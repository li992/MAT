Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Remuneration Committee report 34 Remuneration Committee report continued Overall policy The Remuneration Committees policy during the year was to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in comparison to the Companys Comparator Group: Potential total short-term Potential annual Potential total Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in kind remuneration available share awards compensation value Lower quartile Upper quartile Lower quartile to median Median to Upper quartile Median to to median upper quartile upper quartile This supports the performance-based culture of the Company.
Fixed costs are minimised and The policy in respect of long-term total short-term remuneration will only reach and exceed the median if the performance-based incentives and potential bonus is earned for the relevant financial year.
compensation value is an extension of the policy on total short-term remuneration.
Executives will only receive a market competitive package if the annual bonus and long-term incentives are earned.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP As part of the 2006 remuneration review, the Committee specifically considered how the Companys LTIP would be operated during 2006.
The Committee decided to reduce the maximum permissible grant under the Plan from 400% of salary to 300% of salary and to introduce an effective operational cap at 200% of salary: in addition, after reviewing possible performance criteria for the release of awards and taking into account the views of shareholders during the consultation the Committee determined that a comparative total shareholder return measure would be the most appropriate performance condition.
It is the view of the Committee that this performance condition remains appropriate to the Companys current circumstances and prospects and therefore will apply to any grants made to executives in 2007 see later for further details on the LTIP.
The policy applied during 2006 will continue to apply for 2007.
2006 and 2007 Comparator Group The constituents of the Companys Comparator Group CG for benchmarking remuneration during 2006 and which to the extent not taken over will continue to apply for 2007 are as follows: Name Name Name Acambis Plc Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc Oxford Biomedica Plc Alizyme Plc CAT Group Plc Protherics Plc Allergan Inc Forest Laboratories Inc Shire Pharmaceuticals PLC Alpharma Inc King Pharmaceuticals Inc SkyePharma Plc AstraZeneca PLC Mylan Laboratories Inc Vernalis PLC Axis-Shield Plc Neutec Pharma Plc Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc Factors the Remuneration Committee took into account when selecting the Comparator Group included: the industry within which the Company operates, specifically taking into account both the international nature of the Companys business and its competitors, and the international nature of the Companys current executive team and potential recruits to that team: the market capitalisation, turnover and number of employees of the Company: and the UK listing environment of the Company.
Throughout this report, references to quartiles are to quartiles in the Comparator Group.
Ongoing review The Remuneration Committee will continue to review the remuneration policy on an annual basis to ensure it remains appropriate for the relevant financial year.
Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include: market conditions affecting the Company: the recruitment market in the Companys sector: changing market practice: changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Remuneration Committee report 35 Balance between fixed and variable performance-based compensation The chart below demonstrates the balance between the potential fixed and variable performance-based compensation for each Executive Director for the year ended 31 December 2006.
Fixed compensation Variable performance is calculated as: compensation is calculated as: Maximum bonus available Salary fair market benefits value of maximum Name pension contribution potential LTIP award Samih Darwazah 28% 72% Mazen Darwazah 33% 67% Elements of Executive Directors remuneration Basic salary Policy 2006 and 2007 Lower quartile to median The Companys remuneration policy is to set the levels of base salary for the Executive Directors below the median to support a performance-based culture.
Median rise in Comparator Name 2005 Salary 2006 Salary 2007 Salary Rise Group Samih Darwazah $375,818 $462,208 $462,208 0% 5.4% Median $772,000 Lower quartile $487,000 Mazen Darwazah $280,128 $354,063 $371,766 5% 7.2% Median $417,000 Lower quartile $318,000 The significant rises in the Executive Directors salaries between 2005 and 2006 reflected: the increased responsibility and profile resulting from the Companys listing: and a desire by the Committee to move the salaries towards the lower quartile to median position in order to ensure both that the levels of compensation were competitive but also to ensure that no glass ceiling operated for the next level of management.
It should be noted that the change in the salaries of the Executive Directors between 2005 and 2006 was a one-off adjustment.
The Committees ongoing policy is more accurately demonstrated by their decision that only modest salary rises were required for 2007.
When determining the salary of the executives the Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the lower quartile and median salary levels of those comparable companies within the pharmaceuticals industry and the Comparator Group: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Remuneration Committee report 36 Remuneration Committee report continued Annual performance-related bonus Policy 2006 and 2007 Upper quartile bonus potential Bonus payments are not pensionable.
The following tables summarise the main features of the Companys executive bonus plan.
Bonus Samih Darwazah Mazen Darwazah Company bonus potential 100% 100% Upper quartile 100% 68% Median 68% 60% 2006 bonus paid as percentage of salary 95% 95% Upper quartile bonus payments in the Comparator Group as a percentage of salary 81% 92% The maximum target bonus potential is 100% of salary.
It is possible for exceptional performance to earn up to a total maximum bonus of 200% of salary.
The maximum bonus potentials for 2007 will remain the same as those that applied for 2006.
The bonuses for 2006 have been paid on the basis of the level of the satisfaction of the performance targets.
The table below shows the principal performance targets used for 2006 and their percentage satisfaction.
Percentage of maximum bonus Percentage satisfaction potential subject to target of bonus target Percentage of salary payable Samih Darwazah Profit after tax 50% 90% 45% Operational milestones 30% 100% 30% Personal business targets 20% 100% 20% Total 95% Mazen Darwazah Profit after tax 50% 90% 45% Operational milestones 30% 100% 30% Personal business targets 20% 100% 20% Total 95% The targets for the annual bonus plan are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company in order to ensure that they continue to remain challenging.
It is the opinion of the Committee that the nature of the performance conditions remains appropriate for 2007.
Share incentives Policy 2006 and 2007 Upper quartile The Remuneration Committees policy is to provide annual share grants at the upper quartile level compared to the Comparator Group.
Ongoing share incentives, excluding all employee plans, are provided to the Executive Directors solely through the LTIP.
No further grants will be made to Executive Directors under any other discretionary share plan.
The Remuneration Committee did not grant any awards under the LTIP or any other discretionary share plan to the Executive Directors during 2006.
It is intended to make grants to the Executive Directors under the LTIP in 2007 and on an ongoing basis.
As there was no grant of awards in 2006 under the LTIP or any other discretionary plan operated by the Company, the Remuneration Committee is proposing to increase the level of the 2007 grant to 300% of salary for both Executive Directors which is greater than the normal operating maximum grants Samih Darwazah 200% and Mazen Darwazah 175%.
The following points should be noted: the maximum annual grant limit under the LTIP approved by shareholders is 400% of salary, however, the Remuneration Committee did not feel that an appropriate balance between the interests of the Company, its shareholders and the Executive Directors would be met by doubling the 2007 grant in compensation for the lack of a 2006 grant: and this is a one-off situation and on an ongoing basis the Committee has no current intention to grant awards under the LTIP above 200% of salary with a possible exception on the recruitment of new senior executives.
The Remuneration Committee believes that share awards under the LTIP enable the Company to provide a competitive incentive and retention tool which is also cost effective in respect of both shareholder dilution and income statement expense.
Furthermore, the proposed grant of awards with the attached performance condition ensures that the Companys comparative Total Shareholder Return 1 TSR performance against the Comparator Group is at least at the upper quartile before Executives will receive the full benefit of their share incentives.
This structure demonstrates the Remuneration Committees desire to correlate incentive arrangements with the achievement of substantial performance.
The following table summarises the main features of the LTIP and its proposed operation during 2007.
1 Total Shareholder Return TSR is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the performance period the return is the value of the capital gain and reinvested dividends.
It is normally used comparatively and the company which achieves the best return is ranked number one.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Remuneration Committee report 37 2 Maximum annual grant face value as percentage of salary and performance condition Maximum annual grant 300% current normal operating maximum set by the Remuneration Committee 200% The Awards will be subject to comparative TSR performance against the Comparator Group.
20% of Awards will be released for median performance with full release occurring for upper quartile comparative performance.
The Remuneration Committee will also ensure that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with its TSR performance.
When considering this underlying financial performance the factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee will include profit after tax, revenue growth and the achievement of operational milestones.
Samih Darwazah Mazen Darwazah Proposed grants for 2007 Face Value as a percentage of salary 300% 300% It should be noted that the real value received by the Executive Directors under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the degree to which the performance conditions are satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share price of the Company at this time.
Basis of performance condition selection and measurement Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for the proposed awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that the Executives have outperformed their peers over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions.
The Remuneration Committee will provide a full explanation and justification at the time of the release of the award and why it believes that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with this TSR performance.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards are satisfied, and where appropriate will consult with independent external advisors to calculate the TSR in accordance with the rules of the LTIP and sign-off these figures prior to the release of any award.
Dilution In accordance with the guidelines set out by the Association of British Insurers ABI the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all its share plans.
Under the LTIP rules, grants of no more than 3% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be awarded in the first three years following the Companys IPO.
The Company has not made any grants of shares since the IPO.
Post-employment benefits Policy 2006 and 2007 Lower quartile to median The Executive Directors participate in the Hikma Pharmaceuticals Defined Contribution Retirement Benefit Plan the Benefit Plan in accordance with the Rules of the Benefit Plan relevant to employees of the Group based in Jordan.
Under the Benefit Plan the Group matches employee contributions made to the Benefit Plan.
These are fixed at 5% of applicable salary.
Participants are entitled to 30% of the Groups contributions to the Benefit Plan after three years of employment with the Group, and an additional 10% in each subsequent year.
The participants interest in the Groups contribution fully vests after ten years of employment.
It should be noted that the change in UK pension legislation on 6 April 2006 has had no effect on the Companys executive pension provision due to the location of the Companys executives.
The following table sets out the percentage post employment contributions compared to the Comparator Group.
Samih Darwazah Mazen Darwazah Company 1.3% 2.1% Upper quartile 17% 9% Median 9% 2% Lower quartile 0% 0% In addition, pursuant to applicable law, each of the Executive Directors receives contributions as a percentage of salary which are paid by the Group into government social security systems.
2 Face value for awards under the LTIP face value is the aggregate market value of the shares subject to the award at the date of grant.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Remuneration Committee report 38 Remuneration Committee report continued Benefits in Kind Policy 2006 and 2007 Market practice The Company provides the normal benefits in kind for executives of this level in a company of this size, such as company cars, healthcare and life insurance.
Total compensation Policy 2006 and 2007 Median to upper quartile depending on performance The following table shows the value of each of the main elements of the remuneration package provided to the Executive Directors during the year ended 31 December 2006.
Total in Total 2005 CG Salary Bonus paid Benefits Total payments FMV LTIP Actual and FMV at median Name $000s $000s $000s $000s $000s $000s $000s Samih Darwazah $462 $440 $52 $954 $0 $954 $2,056 Mazen Darwazah $354 $336 $98 $788 $0 $788 $1,062 Other remuneration matters Directors Shareholding Policy The Remuneration Committee does not currently have a formal shareholding requirement due to the substantial shareholdings of the Executive Directors.
The Committee, however, wholeheartedly supports the alignment of interests created by a minimum level of executive shareholding and should the make-up of the Board change would consider the introduction of a formal shareholding requirement.
All-employee share arrangements Historically the Company has used options to provide share incentives to employees of the Company.
While options may continue to be a part of the compensation package for those employees who do not participate in the LTIP, the Company is in the process of deciding whether to operate a Company-wide all-employee share purchase and matching plan.
The preliminary view of the Board is that this type of arrangement has the same cost vs. benefit advantages behind the change from options to LTIP awards and is important in supporting the engagement of employees with the business as a whole.
The main features of the Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 2006 Share Incentive Plan SIP are set out below.
Shares required to satisfy awards under the SIP will be purchased in the market.

salary and providing additional matching shares on a 1:1 ratio.
These matching shares will be normally released three years after they have been awarded provided that the associated shares purchased by the employee have been retained and provided the employee is still employed by a Group Company at this time.
Executive Directors contracts Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors of the Company are as follows: Name Company notice period Contract date Unexpired term of contract Potential termination payment Samih Darwazah 12 months 25 May 2006 Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits Mazen Darwazah 12 months 25 May 2006 Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits The Executive Directors contracts are on a rolling basis, unless terminated by at least 12 months written notice.
This arrangement is in line with best corporate practice for listed companies.
In the event of the termination of an Executives contract, salary and benefits will be payable during the notice period there will, however, be no automatic entitlement to bonus payments or share incentive grants during the period of notice other than in accordance with the rules of the relevant incentive plan.
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that there have been no unjustified payments for failure on an Executive Directors termination of employment.
There are no special provisions in the contracts of employment extending notice periods on a change of control, liquidation of the Company or cessation of employment.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Remuneration Committee report 39 External Appointments The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public sector appointments, and that these can broaden the experience and knowledge of the director, from which the Company can benefit.
Executive Directors may therefore accept non-executive appointments as long as they do not lead to a conflict of interest, and are allowed to retain any fees paid under such appointments.
During the year under review, Mazen Darwazah received fees of USD$36,150 in respect of such appointments.
Non-Executive Directors fees Policy 2006 and 2007 Upper quartile The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the Chairman Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Chairman and is within the limits set by the Articles of Association.
In light of the review of Executive Director remuneration in 2006, it was considered appropriate to appoint Halliwell Consulting to undertake a review of the levels of Non-Executive Directors fees paid.
The nature of the Companys business is international, requiring the Non-Executive Directors to travel to the USA, Middle East and Europe, and the Nomination Committee has therefore looked for Non-Executive Directors with a wide range of experience both in the UK and internationally.
The use of options for Non-Executive Directors is very prevalent in the US and also to some extent internationally.
However, as a UK listed company complying with UK best practice the Board do not feel it is appropriate to grant options to the Companys Non-Executive Directors.
To ensure that the Company is able to attract the appropriate calibre of candidate and to take account of its inability to grant options, the Board has set its fee policy at the upper quartile.
The individual basic and committee fees, which are paid in Pound Sterling, are as follows: 2006 2007 Upper quartile Total fee Basic fee Committee fee Total fee fees in CG Name 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Michael Ashton 46 57 7 64 59 Ali Al-Husry 41 57 57 53 Breffni Byrne 53 57 14 71 70 Ronald Goode 41 57 57 53 Sir David Rowe-Ham 46 57 7 64 59 The fees of Ronald Goode, who has only served part of the year, have been annualised on the same basis as the remuneration of his fellow Non-Executive Directors to allow the levels to be compared to other Non-Executive Directors of the Company and his peers within the Comparator Group.
In calculating the fees in the Comparator Group, the fees of the US companies were converted to Sterling at a rate of USD$1.75, being the rate at the date of review in 2006.
It should be noted that the Board determined to increase the fees of the Non-Executive Directors because of the following factors: in order to recruit an additional Non-Executive Director of the appropriate calibre the Board was required to increase the level of fees offered.
This necessitated a change in the fees for all the Companys Non-Executive Directors: the Board was able to measure the actual time commitment required from Non-Executive Directors which was not reflected in the historic level of fees: and to take account of the inability to grant options.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any bonus plan or share incentive programme operated by the Company and are not entitled to pension contributions or other benefits provided by the Company.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, but have letters of appointment with the Company.
Each appointment is terminable on one months notice from either the Company or the Director, but is envisaged to be for an initial period of up to 36 months, subject to the terms of the Companys Articles of Association, the Companies Act and shareholder approval.

Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Remuneration Committee report 42 Remuneration Committee report continued Directors share options The aggregate emoluments disclosed above do not include any amounts or the value of options to acquire ordinary shares in the capital of the Company granted or held by the Executive Directors.
Options granted under the 2004 Plan are not subject to performance criteria, though vesting of options under the 2004 Plan was conditional on the successful listing of the Companys share on the London Stock Exchange.
During the year under review, the CEO exercised options over 320,000 Ordinary Shares of the Company.
No other options were exercised by Directors during the year and no options expired unexercised.
Furthermore, there were no variations to the terms and conditions of share options during the year.

Options were awarded on 12 October 2004 with an exercise price of US$3.63.
Share options became exercisable following the successful listing of the Companys shares on the London Stock Exchange.
Options under the 2004 Plan have phased vesting over five years, with 20% vesting each year on the anniversary of award, being 12 October in each subsequent year.
The closing market price for an Ordinary Share on the date of exercise, being 3 October 2006, was 403.5 pence.
Based on the US Dollar Sterling exchange rate on that date of 1:US$1.8762, this gave a notional gain on exercise of US$2,132,149.
All of the shares being the subject of the options exercise were retained by the option holder.
The closing market price for the Ordinary Shares on 29 December 2006 was 365.25 pence.
During the period from 1 January 2006 to the year-end the shares closing price ranged from a low of 329.5 pence to a high of 458 pence.
Long-term incentive schemes No awards were made to Executive Directors under the Hikma Pharmaceuticals 2006 Long-Term Incentive Scheme during the period under review.
Audit The emoluments and Directors interests information disclosed in the Directors report on remuneration, which is required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 as amended, has been audited.
