MAC RF62790 E 13 4 07 15:25 Page 70 Report on Remuneration and Related Matters This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 the 1985 Act.
It also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice the Combined Code relating to directors remuneration.
During the year under review, the Company complied with the detailed code provisions set out in Section B of the Combined Code except as follows: as explained on page 69, performance related pay measures did not apply to the Chairman, who was the only Executive Director provision B.
The 1985 Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of this report and to state whether in their opinion those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee Membership The membership of the Remuneration Committee during the year was as follows: Mr. G S Menendez Chairman : Mr. C H Bailey: and Mr. D E Yarur.
Mr. Menendez, Mr. Bailey and Mr. Yarur were considered by the Board to be independent Non-Executive Directors throughout 2006.
Responsibilities The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are fully set out in its Terms of Reference which are available on the Companys website.
The Committee is responsible for setting remuneration policy and for reviewing the remuneration of any Executive Directors and, where appropriate, it consults the Chairman, Mr. J-P Luksic.
The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for monitoring the level and structure of remuneration of Group senior management and evaluating management performance.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole.
No Director participates in the determination of his own remuneration.
Company policy on Directors pay and bonuses The Companys policy is to ensure that Directors are fairly rewarded with regard to responsibilities undertaken, and considers comparable pay levels in the United Kingdom and in Chile.
Corporate and individual performance is taken into account in setting the pay level for the Chairman as an Executive Director, and this is reviewed on an annual basis.
Remuneration levels for Non-Executive Directors are based on comparable levels for companies of a similar size and complexity, and also take into account specific responsibilities undertaken.
Remuneration includes fees paid for non-executive directorships of subsidiary companies within the Group.
The Board does not consider it appropriate to make regular performance-related pay awards such as bonuses to the only Executive Director, Mr. J-P Luksic, given his role as Chairman of the Board and his interest in the Companys shares both directly and as a member of the Luksic family.
The Group has paid Mr. R F Jara for advisory services to the Group.
The Board has taken these payments into account in determining his fees as a Non-Executive Director.
No Directors currently receive pension contributions.

The FTSE All Share Index has been selected as an appropriate benchmark as it is the most broadly based index to which the Company belongs and which relates to the London Stock Exchange, the market where the Companys ordinary shares are traded.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show a theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding over a specified period, assuming that dividends are reinvested to purchase additional shares at the closing price applicable on the ex-dividend date.
Total shareholder return for the FTSE All Share Index is calculated by aggregating the returns of all individual constituents of the FTSE at the end of the five-year period.
