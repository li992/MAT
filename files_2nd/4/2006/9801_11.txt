TSR is defined as share price growth plus reinvested dividends.
This provides a basis for comparison as a relevant equity index in which Marshalls plc is a constituent member.
Marshalls has a TSR for the five year period of 80.3 per cent compared to a TSR provided by the FTSE 250 Index of 91.9 per cent.
In the opinion of the Directors the FTSE 250 Index is considered the most appropriate index against which the TSR of the Group should be measured because it represents a wider index of alternative investments for shareholders.
However, the Committee does not consider TSR an appropriate measure comparator for incentive purposes as sector factors can significantly affect relative performance.

c Benefits are the provision of a fully expensed company car and medical insurance.
d In September 2006, following a change of responsibility, David Sartis basic salary was increased from 170,000 to 186,000. e The fees for the Non-Executive Directors were reviewed in July 2006.
The basic fixed annual fee was increased from 30,000 to 33,000 with an additional fee of 10,000 for the Chairmanship of a Board Committee.
During the year the Chairman received a fixed fee of 125,000 and this was increased to 145,000 with effect from 1 January 2007. f With effect from 1 January 2007 the salaries of the Executive Directors are as follows: Graham Holden 380,000, Ian Burrell 210,000 and David Sarti 210,000. g The total amount paid to Directors during the year was 1,545,000 2005: 1,322,000.
Service Contracts Each of the Executive Directors has a service contract with the Company which is terminable by the Company on not more than twelve months notice and by the Director on six months notice.
If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each circumstance and the compensation that may be paid.
It will take into account the best practice provisions of the Code and it will take legal advice on the Companys liability to pay compensation and the appropriate amount.
The Committee does, periodically, consider what compensation commitments the Executive Directors contracts would entail in the event of early termination.
There are no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement.
The Companys practice is to appoint the Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, under letters of appointment.
Their appointment is usually for a term of three years.
Andrew Allner and Richard Scholes completed their first three year term during 2006 and, following a review, they have both been reappointed for a second three year term.
46 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2006 Marshalls text 2006:Marshalls Text 3 4 07 14:47 Page 47 During the year, as part of the Non-Executive Directors performance appraisal of the Chairman, it was recognised that his term of office would expire in October 2007.
Following the appraisal a recommendation was made to the Board by the Nomination Committee that he be appointed for a second three year term.
This offer has been made to and accepted by the Chairman.
Details of the appointment dates, notice periods and terms of appointment are set out below: Appointment date Notice period Ian Burrell June 2001 1 year Graham Holden August 1992 1 year David Sarti November 2004 1 year Appointment date Term of appointment Mike Davies October 2004 3 years Andrew Allner July 2003 renewed July 2006 3 years Bill Husselby March 2005 3 years Richard Scholes July 2003 renewed July 2006 3 years Pension Benefits The Marshalls plc Pension Scheme the Scheme has two sections: the Defined Benefit section which was closed to new members in 2000 and closed to future service accrual in 2006 and a Defined Contribution section.
On 6 April 2006 the Government introduced some significant changes to the legislation affecting pension schemes.
The Company, and the Trustees, considered the impact of these changes for all of the members.
A number of changes have been made to the Trust Deed to allow members to take advantage of the additional flexibility afforded by these changes at no additional cost to the Company.
The Committee considered the impact of these changes on the Companys pension arrangements for the Executive Directors.
Following advice from Mercers it introduced the option for Executive Directors to take a salary supplement in place of the Companys contribution to the Scheme.
The salary supplement would be set at a level which incurs no additional cost for the Company.
Other Scheme benefits, such as life assurance, would remain unchanged.
On 1 July 2006 the Group replaced its Defined Benefit section of the Scheme with a Defined Contribution section of the Scheme for all active members, including Graham Holden.
From this date Graham Holden, in common with all other former Defined Benefit section members, contributes 6 per cent of his salary to the Defined Contribution section.
In line with the other Executive Directors the Company makes a contribution of 30 per cent of his salary on his behalf.
Ian Burrell and David Sarti are members of the Defined Contribution section of the Scheme.
The Company makes a contribution of 30 per cent of their basic salary and they are required to make a minimum contribution of 4 and 3 per cent respectively of their basic salary.
They are eligible for a lump sum payment and dependants pension benefits on death in service.
The Company made pension contributions of 54,000 in respect of Graham Holden for the 6 months from 1 July 2006.
Company contributions of 55,800, 2005: 54,232 were paid for the full year in respect of Ian Burrell and 52,600, 2005: 46,485 in respect of David Sarti.
As a former member of the Defined Benefit section of the Scheme, Graham Holden is entitled to a deferred pension.
In addition the Scheme provides for a pension for dependents and, in the event of death within the first five years following the date of retirement, a lump sum payment equal to the balance of the pension entitlement for that five year period.
