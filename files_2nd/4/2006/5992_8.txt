Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors The remuneration policy for executive directors is to offer a remuneration package which will attract and retain the highest calibre of executive and to ensure that individual rewards and incentives are properly aligned with personal performance, the performance of the group, and the interests of shareholders.
A significant proportion of total remuneration is expected each year to be performance related.
This policy is expected to continue in future years.
The remuneration arrangements include basic salary and benets, performance related bonus, long term incentives and pension rights.
The main elements are: i Basic salary and benets The level of basic salary and benets is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the performance of the individual and advice and information from independent sources on the rates of salary for similar positions.
Individual salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually by the committee to maintain appropriate relativities within the executive director population and within a general policy that base salary levels are set at no higher than market median level in relation to similar sized UK listed businesses and considering other elements of the package.
Benets normally include the provision of a car, fuel, private medical insurance, permanent health insurance and home telephone costs.
ii Performance related bonus Executive directors each receive an annual performance related bonus of up to 60% of basic salary and these payments are largely dependent on achievement of profit targets.
The targets are set at levels which are challenging in relation to budgets which would produce significant growth.
iii Share options Executive directors have a continuing interest in share options previously granted as detailed below, however no options have been granted during the year and no further options will be granted under the current scheme.
A separate one-off grant of share options has been made to Mr P E Jolly, as an essential part of his recruitment package, following his appointment as an executive director.
In order to secure Mr Jollys appointment, the committee considered it necessary to make a one-off grant of an option over 225,688 shares at the then current market price of 545.0p.
This grant was made under the provisions set out in the UK Listing Rules 9.4.
2 2 relating to the appointment of a director in unusual circumstances, the purpose of which was to secure his recruitment and took into account other opportunities open to Mr Jolly at the time of his appointment.
In addition to considering the value of the incentive, the structure of the arrangement was considered carefully.
It was felt that a market value share option would be the most appropriate incentive vehicle as a one-off arrangement, as this would only provide value to the executive if, and to the extent that, the share price increases above the exercise price which was set by reference to the companys share price on the date of his appointment.
It was recognised that the share price at the time of the grant was trading around an all-time high level.
The committee is comfortable that this one-off arrangement will ensure that this provides a good link between reward and shareholder value creation from the time of Mr Jollys appointment.
The award was granted by way of a separate contractual agreement, the key features of which are as follows: Key Terms The option was granted on 11 May 2006 over 225,688 shares in the company at an exercise price of 545.0p per share being the closing middle-market quotation of a share on 11 May 2006, the date upon which Mr Jolly was appointed as chief executive.
While the requirement to grow the share price above the exercise price is, of itself, a performance condition, exercise of the option is not dependent upon the satisfaction of any formal performance targets.
The option will normally become capable of exercise on the third anniversary of grant and will lapse on the seventh anniversary of grant.
Exercise of the option will be satisfied using market purchase shares.
co. uk 19 Leaving Employment The option will normally lapse if Mr Jollys employment ceases before the third anniversary of grant for whatever reason.
In certain compassionate circumstances, the committee may determine that the option should remain capable of exercise, in which case the number of shares under option would be scaled back on a pro rata basis by reference to the complete number of months that has elapsed between the date of grant and the date of cessation of employment, in relation to 36 months.
The committee may impose additional conditions in relation to the exercise of the option and the maximum period that the committee may enable the option to remain capable of exercise is 12 months following the date of cessation of employment.
Corporate Event In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement, demerger of part of the company or winding up of the company not being an internal corporate reorganisation prior to the third anniversary of grant, the option will become capable of exercise.
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, the option would normally be rolled over into an option over shares in the new company.
Variation of Capital If there is a variation to the share capital of the company or if there is a demerger then the company may make such adjustments to the number or class of shares under option or the exercise price of the option as it sees t subject to obtaining the approval to that adjustment of the professional advisers to the company.
Alterations to the option The company may alter or add to the terms of the option but the prior approval of shareholders will be required in order to amend the terms of the option to the benefit of Mr Jolly other than minor amendments to benefit the administration of the option, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax or regulatory treatment.
Rights of Mr Jolly in relation to the Option The option does not affect Mr Jollys rights and obligations under his service contract and he will not be entitled to claim any compensation for and loss of rights pursuant to the option.
The company is required to ensure that arrangements are in place for the transfer of a sufficient number of shares to satisfy exercise of the option.
The option is not pensionable or transferable.
iv New long-term incentive plan The committee has reviewed the incentive arrangements offered to directors and other senior executives to ensure they remain in line with best practice guidelines at the same time as meeting the requirements of the business.
As a result of the review the committee has recommended the implementation of a new Performance Share Plan PSP to replace the existing share option scheme as the sole form of share based incentive for future years.
The committee considered that the annual award of share options under the current arrangements were no longer in line with best practice investor guidelines and, most importantly, not in alignment with the companys primary long-term objective of generating long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders.
As a result, the committee is seeking shareholder approval for a new PSP at the 2006 annual general meeting on 3 July.
A full summary of the new PSP is contained in the notice of annual general meeting.
The plan will provide the following: Maximum Award Limit Executive directors and senior managers will be eligible to receive conditional awards of Performance Shares with a value of up to 150% of salary each year.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, awards may be made up to 200% of salary in any year.
In the first year of operation of the PSP, awards will be limited to 125% of salary.
Performance Conditions Half of any award will be subject to the growth in the companys normalised earnings per share EPS i. e. before exceptional items and amortisation.
The amount by which EPS exceeds RPI will determine the proportion of the awards that will vest.
The remaining half of the award will be subject to the relative total shareholder return TSR of the company compared against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts.
20 Awards to be made in 2006 will vest on the third anniversary of grant, dependent upon the achievement of the following performance criteria: EPS growth of the company over Vesting percentage of 50% of the shares the performance period subject to an award 11111111 Less than RPI 12% 0% RPI 12% 30% RPI 27% 100% Between RPI 12% and RPI 27% Between 30% and 100% pro-rata on a straight-line basis TSR ranking of the company compared to the Vesting percentage of 50% of the shares comparator group over the performance period subject to an award 11111111 Below median ranking 0% Median ranking 30% Upper quartile ranking 100% Between median and upper quartile ranking Between 30% and 100% pro-rata on a straight-line basis Both elements of the performance condition will be tested over a three year performance period with no provision to re-test the performance condition.
EPS and TSR were chosen for the PSP as they represent the most appropriate measures of the companys long-term performance.
EPS represents the key internal metric through which financial performance is measured and TSR is aligned with shareholders and our objective of generating long-term sustainable returns to shareholders.
With regard to the choice of comparator group for the TSR element of the performance condition, the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts was chosen ahead of a bespoke group of comparator companies due to the limited number of directly comparable companies available from which to create a bespoke group.
Further details may be found in the notes to the Notice of the annual general meeting.
EPS targets will be calculated by the company and veried by the Remuneration Committee.
TSR calculations will be performed by the committees advisors and veried by the committee.
v Shareholding Guidelines If the PSP is approved, executive directors will be expected to retain no fewer than 50% of any shares delivered under the PSP net of taxes until such time as a shareholding equivalent to 100% of their base salary has been achieved.
vi Pension rights Generally, the policy for executive directors pension arrangements is to offer a contribution towards the executives pension arrangement.
From the date of his appointment as an executive director the company contributes 15% of Mr Jollys basic salary into his SIPP.
The other executive directors have long standing pension arrangements.
The committee has considered these arrangements and feels that it would not be appropriate to instigate any changes.
Dr I J Bolton and Mr P B Maudsley participate on a non-contributory basis, and Mr D B Dutton participates on a contributory basis, in the Findel Group plc Pension Fund the Scheme which provides them at their normal retirement age of 65 with a pension of up to two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings at retirement.
In the event of retirement before the normal retirement age, their pension would normally be reduced.
Life assurance cover is four times salary for Dr Bolton and Mr Dutton, and three times salary for Mr Maudsley.
Pensions are payable in certain circumstances in the event of ill health and a spouses pension is payable on death.
Pensionable earnings for Dr Boltons service after 1 April 2003 are dened as one third of the aggregate of his basic salary paid in the three years prior to retirement plus one ninth of the aggregate of performance related bonuses paid in the same three year period.
Previously, Dr Boltons terms of service provided that elements of his emoluments as well as basic salary were taken into account in calculating his pension entitlement.
Pensionable earning for Mr Dutton and Mr Maudsley are dened as one third of the aggregate of the members basic salary paid in the three years prior to retirement.
For Mr K Chapman and for Mr D A Johnson until his resignation as an executive director, in order to ensure that the value of their total remuneration is not reduced by the fact that on reaching normal retirement age they took www.
co. uk 21 a transfer from the Scheme and are no longer members of the Scheme, the company contributes an amount equal to not more than the percentage of pensionable salary the company would have contributed to the Scheme if they were members of the Scheme into their own personal pension arrangements, which amounts were 42,240 in each case in the year ended 31 March 2006.
The Remuneration Committee considers that inclusion of a small proportion of annual bonus paid in the denition of pensionable pay is justied after considering overall levels of base salary and bonus potential, and considering the smoothing effect of averaging the bonuses paid over three years.
Performance Graph The following graph contrasts the total shareholder return of the company calculated in accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 with the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index.
This index was selected as being, in the opinion of the committee, the most appropriate for comparison.
Findel plc 5-year total return v total return of FTSE 350 General Retailers Index 3 month rolling average 350 Findel - cumulative FTSE 350 General Retailers - cumulative 300 250 200 150 100 50 y e March 2002 y e March 2003 y e March 2004 y e March 2005 y e March 2006 Source: Datastream Service Agreements It continues to be the Remuneration Committees policy that service agreements for executive directors should be terminable on not more than 12 months notice, in line with current market practice.

The company, in line with the rules of the long term incentive plan, chose to settle the gain on exercise to Mr Johnson in cash.
There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for share options or awards under the long term incentive plan during the year ended 31 March 2006.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2006 was 557.5p and the range during the year was 401.0p up to 559.0p.
