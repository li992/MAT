Remuneration report The Board presents the Remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2006.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The aim of the remuneration policy is to provide a competitive remuneration package, having regard to comparable companies in the financial sector, which is sufficient to attract and retain the quality of director needed to manage and develop the Company successfully.
The stated policy shall apply in 2007 and, subject to review, in subsequent financial years.
Remuneration packages Remuneration packages are designed to include xed and variable elements, and to provide rewards for both the long and short-term as follows: Short term Long term Fixed Basic salary and benets Pension Variable profit share Long Term Incentive Plan The Remuneration Committee the Committee considers that the key objectives of a remuneration package are to motivate directors to generate long-term shareholder value and to increase short-term profitability.
The first objective is met by long-term incentive plan LTIP awards providing directors with the opportunity to build a meaningful shareholding in the Company, performance permitting.
Executive directors are actively encouraged to build up and maintain a shareholding to the equivalent value of at least one years salary within five years of their appointment to the Board.
The second objective is met by profit share payments.
The link between corporate and individual performance is reinforced through the very substantial shareholdings of the executive directors set out on page 31.
Current and former directors, staff and their families own over 20% of the Company.
Basic salary and benets An executive directors basic salary is determined by the Committee and any change implemented on 1 January of each year or when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers salaries throughout the Group as a whole and the information obtained on comparable companies in the financial sector.
Board salary costs for the year increased to 2.1m compared to 1.9m in 2005 adjusted to reect the retirement in that year of M P Egerton-Vernon, an increase of 10.5%.
This was, in part, due to the appointment of the two new non-executive directors during the year.
When setting salary levels, use is made of survey data and information provided by the advisers to the Committee.
The views of the chairman and chief executive are also taken into consideration.
All directors are entitled to take part in the Share Incentive Plan SIP on the same terms as all other employees.
This allows all employees to purchase shares in the Company and currently these are matched on a one-for-one basis by the Company.
Performance shares are also offered to employees based on earnings per share growth.
In addition Rathbones provides a range of benets, the most significant of which is a company car or cash alternative.
profit share Certain executive directors on the Executive Committee are eligible for a discretionary profit share payment from a pool based on approximately 1% of Group pre-tax profits.
Directors with direct responsibility for investment management, unit trust or trust departments receive a profit share payment based on the profits of the department concerned.
This may be supplemented by a payment from the pool.
profit share payments are not capped and are not pensionable.
Details of payments for 2006 are shown in Table 7 on page 43.
37 37 Rathbone Brothers Plc Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 200 Report and accounts 2006 6 5 KE 5 $ GI Remuneration report continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP At an Extraordinary General Meeting in November 2000, a long-term incentive plan LTIP was approved by shareholders to start in 2001.
No awards from the current plan will be made after November 2010.
Executive directors are provisionally awarded rights to acquire ordinary shares at the start of a three year plan cycle the provisional award.
The maximum value of a provisional award is 75% of a participants basic salary.
At the end of each plan cycle, the Companys performance is assessed against the performance targets for that cycle.
The extent to which the targets have been achieved determines the actual number of shares if any attributable to each participant the actual award.
The performance targets used to date have been a mixture of growth in earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR.
TSR is a measure of the overall return to shareholders.
It reects both the change in the share price and dividends, and any other cash payments made, assuming that they are reinvested.
If a participant ceases to be employed as an executive director by reason of retirement at normal retirement age or earlier with the Companys consent, ill-health, redundancy or death, or any other circumstances which the Committee deems to be appropriate, the Committee may, at its discretion, recommend to the trustee that any distribution be based on the performance during the plan cycle as a whole but that the actual award be reduced pro rata to reect the fact that the participant was not an executive director for the whole plan cycle.
2001 03 and 2002 04 plan cycles The performance target for the 2001 03 and 2002 04 plan cycles was average annual compound EPS growth over the plan cycle.
No actual awards were made from these plans.
2003 05 plan cycle The performance targets for the 2003 05 plan cycle are set out in Table 3.
Actual awards of 100% of the provisional award before any pro rata service related adjustment totalling 136,991 ordinary shares were made in March 2006 as both EPS and TSR performance conditions were fully satisfied.
Awards were made in the form of 65,312 ordinary shares and the cash equivalent value of 71,679 shares at 11.45 the market value on 8 March 2006.
2004 06 plan cycle The performance targets for the 2004 06 plan cycle were unchanged and are set out in Table 3.
Actual awards of 100% of the provisional award before any pro rata service related adjustment totalling 150,752 ordinary shares will be made March 2007 as both EPS and TSR performance conditions were fully satisfied.
Details are set out in Table 5.
EPS increased from 38.11p in 2003 to 76.62p in 2006, an increase of 101% whilst the TSR for the three year period was 79%.
A 100% award is made for each element of the Plan if the relevant percentage exceeds 37.5%.
2005 07, 2006 08 and 2007 09 plan cycles The performance targets for 2005 07 onwards were changed taking into consideration feedback from shareholders and changes to expectations of best market practice.
The Committee particularly took note of the preference for the use of a relative rather than an absolute TSR measure.
With effect from 2005 07, TSR performance relative to the FTSE All Share Index rather than absolute TSR has been used as set out in Table 4.
The use of a peer group rather than a broad index was ruled out due to the small number of similar businesses in the speciality and other finance sector, and the risk that numbers would fall still further due to consolidation.
The Committee considers that the revised targets are as demanding, in the current climate, as those put in place for earlier cycles were considered to be at the time.
Details of the provisional awards for the 2005 07, 2006 08 and 2007 09 plan cycles are set out in Table 5.
On 31 December 2005, the trustee held 55,000 Rathbone Brothers Plc ordinary shares.
On 8 March 2006, the trustee acquired a further 10,312 Rathbone Brothers Plc ordinary shares at 11.55 to meet the 2003 05 award.
On 28 September 2006, 100,000 shares were acquired at 11.10 to be held for future actual awards, and were held at 31 December 2006. Dividend entitlements in respect of this holding have been waived and voting rights will not be exercised.
Were the maximum possible provisional awards to be made to current and former directors, 400,727 ordinary shares 2005: 472,506 would be awarded, representing 0.9% 2005: 1.1% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2006.

Long term incentive arrangements for Peter Pearson Lund Following his appointment to the Board, Peter Pearson Lund continues to participate in the Rathbone Unit Trust Management Limited RUTM deferred profit sharing plan rather than the LTIP.
A deferred profit sharing pool, which in a normal year equates to 20% of RUTMs pre-tax profits, is allocated to participants on the recommendation of a RUTM Plan Committee.
Allocations are held in trust and invested on behalf of participants.
The release of an award is conditional on continued employment unless the participant is a good leaver.
Funds are released in two equal tranches two and three years after the period end.

The market value of shares at the date of provisional award is the average mid-market price over the 20 dealing days prior to the start of the plan.
Share options Historically, share options were granted to senior employees who it was considered would have a significant impact on the earnings and profitability of the Group during the following five years.
The Board is of the view that, following the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards, share options are increasingly expensive to administer and that there is a mis-match between their cost to the business and their perceived value to employees.
In future, option grants will only be made in exceptional circumstances.
Options are no longer granted to directors after their appointment to the Board.
Options granted prior to 21 June 2004 can be exercised if the earnings per share of the Group during the period from grant to the date of notication of exercise has increased in percentage terms by more than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 2% per annum or pro rata for any part thereof.
Options granted after 21 June 2004 can be exercised if the earnings per share of the Group between the accounting period immediately prior to the option grant and the accounting period immediately prior to the third anniversary of grant has increased in percentage terms by more than the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum or pro rata for any part thereof.
Option grants to a participant in a ten year rolling period are capped at four times remuneration.
There is no automatic waiving of performance conditions in the event of a change of control or the early termination of a participants employment.
Options may not normally be exercised before the third anniversary of the date of grant and expire on the tenth anniversary of grant.
Details of outstanding options at the start and end of the year together with details of options exercised during the year are set out in Table 6.
The terms and conditions of all options have remained unchanged during the year.
41 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2006 5 KE 5 $ GI Remuneration report continued Table 6.
Dilution Not more than 15% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company adjusted for bonus and rights issues should be issued for all share incentive schemes operated by the Company in any ten year period.
Of that 15%, not more than 10% applies to shares allotted under share option schemes and not more than 5% to shares allotted under both the LTIP and SIP.
In the ten years to 31 December 2006, options over 3,126,037 ordinary shares 2005: 3,362,928 have been granted which represents 7.4% of the issued share capital at that date 2005: 8.1%.
849,674 ordinary shares 2005: 744,893 have been allotted in respect of the SIP, representing 2.0% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2006 2005: 1.8%.
No shares have been allotted for the LTIP to date.
Pension arrangements UK staff who joined Rathbones prior to April 2002 were offered membership of the Rathbone 1987 Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme provides for members to retire at the age of 60 with a pension based on final pensionable salary.
Prior to 1 April 2006, the accrual rate was 1 60th for each year of membership.
With effect from 1 April 2006, employees were given the choice of either remaining on a 1 60th accrual rate but increasing their contribution rate from 5% to 6.5% at 1 April 2006 and to 8% from 1 January 2008 or switching to a 1 70th accrual rate for future pensionable service but continuing to contribute at 5%.
Details of the Companys contributions are set out in note 27 to the accounts.
Since April 2002, new employees have been offered membership of a group dened contribution plan, established with Scottish Widows.
In the case of certain directors and senior staff, the Group contributes to their personal pension arrangements.
42 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2006 5 KE 5 $ GI Paul Chavasse, Sue Desborough, Richard Lanyon, Andrew Morris, Peter Pearson Lund and Richard Smeeton are members of the Scheme.
Ian Buckley, James Lifford and Andy Pomfret participate in the Scheme for death in service benets only.
Ian Buckley, James Lifford and Andy Pomfret have arrangements under self-invested personal pension schemes and Mark Powell has a personal pension scheme.
Rathbones pays annual contributions of 11.5% of salary to those schemes, subject to HM Revenue & Customs maximum limits, where applicable.
In the case of Mark Powell, employer pension contributions and death in service benets ceased on 31 March 2006, and his salary was adjusted with no overall increase in cost to the company.
The changes in pension entitlements arising in the financial year, required to be disclosed by the UK Listing Authority, are shown in Table 8.
There have been no changes in the terms of directors pension entitlements during the year.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for directors.
