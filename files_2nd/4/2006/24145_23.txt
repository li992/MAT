The Remuneration Committee recognises that in setting this base salary, it is materially below the benchmark for Mr Moore but considers that the new package should not be greater than that payable to Keith Satchell, the outgoing Group Chief Executive.
The Committee will seek to move base salary over time such that total compensation more accurately reflects the target benchmark positioning.

The accrued benefits for Keith Satchell include the appropriate proportion of additional service of 4 years 9 months that has been accruing uniformly from 1 July 1991 to his normal retirement date.
As previously reported, in the event of Keith Satchell retiring between ages 55 and 60, he would be entitled to receive a pension based on actual accrued service without actuarial reduction.
Keith Satchell retired on 31 January 2007 and, based on these enhanced terms, the 31 December 2006 transfer value would increase to 6.7 million.
The benefits for Ben Gunn include additional service of 10 years 6 months granted to him on joining London and Manchester Group plc in 1996 and also include additional service of 8 years 9 months that were purchased with a transfer value he brought from a previous employers scheme.
The 31 December 2006 transfer value shown above is based on his selected normal retirement year at age 60.
Philip Moore transferred 21,000 during 2006 from previous pension arrangements to purchase an additional 8 months of service in the Pension Scheme, this is reflected in the end of year position.
In addition, the end of year figure includes a fixed pension of 10,259 relating to a transfer received during 2005, which was not included in the beginning of the year transfer value.
The Pension Scheme Cap affects Ben Gunn, Philip Moore and Jim Smart as described below: a Ben Gunn has an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement under which, on his retirement from the service of the Company at age 60, he will receive pension benefits that, when added to any pension benefits he receives from the Pension Scheme on that date, equate to the pension benefits he would have received if he were a member of the Pension Scheme and not subject to the Pension Scheme Cap.
The figures in the table above include the value of the arrangement.
It has been agreed that if he retires on or after 30 June 2007, he will receive his scheme and unfunded benefits based on service to his date of early retirement and with no actuarial reduction save for the element of his pension purchased by funds from former employment which would be reduced for early payment.
b Philip Moore receives a monthly amount in addition to his basic salary of the difference between a variable percentage of his monthly basic salary and one twelfth of the Pension Scheme Cap to give him the opportunity to make further pension provision.
Since his appointment on 1 July 2003, this amount has been equal to 20% and is reviewed in each calendar year.
During 2006, Philip Moore received 48,431 in this respect and the amount is included with the salary figure shown in the table.
On appointment to Group Chief Executive, the Remuneration Committee agreed to the augmentation of benefits for Philip Moore the effect of which would be to provide an overall pension benefit of broadly two thirds of capped salary at age 60.
This augmentation will be funded by the receipt by the Pension Scheme of transfer values in respect of previous employments and Philip Moores personal contributions.
c Jim Smart is subject to the lifetime allowance on approved pension benefits introduced in April 2006 as part of the HM Revenue & Customs pension simplification changes.
As a result, on appointment, it was agreed that in lieu of benefits under the Pension Scheme, Jim Smart would be paid a salary supplement of 20% of basic salary, reviewable in each calendar year, to give him the opportunity to make further retirement provision.
During 2006, Jim Smart received 10,909 in this respect and the amount is included with the salary figures shown in the table.
During 2006, each executive director apart from Jim Smart and Alain Grisay, in common with all staff, contributed 3% of his pensionable salary to the Pension Scheme.
Alain Grisay contributed 6% of his pensionable salary to the F&C Asset Management Staff Pension Fund.
No excess retirement benefits have been paid to directors or past directors.
The transfer values shown in the table have been calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note 12b 6 April 1997 issued by the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the appropriate fund.
