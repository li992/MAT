External Appointments The Board considers whether it is appropriate for an executive Director to serve as a non-executive Director of another company.
Stephen King was entitled to a fee of 34,500 in respect of his non-executive Directorship of the Weir Group plc, which he was permitted to retain.
37 fide La Rue Annual Report 2006 Details of each executive Directors pension arrangements are as follows: Stephen King is eligible for a target pension from all sources of two-thirds of basic salary at the age of 62.
Part of this benefit arises from previous employment.
His target pension is provided through a combination of a closed FURBS and membership of the senior section of the fide La Rue Pension Scheme.
He is required to make a contribution of 7 per cent of basic salary to his pension arrangement and is covered for a lump sum on death in service based on four times basic salary, with a widows pension of 60 per cent of target pension in the event of death in service.
Contributions to the FURBS were suspended during 2003, until the review of the new legislation was completed and benefits on earnings in excess of the earnings cap were provided on an unfunded basis.
These contributions, totalling 164,718, will be transferred to the Scheme to fund the previously unfunded past service benefits.
The impact of this will be to increase his pension under the defined benefit Scheme as at 6 April 2006 to 16,100 pa. Leo Quinn is eligible for a target pension from all sources of two-thirds of basic salary at the age of 60.
He is required to make a contribution to the senior section of the Scheme of 7 per cent of basic salary and is covered for a lump sum on death in service based on four times basic salary, with a widows pension of 60% of target pension payable on death in service.
Until the review of the new legislation was completed, pension on earnings in excess of the earnings cap was unfunded.
From 6 April 2006 his pension will be provided through the Scheme.
The Company will make a payment to the Scheme to cover the cost of previously unfunded past service benefits.
The Companys external actuary has estimated this cost to be 275,000.
The impact of this will be to increase his pension under the defined benefit Scheme as at 6 April 2006 to 24,700 pa.
The increase in defined benefit scheme pension for each of the executive Directors from 6 April 2006 does not represent an increase in either the target pension or Company liability but is a consequence of transferring the funding from a combination of two arrangements to one and the cancellation of past unfunded liabilities.
Directors Pension Entitlements audited information The table below sets out the pension benefits to which each executive Director is entitled.
It shows: the accrued pension entitlement at the end of the year, payable from normal retirement age: the additional pension accrued during the year, payable at normal retirement age: and the transfer value amounts as at 26 March 2005 and 25 March 2006 and the increase in transfer value between the two periods net of Directors contributions.
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The increase in transfer value required by the Listing Rules discloses the current value of the increase whereas the change in transfer value shown under the Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 shows the absolute change in the value including the effects of market volatility and inflation.

Sharesave Scheme All UK employees of the Company may join its HM Revenue and Customs approved SAYE Scheme.
Options are granted over fide La Rue plc shares, at the prevailing market price at the time of grant with a discretionary discount to the market price, to employees who agree to save between 5 and 250 per month over a period of three or five years.
A grant was made in December 2005 at a price of 357.0p which was a 15 per cent discount, and 36 per cent of eligible employees participated.
US Employee Share Purchase Plan The US Employee Share Purchase Plan, established under Section 423 of the US Internal Revenue Code, provides a competitive incentive for US employees to invest up to 10 per cent of basic salary each year in the Company, subject to the statutory limit currently US$25,000 worth of shares.
No performance conditions are attached to options under the Plan.
The Fourth Offering under the Plan began on 1 January 2006 and 23 per cent of eligible employees participated.
The purchase price is 85 per cent of the lower market value of a fide La Rue share either at the beginning 294.95p or end of the Offering Period on 31 December 2006.
Current Schemes Deferred Bonus and Matching Share Plan The Company established the Deferred Bonus and Matching Share Plan in July 2005 following a review by the Remuneration Committee of share incentive arrangements which were introduced in 2002 for executive Directors and other senior executives.
The objective of the Plan was to replace the existing schemes with a single arrangement which was more in alignment with the Companys strategy of developing its core business.
The Plan involves making awards of deferred allocations of shares to executive Directors and selected senior executives based on the achievement of annual performance targets to be satisfied before the awards are made.
The maximum value of the deferred allocation based on market value of a share at the date of allocation is 50 per cent of the maximum bonus, i. e. 50 per cent of salary in the case of Leo Quinn and 35 per cent of salary in the case of Stephen King.
The number of deferred shares will be matched by additional free shares which will be released on the third anniversary of the allocation of the deferred shares provided pre-determined performance targets are satisfied and the participant is still employed by the Company.
