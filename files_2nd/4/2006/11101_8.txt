Remuneration Report This report contains the information required by the Companies Act 1985 and the relevant parts of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board of Directors report that the Company has complied with these regulations throughout the year under review.
Information not subject to audit The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration of the Chairman and executive directors, and reviews that of senior executives.
The members of the Committee who served during the year are listed in this Annual Report.
They are independent nonexecutive directors of the Company and have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters addressed by the Committee and have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships.
Remuneration policy The remuneration packages of directors are reviewed by the Committee at least annually on the same basis as any other employee of the Group.
The review takes into account market practice and performance of the individual and of the business.
Other factors taken into account include the experience and responsibility of the individuals concerned.
The Committee receives information from various independent sources on directors remuneration.
The components of the Groups remuneration packages are detailed below.
Policy is structured to provide a mix of remuneration to ensure that no one component or measure dominates and that interests are aligned over different time periods with other employees and shareholders.
Packages include basic salary, annual bonus based on earnings per share, a long term incentive plan based on total shareholder return and optional participation in a risk reward investment plan.
Salary Salaries of directors are set by reference to those prevailing in the market, particularly within other major retail companies, and according to individual performance, experience and responsibility.
Annual performance related bonus The executive directors participate in an annual performance related bonus scheme which is based on a formula determined by the Committee measuring the performance of the business.
The performance measure is earnings per share before tax, which must increase by 5% prior to any bonus becoming payable.
The formula includes an upper limit of 100% of salary and other constraints which may reduce the bonus percentage below that determined by the formula.
Earnings per share growth must reach a demanding level of at least 20% for the maximum bonus to be earned.
Long term incentive plan The long term incentive plan was approved by shareholders in 1997 and will expire in 2007.
A new ten year plan will be put to shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually to executive directors and senior executives.
Under the current plan, performance is measured over periods of three years, which commence annually, by comparing total shareholder return against approximately 20 other UK listed retail companies.
The comparator group of companies for the three year performance period to January 2006 was as follows: Body Shop G. U. S. Marks & Spencer New Look Boots JJB Sports Matalan Signet Burberry J Sainsbury MFI Furniture Tesco DFS Furniture Kingfisher Mothercare W H Smith Dixons Laura Ashley N Brown Woolworths Findel 20 Remuneration Report The Committee determines which companies are to be added to or removed from the comparator group.
Laura Ashley, DFS Furniture and New Look have been removed for periods ending January 2007 onwards and have been replaced with Carpetright, Kesa and Wm Morrison Supermarkets.
The Committee considers that the comparator group consists of companies which are most comparable to NEXT in size or nature of their business.
The Committee believes that comparison against a group of retail companies is more likely to reflect the Companys relative performance against its peers, thereby resulting in appropriate awards being made.
The graph below shows relative total shareholder return of the Company over five years when compared to the FTSE All Share index and FTSE General Retailers index.
This illustrates the Companys performance against a wide all-share UK index and against other companies in the same sector.
NEXT plc Performance Chart 2001-2006 Total Shareholder Return 250 200 150 100 50 Re-based to 31 January 2001 100 NEXT plc FTSE General Retailers FTSE All Share Under the rules of the plan the maximum share award possible for each performance period is the equivalent of 100% of basic salary at the start of the performance period.
However, the Committee has generally restricted the maximum share award possible to the equivalent of 70% of basic salary.
An incremental award has been made to Mr Angelides, bringing his maximum share award to an equivalent of 100% of salary for the performance periods commencing January 2004 and 2005.
The additional 30% award is contingent on his remaining with the Group for a five year period to January 2009.
Incremental awards made to three senior executives for the performance period commencing January 2004 were cancelled during the year and replaced by deferred bonuses linked to the Companys share price which are only payable in 2009 if they remain with the Group.
If total shareholder return is below the median ranking company there will be no entitlement to any of the award.
For median performance the entitlement will be 30% of the maximum award.
For performance above the median the entitlement will rise, with the maximum award being earned for performance which places the Company in the upper quartile of the comparator group.
Irrespective of where Company performance ranks, no award will be made unless the earnings per share of the Company has increased by at least the increase in the Retail Price Index over the period.
Awards are granted provisionally at the start of a performance period and remain subject to performance conditions over the life of the plan before any entitlement is earned.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of a three year performance period then the award for that period will lapse.
The Company has discretion as to whether entitlements earned are payable in NEXT shares or cash and to date it has allowed participants the choice.
Entitlements earned are not pensionable and are based on salary and share price at the start of the performance period.
Individuals included in the plan have not received grants under the management share option scheme in the same year.
21 Remuneration Report Risk Reward investment plan In July 2005, a risk reward investment plan was approved by shareholders in Extraordinary General Meeting.
In accordance with the terms of the plan, and following approval by the Remuneration Committee, the Group made a special contribution to the NEXT 2003 Employee Share Ownership Trust the ESOT.
This contribution was applied by the ESOT to acquire listed warrants issued by Goldman Sachs Jersey Limited.
These warrants are held on revocable trusts for those executives who made a personal investment from their own resources in a financial contract, the success of which is based on the market price of NEXT shares in July 2009.
The Groups contribution to fund investments made by the ESOT was limited to a maximum of three times the personal investment of each participant, subject to an upper limit on the Groups contribution of 200,000 per participant.
The returns on the warrants and the financial contracts are materially the same and will vary between a minimum of zero if the final share price is then 20.50 or less and a maximum of approximately five times the initial investment.
The maximum value will only be achieved if the final share price is at or above 25.00.
The final price will be determined by an averaging mechanism over the final three months to July 2009.
On maturity of the warrants, any returns accruing to the trust will only be distributed either in NEXT shares and or cash to those participants who have remained with NEXT.
Based on an average share price of 14.93 over the three months to July 2005, the Companys share price must increase at the equivalent of an annual compound growth rate of 8.3% prior to dividends payable in order for there to be any return on the initial investment.
In order to achieve maximum value the annual compound growth rate would be 13.8%.
The financial contracts were entered into with an independent third party regulated by the FSA.
No interest in the Companys securities is being acquired under these contracts by the directors or employees.
In addition, the Group also acquired 172,368 warrants direct from Goldman Sachs Jersey Limited in order to hedge its potential employers national insurance contributions liability in respect of the plan.
In 2004 the Group paid special bonuses to certain directors and senior executives who invested their own resources in similar financial contracts on the understanding that the net amount would also be invested in those contracts.
The success of the 2004 financial contracts was based on the market price of NEXT shares in July 2008.
Details of the amounts invested in the financial contracts by the executive directors and of the Groups related special contributions to the ESOT are given below.

The plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees excluding main board directors and senior executives who participate in the long term incentive plan at the discretion of the Board.
Options 22 Remuneration Report can either be approved where the beneficiary may qualify for tax relief or unapproved.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to shareholder approved limits and there are no cash settlement alternatives.
Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.
The maximum total market value of shares i. e. the acquisition price of shares over which options may be granted to any person during any financial year of the Company is three times salary, excluding bonuses and benefits in kind.
This limit may be increased to five times salary in circumstances considered by the Remuneration Committee to be exceptional, for example on the grant of options following recruitment.
Grants are generally made annually.
The exercise of options is subject to a performance condition where the percentage growth in earnings per share of the Group over a three year period must exceed RPI and a further 3% per annum.
If this performance condition is not met within three years from the date of grant, the options lapse.
No options were granted to directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.
No employee has received option grants under the scheme and been included in the long term incentive plan in the same year.
Sharesave options The sharesave option scheme was approved by shareholders in 2000 and will be due for renewal in 2010.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually to all employees.
The scheme operates on a save-as-you-earn principle and is subject to a maximum contribution limit of 250 per month per employee.
Options are exercisable three, five or seven years from the date of grant.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20%.
A similar scheme is operated by the Company for its employees in the Republic of Ireland.
Sharesave options granted to directors in the year under review are detailed below.
Group pension scheme Executive directors are eligible for membership of the NEXT Group Pension Plan which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs and consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The trustee of the scheme is a limited company, NEXT Pension Trustees Limited the Trustee.
All the directors of the Trustee are appointed and can be removed by NEXT.
The Board of the Trustee includes members of the scheme, a pensioner member and an independent director who is also the Chairman of the Trustee.
All directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of NEXT.
The schemes investments are kept entirely separate from the business affairs of the NEXT Group and the Trustee holds them in trust.
Responsibility for investment of the schemes funds has been delegated by the Trustee to professional investment managers.
Defined contribution section Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the scheme.
Members elect to pay either 3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.
For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of three times the members basic salary at the previous April is payable along with the current value of the members fund, subject to statutory limits.
Defined benefit section The defined benefit section of the scheme was closed to new members in 2000 but is being continued for the benefit of existing members.
This section provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth depending on chosen member contribution rate of final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service.
This section also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependents pensions on death in service or following retirement.
For death prior to retirement a spouses pension of 60% of the members prospective pension is payable.
A lump sum of up to three times the members final pensionable earnings plus a return of the members contributions with interest is also payable.
For death after retirement a spouses pension of 60% of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
A lump sum equivalent to the balance of five years pension is payable if death occurs within five years of retirement.
If death occurs after leaving service but before the pension becomes payable i. e. as a deferred pensioner, a spouses pension of 60% of the accrued deferred pension is payable 23 Remuneration Report along with a lump sum equal to the members own contributions with interest.
Childrens pensions are only payable on death in service.
In the case of ill-health retirement only the accrued pension is payable.
All benefits are subject to statutory limits.
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post-1997 is subject to limited price indexation.
For all current scheme members basic pay, overtime and annual performance bonus are included in calculating pensionable earnings but no other items of remuneration are taken into account.
The inclusion of annual performance bonus in pensionable earnings is limited to a maximum of 35% of an employees annual salary in any year.
The inclusion of variable pay in pensionable earnings has been the practice for many years and is appropriate for NEXT where a significant element of employee earnings is dependent on productivity or profit performance.
The Trustee was asked to consider that bonus be excluded from future defined benefit pensionable earnings and replaced with an optional AVC alternative, however it was not possible to introduce such a change at that time.
A new proposal to remove bonus from pensionable earnings is currently being discussed with the Trustee.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company made contributions at the rate of 15.5% up to August 2005 and 17.5% thereafter.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit sections financial position was undertaken as at 31 March 2005 and concluded that the scheme had a 12% deficit of assets compared to actuarial liabilities.
Members who joined the scheme after May 1989 and before October 2000 are subject to a statutory salary cap for approved pension schemes which is set at 105,600 per annum for 2005 2006.
Members subject to the cap may be provided with appropriate benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement in relation to that part of their earnings which exceeds the cap, where they so elect.
The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by paying 5% of pensionable earnings in excess of the cap.
Specific information in respect of executive directors pension entitlements is detailed below.
Notice periods Each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract which is terminable by the Company on giving one years notice.
The Committee will ensure that in the event of any termination payment being made to a director full account will be taken of that directors duty to mitigate any loss and where appropriate the Committee may seek independent professional advice prior to authorising such payment.
Apart from service contracts no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries.
Other benefits Executive directors receive benefits which may include the provision of a fully expensed company car or cash alternative, private medical insurance, annual subscriptions to appropriate professional bodies and staff discount when purchasing the Groups merchandise.
Other employees are also eligible for certain of these benefits.
Non-executive directors Remuneration of the non-executive directors of the Company is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.
Remuneration consists of fees for their services in connection with Board and Board Committee meetings.
Letters of appointment do not contain notice periods.
Non-executive directors receive a discount when purchasing the Groups merchandise but do not participate in any of the Groups pension, bonus, share option or other incentive schemes.

Mr Mitchell-Innes and Mrs Burdus both retired on 13 May 2004.
25 Remuneration Report Mr Wolfson was the highest paid director in the current year 2005: Mr Angelides.
Details of the 2005 special bonuses are as noted above.
In addition to the above, Mr Mitchell-Innes received advisory fees of 14,583 2005: 13,125 subsequent to his resignation as a director of the Company, and was a director of NEXT Pension Trustees Limited until 30 June 2005, for which he received a fee of 6,250 2005: 26,041.
The Company also paid a pension under the unfunded, unapproved arrangement to a former director of the Company of 31,495 2005: 31,155.
Long term incentive plan Estimated monetary values were included in the January 2005 Remuneration Report for the three year performance plan which matured at that date based on a share price of 1563p on 21 March 2005.
Performance conditions of the plan are detailed above.
Awards were made subsequent to the Report on 31 March 2005 when the share price was 1595p.
Adjustments to the estimated monetary value together with the final award have therefore been included in the table below.
A further three year performance period of the plan matured in January 2006.
The total shareholder return of the Company over this period ranked between third and fourth when compared to the group of 21 other listed retail companies.
Accordingly an award of 100% of the maximum equivalent to 70% of basic salary is expected to be made to the participants in the plan, which is payable in NEXT shares or cash at the Companys discretion.
The awards will be made during 2006 and, based on the share price of 1743p on 21 March 2006, awards to directors would be as follows: January 2006 January 2005 Actual Estimated Adjustment Final no.

26 Remuneration Report Directors pension entitlements All executive directors are members of the defined benefit section of the NEXT Group Pension Plan.
Directors and some senior managers receive an enhancement from the Plan, increasing the accrual of their retirement benefit up to two thirds of their final pensionable earnings on completion of 20 years pensionable service at age 60 for members who joined before October 2000.
The lump sum payable on death in service for directors and some senior managers is enhanced to four times pensionable salary.
In the case of earnings over 100,000 per annum, final pensionable earnings are based on an average of the best consecutive 36 or more months earnings in the ten years prior to retirement.
Pension entitlements of the executive directors who held office during the year are as follows: Increase in Transfer value Increase in Age at Years of Accrued accrued of accrued transfer value January pensionable annual annual annual pension less directors 2006 service pension pension 2006 2005 contributions 000 000 000 000 000 S A Wolfson 38 11 161 26 1,222 851 355 C E Angelides 42 13 149 25 1,335 889 430 D W Keens 52 19 240 30 2,880 2,119 735 A J Varley 55 22 204 19 2,874 2,138 716 Years of pensionable service shown above may include bought in service from the transfer of other pension entitlements into the Plan.
Due to movements in bond yields, which underlie the basis of calculation of transfer values, the increase in transfer values over the year can be significantly higher for members nearer to retirement than for younger members.
Mr Wolfson and Mr Angelides are both subject to a statutory salary cap and have elected to join the unfunded, unapproved pension arrangement.
The accrued annual pension set out above includes their membership of that arrangement.
Directors interests Directors beneficial interests in shares and share options at the beginning of the financial year, or date of appointment if later, and at the end of the year, were as follows: Ordinary shares of 10p each Options over ordinary shares of 10p each 2006 2005 2006 2006 2005 2005 No.
No director held any option with an exercise price above the market price of NEXT shares on 28 January 2006.

The market price of shares at 28 January 2006 was 1698p and the range during the year then ended was 1268p to 1734p.
The executive directors are also together with other employees discretionary beneficiaries under the ESOT and, as such, were each considered to be interested in the 8,185,173 shares owned by the ESOT at 28 January 2006.
Mr Keens has a beneficial holding of 41,000 nominal value of the Companys 10 year 5.25% corporate bonds.
There have been no changes to directors interests in the shares of the Company from the end of the year to 21 March 2006.
Full details of directors interests in the shares and share options of the Company are contained in the Register of Directors Interests which is open to inspection.
