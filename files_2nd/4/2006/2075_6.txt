As in previous years, our approach has been to meet the highest standards of disclosure while aiming to produce a clear and comprehensible document.
New remuneration arrangements were put in place in 2004 and the Committee remains satisfied that these continue to achieve its aim of delivering superior shareholder value by driving outperformance against the sector.
However, the Committee is particularly mindful of the need to balance the fostering of a performance culture with ensuring that we keep our best people.
With commodity prices at record levels, retention of executive talent will become an increasing challenge.
The Committee intends to review current arrangements over the course of the 2007 financial year to determine how better to promote retention.
We have an open dialogue on remuneration issues with our major investors and representative bodies.
I am very pleased to be able to report that a proposal to introduce an all-employee share plan will be put to this years Annual General Meeting.
The plan will allow all our people to share in the success of the Group and thus help to align their objectives with those of investors.
On behalf of the Committee I thank you for your interest in our Report.

Remuneration Policy and Structure The Committee recognises that the Group operates in a global environment and that its performance depends on the quality of its people.
It keeps the remuneration policy under constant review to ensure its ongoing appropriateness.

Group Performance and Key Performance Indicators Group performance The performance of the Group relative to the markets in which it operates over the past five years is illustrated by the two charts below.
The first compares BHP Billitons TSR performance with that of the ASX 100 and the FTSE 100, both of which are broadly-based indices.
The second illustrates performance against an index of a peer group of companies, weighted 75 per cent to mining and 25 per cent to oil and gas.
The relevant companies are listed in the table on page 129 of this Report see note 7 to the table on that page.
The Committee believes that the broadly-based indices and the index of peer group companies are the most appropriate benchmarks for measuring the Groups performance.
For FY 2006, the total return to BHP Billiton Limited shareholders as measured by the change in share price plus dividends reinvested was 68 per cent.
Over the same period, the total return to BHP Billiton Plc shareholders measured 1 on the same basis was 60 per cent.

The KPIs for FY 2006 were based on Group, individual business and personal measures and the levels of performance achieved were as follows: Group KPIs Level of performance achieved as determined by the Committee 1 Health, Safety, Environment and Community Between threshold and target Shareholder value added Between threshold and target Net Present Value added Below threshold Notes: 1 Health, Safety, Environment and Community HSEC measures include: Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate TRIFR : HSEC standards: Group HSEC targets: and behavioural-based systems.
Supplemental bonus When the Committee assessed performance for FY 2006, it was felt that there was a gap between the GIS awards as calculated and BHP Billitons share price performance.
It therefore recommended to the Board that an additional cash bonus be paid to executives, which the Board approved.
The amount of the additional bonus was capped, in aggregate as a 14 per cent increase to the cost of the Groups short-term incentive program, and a 20 per cent maximum increase for individual executives.
The CEO was given discretion as to the application.
In applying the bonus the CEO took account of the performance of the individual businesses to which the executive was attached.
The Board determined the additional bonus amount payable to the CEO and approved an additional bonus equal to 14 per cent of the CEOs GIS incentive award.
The amounts payable to the executive Directors and Key Management Personnel who are not Directors are contained in the remuneration tables on pages 122 to 123 of this Report.

Such entitlements, if any, will be governed by the rules of the schemes at the date of departure.

8.1 Estimated value range of awards The maximum possible value of awards yet to vest to be disclosed under the Australian Corporations Act 2001 is not determinable as it is dependent on, and therefore fluctuates with, the share prices of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc at a date that any award is exercised.
An estimate of a maximum possible value of awards for Key Management Personnel can be made using the highest share price during FY 2006, which is A$32.00 and 12.11 respectively, multiplied by the number of awards for each scheme.
For Options granted to Mr Goodyear, the value is reduced by the exercise price multiplied by the number of Options.
The minimum value of awards yet to vest is nil.
