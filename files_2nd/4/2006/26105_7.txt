Kensington Group plc Report of the Board to shareholders Annual report and accounts 2006 on Directors remuneration 29 Report of the Board to shareholders on Directors remuneration The role of the Remuneration Committee is to determine, on behalf of the Board, the terms of engagement and remuneration of the Executive Directors and to report on those issues to the shareholders.
The Committee is also responsible for determining, on behalf of the Board, matters of policy relating to the Companys pension arrangements, share option schemes and executive incentive plans.
Finally, the Remuneration Committee also monitors the policies being applied by the Group Chief Executive in remunerating senior executives in the Group.
The Committee members are independent Non-Executive Directors.
Mr D Jones Chairman, Mr J Herring and Mr T Strauss were members throughout the year.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest, other than as shareholders of the Company, in the Committees decisions.
The Committee met nine times in the year and there was 100% attendance by Mr D Jones and Mr J Herring and 89% 8 9 by Mr T Strauss.
The Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive are invited to attend meetings of the Remuneration Committee, except when issues relating to their own remuneration are being discussed.
The Remuneration Committee draws advice principally from remuneration reports and surveys provided by Watson Wyatt and New Bridge Street Consultants.
Watson Wyatt and Linklaters provide specific advice on the design and operation of the share and incentive plans.
Both firms also provide advice to the Company on human resources and legal matters respectively.
Data required for the analysis of comparator performance used in the Companys share plans is provided by Citigroup, the Companys brokers.
The Committee is supported by Mandy Perrin, Group Human Resources Advisor.
Remuneration policy The overriding objective of the Groups policy on remuneration is to ensure that Kensington Group is able to attract, retain and motivate executives of the highest calibre, essential to the effective leadership and management of the business.
In developing its remuneration policy, Kensington Group takes into account the UKs regulatory framework, corporate governance best practice and shareholder views.
Total remuneration is benchmarked against relevant internal and external markets and Kensingtons policy is to provide Executive Directors with remuneration at levels that are competitive with FTSE 250 businesses, taking account of any specialist skills required by the business.
Another key aspect of the Groups remuneration policy is to ensure that there is a clear linkage between pay and individual and corporate performance.
A significant proportion of the total remuneration is awarded through performance related plans with phased delivery over the short, medium and long term.
The performance measures used by Kensington Group are balanced between financial measures and comparative sector measures and are designed to achieve alignment between executive and business and shareholders objectives.
The Committee approves all performance measures used in the Companys executive incentive plans and these measures are clear and transparent.
It is the Committees current intention to continue to apply the same remuneration policy in future years.
Report on 2006 Executive Directors Remuneration for 2005 6 Financial Year Total remuneration levels Executive Directors remuneration levels are benchmarked using externally provided compensation data.
This information, together with personal and Company performance, is used by the Committee in determining the appropriate remuneration level.
Components of remuneration The remuneration of Executive Directors for 2005 6 comprised base salary, annual performance bonuses, pension contributions, share awards under the Performance Share Incentive Plan PSIP, car allowances, life assurance, permanent health and medical insurance.
The major components of remuneration are described in more detail in the following sections.
Base salary Salaries are reviewed annually with effect from 1 December taking into account both internal and external relativities.
Remuneration surveys are used to provide external market salary levels and when appropriate, market rate adjustments are made to ensure the ongoing competitiveness of the executives remuneration package.
Kensington Group plc Report of the Board to shareholders Annual report and accounts 2006 on Directors remuneration 30 Report of the Board to shareholders on Directors remuneration continued Taking into account the external data and overall internal relativities the Remuneration Committee approved a base salary effective 1 December 2006 for the Group Chief Executive of 322,400, representing a 4% increase from last year.
The Group Finance Director was recruited in August 2006 on a salary of 265,000 and the salary is scheduled to be reviewed again on 1 December 2007.
Pension contributions Base salary is the only element of Directors remuneration that is pensionable.
The Executive Directors participate in the Kensington Mortgages Group Personal Pension Plan GPP administered by AXA.
Following a review of Executive Pension Contributions undertaken in October 2005 and reported in the 2005 Annual Report the Remuneration Committee approved an increase in the pension contribution levels for senior managers, including the Executive Directors.
The changes highlighted below took effect from 6 April 2006.
Previous employer contribution New employer contribution Age under 41 Age 41 0-5 years service 5 years service 7.5% 10% 10% 15% Previous employee contribution New employee contribution None required None required None required Minimum 2.5% required The changes reflected the need to move away from an age related contribution scale in order to avoid future claims under the new age discrimination legislation.
The review also addressed the relatively uncompetitive contribution level of Kensingtons executive pension contributions and at the same time introduced an incentive for executives to make personal contributions to the plan.
From April 2006, individuals can cease pension accruals where they are at or near to the Inland Revenue lifetime limits.
In such cases executives are eligible to receive an alternative, taxable, cash allowance.
There are currently no individuals receiving this alternative cash allowance.
Incentive awards Annual performance bonus The Executive Directors participate in the Kensington Group Annual Bonus Plan.
Under the terms of the plan annual bonus payments were determined by: How well the business performed against agreed business objectives profit, volume, arrears and operating cost per new business asset How well an individual performed against their individual objectives and How well an individual contributed by demonstrating the Kensington values, behaviours and adherence to the Companys code of business conduct.
The Remuneration Committee reviews and sets the performance targets and objectives used in the plan on an annual basis taking into account the business strategy.
The bonus plan has a threshold level below which no bonus is payable and an on-plan achievement level.
The on-plan bonus level is achieved if the business meets its plan numbers and the individual meets their objectives.
The on-plan level is 70% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and 52.5% for the Group Finance Director.
If the business results exceed plan and the individual is rated as excellent and overachieves against their objectives the bonus can be higher, but is subject to an overall maximum of 190% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and 140% of salary for the Group Finance Director.
The bonuses arising under the terms of the plan for 2006 were 85.5% and 15.2% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director respectively.
The Group Finance Director, Mr R Blundell, joined in late August 2006 and the bonus payment made, rewards the period 1 September 2006 30 November 2006.
In addition a further bonus of 200,000 was paid to the Group Finance Director which was part of a joining package that recognised the forfeiting of short and long-term incentives from his previous employer.
The same bonus plan principles are used throughout the organisation.
The on-plan and maximum bonus levels vary depending on market practice and the individuals level in the organisation.
Kensington Group plc Report of the Board to shareholders Annual report and accounts 2006 on Directors remuneration 31 Report of the Board to shareholders on Directors remuneration continued Long-term incentives Awards have been made to the Executive Directors under a number of long-term incentive plans of which the following are still active incentive schemes: The Kensington Group plc Performance Share and Investment Plan PSIP 2004: The Kensington Group plc unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 2001: and The Kensington Group plc Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 2000.
Awards under these plans are delivered in the form of ordinary shares of the Company and all awards are made under plans that incorporate dilution limits as set out in the guidelines for Share Incentive Schemes published by the Association of British Insurers.
The current estimated dilution from existing awards, including executive and all employee share plans adopted by the Company since November 2000, is 5.38% of the Companys share capital as at 30 November 2006.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the performance criteria, grant levels and vesting schedules associated with the Companys share based plans remain appropriate for the business.
Performance Share and Investment Plan PSIP Under the PSIP, awards can be made to a small number of senior executives, including the Executive Directors.
The objectives of the plan are to provide a long-term incentive for delivering enhanced business performance and to increase the alignment of interests of executive directors with the Companys shareholders.
The plan consists of three elements: performance shares: a grant of Kensington Group shares made by the Company to the Executive.
Typically, the face value of performance shares awarded to Executive Directors is expected to be up to 100% of salary although the scheme rules allow for awards of up to 130% of salary.
investment shares: shares purchased by the Executive and held in trust.
The Executive can invest up to 50% of their annual bonus in investment shares within the PSIP.
This maximum level is set and reviewed by the Remuneration Committee and the Committee has no plans to change the maximum level in the next 12 months.
matching shares: shares awarded by the Company to match the pre-tax investment made by the individual executive.
Vesting of performance and matching shares depends on share performance against two tests: growth in earnings per share: and the Companys relative TSR performance.
The performance conditions are detailed below and if either condition is not satisfied at the end of the three year performance period the awards will lapse.
There will be no retesting.
Performance conditions for performance and matching shares Earnings per share 50% of performance and matching shares vest if the comparative TSR test is met and EPS for the last accounting year of the Performance Period as derived from the published accounts for that year shows a growth of at least 4% per annum in excess of the growth in the Retail Prices Index, compounded annually over the Performance Period, when measured against the EPS for the Base Year.
100% of performance and matching shares vest if the comparative TSR test is met and EPS for the last accounting year of the Performance Period as derived from the published accounts for that year shows a growth of at least 10% per annum in excess of the growth in the Retail Prices Index, compounded annually over the Performance Period, when measured against the EPS for the Base Year.
AND Comparative TSR TSR growth over three year performance period is equal to or greater than the median TSR growth in the comparator group companies: Alliance and Leicester plc Bradford and Bingley Cattles Plc London Scottish Bank plc Paragon Group of Companies Provident Financial plc Northern Rock plc Kensington Group plc Report of the Board to shareholders Annual report and accounts 2006 on Directors remuneration 32 Report of the Board to shareholders on Directors remuneration continued In addition to the performance conditions, the individuals investment shares must have been held throughout the three year period in order for the matching shares to be payable.
In the 2005 6 financial year the following PSIP awards were made to the current Executive Directors: Mr J Maltby 24,800 Performance Shares 90% of salary at maximum vesting 32,158 Conditional Matching Shares Mr R Blundell 1 37,313 Performance Shares 122% of salary at maximum vesting 1 This level of award was part of a joining package which compensated for long-term incentives forfeited on leaving previous employer.
Share options Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 This is a discretionary scheme and the scheme is not approved by the Inland Revenue.
An option can be granted at a price which is either set by reference to the middle market price on the previous business day or the average of the middle market price on the three or five previous business days.
No consideration is payable on the grant of an option.
Options will normally be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of their date of grant.
The performance conditions attached to the options are: increase in earnings per share EPS of the Company of at least 5% more than the increase in the Retail Prices Index RPI : and the increase in EPS must have outperformed the average EPS of a comparator group of companies during the three previous financial years prior to the first exercise date.
The companies in the comparator group currently are: Cattles plc, Paragon Group of Companies plc, Provident Financial plc and Northern Rock plc.
Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 This is an Inland Revenue approved discretionary scheme open to all full time executive directors and employees of the Company.
The aggregate price payable by each participant for ordinary shares under option at any one time will not be allowed to exceed 30,000, or such other maximum limit as the Inland Revenue may agree.
The pricing, performance conditions and exercise timescales relating to the options are identical to those applying to the Unapproved Executive Scheme outlined above.
Share option awards in 2005 6 No options were granted under either the Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 or the Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 to Executive Directors in the 2005 6 financial year and the Remuneration Committee have no plans to do so in the future.
The Executive Directors will continue to be able to participate in the All Employee Share Plan SAYE.
Share ownership guidelines Executive Directors participating in the PSIP long-term incentive plan must comply with the Companys share ownership guidelines which were introduced in 2004.
These require the Executive Directors to build a personal holding of Kensington shares equivalent to one times salary within four years and to maintain a minimum holding at this level in future years.
As at 30 November 2006, Mr J Maltbys personal shareholding was 280,083 shares.
Based on the share price as at 30 November 2006 760.5 pence this is equivalent to 6.87 times his annual salary.
Mr R Blundell did not hold any Kensington shares as at 30 November 2006.
All Employee Share Plan SAYE The Inland Revenue approved Kensington Group plc Share Save Scheme 2001 is an Inland Revenue approved scheme open to all permanent employees.
The scheme is designed to align employees interests more closely with those of shareholders and to provide an opportunity to participate in the Companys financial success.
The maximum that can be saved each month is 250 and savings plus interest may be used to acquire shares by exercising the related option.
The Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the scheme and details of their participation are given in the table on page 37.

Service Contracts Mr J Maltby has a service agreement, effective from 9 August 2000, with Kensington Mortgages Limited KML, which may be terminated by KML or Mr J Maltby with not less than 12 months notice in writing.
Mr R Blundell has a service agreement, effective from 1 September 2006, with KML, which may be terminated by KML or Mr R Blundell with not less than 12 months notice in writing.
The Executive Directors service agreements do not have a fixed term and provide for a normal retirement age of 60.
The service agreements do not contain clauses specifying payments in the event of early termination by the Company.
The Companys approach when considering payments in the event of early termination would be to examine individual circumstances, including the reason for termination, contractual notice period and share scheme rules relating to contract termination and take a decision based on this information.
The Remuneration Committee would approve any such arrangements for the Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors Mr P Birch, Mr J Herring, Mr D Jones and Mr T Strauss are Non-Executive Directors and each has a letter of appointment.
Their appointment is terminable in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association or immediately, on written notice, for cause.
A Non-Executive director may, by written notice to the Company, resign with immediate effect.
Non-Executive Directors remuneration The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors takes the form of fees and is periodically reviewed by the Group Chief Executive and Group HR Advisor.
The fees are compared with those paid to FTSE 250 non-executive directors using survey data compiled by New Bridge Street Consultants.
The fees are approved by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
Kensington Group plc Report of the Board to shareholders Annual report and accounts 2006 on Directors remuneration 34 Report of the Board to shareholders on Directors remuneration continued Based on the 2006 New Bridge Street Consultants survey, basic fee levels were increased with effect from 1 December 2006.
