norms, respectively, for increases paid to senior executives during 2006.
The increases to US-based executives were in a range from 3% to 7%: the increases to UK-based executives were in a range from 4% to 6%, except in the case of Mr. van fide Aast, who was given an increase to align him more appropriately to the global market within which he operates, rather than to the UK market, which accounts for less than 20% of his business.
Because of the many countries in which we operate, there is no practical basis on which to compare directors pay increases with those of other employees.
However, the same factors, in terms of market, personal contribution and performance determine the level of increase across all employee populations globally.

We have also delivered strong cash generation and higher returns on invested capital.
Organic revenue growth was 5%, with good growth in Elsevier, LexisNexis and Reed Business and flat revenues in Harcourt Education in a weaker market.
Organic adjusted operating profit growth was 8% with underlying margin improvement in Elsevier, LexisNexis and Reed Business.
The revenue growth benefits from a 10% increase in digital revenues representing the payback on the continuing investment in new electronic product, innovative marketing and expanded sales coverage.
The 0.7 percentage point improvement in underlying margin reflects the revenue growth and the continuing focus on cost across the business.
The quality of the earnings is underpinned by our strong cash flow in 2006, with 95% of adjusted operating profits converting into cash.
In addition, the directors were generally assessed as having delivered a strong performance against their KPOs, resulting in positive business momentum and an overall promising business outlook going into 2007. iii Gains made under Long term Incentive Plans during 2006 ESOS The following gains were made by executive directors in relation to share options over ordinary shares in Reed Elsevier PLC PLC and Reed Elsevier NV NV exercised during 2006: No.

For the performance period 2004-06, awards to executive directors under the LTIS were made in February 2004 in respect of 5.5 times salary in conventional market price options and 2.5 times salary in performance shares.
The performance condition governing the vesting of those awards was as follows: at 8% compound annual growth in adjusted EPS at constant currency, 25% of the awards vest: at 10% growth, 100% vest: at 12% growth, 125% of the awards vest.
Awards vest on a straight line basis between each of these points.
There is no provision for retesting of the performance condition.
The Committee assessed both the earnings growth and the quality of earnings in order to determine whether the performance condition had been achieved.
Reed Elseviers performance throughout the 200406 performance period continued to show good revenue growth, continuous margin improvement, strong cash generation and growing returns on capital.
On average over the period, Reed Elsevier succeeded in delivering against its targeted adjusted earnings per share growth of a minimum of 10% at constant currencies.
Increasing profitability and capital discipline drove the post tax return on capital employed to 9.8% in 2006, which was 0.4 percentage points ahead of 2005.
This was the fifth successive year of growth in returns.
Acquisitions have continued to accelerate the strategy in e-health, legal solutions, risk management and business online, and are on track to deliver a return on capital in excess of Reed Elseviers weighted average cost of capital within three years, with good growth in returns expected thereafter.
The Remuneration Committee therefore considers that the adjusted EPS growth achieved is a fair reflection of the progress of the business and has approved that the average compound annual growth rate in adjusted EPS at constant exchange rates over the 200406 performance period is 10.17%, which means that 102.125% of the target awards will vest.

Following shareholders approval of the revised terms of the LTIS in 2006, the shareholding requirement for the Chief Executive Officer is now three times salary previously 1.5 times salary and for other executive directors is two times salary previously 1.5 times salary.
These increased shareholding requirements must be met by February 2009 at the latest.
Details of directors shareholdings, as at 31 December 2006, are set out on page 51.
41 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2006 f Service contracts Executive directors are employed under service contracts which generally provide for one years notice and neither specify a pre-determined level of severance payment nor contain specific provisions in respect of change in control.
The service contracts for executive directors and for approximately 130 other senior executives contain the following provisions: covenants which prevent them from working with specified competitors, recruiting Reed Elsevier employees and soliciting Reed Elsevier customers for a period of 12 months after leaving employment: in the event of their resigning, they will immediately lose all rights to any outstanding awards under the LTIS, ESOS and BIP granted from 2004 onwards, including any vested but unexercised options: and in the event that they were to join a specified competitor within 12 months of termination, any gains made in the six months prior to termination on the exercise or vesting of an LTIS, ESOS and BIP award made from 2004 onwards shall be repayable.
g Policy on external appointments The Committee believes that the experience gained by allowing executive directors to serve as non-executive directors on the boards of other organisations is of benefit to Reed Elsevier.
Accordingly, executive directors may, subject to the approval of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, serve as non-executive directors on the boards of up to two non-associated companies of which only one may be to the board of a major company and they may retain remuneration arising from such appointments.
Sir Crispin Davis is a non-executive director of GlaxoSmithKline plc and received a fee of 70,000 during 2006.
Erik Engstrom was a non-executive director of Eniro AB until 5 April 2006 and received a fee of SEK75,000 5,527 during 2006.
Andrew Prozes is a non-executive director of the Cott Corporation and received a fee of $56,000 30,435 during 2006.
Gerard van fide Aast is a non-executive director of OCE NV since 1 May 2006 and received a fee of a23,342 15,879 during 2006.
B. Non-executive directors a Policy Reed Elsevier seeks to recruit non-executive directors with the experience to contribute to the board of a dual-listed global business and with a balance of personal skills which will make a major contribution to the boards and their committee structures.
With the exception of G J fide Boer-Kruyt, who serves only on the supervisory board of Reed Elsevier NV, non-executive directors, including the Chairman, are appointed to the boards of Reed Elsevier Group plc, Reed Elsevier PLC and the supervisory board of Reed Elsevier NV.
Non-executive directors remuneration is determined by the three boards as appropriate to the director concerned.
The primary source for comparative market data is the practice of FTSE50 companies, although reference is also made to AEX companies.
Non-executive directors, including the Chairman, serve under letters of appointment, do not have contracts of service and are not entitled to notice of, or payments following, termination.
In 2005 the Reed Elsevier Group plc board introduced a charity donation matching programme for non-executive directors.
Under the policy, where a non-executive director donates all or part of their fees to a registered charity, the Company may, at its sole discretion, make a matching donation to any charity, provided the charitys objectives are judged to be appropriate and are not political or religious in nature.
Messrs Reid, Zelnick and van Lede each donated a proportion of their fees in respect of 2006 to charity and, in accordance with the programme, the Company made matching charitable donations of 22,500, 42,065 and 20,408, respectively.
42 Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report continued b Fee levels Non-executive directors receive one annual fee in respect of their memberships of the boards of Reed Elsevier PLC, Reed Elsevier NV and Reed Elsevier Group plc.
The fee paid to G J fide Boer-Kruyt, who serves only on the supervisory board of Reed Elsevier NV, reflects her time commitment to that company and to other companies within the Reed Elsevier combined businesses.
Non-executive directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending meetings.
They do not receive any performance related bonuses, pension provisions, share options or other forms of benefit.
Fees may be reviewed annually, although in practice they have changed on a less frequent basis and were last reviewed with effect from 1 May 2003.
The fee for Mrs fide Boer-Kruyt was last reviewed with effect from 1 January 2004.
Annual fee rates applicable to non-executive directors and to the Chairman are set out in the following table: Annual fee 2006 Annual fee 2005 Chairman g350,000 a350,000 Non-executive directors 45,000 g65,000 45,000 a65,000 Chairman of: Audit Committee 7,000 g12,000 7,000 a12,000 Remuneration Committee 7,000 g12,000 7,000 a12,000 C. Statutory disclosures a Report authorship This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee of Reed Elsevier Group plc.
It has been prepared in accordance with the UK Regulations and the Dutch Code issued in December 2003 in order to meet the requirements of the UK Combined Code of Corporate Governance issued in July 2003, the Dutch Code and the Netherlands Civil code.
b Remuneration committee constitution and terms of reference The Committee is responsible for: recommending to the boards the remuneration in all its forms of the Chairman and the executive directors, including terms of service contracts and all other terms and conditions of employment: providing advice to the Board and to the Chief Executive Officer on major policy issues affecting the remuneration of executives at a senior level below the board: and the operation of all share-based plans.
A copy of the Terms of Reference of the Committee can be found on the Reed Elsevier website www.
The Remuneration Committee met six times during the year.
Mr van Lede was unable to attend one meeting, otherwise there was full attendance.
c Advisors The Committee has appointed Towers Perrin, an external consultancy which has wide experience of executive remuneration in multinational companies, to advise in developing its performance-related remuneration policy.
Towers Perrin also provide actuarial and other Human Resources consultancy services directly to some Reed Elsevier companies.
The following individuals also provided material advice or services to the Committee during the year: Sir Crispin Davis Chief Executive Officer : Ian Fraser Group HR Director : and Philip Wills Director, Compensation and Benefits.
43 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2006 d Total Shareholder Return TSR As required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the following graphs show the Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV total shareholder return performance, assuming dividends were reinvested.
They compare the Reed Elsevier PLC performance with that achieved by the FTSE 100, and the Reed Elsevier NV performance with the performance achieved by the Euronext Amsterdam AEX Index, over the five year period from 20022006.
For the five year period since 1 January 2002, the TSR for Reed Elsevier PLC was 11%, against a FTSE 100 return of 39%.
For Reed Elsevier NV during the same period, TSR was 14%, against an AEX Index return of 16%.
As Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV are members of the FTSE 100 and AEX Index respectively, the Committee considers these indices to be appropriate for comparison purposes.
