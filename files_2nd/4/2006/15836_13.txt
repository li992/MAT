Topps Tiles Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 REMUNERATION REPORT INTRODUCTION This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of Directors remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.

The members of the committee are Mr. McIntosh, Mr. Watson and The RT.

Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibre needed to maintain the Groups position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors and senior management: basic annual salary including Directors fees and benefits: long-term incentive plan: annual bonus payments: and pension arrangements.
Basic salary An executive Directors basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparator group of companies.
Basic salaries were reviewed in September 2005 with increases taking effect from 30 September 2006.
Executive Directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
