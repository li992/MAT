There were no options exercised by current Executive Directors during 2006 or 2005.
No performance conditions are attached to options granted under this scheme as it is an all-employee share option scheme.
1 No variations were made to Directors options or the terms and conditions of any Directors options during the year 2006 or the period ended 19 February 2007.

com ICI Annual Report and Accounts 2006 51 Board of Directors, governance and remuneration Remuneration report continued 4 Grants under the Executive Share Option Plan in 2004 and 2005 were made subject to the following sliding scale performance conditions.
These Adjusted EPS target figures are after the required adjustments for the impact of IFRS accounting changes on the EPS targets as originally set under UK GAAP at the time of the grants.
The Remuneration Committee have ensured that these required adjustments were made on a fair and equitable basis.
Adjusted EPS targets in 2006 Adjusted EPS targets in 2007 Percentage of shares vesting for grants made in 2004 for grants made in 2005 33.3% 28.3p 31.7p 100% 34.7p 36.0p The performance condition for the 2006 grants requires average annual growth over three years of between RPI 4% per annum and RPI 8% per annum for between one third and 100% of the options to be exercisable respectively.
There is no retesting of the condition after the three-year performance period.
The percentage of shares vesting will be pro-rated, on a straight-line basis, between points on the above scales.
The performance condition for the awards made in 2004 was tested in February 2007 following the end of the requisite three-year period.
The Remuneration Committee concluded, after due consideration of the underlying performance of the Company, that the Adjusted EPS performance for 2006 of 31.6p will result in 67.7% of the awards granted to Executive Directors in 2004 becoming exercisable from their third anniversary.
The balance of the awards made in 2004, as set out in the above table detailing the individual grants, will lapse.
5 Grants made under the share option scheme in operation prior to 2004 were made subject to an EPS performance condition which requires that over a three-year period in the life of the option the growth in ICIs Adjusted EPS must be equal to, or greater than, the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum.
To test the condition against 2006 EPS, baseline EPS for 2003 is required on an IFRS basis.
The Remuneration Committee ensured that all appropriate factors were included in the adjustment and this resulted in the 2003 UK GAAP EPS before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation of 18.5p being adjusted to an IFRS Adjusted EPS baseline figure of 21.3p.
The 48% growth in 2006 Adjusted EPS from this baseline was significantly greater than the 19.5% growth required for the condition to be met.
The Remuneration Committee concluded, after due consideration of the underlying performance of the Company, that the vesting should be in accordance with the EPS condition.
All options granted between 1997 and 2003 have now therefore passed their performance conditions and are now exercisable.
The shares to fulfil options granted under this plan do not dilute ICIs issued share capital as they are bought in the market.
6 The earliest date from which an option is exercisable is subject to any outstanding performance condition being met.
7 In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the annual grant of share options made on 29 April 1999 to Executive Directors involved with the then proposed disposal of businesses to Huntsman ICI Holdings LLC was delayed.
As a result of this delay, those participants were granted fewer options at a higher exercise price than would have been the case had the grants been made to them at the same time as they were made to all other participants at an exercise price of 4.33.
The Remuneration Committee decided that those individuals so affected should receive the same gross gain at the time they exercise their options as if the grant had not been delayed.
8 Awards made under the US Stock Appreciation Rights plan and denominated in ADRs have been disclosed in terms of Ordinary Share option equivalents at the price of the ICI shares at the date of grant.
Any gain on exercise of these awards is delivered in the form of ADRs.
9 Under the Plan Rules for retirement that govern awards made to Mr Powell prior to 2004, the performance condition was waived and the Stock Appreciation Rights became exercisable in full for a period of two years.
For the option grant made in 2004 and 2005 the performance condition was not waived but tested early based on Adjusted EPS for the year prior to his retirement against the original EPS target figures.
As a result, all Stock Appreciation Rights awards made to Mr Powell in 2004 and 2005 lapsed on his retirement.
The award made in 2006 has also lapsed because, as at the date of retirement, less than 12 months of the performance period had elapsed.
Following his retirement, Mr Powell exercised SARs during 2006 over a total of 405,943 ADRs at a market price at exercise of US$30.02 with a weighted average SAR price at grant of US$15.14.

2 The accrued annual pension at the end of the year, payable at normal retirement age.
3 The transfer value calculations take into account the combined effect of notional interest and the individuals age which will typically increase transfer values by 8%-9% year on year.
Additional factors that impact the transfer values which are net of contributions by Directors over the year are changes in pensionable pay and the service of each Director, as well as changes in actuarial assumptions, particularly for equity and bond returns.
The increases in transfer values are in accordance with the rules of the relevant pension fund.
4 Dr McAdam and Mr Hamill are participants in Pensave, which is an all-employee arrangement related to pension contributions.
Employer and employee contributions for these executives are on a notional basis to exclude Pensave related adjustments.
5 Dr McAdam and Mr Knott participate in the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund.
Pensionable salary under this plan includes annual bonus, subject to a maximum of 20% of base salary for Dr McAdam and 15% of base salary for Mr Knott.
The pensionable element of bonus is particular to these two Executive Directors and reflects their terms of employment and continuous pensionable service prior to their transfer from Unilever to ICI in 1997, on the acquisition of certain specialty chemicals businesses.
This pensionable bonus element entitlement has been frozen since the time of transfer and has not been increased in line with promotion or increases in ICIs bonus levels.
In the event of voluntary early retirement for these two executives the accrued pension is reduced actuarially where the pension is drawn early.
For early retirement at the Companys request, in certain circumstances the Company has an established practice of allowing the Executive Director to draw the full accrued pension immediately.
6 Mr Hamill participates in the ICI UK Retirement Plan, a defined contribution plan, in respect of base salary up to a Company specified earnings cap currently 108,600 for 2006 7.
He also receives a retirement benefit allowance, payable in cash and subject to income tax, in respect of base salary above this cap.
This allowance is reported in the Directors emoluments table on page 49 and for the 2006 period totalled 96,645 2005 90,240.
7 Prior to his retirement from the company on 31 October 2006, Mr Powell participated in the National Starch and Chemical Company Pension Plan for Salaried Employees and the Supplementary Retirement and Savings Plan of National Starch and Chemical Company.
Under these Plans, pension is based on average pay, including annual bonus.
The figures in the above table for these plans, in accordance with the disclosure regulations, reflect Mr Powells service up to the date he retired from the company on 31 October 2006.
Mr Powell also participated in two defined contribution plans, for which the employers contributions are set out above up to the date he stepped down as a Director on 6 April 2006.
Mr Powells figures reflect not only the change in value of benefits but also movements in exchange rates used for the translation to Sterling.
The actual additional pension accrued in the year was US$20,277 and the actual transfer value increased over the year by US$119,297.
When translated into Sterling, the resulting reduction in pension accrued was 30,864, comprising 11,006 translating the US dollar additional pension into Sterling and a 41,870 exchange loss translating the closing accrual at a spot rate of 1 US$1.962 2005 1 US$1.723.
Similarly, the Sterling decrease in transfer value of accrued pension was 511,849, comprising 64,755 translating the US dollar movement into Sterling and 576,604 exchange loss translating the accrual at the differing spot rates at end 2005 and 2006.
8 Mr Brown participates in the ICI UK Retirement Plan only in respect of life insurance benefits for base salary up to a Company-specified earnings cap currently 108,600 for 2006 7.
No pension contributions are paid on his behalf.
Instead he receives a retirement benefit allowance, payable in cash and subject to income tax, in respect of full base salary.
This allowance is reported in the Directors emoluments table on page 49 and for 2006 totalled 123,508.
9 The Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority require disclosure above and beyond that set out in the Companies Act.
Specifically the following disclosures for defined benefit plans which are calculated on an alternative basis to those disclosed in the table above.
Additional annual pension accrued in 2006 net of inflation : Dr McAdam 51,600: Mr Knott 7,330: Mr Powell 31.
Transfer values at 31 December 2006 of the increase in accrued pension net of inflation and contributions by the Director : Dr McAdam 889,800: Mr Knott 73,700: Mr Powell 512.
The calculation for Dr McAdam includes pension contributions on a notional basis due to Pensave.
com ICI Annual Report and Accounts 2006 53 Board of Directors, governance and remuneration Remuneration report continued UK Inland Revenue pensions simplification tax regime The Remuneration Committee has agreed ICIs approach in response to the UK pensions simplification legislation, which became effective on 6 April 2006, for those Executive Directors who are members of UK pension plans.
Such Executive Directors were given the option of either: maintaining the existing pension arrangement, in which case the executive would take personal responsibility for any additional taxation arising, or ceasing to accrue pension benefits in respect of future service and instead receiving a cash retirement benefit allowance, subject to income taxation.
Past service benefits would remain linked to future salary increases.
This cash alternative is in line with ICIs defined contribution benefits policy and the level of retirement benefit allowance payable will be in line with existing Company contribution rates to the ICI UK defined contribution plan.
These arrangements will not increase the cost to the Group of pension provision.
