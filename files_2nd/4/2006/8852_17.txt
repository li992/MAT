Pensions Pensions and life assurance benefits for the executive directors are provided through the companys final salary occupational pension scheme for UK employees the Johnson Matthey Employees Pension Scheme JMEPS which is constituted under a separate Trust Deed.
JMEPS is an exempt approved scheme under Chapter I of Part XIV of the Income & Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
It is an authorised scheme for the purposes of the Finance Act 2004.
Members are contracted out of the State Second Pension.
Pension and life assurance benefits for Mr Pentz for the period up to 31st December 2005 were provided through the Johnson Matthey Inc.
Salaried Employees Pension Plan for employees in the United States, and a separate Senior Executive Retirement Plan.
From 1st January 2006, following his transfer to the UK, these benefits have been provided through JMEPS.
The Finance Act 2004 introduced changes to the taxation of benefits payable from authorised UK pension schemes.
The changes were effective from 6th April 2006.
Unless protected under transitional arrangements, retirement benefits that exceed a capital value called the Life Time Allowance will be subject to an additional tax charge.
Any such tax charge arising out of membership of JMEPS will be paid by the member at the point of retirement and benefits will be reduced accordingly.
Executive directors whose retirement benefits are valued in excess of the Life Time Allowance may withdraw from service in JMEPS and receive an annual payment of 25% of basic salary instead.
This payment is commensurate with the cost to the company of providing JMEPS benefits.
The Act also enables authorised schemes to remove the restriction imposed by the earnings cap under the Finance Act No.
Disclosure of directors pension benefits has been made under the requirements of the United Kingdom Listing Authority Listing Rules and in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The information below sets out the disclosures under the two sets of requirements.

In accordance with the JMEPS rules, Mr Pentz started contributing on 1st January 2006.
2 The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase for inflation.
3 The entitlement shown under Total accrued pension at 31st March 2006 is the pension which would be paid annually on retirement, based on pensionable service to 31st March 2006.
The pension would, however, be subject to an actuarial reduction of 0.3% per month for each month that retirement precedes age 60.
4 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note 11, less directors contributions.
No allowance has been made in the transfer values for any discretionary benefits that have been or may be awarded under JMEPS.
The transfer values in the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 have been calculated at the start and the end of the year and, therefore, take account of market movements.
5 The JMEPS benefits and contributions for Messrs Morgan and Sheldrick in respect of service up to 5th April 2006 are restricted by reference to the earnings cap imposed by the Finance Act No.
Contributions have therefore been paid to Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Schemes FURBS established by the company, independently of JMEPS, with effect from 1st April 2000.
The purpose of each FURBS is to provide retirement and death benefits in relation to basic salary in excess of the earnings cap.
Because FURBS are not exempt approved under Chapter I of Part XIV of the Income & Corporation Taxes Act 1988, payments have been made to meet the tax liabilities in respect of these contributions.
No FURBS payments will be made after 5th April 2006.
Benefits in respect of service from 6th April 2006 will be provided by JMEPS in accordance with the normal scheme rules.
6 Mr Pentz is a US citizen but became a member of JMEPS on 1st January 2006.
Prior to that he was a member of the Johnson Matthey Inc.
Salaried Employees Pension Plan a non-contributory defined benefit arrangement and a US savings plan 401k.
He also has benefits in a Senior Executive Retirement Plan.
The pension values reported above are the aggregate for his separate membership of the UK and US pension schemes and the Senior Executive Retirement Plan.
US entitlements have been converted to sterling by reference to exchange rates on 31st March 2005 and 31st March 2006.
The companys contributions to the US savings plan 401k for the period up to 31st December 2005 are included in his benefits in the table on page 47.
