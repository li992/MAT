Directors Remuneration Report For the year ended 1 October 2006 The following is a report by the Remuneration Committee the Committee which has been approved by the Board of Britvic plc for submission to shareholders.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
It provides the Companys statement of how it has applied the principles of good governance relating to Directors remuneration and is intended to communicate Britvics policies and practices on executive remuneration to the Companys major shareholders and relevant institutions.
In accordance with the Companies Act 1985, a resolution will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting to approve the Directors Remuneration Report.
Membership of Remuneration Committee Since flotation in December 2005, the Committee consisted wholly of independent Non-Executive Directors: Chris Bulmer Chairman of the Committee, Bob Ivell and Michael Shallow.
At the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer and Human Resources Director attend the meetings of the Committee except when their own remuneration is under consideration.
Details of the attendance by Committee Members at Committee Meetings are shown in the Corporate Governance Report on page 30.
Composition and terms of reference The Committees composition and terms of reference are in line with the Combined Code and are available on the Companys website or on request.
The Committee meets not less than three times a year and has responsibility for: i making recommendations to the Board on the Groups policy on the remuneration of the Companys Chief Executive, Chairman, the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and other members of the Executive Committee: ii the determination, within agreed terms of reference, of the remuneration of the Chairman and of specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee, including pension rights, any compensation payments and benefits: and iii the determination of awards under the Companys employee share plans to the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and other members of the Executive Committee.
The Committee also ensures compliance with the Combined Code in this respect.
Advisors The Committee has appointed an external consultant, Towers Perrin, to advise on executive compensation issues and in developing its performance-related remuneration policy.
The following individuals also provide material advice or services to the Committee during the year: Paul Moody Chief Executive : Doug Frost Human Resources Director : and Michael Mountford Head of Compensation & Benefits.
Remuneration Policy The remuneration policy with respect to Executive Directors has been designed to provide market competitive remuneration relative to UK-listed companies of similar size and scope.
The Company believes that in order to meet its remuneration objectives, the remuneration of Executive Directors should comprise a balance between fixed and variable performance-related pay elements with the predominant proportion of potential reward being linked to performance.
As a result, for superior performance, approximately two thirds of total remuneration is performance-related.
For target performance, approximately 53 per cent of total remuneration is performance-related.
The Committee constantly reviews remuneration policy to ensure that it is sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in Britvics business operations and environment and recognises key developments in remuneration practice and alignment to shareholder interests.
Consequently, the policy set out in this report has applied during 2005 6 and, subject to the changes to the annual incentive arrangement described below, will apply in 2006 7.
Remuneration Objectives The principal objective of the remuneration policy is to provide market competitive levels of remuneration, including incentive arrangements, which will reward successful execution of the Company's short and long-term strategy.
The Committee believes that this requires: The provision of mid-market base salaries and incentive levels for the sector, with appropriate leverage to reward sustained exceptional performance and support the future growth aspirations of the Company.
A reward structure that initially places an equal emphasis on short-term and long-term performance in the early period post IPO to support operating performance and reward sustained longer-term performance.
Incentive arrangements that are underpinned by a balance of operational and market-related performance metrics to provide both a focus on business performance and alignment with returns to the Company's shareholders.

Directors salaries are benchmarked against a selected peer group of UK companies with similar levels of revenue.
The salaries of other members of the Executive Committee are benchmarked against a selected group of major companies in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods FMCG and Retail sectors, where the Committee sees the primary market for talent at this level.
Short-Term Incentive Plan Targets are approved by the Committee at the beginning of the year and are aligned to internal targets and strategic business objectives for 2005 6.
Up to 60 per cent of salary for the Chief Executive and 50 per cent of salary for the Finance Director is payable for the achievement of target PBT and EPS performance on a 50 50 basis.
Up to a maximum of 120 per cent and 100 per cent of salary is payable for the achievement of exceptional performance targets for the Chief Executive and Finance Director, respectively.
For 2005 6, no bonus was earned by the Chief Executive and Finance Director as threshold levels of PBT and EPS performance were not achieved.
For 2006 7 the Committee decided to reinforce and support the business objective of revenue growth and cash generation by replacing the EPS performance measure with two new performance measures, one relating to Net Revenue growth and the other relating to effective cash flow.
These new elements will be combined with PBT on a 25 25 50 basis.
The target and maximum incentive opportunities will remain the same.
Target bonuses will be paid for achievement of performance measures based on free cash flow, Net Revenue growth and PBT set at appropriately stretching levels.
Executive Share Option Plan Annual grants of options are made at the discretion of the Board over shares in Britvic plc at the market price at date of grant to senior executives 21 in 2005 06.
The level of option grant and the performance conditions are determined and reviewed by the Committee annually.
For 2005 6 and thereafter the current policy is to grant the options over shares worth 200 per cent and 150 per cent of annual salary to the Chief Executive and Finance Director, respectively.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
A performance condition is applied such that 40 per cent of the grant vests for the achievement of EPS growth over the three-year performance period equivalent to RPI 3 per cent per annum.
No awards will vest below this threshold level of performance.
For achievement of EPS growth equivalent to RPI 7 per cent per annum over the same period, 100 per cent of the grant will vest, with straight-line vesting between threshold and maximum.
Options lapse to the extent that the performance condition is not achieved.
32 Britvic plc Annual Report 2006 Remuneration in Practice continued Performance Share Plan Annual grants of performance shares are made at the discretion of the Board to approximately 90 senior executives and managers.
The awards normally vest at the end of the three-year performance period, to the extent that the performance condition is achieved, and lapse to the extent it is not achieved.
For 2005 6 and thereafter the current policy is to grant the equivalent of 50 per cent of annual salary to Executive Directors, calculated on the basis of the market price at the date of grant.
For awards to vest in full under this plan, Britvics TSR must rank in the top quartile of the peer group of the following 22 similar sector companies over the same period.
AG BARR Northern Foods Arla Foods Premier Foods Associated British Foods Reckitt Benckiser C&C Group RHM Cadbury Schweppes SABMiller Dairy Crest Scottish & Newcastle Diageo Smith & Nephew Fuller Smith SSL International Greene King Tate & Lyle IAWS Group Uniq Nichols Wolverhampton & Dudley No awards will vest for performance below median, with 40 per cent of the award vesting at median rising to 100 per cent at upper quartile on a straight-line basis.
For 2006 7, it is proposed that the same peer group of companies will be used.
Shareholding guidelines In accordance with best practice and further to align the interests of Executive Directors and shareholders, a shareholding guideline is in place.
The guideline requires Executive Directors to acquire a shareholding equal to their annual salary within 5 years from IPO calculated at the IPO share price.
Until this holding is acquired, the Executive Directors may not sell any shares, other than to finance the cost of exercising options and any tax liabilities arising from the vesting of long-term incentives plans, unless approved by the Committee, for example, in cases of financial hardship.
Retirement benefits The Executive Directors currently participate in a defined benefit pension arrangement which broadly provides a pension of two thirds of final salary along with life assurance, ill health and dependants' pensions.
The retirement age for Executive Directors is 60.
Bonus payouts or other incentive awards are not pensionable.
Prior to the legislative changes on 6 April 2006 A-Day, the Company operated an unfunded, unapproved retirement benefits scheme to provide pension benefits above the previous HM Revenue and Customs HMRC earnings cap.
Post A-Day, this earnings cap has been removed for future service within the main Britvic Pension Plan and the Executive Directors continue to participate in the defined benefit section of the Plan.
For pre A-Day service the earnings cap is maintained and will be indexed by inflation in line with Treasury notification.
The unfunded, unapproved retirement benefits scheme is maintained to provided pension benefits above the earnings cap for pre A-Day service and to provide benefits above the new Lifetime Allowance for post A-Day service.
The defined benefit section of the Britvic Pension Plan is closed to new entrants.
All new entrants are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Plan with similar life assurance, ill health and dependants pensions.
Other benefits Executive Directors receive an annual car benefit or allowance and private medical insurance.
