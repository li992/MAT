50 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc SERVICE CONTRACTS To re ect current market practice, it is the Committees policy that executive directors have service contracts that provide for a notice period for termination of up to 12 months.
The Committee has established a mitigation policy in the event of early termination of a directors contract where the contract does not contain a liquidated damages clause.
The Committees aim will be to avoid rewarding poor performance.

51 Annual Report & Accounts 2006 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT PERFORMANCE GRAPH The graph below illustrates the performance of the Company and a broad equity market index over the past five years.
As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE All Share Travel and Leisure Index, the directors consider this index to be the most appropriate broad equity market index against which the Companys performance should be compared.
Performance is measured by Total Shareholder Return share price growth plus dividends reinvested.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN Source: Datastream The graph shows the value, by the end of 2006, of 100 invested in Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc on 31 December 2001 compared with 100 invested in the FTSE All Share Travel & Leisure Index.
The other points plotted are the values at the financial year-ends.
AUDITED INFORMATION Share Options i Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Executive Share Option Scheme No further options have been granted under the Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Executive Share Option Scheme the 1996 Scheme.
Options outstanding under the 1996 Scheme may be exercised if the Companys earnings per share increases over a three year period by the Retail Price Index plus 6%.
ii Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme The Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2003 Scheme provides for the grant of both approved and unapproved options.
Under the 2003 Scheme options over shares worth up to two times base salary may be granted each year although, in exceptional circumstances, such as in a recruitment situation, this limit is four times base salary.
The size of actual option awards will be determined by the Committee, which will take into account a number of factors, including the financial performance of the Group and the successful attainment of speci ed objectives.
52 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc The exercise of options, granted under the 2003 Scheme, is subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets.
Earnings per share EPS targets have been chosen as the Committee believes that participants in the 2003 Scheme should be incentivised to deliver signi cant earnings growth which, in turn, should return substantial shareholder value.
The performance condition applying to the exercise of options granted in 2003 requires the Companys EPS to grow, in real terms, from a notional base gure of 17.8p, over a period of at least three consecutive financial years after grant measured from a xed base.
To the extent that the performance condition is not satis ed by the fifth anniversary of grant, the options will lapse.
Following consultation with major shareholders in early 2004, it was agreed that for options granted in 2004 and subsequent years, the notional base EPS gure will be 15p and that options granted from 2004 onwards will not be subject to re-testing and to the extent that performance conditions are not satis ed by the third anniversary of grant the options will lapse.
The EPS base gure used for options granted in 2005 was the Groups pre-exceptional EPS gure for 2004 of 15.3p.
Subject to the rules of the 2003 Scheme, options will become exercisable as follows: EPS growth target Proportion of option exercisable EPS growth of less than an average of RPI plus 3% per annum 0% EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 3% per annum 25% EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 3% per annum to 10% per annum 25% 100% pro-rated EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 10% per annum or more 100% In determining the extent to which if at all the EPS targets are achieved, the Committee believes that the most appropriate approach is for the calculations to be undertaken internally and then veri ed by an independent third party.
The base EPS gures for grants made in 2003, 2004 and 2005 were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
Following the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, the Committee now arranges for EPS gures prepared under IFRSs to be recalculated to a UK GAAP basis, as necessary, so that true like for like growth comparisons are made.
iii Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Long-Term Incentive Plan The Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP was approved at the Annual General Meeting in 2006.
Under the terms of the LTIP, the Company is permitted to make both Performance Share Awards and Deferred Share Bonus Awards.
The level of awards made under the terms of the LTIP are determined by the Committee.
Vesting of Performance Share Awards is subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets.
Consistent with the performance measures for the Companys executive share options schemes, EPS targets have been chosen so that participants are incentivised to deliver signi cant earnings growth which, in turn, should return substantial shareholder value.
The performance condition applying to Performance Share Awards require the Companys EPS to grow, in real terms, over a period of three consecutive financial years after award.
Performance Share Awards will vest on the third anniversary of the award being made, subject to the vesting schedule shown in the table below.
Awards will not be subject to re-testing.
EPS growth target Proportion of award vesting EPS growth of less than an average of RPI plus 5% per annum 0% EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 5% per annum 25% EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 5% per annum to 13.5% per annum 25% 100% pro-rated EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 13.5% per annum or more 100% No awards of Deferred Share Bonus Awards were made during the year.
iv Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Sharesave Scheme The Company also operates the Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Sharesave Scheme the Sharesave which is an Inland Revenue approved scheme and under which the UK-based executive directors and Group employees are eligible to participate.
All awards made under the Companys share schemes conform to institutional dilution guidelines.

PENSIONS Mr Tony Potter participated in a contributory fide ned bene t pension plan, designed to provide up to two-thirds of his final salary subject to Inland Revenue limits at age 65, plus a spouses death in retirement pension of two-thirds of the pension payable at date of death.
In addition, death-in-service bene ts were provided comprising a lump sum bene t of four times salary at date of death.
The Companys pension contribution to the scheme was 20.6% of pensionable salary until April 2006 when the contribution rate reduced to 20.5% of pensionable salary.
As Mr Potter entered service after 31 May 1989 the bene ts provided to him by the Companys pension scheme were restricted by the operation of the earnings cap.
After the introduction of provisions of the Pensions Act 2004 in April 2006, the UK fide ned bene t scheme retained an earnings cap which is to be increased each year in line with the retail price index.
For base salary in excess of the schemes cap, Mr Potter had the options to either receive a salary supplement equal to the Companys pension contribution rate in excess of the earnings cap or for the Company to make equivalent contributions on his behalf into the Groups UK fide ned contribution pension plan or a personal pension arrangement.
A salary supplement of 20.6% of base salary above the earnings cap was paid during the year up until 1 April 2006 and 20.5% up until the date of his resignation on 27 October 2006.
