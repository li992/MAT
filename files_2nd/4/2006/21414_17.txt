Directors remuneration report Consideration of matters relating to directors remuneration The remuneration policy is set by the board and is described below.
Individual remuneration packages of executive directors and the chairman are determined by the remuneration committee within the framework of this policy.
The remuneration committee consists of the non-executive directors and during the year the members included Dudley Fishburn as chairman, Andy Pomfret, Joe Sargent, Tom Sullivan, Dan Jones and Gordon Hamilton.
Details of the changes to the membership of the committee during the year are set out below.
The company views each of these directors as independent.
The committee met eight times during the year.
The committee receives advice from a variety of sources on issues where it considers it appropriate.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP advised the committee on ongoing issues.
The committee also calls on specialist advice from a variety of additional sources including Capita Hartshead Ltd for pensions advice, Watson Wyatt publications for salary data, The Share Option Centre, and internal advisers including the chief executive and the company secretary who present to the committee on specic issues.
Remuneration policy statement The directors believe that performance-related remuneration is an essential motivation to management and staff, and this policy will form the basis for determining executive directors remuneration for the current and forthcoming financial years.
The general philosophy underlying the reward strategy for executive directors is the same as that applied to all other employees.
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and data on comparable positions in other similar organisations are taken into consideration when determining executive directors remuneration.
The companys policy is to remunerate the executive directors and other management fairly in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualied personnel.
The measurement of the executive directors performance and the determination of their annual remuneration package is undertaken by the remuneration committee.
The main elements of the remuneration package payable under the service agreement of each executive director comprise basic salary, short-term incentive payments, pension contributions, sharebased incentives and other benets.
Other benets include private medical insurance for the director and his immediate family, permanent health insurance, death in service benefit at four times annual salary, accident and travel insurance, healthclub membership, season ticket, car parking and the provision of either a company car or a monthly car allowance.
In line with Lloyds market practice there are no upper limits on the amounts payable to individuals under short-term incentives.
The committee has considered whether it is appropriate to set an upper limit and has recently agreed that such a limit would adversely affect the companys competitive position and would not be in the interests of shareholders.
The incentive payments, which comprise short-term incentive payments and share incentive plans, are awarded on a discretionary basis, and are determined by the committee in respect of performance of both the individual and the company.
As the profitability of the group has improved signicantly during the year, the committee was able to reect this improved performance in the incentive awards made to directors.
The policy is to ensure that a material proportion of each executive directors overall remuneration is performance based to align executive directors interests with those of shareholders.
The board, on a bi-annual basis, determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors with details set out below.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The directors believe that a key element of the remuneration strategy is the share incentive plans that further align the interests of participants in the plans with shareholders interests.
Entitlements under certain plans are subject to the achievement of performance conditions as described below under share incentive plans.
Section headings marked indicate the information in that section that has been audited.
Service contracts The company has service contracts with executive directors.
It is company policy that such contracts contain notice periods of not more than 12 months.
Details of the contracts currently in place for executive directors who have served during the year and their basic salary for 2007 are as follows: Annual salary Provision for Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period compensation A F Beazley 450,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil N H Furlonge 225,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil J G Gray 285,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil D A Horton 280,000 1 Jun 2003 n a 12 months Nil N P Maidment 260,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil J G B Rowell 400,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil C A Washbourn 260,000 6 Dec 2006 n a 12 months Nil The unexpired term is not applicable as each of the executive directors contracts is on a rolling basis.
C A Washbourn was appointed on 4 December 2006.
Beazley Annual Report 2006 37 Directors remuneration report continued Subject to the notice requirements described on page 37, there is no provision in the service agreements for compensation to be payable on early termination of the contract.
The company will normally phase any payments of compensation which will also be subject to negotiation and mitigation.
Non-executive directors The fees of non-executive directors, other than the chairman, are determined by the board.
When setting fee levels consideration is given to levels in comparable companies for comparable services.
No non-executive director participates in the companys incentive arrangements or pension plan.
Non-executive directors are appointed for xed terms, normally for three years, and may be reappointed for future terms.
Non-executive directors are typically appointed through a selection process that includes the candidate bringing the desired competence and skills to the group.
The board has identied several key competencies for non-executive directors to complement the existing skill-set of the executive directors.
These competencies are as follows: Insurance sector expertise: Asset management skills: Public company and corporate governance experience: Risk management skills: and Finance skills.
During the year the following non-executive directors resigned and were appointed to ensure that the board comprises sufficient non-executive directors to provide all these key competencies.
Following both the inclusion of the company within the FTSE 250 index in September 2006 and the appointment of Clive Washbourn as an executive director, the appointment of a further non-executive director will be considered.
Date of resignation or appointment J D Sargent Resignation 31 Oct 2006 T F Sullivan Resignation 31 Oct 2006 D L Jones Appointment 1 Jul 2006 W M Becker Appointment 8 May 2006 A G K Hamilton Appointment 8 Sep 2006 A bi-annual review of the fees and other income payable was carried out by the board in December 2006.
Details of the non-executive directors terms of appointment and their fees for 2007 are set out below: Current annual fees Term of Other income appointment Expires J G W Agnew 75,000 3 years 31 Dec 2008 J D Fishburn 42,000 3 years 31 Dec 2008 7,000 A D Pomfret 42,000 3 years 31 Dec 2008 14,000 D L Jones 42,000 3 years 30 Jun 2009 W M Becker 42,000 3 years 7 May 2009 A G K Hamilton 42,000 3 years 7 Sep 2009 Other income relates to the additional fee payable to A D Pomfret in respect of his chairmanship of the audit committee and as senior non-executive director and to J D Fishburn in respect of his chairmanship of the remuneration committee.
During the year non-executive directors were entitled to between 5,000 and 8,000 per annum in respect of the chairmanship of a committee.
2 The benets comprise those detailed in the service contracts of the executive directors and relate to the standard benets such as private medical insurance, car allowance, etc.
3 Salary, benets and pension contributions have been disclosed from 4 December 2006, Clive Washbourns date of appointment to the board.
4 The directors have deferred bonus entitlements to support their underwriting through Beazley Staff Underwriting Limited.
Salary The remuneration committee reviews salaries annually taking into account levels in comparable positions in other similar financial companies.
It also considers the performance of the group, individual and average salary increases for employees across the whole group.
The salaries of Messrs Beazley and Rowell have been increased signicantly during the year as the committee believes that increasing competitive pressures make it necessary and that it is in the best interests of shareholders for the salaries of these individuals to be in line with the top quartile of the salaries of directors of comparable companies at the current time.
Short-term incentives Enterprise bonus pool Since listing, the total pool available for distribution to participants under the enterprise pool equals 5.83% of the profits of the syndicates as reported on an annual accounting basis.
So, for 2006 the pool contains profits from the 2004, 2005 and 2006 years of account.
During the year the committee reviewed the operation of the short-term incentive scheme to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.
It concluded that a scheme based on achieving stretching target returns on group equity with minimum hurdles to be met better aligned the interests of directors and staff with shareholders.
A proportion of this pool is allocated among executive directors at the discretion of the committee.
In determining the award levels, the committee had regard to both methods of establishing the enterprise pool and as both the groups return on equity and syndicate profitability has improved, the level of awards made were increased.
In addition, a proportion of any award can be paid in deferred shares that will vest after three years dependent only on continued employment.
Retention plan In addition to the 5.83% of syndicate profits that make up the enterprise bonus pool, senior executives will be eligible to receive conditional awards of ordinary shares under the retention plan.
The retention plan is operated on a discretionary basis based on performance to ensure key individuals have an adequate retention package and the first grant of awards was made in April 2005.
The remuneration committee has concluded that the award of retention shares should be targeted at key staff where retention is essential to the business and that executive directors who already have significant shareholdings are unlikely to be awarded retention shares in the future as additional awards of ordinary shares are unlikely to further align their interests with shareholders.
The total number of shares awarded to date has been 5,530,937 of which 5,015,426 ordinary shares are held by the employee benefit trust.
Beazley Annual Report 2006 39 Directors remuneration report continued Special award of retention shares to Clive Washbourn On 4 December 2006 the committee awarded 1 million retention shares to Clive Washbourn at the time of his appointment to the board, which was in excess of the grants allowed under the existing scheme.
The committee felt it was necessary to provide this meaningful incentive to retain his services in the longer term in the current climate.
15% of the shares awarded shall become transferable to Clive Washbourn on or following the announcement of results for the financial year of the company ending 31 December 2008.
Thereafter, 15% of the total outstanding shares held under the scheme shall become transferable on or following the announcement of the companys results for each subsequent financial year, subject to Clive remaining a director or employee within the companys group.
Dividends on shares still subject to retention will be rolled up and paid from the announcement of the results for the year ending 31 December 2008 and thereafter whenever dividends are paid to shareholders.
The award will be forfeited if Clive Washbourn ceases to be an employee or director of the companys group unless he ceases by reason of injury, ill-health or permanent disability, retirement, redundancy, the sale or transfer of his employing company or business out of the companys group, or any other reason permitted by the remuneration committee.
In these circumstances, the award will vest early to the extent and on such terms determined by the remuneration committee.
In the event of a takeover not being an internal corporate reorganisation or the voluntary winding-up of the company, the award will vest early.
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, awards may be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding company.
No payment is required on the grant of the award.
The award is not transferable, except on death.
The award is not pensionable.
The award is over shares held by the companys employee benefit trust and does not confer any shareholder rights until shares are transferred.
In the event of any variation of the companys share capital, the remuneration committee may make such adjustment as it considers fair and reasonable to the number of shares subject to the award.
The remuneration committee may, at any time, amend this special award in any respect, provided that the prior approval of shareholders is obtained for any amendments that are to the advantage of Clive Washbourn in respect of the terms applying to the size of his award and the basis for determining his entitlement to, and the terms of, the shares and the adjustment of his award.
This prior approval will not, however, apply to any minor alteration made to benefit the administration of the award, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment.
Pensions All executive directors, except D A Horton, participated in the Beazley Furlonge Limited final salary pension scheme up to 31 March 2006.
This was a non-contributory final salary scheme subject to applicable Inland Revenue restrictions.
All executive directors, except A F Beazley and N H Furlonge, are subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap on pension entitlements.
This scheme provided significant contractual entitlements to pensions for employees including executive directors which left the company exposed to potentially very high and unpredictable liabilities.
Consequently, a decision was taken to close the scheme to new members with effect from 31 December 2002 and accruals for future service for all members of the scheme ceased from 31 March 2006.
The arrangements adopted on 1 April 2006 were devised to be on a cost-neutral basis to the company as well as reducing the longer term risk to the group.
Details of the entitlements for service accruals up to 31 March 2006 of those directors who participated in the final salary scheme during the year are as follows: Increase in Transfer value Transfer value Increase in Accrued accrued benets Increase in of A less of accrued transfer value benefit at excluding accrued benets directors benets at less directors 31 Dec 2006 ination A including ination contributions 31 Dec 2006 contributions A F Beazley 222,321 2,143 46,607 37,986 3,940,543 847,977 N H Furlonge 139,243 1,623 6,128 33,406 2,865,212 199,584 J G Gray 25,491 440 2,024 7,303 423,412 37,263 N P Maidment 29,401 440 2,268 5,004 334,085 26,098 J G B Rowell 25,961 440 1,908 3,462 306,023 22,991 C A Washbourn 13,762 440 1,295 5,415 169,496 16,364 The increase in the transfer value for the past service entitlement of A F Beazley and N H Furlonge reects the increase in pensionable salary, as an additional quarter years service has been accrued and as the discount rate and mortality assumptions used in the transfer value calculations have changed.
The company and the trustees of the scheme have agreed to accelerate the funding of the deficit of the scheme and the final tranche of an additional 3m will be paid to fund the deficit shortly.
From 1 April 2006 pension benets for all staff have been by way of a dened contribution scheme arranged through Fidelity, which is noncontributory.
The salary supplements for the active final salary scheme members were based on the age of the individual and on the principle that there is no overall additional cost to the company.
No other pension provisions are made.
The normal retirement age for pension calculation purposes is 60 years.
A spouses pension is the equivalent of two-thirds of the members pension before any commutation payable on the members death after retirement.
40 Beazley Annual Report 2006 Share incentive plans The company operates a variety of long-term, share-based incentives including a pre-IPO plan now closed, tax-approved and unapproved option plans, a long-term incentive plan LTIP and a save-as-you-earn SAYE scheme, which are detailed below.
In 2005 it was agreed that in the future share option grants other than those under the Beazley SAYE scheme which have substantial tax advantages for participants are to be made only in exceptional circumstances, e. g. recruitment, when the terms of those share options will reect best practice prevailing at that time.
In particular, there will be no retesting of performance conditions on those grants.
Existing options will be honoured and allowed to run their full course.
The LTIP Participation in the LTIP is restricted to employees and full-time executive directors of the Beazley Group.
Participants are selected on a discretionary basis, and receive awards of free shares in the form of a nil-cost option, thus, no exercise price is payable.
The options will normally be exercisable subject to meeting the performance conditions set out below and provided that the participant continues in the employment of the company at that date between the third and tenth anniversaries of grant.
The LTIP awards that were granted in May 2003 did not meet the performance criteria established and have therefore lapsed.
It is expected that the performance conditions in respect of the awards made in March 2004 will be met in part and therefore a proportion of the awards will vest.
The maximum normal levels of grants that may be made under the LTIP to one individual is one times salary in any financial year, measured by the value of ordinary shares put under award at the time of the award.
Dividends are not currently accrued on ordinary shares prior to vesting and the number of shares awarded is not therefore adjusted.
The committee will keep this issue under review for future awards.
Awards are measured by TSR and net asset value NAV performance.
The company decided upon these measures as TSR aligns the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior TSR performance and NAV is a key measure of the companys financial performance.
The LTIP performance conditions were originally set when the scheme was established by board resolution on 6 November 2002.
The performance conditions were amended at an extraordinary general meeting on 14 March 2005 for grants made after that date.
2005 and Shares worth up to 50% of salary 50% of the Basic Shares will be received if NAV growth equals or is future awards Basic Shares greater than the risk-free rate of return plus 5% per year.
AND OR 25% of the Basic Shares will be received for median TSR performance and 50% of the Basic Shares will be received for upper quartile performance.
For performance between median and upper quartile the number of shares which can be received is determined on a straight-line basis.
Shares worth more than 50% of salary No Additional Shares will be received if NAV growth is less than the Additional Shares risk-free rate of return plus 5% per year.
50% of the Additional Shares will be received for a rate of outperformance of the risk-free rate of return plus 10% or more per year.
For out-performance of the risk-free rate of return of between plus 5% and plus 10%, the number of shares which will be received is determined on a straight-line basis.
AND OR No Additional Shares will be received if less than the upper quartile TSR performance is achieved.
50% of the Additional Shares will be received if top decile performance is achieved.
For performance between upper quartile and top decile performance, the number of shares which will be received is determined on a straight-line basis.
Awards up Shares can only be received if two If both conditions are met, 50% of the award vests at median to 2004 conditions are met: TSR performance, with full vesting at upper quartile performance.
For performance between median and upper quartile the number of a if NAV growth is greater than the risk-free shares which can be received is determined on a straight-line basis.
rate of return plus 5% per year AND b if TSR is at least median in the comparator group.
Beazley Annual Report 2006 41 Directors remuneration report continued The companys TSR growth is compared with that of members of a comparator group comprising 11 companies from the insurance sector the comparator group over a three-year period starting with the year in which the award is made.
The comparator group is dened as the Lloyds vehicles listed on the London Stock Exchange and includes the following companies for the 2006 awards: Alea Brit Insurance Hardy Kiln Amlin Catlin Group Highway Novae Group Atrium Chaucer Hiscox The comparator group changed from last year as Cox, Goshawk and Wellington are either no longer listed or not trading, SVB changed its name to Novae Group and Catlin and Alea have been introduced as these companies are now listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Details of entitlements under this plan, which are all subject to the above performance conditions, for directors who served during the period, are set out in the table on the next page.
No awards were exercised during the period as none has vested unconditionally since the first grant was made under this plan.
The pre-IPO plan Participation in the pre-IPO plan is restricted to employees and full-time executive directors of the Beazley Group.
Participants were selected on a discretionary basis.
No payment is required for the grant of an option.
All options under the pre-IPO plan were granted on 6 November 2002 and no further grants are anticipated.
The exercise price per ordinary share for this grant is 71.44p as adjusted for the 2004 rights issue, and options will normally be exercisable subject to meeting the performance conditions set out below between the third and the tenth anniversaries of grant.
The initial performance condition was not met during the three years following the grant of the options, being TSR growth of at least 100%.
As the performance target was not achieved within this period, the TSR target was increased by 10% per annum and only 75% of the options can vest if the target is achieved within the first year of the additional period.
This enhanced performance condition was met on 22 January 2007 and 75% of the awards have vested.
The above performance conditions were set when the scheme was established by board resolution on 6 November 2002.
These conditions were considered appropriate because a target TSR growth of 100%, while imposing a demanding requirement on the participants, would, if achieved, ensure that shareholders also receive attractive returns.
The unapproved share option plan Participation in the unapproved plan is restricted to employees and full-time executive directors of the Beazley Group, although it is the committees intention to only make awards under this plan in exceptional circumstances.
Participants are selected on a discretionary basis.
No payment is required for the grant of an option and the limit on grants when aggregated with awards under the LTIP is shares with a face value of one times salary or twice salary in exceptional circumstances.
Under both the approved and unapproved share option plans, options are subject to performance conditions and typically vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, provided that the participant has remained in employment up to that date.
The performance conditions require the companys NAV plus dividends per share growth to increase as follows over a three-year period: An option may be exercised over all ordinary shares under option if the cumulative growth in NAV plus dividends per share is equal to or exceeds the risk-free rate of return this being dened as the average yield of UK gilts with maturity dates within the next five years in the relevant period plus 10% per annum: An option may be exercised over half the ordinary shares under option if the cumulative growth in NAV plus dividends per share is equal to the risk-free rate of return plus 5% per annum: For performance where the cumulative growth in NAV plus dividends per share equals a number between the risk-free rate of return plus 5% and 10% per annum, the number of ordinary shares over which an option can be exercised will be calculated on a straight-line basis between these two points: If the option is not fully exercisable at the end of the three-year period, it will be re-tested once, on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, from a xed base.
The option is exercisable over whichever is the higher number of options vesting: and The option will lapse if NAV plus dividends per share performance is below the risk-free rate of return plus 5% per annum in both periods.
The performance conditions above were set when these plans were established by board resolution on 6 November 2002.
These performance conditions were considered to be appropriate as they impose demanding performance requirements, while ensuring that shareholders also receive attractive returns over the performance period.
It is expected that a proportion of the unapproved and approved options granted in 2003 and 2004 will vest following the announcement of the results for the year ended 31 December 2006 while the options awarded in 2002 have not met the performance criteria and have lapsed.
42 Beazley Annual Report 2006 The approved share option plan Participation in the approved plan is restricted to employees and full-time executive directors of the Beazley Group.
The terms and conditions are consistent with the unapproved plan, except that the plan has been approved by HMRC formerly known as the Inland Revenue.
SAYE scheme A SAYE scheme, administered by Yorkshire Bank plc, was launched in May 2003 for the benefit of staff.
The scheme rules were approved by HMRC.
The scheme offered a three-year savings contract period with options being offered at a price of 73p as adjusted for the 2004 rights issue for grants in 2003, 74p as adjusted for the 2004 rights issue for grants in 2004, 74p for grants in 2005 and 93p for grants in 2006, representing the maximum allowed discount of 20%.
Monthly contributions are made through payroll deduction directly to individual Yorkshire Bank accounts on behalf of participating employees.
All employees who had completed their probationary period prior to the closure of the invitation period were considered eligible to participate in the scheme.
Savings-related share option plan for US employees The Beazley Group plc savings-related share option plan for US employees the Plan permits all eligible US-based employees to purchase shares of Beazley Group at a discount of up to 15% to the shares fair market value.
The Plan is designed to comply with the terms of Section 423 of the US Internal Revenue Code.
A similar arrangement SAYE scheme is in place for UK-based Beazley Group employees.
Approval is being sought from shareholders for the adoption of this Plan.
Participants elect to participate by entering into a savings contract under which the participant agrees to have a portion of his or her compensation withheld in a savings plan for the purpose of exercising options granted under the Plan.
The maximum amount of compensation that may be withheld each month under all savings contracts for any participant may not exceed 250.
After a two-year period, participants may exercise their options to purchase Beazley shares at the exercise price.
The shares purchased are non-transferable for at least 12 months following exercise.
Unexercised options lapse 27 months after the date on which the options were granted.
Options may be exercised early in the event of an employees death or retirement, certain other cessations of employment and certain Beazley Group change in control events.
The Plan, by its terms, will terminate on 5 May 2016, which is the tenth anniversary of its adoption.
The share plans permit 10% of the companys share capital to be issued pursuant to options LTIP awards in a 10-year period.
Since November 2002, 30% of this allowance 3.0% has been allocated for option and LTIP awards.

The directors participate in the underwriting and have exposure to underwriting results either through direct involvements in NameCos or through participation in Beazley Staff Underwriting Limited that provides an indirect involvement in the results of the syndicate.
The majority of underwriters has an interest through this company and has agreed to defer future bonuses that will be at risk if the syndicate declares losses.
Annual general meeting A resolution will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting to be held on 3 May 2007 to approve this directors remuneration report.
