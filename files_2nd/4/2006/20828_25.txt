Increases in accrued pensions during an additional amount to that reported in the 2005 Directors remuneration the year exclude those due to inflation.
The transfer values of increases report as the relevant relative performance data was not available early during the year, and changes in total transfer values during the year, are enough in the year to be included in that report as is the case this year in shown before the effects of inflation and after deduction of the respect of 2004.
Long service awards are paid on a staff-wide basis and directors own contributions during the year.

Executive directors Performance Share Plan participations An outline of the Performance Share Plan, and of the basis of the No payments were made during the year in respect of any director participations granted, is set out in the Remuneration policies section leaving the Board or ceasing to be employed by the Group.
The options granted to the directors of the Company participating in this Plan are shown in the table below.
For this reason, the potential profit at the year end, which is stated as the market value of 325.25p per share at that date of all the shares over which options are outstanding, is hypothetical.

64 Amlin plc Annual Report 2006 Executive directors Capital Builder Plan participations Further to the descriptions of both the original and new Capital Builder Plans earlier in this report, the applicable classes and wider categories of underwriting business which will determine the rewards payable to each of the directors of the Company participating in both these Plans are as follows: Original Plan to 2005 New Plan from 2006 Class of business division syndicate Class of business Group B D Carpenter Fleet Fleet AIS division Other Motor Whole of Syndicate 2001 Package AIS liability classes lesser participations than in above classes Group A W Holt Catastrophe Catastrophe Risk Excess of Loss Risk Excess of Loss Marine Excess of Loss Marine Excess of Loss Total of Excess of Loss accounts Aviation Excess of Loss Non-marine division Other Non-marine classes generally Whole of Syndicate 2001 lesser participations than in above classes Group In the new Plan Amlin Bermuda Ltds underwriting is included, with different applicable percentage participations, in the results of those classes written in both the UK and Bermuda.
On the basis of the relevant estimated returns in respect of the 2001 to 2005 Lloyds years of account, the rewards of each of the directors in respect of the original Plan are currently estimated as shown in the table below.
50% of the total estimated reward was paid to participants in 2006 based on 31 December 2005 reserving.
50% of the balance, based on 31 December 2006 reserving, is payable in 2007 and the final balance, based on 31 December 2007 reserving, in 2008.
It is emphasised that the estimated payments in 2007 and the estimated balance payments given in the table could be reduced, or increased, both as a result of further detailed audit and by changes in the performance of relevant years of account resulting from reserving run-off development up to 31 December 2007.
Directors estimated Capital Builder Plan rewards for the 2001 to 2005 year of account performance period Estimated reward for 2001 to 2005 as at 31 December Estimated reward for 2001 to 2005, as reported in 2005 2005 as at 31 December 2006 Directors remuneration report Class division 000 000 B D Carpenter Class 1,173.4 1,061.3 AIS division 1,048.4 934.9 Syndicate 2001 200.6 186.5 Total 2,422.4 2,182.7 50% paid estimated payable in 2006 1,039.0 1,091.3 Presently estimated balance 1,383.4 Estimated payable in 2007 691.7 A W Holt Classes 887.3 1,010.7 Non-marine division 1,170.2 1,091.4 Syndicate 2001 501.5 466.2 Total 2,559.0 2,568.3 50% paid estimated payable in 2006 1,207.0 1,284.1 Presently estimated payment 1,352.0 Estimated payable in 2007 676.0 Amlin plc Annual Report 2006 65 Directors remuneration report In 2006 the first awards were made under the New CB Plan, in which the executive directors estimated rewards from the first year, based on reserving at 31 December 2006, were as follows: Directors estimated Capital Builder Plan rewards for the first year of 2006 to 2010 performance period Estimated reward for 2006 as at 31 December 2006 Class division 000 B D Carpenter Classes 118.8 Group 16.1 Total 134.9 A W Holt Classes 180.7 Group 24.1 Total 204.8 It is emphasised that the above are just the presently estimated rewards for the first underwriting year 2006 of a five year period 2006 to 2010.
They reflect the accrual in the Group accounts but, in view of the eventual rewards being over a five year performance period, as well as the early stage of the development of the 2006 underwriting year the estimates are speculative and should not be taken as indicative of the rewards likely eventually to be attributable to 2006.
The high and low during the year were 220p and 331.5p respectively.
These calculations are before tax and are theoretical as in many cases the relevant options were not exercisable at the year end.
Where indicated T1 and T2 indicate tranches of Amlin Scheme options with median and upper quartile relative TSR conditions respectively.
Other than grants of options, the only changes in directors options during the year resulted from the exercises set out above.
As well as options under the Amlin Schemes and the Sharesave Scheme, as described above, one director has an outstanding option under The Murray Lawrence Discretionary Share Option Scheme 1998 ML 1998.
This is not an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme.
Options were granted to selected employees and directors of the Murray Lawrence group in 1998, with a ten year life, prior to the merger of the Company with ML Bermuda Limited that year.
The options became options over the Companys shares following the merger.
The performance conditions of all of the options granted up to 2003, including the ML 1998 options, had been fully satisfied as at the start of 2006.
Those applying to the 2004 to 2006 grants are summarised in Remuneration policies above.
In respect of the grants made in 2006 the comparator group, in addition to Amlin, was: Atrium Underwriting, Beazley Group, BRIT Insurance Holdings, Catlin Group, Chaucer Holdings, Domestic & General Group, Hardy Underwriting Group, Highway Insurance Holdings, Hiscox, Kiln, Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Group, SVB Holdings now Novae and Wellington Underwriting.
68 Amlin plc Annual Report 2006 The performance against the primary conditions of those grants which had not vested by the start of 2006, which involve ranking the Companys TSR against that of a comparator group of Lloyds companies, in each case over the three year measurement period since grant, was as follows: Grant First normal exercise date Total shareholder return Ranking against return third anniversary of grant after three years performance 2003 grants 23 April 2006 152% 1st out of 15 2004 grants 29 March 2007 192% 1st out of 15 Accordingly, the Committee has confirmed that the primary conditions of the above grants of options, including those granted in 2004 which required top quartile performance, have been satisfied.
The Committee concluded during 2006 and in early 2007 that the secondary condition in respect of the 2003 and 2004 grants respectively, measured over the respective three year period, had been satisfied on first testing.
In reaching these conclusions the Committee had regard, amongst other factors, to the underlying earnings, returns on equity, and increases in net tangible assets per share, over the relevant periods.
Limits on potential issues of new shares The rules of the Amlin and Sharesave Scheme each include limits on the overall number of unissued shares over which options may be granted.
These are the Companys only employee schemes under which new shares are committed to be issued but, in the event that new shares were ever issued under any of the long term incentive plans described above not the present intention, or under the new SIP to be decided, such share issues would also be subject to the same limits.
Grants over new shares under the executive schemes and any selective long term incentive plan, after deducting any such options which have lapsed, are limited to 5% of the issued share capital in any 10 year period.
Grants over new shares under any scheme are also limited to 5% over five years and to 10% over 10 years.
At 31 December 2006, the numbers of shares, and percentages of the year end shares in issue, together with the equivalent percentage a year earlier, relating to each of these limits were as follows: Percentage of Percentage of Number of shares then in shares then in shares utilised issue utilised issue utilised 31 Dec 2006 31 Dec 2006 31 Dec 2005 Executive 5% limit over 10 years 20,523,043 3.84% 3.55% All schemes 5% limit over 5 years 15,223,785 2.85% 2.87% All schemes 10% limit over 10 years 23,626,764 4.42% 4.15% None of the schemes with any options currently outstanding require the payment of any consideration for the grant of options.
Adjustments to both numbers of shares under option and exercise prices were made in 2002 and 2005 to take account of the three share issues rights and open offers made in those years.
Total shareholder return performance The graphs below illustrate the total shareholder return performance of the Companys ordinary shares relative to two indices of which Amlins shares are a constituent, the FTSE 350 index and the FTSE All Share Insurance index, over the five years to 31 December 2006.
Comparisons are shown with both these indices as they were in previous years reports as the performance of Amlins shares is affected both by the general UK stock market in companies of its size and by its insurance sector.
The graphs show the values, at each year end from 2002 to 2006 inclusive, of 100 invested in the Companys shares on 31 December 2001 compared with the values of 100 invested in the relevant index on the same date.
To produce a fair value, each point on the graphs is the average of the relevant return Index over the 30 days preceding the relevant year end.

In terms of the make-up of each directors remuneration decided upon by the Committee during the year, the relevant measure relating to options is the value, at the date of grant, of the executive options granted during the year.
Using the same Black Scholes valuation method as used in the Companys financial statements as summarised in note 21 to the Accounts and assuming continuing employment, the theoretical values of the executive options granted are estimated as follows: Theoretical values of executive options granted in 2006 Theoretical value of Number of shares over Theoretical value on 2005 grants on their which executive options Exercise date of grant in 2006 date of grant granted in 2006 price per share 000 000 B D Carpenter 46,075 293.00p 15.8 13.1 R A Hextall 58,362 293.00p 20.0 13.9 A W Holt 55,904 293.00p 19.2 16.2 C E L Philipps 92,150 293.00p 31.6 18.9 Theoretical values at the date of the awards of the two participating directors Performance Share Plan awards, also calculated on the same basis as used in the Companys financial statements which in this case includes assumptions of continuing employment and that a 15% average ROE is achieved over the five year performance period, are as follows: Theoretical values of PSP awards made in 2006 Theoretical value of Number of shares over Theoretical value on 2005 grants on their which PSP options Share price date of grant in 2006 date of grant granted in 2006 on grant 000 000 R A Hextall 77,816 293.00p 146.0 97.0 C E L Philipps 153,584 293.00p 288.2 189.4 Non-executive directors fees, appointment and removal In line with the recommendations of the Combined Code, the fees paid to non-executive directors of the Company, other than the Chairman, are determined by the full Board.
The Board receives recommendations in this respect from a special committee chaired by the Chairman, with the Chief Executive and two other directors one executive and one non-executive, each of which usually changes each year as the other members.
Recommendations and decisions are made taking account of professional advice and other information on the level of such fees paid by comparable companies for comparable services.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by similar criteria, but by the Remuneration Committee.
The minimum time commitments given by each director, as detailed in the Board corporate governance statement, are also taken into account.
The Boards policy is that non-executive fees should be set by reference to the upper quartile of such fees paid by companies of similar size, on account of the above average complexity and regulatory responsibilities involved.
Each non-executive director is paid a basic fee and may be paid further for additional services, such as additional committee or subsidiary Board responsibilities.
Non-executive directors have contracts for services rather than employment contracts.
Their terms of appointment are formalised in letters of appointment, copies of which are available for inspection at the Companys registered office and which are updated from time to time.
They are appointed on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, usually for a three year term, and may be removed, or not nominated for re-election at the end of their term, in each case in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company.
The commencement and expected year of expiry of each of the non-executive directors current terms are as follows: Date of most recently amended Expected date of expiry Current term commenced letter of appointment of current term N J C Buchanan 25 May 2006 18 July 2006 AGM in 2009 R H Davey 25 May 2006 18 July 2006 AGM in 2009 R S Joslin 18 May 2005 18 July 2006 AGM in 2008 K T Kemp 18 May 2005 18 July 2006 AGM in 2008 R W Mylvaganam 18 May 2005 18 July 2006 AGM in 2008 R J Taylor 18 May 2005 7 August 2006 AGM in 2008 Sir Mark Wrightson Bt 25 May 2006 18 July 2006 AGM in 2009 If a non-executive director is not nominated or re-elected at the end of a term of office, the director is not entitled to any extra payment on termination.
In other circumstances three months notice of termination may be given by either side.
