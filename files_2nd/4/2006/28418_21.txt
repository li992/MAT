The award payout equals an initial award value adjusted by the Prudential plc share price change over the performance period.
In order for any award to be made under the 2005 plan, the growth rate over the performance period must be eight per cent per annum compound or greater.
At this level of performance, the initial award value is US$864,240.
If the on-target performance level of 11.5 per cent per annum compound is achieved the initial award value is doubled.
If the annual growth rate is at least 17.5 per cent, the payout increases to a maximum of three times the initial award value.
For performance between these points, payouts are on a straight-line sliding scale.
For the 2003 award, the results led to a payment of US$2,703,461.
The face values of the awards for Clark Manning are converted at the average exchange rate for 2006 which was US$1.8430 1 2005: US$1.8192 1.
For the 2004 Business Cash LTIP, the compound annual growth rate in appraisal value was 21.64 per cent and as a result a payment of US$4,028,896 was made.
Michael McLintock Michael McLintocks 2003, 2004 and 2005 cash long-term incentive awards were under the M&G Chief Executive Long Term Incentive Plan that provides a cash reward through phantom M&G share awards and options.
For these awards, the phantom share price at the beginning of the performance period was 1.
The change in the phantom share price equals the change in M&G profit, modified up or down by the investment performance of M&G, over the performance period.
For each year, the face value of the share award was 225,000 and the phantom option award had a face value of 367,800.
Provided the phantom share options have value, they may be exercised in part or in full during annual exercise periods after three to seven years from the start of the performance period.
For the 2003 award, the phantom share price at the end of the performance period was 2.03.
This resulted in a payment from the phantom share award of 456,750 and a phantom option award of 367,800 units.
Michael McLintock did not exercise any of these options.
For the 2004 award, the phantom share price at the end of the performance period was 2.59.
