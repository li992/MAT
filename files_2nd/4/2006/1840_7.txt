Remuneration Report Introduction This years remuneration report is presented to shareholders in accordance with the requirements of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
In preparing the report the Remuneration Committee has reviewed remuneration policy for executive directors and in so doing has reaffirmed its commitment to ensure that overall remuneration continues to be linked to organisational and individual performance and has a clear alignment with the interests of shareholders.
Remuneration Committee The Committee operates within terms of reference and governance policies approved by the Board and is responsible on behalf of the Board for: executive remuneration policy: determining the service conditions and remuneration of all executive directors: obtaining independent professional advice in relation to executive director remuneration: the evaluation of executive director performance with regard to the award of share options, annual bonus and other performance based remuneration.
During the year under review the Remuneration Committee has met on 2 occasions with all members present.
Membership and Proceedings of the Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee are all non-executive directors and during the year have comprised Mr A E Kilburn Chairman, Mr C G Toner, Mr M Pescod, Mr R J Davies, Mr R MacEachrane from his appointment on 1st May 2006 and Mr W Shannon from his appointment on 1st September 2005.
As reported earlier, Mr C G Toner stood down from membership of the Committee on 14th September 2005.
Accordingly, all Committee members are now considered to be wholly independent with no financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the Committees decisions.
The Group Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee as required but he is not present when matters affecting his own remuneration are considered.
Other than as expressly identified in this report the Remuneration Committee has complied with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Committee recognises its accountability on executive remuneration to shareholders through this report and in determining future remuneration policy it will consider both the shareholders vote on the report and views expressed by shareholders on the detail of the report.
Advice Advice is provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary, Mr L Dent, a practising solicitor.
Mr Dent also acts as secretary to the Committee.
In addition, Hay Group were appointed by the Committee to advise on a range of issues, including the current market positioning of the Groups executive remuneration having regard to a comparator group of other housebuilding companies, including Persimmon, George Wimpey, Taylor Woodrow and Bellway.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited have advised the Company in relation to various pensions issues and, with effect from 10th July 2004, were appointed to provide actuarial services to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
Remuneration Policy As detailed in last years remuneration report the Committee undertook a comprehensive review of executive remuneration during 2005 and a number of changes were implemented.
Following on from that review no major changes have been made this year to structure or policy as the Committee believes that executive remuneration: is fully aligned with the performance of the Company and the returns received by shareholders: rewards the sustained growth and profitability of the business: conforms with market-leading best practice.
29 Remuneration Report Central to the Group remuneration policy is recognition that the sustained growth and profitability of our business is determined in no short measure by the skill and commitment of the executive team.
The reward policy for executive directors seeks to provide remuneration and other service conditions which will attract, retain, motivate and reward executive directors of the highest calibre within the industrys highly competitive employment market.
Within these broad objectives the executive remuneration package is based on the following principles: the greater part of remuneration paid to executives should be linked to the achievement of performance targets: currently over 50% of the total executive remuneration package is performance based: performance related remuneration should align the interests of executives with those of shareholders by setting performance targets based on measures of shareholder return: total remuneration for outstanding performance should be competitive with that available elsewhere in the sector.
The Remuneration Package for Executive Directors The remuneration package for executive directors comprises: basic salary: annual performance related bonus: long-term share incentives: pension and other benefits.
Typically the performance related element of executive remuneration makes up more than 50% of the total package excluding pension benefits.
The performance conditions which apply to the performance related element of executive remuneration are the same for all executive directors and are set out in the following sections of this report.
Basic Salary Basic salaries for executive directors are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash.
Salaries are set having regard to individual responsibilities, skills and experience and are currently based on the market rate for similar positions in large national housebuilding companies.
Salaries were reviewed during the year by the Remuneration Committee and an increase of 3% was awarded, taking effect from 1st July 2006.
This increase is the same as that received by other employees within the Company.
Details are shown in the table below.
per Annum per Annum D A Pretty 522,725 1 July 2005: 507,000 S J Boyes 309,000 1 July 2005: 300,000 C Fenton 309,000 1 July 2005: 300,000 G K Hester 309,000 1 July 2005: 300,000 M A Pain 309,000 1 July 2005: 300,000 Annual Profit Related Bonus The annual bonus is dependent upon the achievement of financial objectives and key strategic measures for the business, set annually by the Group Board.
For the attainment of 100% of target the amount of bonus will be 130% of basic salary.
The maximum amount of bonus which can be received by any executive is 180% of basic salary, for the attainment of 125% of target.
If actual performance falls below 85% of target then no bonus will be payable.
Payment of the bonus is on a progressive scale with proportionately more being attainable for performance over and above target.
30 Remuneration Report Any bonus earned above target is deferred on a compulsory basis, with an opportunity for additional voluntary deferral.
The deferred amounts will be converted into shares, with an opportunity for additional matching shares to be received if further performance targets are met.
These additional performance targets are the same as those used for the Long-Term Performance Plan, as detailed below.
No part of the annual bonus is pensionable.
Share Option Plan In November 1997 the Company adopted the current Executive Share Option Plan the Plan.
The grant of share options under the Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group.
Options must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years.
The exercise of options granted under the Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee namely that the growth in the earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and 1998 and by at least 9% for those options granted in and since 1999.
In accordance with best practice the Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance condition and for options granted after 1st July 2004 the three consecutive financial years over which the earnings per share growth target must be met will commence with the financial year during which the options are granted.
If the target is not met over this fixed three-year period, then options will lapse.
There will be no retesting of performance.
No options have been granted under the Plan during this financial year.
Options which have been granted in previous years remain unchanged and details of the terms of these outstanding awards are set out below.
Long-Term Performance Plan The Long-Term Performance Plan the LTPP was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to take effect from 1st July 2003.
Awards under the LTPP are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 200% of basic salary with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three year performance period of the plan, subject to attainment of the agreed performance targets.
50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on Basic Earnings Per Share EPS growth and 50% based on Total Shareholder Return TSR.
For awards made in 2003 and 2004 a vesting schedule has been established so that, in terms of EPS growth, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the Retail Price Index RPI plus 45% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds RPI plus 30% with straight line vesting between these two points.
The remaining 50% will vest subject to TSR performance originally measured against the constituents of the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Sector Index.
Again a vesting schedule has been established so that the full 50% will vest if TSR growth is in the upper quartile of the comparative index and 10% vesting if TSR growth is at the median of the index, with straight line vesting between the two points.
Shareholders approved a change to these performance conditions at the 2005 AGM, and for awards made in 2005 and thereafter the targets are as follows.
For the EPS element of the target, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI Index plus 18% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 9%: for performance in between the award will vest on a straightline basis.
For the TSR portion of the award a peer group has been formed comprising listed housebuilders.
A vesting schedule will be drawn up by taking an average of the two highest and two lowest TSR figures for such companies over the performance period and creating a mid-point and an upper quartile from those two figures.
The full 50% will vest if the Companys TSR is within the upper quartile and 10% will vest at the mid-point mark: for performance in between, the award will vest on a straightline basis.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed these targets in the light of current circumstances and considers that the targets remain appropriate.
Details of the maximum number of notional share awards made under the LTPP, subject to achieving the full performance targets described above, during the last year are set out below.
The 2004 award which vests this year will be 50% of the maximum as the minimum EPS target was not achieved.
31 Remuneration Report Pension Benefits All executive directors except Mr M A Pain are members of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme, which is now closed to new entrants.
The scheme entitles the executive directors with the exceptions of Mr D A Pretty, Mr G K Hester and Mr C Fenton to a pension on retirement at age 65 of two thirds of final pensionable salary after 40 years membership of the scheme.
The executive directors are also eligible for dependants pension and an insured lump sum of four times pensionable salary on death in service.
The final pension is calculated from the highest yearly average pensionable salary over three consecutive years during the last ten years of service.
The entitlements of Mr D A Pretty, Mr G K Hester and Mr C Fenton are restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the Finance Act 1989.
Under a contractual arrangement entered into in 1992 Mr D A Prettys pension accrues at the rate of 1 30th but it remains restricted to the earnings cap.

Following the introduction of the Lifetime Allowance Pension Rules on 6 April 2006 the Committee has agreed to make changes to the existing pension provision.
With effect from 1st July 2006 all executive directors will have a choice of remaining in the defined benefit pension scheme as described above, or opting to leave this scheme and instead receive a cash supplement equal to 25% of their basic salary.
This choice is at the discretion of the individual executive directors.
In lieu of membership of the defined benefit pension scheme Mr M A Pain receives a cash supplement equal to 75,000 per annum.
