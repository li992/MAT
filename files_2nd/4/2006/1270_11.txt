Introduction The Remuneration Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board on all matters relating to the remuneration arrangements applying to the executive directors, the management population occupying roles immediately below those of the Board and to any other employee within the group whose remuneration package, including pensions and bonus exceeds 200,000 per annum.
During the year under review the Committee met on five occasions: details of attendance at the meetings of the Committee are provided in the Corporate Governance Review on page 44.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee is limited to the independent non-executive directors and is chaired by Mrs A V M Palmer.
The other members of the Committee are Mr S G Batey and Mr N P Buckles.
In his capacity as Senior Independent Director Mr S G Williams is entitled to attend any meeting of the Committee.
During the year under review Sir Richard Broadbent, Mr R J Davies until his retirement on 19 April 2006 and Mr D R Martin have attended meetings of the Committee as invitees.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the companys website www.
Remuneration policy The objective of the Boards remuneration policy is to ensure that senior management of the appropriate calibre and experience are attracted, motivated and retained to offer the best possible opportunity for the company to deliver sustained shareholder value.
A comprehensive remuneration review conducted in 2005 with advice from KPMG confirmed the companys policy of paying base salary at the median of the peer comparator group and to reward outstanding performance with upper quartile total remuneration.
A peer comparator group was established for this purpose comprising a representative sample of FTSE 250 companies of a similar size and complexity to that of the company from the transport and other sectors.
The committee aims to match the remuneration opportunity of the directors with that of the peer comparator group and to ensure that reward is a direct result of achieving stretching performance targets in line with the groups strategic goals.
Remuneration structure 3.1 Base salary The base salaries of the executive directors are reviewed each year effective from 1 January and are as follows: Salary Salary 1 January 2007 1 January 2006 000 p. a.
D R Martin 465 312 S P Lonsdale 302 290 S J Clayton 271 260 R J Davies retired 19 April 2006 n a 447 Mr D R Martins salary was increased to 447,000 p. a. on 19 April 2006 on his assumption of the role of Chief Executive following the retirement of Mr R J Davies.
3.2 Performance related bonus The annual bonus opportunity is 100 per cent of base salary with 70 per cent being determined by group financial performance and the balance reflecting performance against personal objectives agreed with each director at the beginning of the year: the financial performance will be the groups earnings per share before goodwill impairment and intangible asset amortisation calculated under International Financial Reporting Standards adjusted for exceptional items EPS.
The Remuneration Committee will review the measure each year to ensure that it remains appropriate.
The financial element of the bonus scheme in 2006 was structured as follows: EPS Target Bonus as 2006 p per cent of Base Salary 42.4 0 44.6 30 49.1 70 Arriva plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 37 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued 3.3 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP a Awards made up to and including 2005 The LTIP was initially introduced in 2000 and provides for the conditional award of shares at the discretion of the Board as advised by the Remuneration Committee.
The market value of any conditional award is limited to 100 per cent of the directors base annual salary at the date of the award.
The vesting of the conditional share awards will depend upon EPS performance when compared with the growth in the Retail Price Index and also of the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the group when compared with the TSR of the peer comparator group comprising the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 excluding the company and investment companies, over a period of three years.
The degree of vesting is on a sliding scale of 25 per cent - 100 per cent, with no share vesting unless the TSR of the group is at least equal to the median TSR of the peer comparator group.
However, irrespective of TSR performance, no share shall vest in any event unless the growth in the groups EPS over the three year measurement period exceeds the growth of the Retail Price Index in the same period by at least six per cent.
With regard to the conditional share award made on 8 March 2004 the performance measurement period was the three years ended 31 December 2006: in that period the growth in the groups EPS was 26.5 per cent compared with the growth in the Retail Price Index of 10.5 per cent.
The companys TSR for the same period fell between the TSR of the 66th and 67th ranked companies, delivering a conditional award vesting level of 58.16 per cent.
b Awards made in 2006 At the Annual General Meeting held on 19 April 2006 shareholders approved a revision to the LTIP arrangement following the review of executive remuneration and the LTIP now comprises a blend of two elements providing i a reward equivalent to a maximum of 100 per cent of base salary at upper quartile TSR performance and ii a further reward equivalent to up to 100 per cent of base salary on superior EPS performance.
Vesting for this second element is on a linear scale with 10 per cent vesting if EPS increases by RPI four per cent annually over the three-year measurement period, rising to a maximum award of 100 per cent if the EPS increases by RPI 13 per cent annually over the measurement period.
In measuring TSR, the groups performance will be ranked with that of a peer comparator group consisting of companies excluding the company and investment companies whose shares comprise the FTSE 250 at the beginning of the three-year measurement period.
These revised arrangements apply to the conditional awards made in May 2006.
Share retention guidelines have been introduced requiring retention of 50 per cent of any share award by executive directors until a holding equivalent in value to annual base salary has been achieved.
As at 31 December 2006 the interests of the directors in conditional share awards made under the LTIP were as follows: Movement in Conditionally Awarded Shares Balance Not at Awards Subsisting at Vested 31 Dec 1 January 2006 Awarded During Year Vested During Year in Year 2006 Share Share Price at Price at Value of Date of Date of Shares at No.
ii Following his retirement on 19 April 2006 the Remuneration Committee resolved that Mr R J Davies retain his entitlement to exercise, pro rata, in accordance with the length of the performance period for which he was employed any outstanding conditional shares awarded under the LTIP in 2004 and 2005 in accordance with the normal timetable and performance conditions of the rules of the LTIP.
Mr Davies conditional share awards under the LTIP in 2004 and 2005 were 105,140 ordinary shares and 78,467 ordinary shares respectively.
On 24 November 2006 Mr Davies exercised his option over the 114,995 ordinary shares that had vested in March 2006 under the terms of the LTIP.
38 Moving you across Europe 3.4 Share options Since the introduction of the LTIP in 2000 the executive directors have not participated in any of the companys share option schemes and it is not envisaged that there will be any change to this policy in the future.
The non-executive directors do not participate in either the LTIP or the share option schemes.

A pension of 5,000 2005: 5,000 was paid to a former director.
3.6 Non-executive directors fees With effect from 1 March 2005, the fee payable to each of the non-executive directors has been 32,500 per annum.

Within the aggregate cap the annual fee for each non-executive director is determined by the Board, the non-executive directors taking no part in the deliberations.
Each of the non-executive directors is appointed for a fixed term not exceeding three years.
The appointments are renewable with the agreement of both parties again for terms not exceeding three years.

Since 1 January 2000 Messrs Clayton, Lonsdale and Martin have been accruing benefits in their respective schemes at 1 30th of basic annual salary: for service after 31 December 1999 bonus ceased to be taken into account when computing pension benefits.
No director elected to cease membership of his respective pension scheme in the light of the changes to the pension taxation regime which took effect on 6 April 2006.
No future executive director external appointees to the Board will be eligible for a final salary based pension arrangement, but instead will receive a cash contribution equal to 25 per cent of base salary.
Any active executive director internal appointees will be permitted to retain their existing pension arrangements.
Service contracts Each of the three executive directors has a service contract dated 19 April 2006: the contracts are subject to twelve months notice from the company and six months notice from the director.
Each contract contains covenants restricting the ability of the director, within a period of six months from termination, from competing with the company.
The contracts make specific provision with regard to termination payments which are quantified as the sum of: i the directors base pay at the date of termination: ii the amount of bonus estimated to be payable in respect of the year in which notice is served, but in any event capped at maximum of 40 per cent of base pay: and iii the value of the benefits in kind.
Additionally in the case of termination by the company, the company will seek to procure that the director is credited with an additional twelve months service in his respective pension scheme.
Should the director terminate the contract within six months of a change of control of the company he will receive a termination payment equal to 50 per cent of the termination payment described above.
External Board appointments The Board will permit executive directors to accept one appointment outside the company.
Before accepting such appointments the director s involved must receive the prior approval of the Board.
In considering such cases the Board will always satisfy itself, as far as is possible, that such appointments will not detract from the executive directors expected contribution to the company, nor that such appointment will create any conflict of interest: any fees earned by an executive director in such a capacity will be assigned to the company.
