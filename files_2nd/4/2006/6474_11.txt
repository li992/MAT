Directors remuneration report The Directors have pleasure in submitting their Remuneration Report for the year to 31 March 2006.
This Report, which complies with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, sets out how the principles of the Combined Code relating to Directors remuneration are applied.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the Group was compliant with the provisions of the Combined Code relating to Directors remuneration throughout the period.
The information that has been audited in this Report comprises the Directors remuneration table on page 53, the share options table on page 55, the two Long-Term Incentive Plan tables on page 56, the Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme, the Interim Merger Scheme table on page 57 and the pensions disclosure on page 58.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 24 July 2006 inviting them to consider and approve this Report.
Remuneration Committee The Board has overall responsibility for determining the framework of executive remuneration and is required to take account of any recommendations made by the Remuneration Committee.
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee, through formal terms of reference, approval of the specific remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and consideration of executive remuneration issues generally, including the use of share incentive plans.
The Remuneration Committee at the beginning of the financial year comprised Peter Mitchell as Chairman, Tim Mason, Tony Illsley and Peter W Williams.
Following the merger with GWR Group plc the Committee comprised Alastair Ross Goobey as Chairman, Tim Mason, Peter Cawdron and Peter Michael, Tony Illsley, Peter W Williams and Peter Mitchell having resigned from the Committee on 9 May 2005.
Tony Illsley was subsequently re-appointed to the Committee during the year concurrent with the standing down of Tim Mason from the Board and the Remuneration Committee.
Peter Cawdron resigned from the Committee upon his appointment as Chairman of the Company in September 2005.
The Committee met seven times during the year to review the Companys general policy on executive remuneration and the application of this policy to the remuneration and benefits of the Executive Directors and other senior executives of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee at all times during the year consisted exclusively of independent Non-executive Directors.
The Chairman and the Chief Executive normally attend meetings of the Remuneration Committee, but are not present at any discussions concerning their own remuneration.
The terms of reference permit the Remuneration Committee to obtain its own external advice on any matter at the Companys expense.
For the financial year under review, the Committee was assisted internally by the Companys Director of Human Resources and by external consultants , The Monks Partnership and New Bridge Street Consultants.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors The Committee aims to provide a competitive remuneration package to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior executives of the highest calibre and with the experience needed to shape and execute the Groups strategy and deliver shareholder value.
The Committee takes account of external market data supplied by independent professional advisers and is sensitive to the wider scene, including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group, especially when determining annual salary increases.
The Committee also takes account of the remuneration paid by the Companys comparator group in the market.
The Committees policy is for a significant proportion of executive reward to be variable and dependent upon the Groups performance, and for targeted performance-related incentives for Executive Directors to equate to well over half of the total potential remuneration.
Variable reward components provide an opportunity for higher levels of remuneration where this is supported by exceptional performance whether at an individual level or in relation to the Groups short-term and longer-term business priorities.
Variable rewards will continue to be provided through a balanced mix of performance-related elements.
The annual bonus scheme supports operational objectives over the financial year, whilst the Companys Long-Term Incentive Plan will reward superior performance over a longer period.
The Interim Merger Scheme continues, in the shorter-term, to motivate the Executive Directors to achieve targets set in relation to the achievement of synergies in connection with the Merger.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors consists of: Basic salary which is based on comparable positions in leading businesses of similar size and complexity.
Annual bonus scheme which is based on achievement of Group profit targets, as well as other financial and non-financial measures and personal targets.
The maximum bonus payout is 100% of base salary.
The bonus is paid partly in cash and partly in shares with a matching share element if the individual remains in service for three years, the original shares are retained and performance targets are met.
Details of performance criteria are set out on page 50.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee has power to award bonuses outside this scheme.

Interim Merger Scheme under which the Executive Directors may receive, over two years, up to 100% of base salary as at 1 April 2005, on the achievement of annualised costs savings of at least 25 million by 31 March 2007.
Awards are satisfied half in cash and half in shares.

Basic salary and benefits In formulating and reviewing pay packages for the Executive Directors, the Committee will normally receive comparator group information and assistance from independent remuneration consultants.
The Committees policy has been to maintain a salary structure based upon the midmarket of its comparator group of companies.
The Company structures remuneration packages which are appropriate to the particular function and level of responsibility of each individual Executive Director and which are designed to attract, retain and motivate the individuals.
It takes into account the remuneration structures and levels at other companies, in particular in the media sector.
The Remuneration Committee is made aware of pay conditions in the Group when it is considering annual salary increases.
All Executive Directors receive company car and private healthcare benefits.
Death-in-service and permanent health insurance is also provided for each Executive Director.
Annual Bonus Scheme and Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme The Company operates an annual bonus scheme which is reviewed each year by the Remuneration Committee and under which each Executive Director is able to earn a bonus of up to a maximum of 100% of basic salary, dependent upon performance conditions being met.
During the year under review, the annual bonus scheme was assessed by reference to overall Group financial performance 70%, other financial and non-financial measures 15% and personal objectives 15%.
The Remuneration Committee determined that a bonus should be payable for achieving personal objectives 15% but on no other measure.
The bonus is payable 65% in cash while 35% is applied to the purchase of shares for the individual.
The cash and share elements are payable immediately after the announcement of the results for the financial year.
In conjunction with the annual bonus scheme, the company operates a Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme DABS, pursuant to which Executive Directors and other members of the Group may receive a DABS award, inviting them to lodge the shares received under the share element of the annual bonus Lodged Shares for the purposes of the DABS scheme enabling them to acquire additional matching shares at the end of a three-year performance period, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, continued employment and based on the number of Lodged Shares that were acquired which must be retained for the three-year performance period.
The award is normally in the form of a nil-cost option and it is the intention of the Company that, wherever possible, the grants of matching shares will be met from shares held in trust for that purpose.
The performance conditions applicable to the DABS awards made during the year under review were as follows: Percentage growth in the Companys earnings per share over the three-year period from 31 March 2006 to 31 March 2009 Percentage of DABS Award vesting Less than 6% per annum compounded None of the DABS Award vests 11% per annum compounded 50% of DABS Award vests Between 6% and 11% per annum compounded DABS Award vests proportionately between nil and 50% Between 11% and 16% per annum compounded DABS Award vests proportionately between 50% and 100% 16% per annum compounded or greater 100% of DABS Award vests If 100% of the DABS award vests, this is equivalent to the maximum two-for-one matching.
No re-testing of the performance criteria is permitted.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee has power to award bonuses outside the above schemes.
Immediately prior to completion of the Merger, the Committee considered whether special bonuses should be payable for additional services in respect of the period up to completion of the Merger.
The bonuses approved by the Committee are disclosed in the table on page 53. c. Share Incentive Plan It is the Remuneration Committees policy that Executive Directors should participate in the Companys 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP as this scheme aligns the Directors interests with those of the Companys shareholders by linking the reward available to participants to TSR.
Executive Directors may also participate in the Capital Radio Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE.
This is open to all full-time members of the Group who have been employed for more than 12 months at the date of grant of the options.
Details of all share incentive awards outstanding for each Executive Director are set out on page 55.
As referred to above, the Executive Directors who stood down during the year previously received awards under the 1986 and 1998 Capital Radio Share Option Schemes and the Capital Radio Long-Term Incentive Plan.
No awards under either of these schemes have been made to any Executive Directors during the year.
2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan Under the LTIP, Executive Directors may receive awards entitling them to acquire or receive shares in the Company to a maximum annual value of 150% of basic salary.
For the period under review, each Executive Director received awards of 150% of basic salary by way of nil-cost options with the value of the Companys shares as at 1 September 2005 being used for the purpose of calculation.
The Companys share price on that date was 3.0775.
For subsequent awards, the market value of the shares on the award dates will be used.
GCap Media plc Annual Report 2005 06 50 All awards under the LTIP are subject to stretching performance conditions measured over a three-year period.
The performance conditions applicable to the awards granted during the period under review are as follows: 50% of the award will be subject to TSR performance compared to the constituent companies of the FTSE Media Sector the First Comparator Group and 50% of the award will be subject to TSR performance compared to the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 Index the Second Comparator Group.
12.5% of the award will vest if the TSR of the Company over the three year period commencing 9 May 2005 the Performance Period is equal to the median TSR of the First Comparator Group over that Period.
Additionally, if the TSR of the Company over the Performance Period is equal to the median TSR of the Second Comparator Group over that period, 12.5% of the award will vest.
If the Companys TSR over the Performance Period would place it in the upper quartile of the TSR of the First Comparator Group and or the Second Comparator Group, 50% of the award will vest respectively i. e. if both targets are met 100% of the award will vest.
If the Companys TSR is between the median and upper quartile of the First Comparator Group and or the second Comparator Group, the award will vest proportionately between 12.5% and 50% respectively.
TSR is the annual compound return received on a share calculated by measuring the increase in the price of a share over the Performance Period and the gross value of dividends and other benefits received on the share and reinvested on the day that share was declared ex-dividend.
No re-testing of the performance criteria will occur.
The Remuneration Committees overall policy is to make awards under the 2005 LTIP using performance conditions and target levels which are believed to be stretching and provide value to the participants commensurate with the performance achieved.
The policy when deciding on performance measures is to use measures the participants can, by their actions, influence, in order to provide effective motivation.
The policy is to make awards annually and, as has been mentioned above, to ensure that the targets are set at the time of award with regard to prevailing conditions and that all the equity incentive arrangements in which an employee participates are considered as one whole.
d. Interim Merger Scheme This scheme, on its introduction in 2005, provided for the making of a one-off nil-cost share option and a contingent cash award to Executive Directors.
The Scheme was introduced to incentivise Executive Directors and certain senior managers to achieve the annualised merger synergies identified by the Company in connection with the merger between GWR Group plc and the Company, and satisfaction of stretching performance targets relating to such achievement would be required before any vesting of awards.
The Scheme was also designed to recognise that Executive Directors either had no extant long-term incentives or little or no prospect of any payment under any such incentive schemes until at least three years after the Merger.
The performance conditions originally applicable to the Scheme were revised following the Companys announcement in September 2005 of a target of significantly higher annualised merger synergies than had initially been anticipated.
The targets are therefore now as follows: Annualised Merger Synergies achieved Proportion of contingent in the financial year to 31 March 2006 Proportion of award vesting Proportion of option exercisable cash award payable Below 4,000,000 Nil Nil Nil 4,000,000 7.5% 3.75% 3.75% Between 4,000,000 and 6,000,000 7.5% to 50% pro rata 3.75% to 25% pro rata 3.75% to 25% pro rata 6,000,000 50% 25% 25% Proportion of option Proportion of award vesting exercisable including any Aggregate Annualised Merger Synergies achieved in including any part of the award part of the option which has Proportion of contingent the financial years to 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2007 which has already vested already become exercisable cash award payable Below 18,000,000 Nil Nil Nil 18,000,000 15% 7.5% 7.5% Between 18,000,000 and 25,000,000 15% to 100% pro rata 7.5% to 50% pro rata 7.5% to 50% pro rata 25,000,000 100% 50% 50% In summary, therefore, Executive Directors have the ability to earn a bonus under this Scheme of up to 100% of basic salary as at 1 April 2005 if the Aggregate Annualised Merger Synergies reach 25 million in the year to 31 March 2007.
Vesting will be proportional if lower levels of synergies are achieved.
The Committee has reserved to itself a discretion to vary the level of vesting if the cost of achieving the synergies exceeds 18 million and will seek external verification of the synergies and the cost of achieving them.
As noted above, to the extent an award vests in each of the years to 31 March 2006 and 2007, 50% of the award will be satisfied by the vesting of nil-cost options and 50% of the award will be paid in cash.
GCap Media plc Annual Report 2005 06 51 Directors remuneration report continued e. Service contracts The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews all aspects of executive service contracts in the light of current practice and the specific circumstances of the Group.
The Committee has determined that all service contracts should be updated and revised during the forthcoming financial year and will be conducting an exercise to this effect.
As at the date of this Report, all of the Executive Directors have service contracts with unexpired rolling terms of one year and a notice period by either party of one year.
The date of contract is show below: Ralph Bernard 21 March 1997: Steve Orchard 7 June 2004: and Wendy Pallot 31 March 2003.
Contracts for Ralph Bernard, Steve Orchard and Wendy Pallot provide that on a change of control as a result of which within six months an executive is dismissed or treats himself or herself as being dismissed as a result of any repudiation by the Company of his contract, compensation is payable for the unexpired portion of his or her notice period.
Contracts for Steve Orchard and Wendy Pallot also provide that in the event of a change of control that is not recommended by the Board, the executive can, within six months of that change of control, choose to terminate his or her employment by giving not less than 30 days notice and receive compensation for the unexpired portion of his or her notice period.
Ralph Bernards contract also has this clause, but with a notice period of six months.
The service contracts for the Executive Directors who stood down from the Board during the period under review provided for termination by the executive or the Company on 12 months notice.
Each agreement also contained a provision entitling the Company to terminate without notice and to make a payment in lieu of notice to the relevant executives equal to 95% of the sum of 12 months salary and the value of other benefits including annual bonus.
In each case, compensation for loss of office was paid to the departing executives as shown in the table on page 53.
The comments of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on page 54 should be noted.
f. External appointments GCap Media recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies or to become involved in charitable or public service organisations.
As the Board believes that this can broaden the knowledge and experience of the Companys directors to the benefit of the Company, it is the Companys policy to approve such appointments provided there is no conflict of interest and the commitment required is not excessive.
The Executive Director concerned can retain the fees relating to any such appointment.
None of the Executive Directors holds any significant business directorships which are not directly related to the business of the Group.
Fees payable in relation to the services of Directors representing the Group on the boards of other companies are received and retained by the Group.
Non-executive Directors a. Remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is a matter reserved to the Board, on advice from the Remuneration Committee.
Non-executive Directors receive an annual fee and are reimbursed expenses incurred in performing duties.
Chairmen of Board Committees receive an additional annual fee.
Non-executive Directors do not receive any performance-related bonuses, pensions provision, share options or other forms of benefit.
Under Article 101 of the Companys Articles of Association, a limit of 800,000 increased from 500,000 by special resolution of the Company passed at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 15 April 2005 is placed on the aggregate amount of fees that can be paid to Non-executive Directors.
This limit does not apply to Executive Directors, who have salaried employment with the Group.
In addition, under Article 103, the Board may grant extra remuneration to any Director who performs special services at the request of the Company.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
In reaching future decisions on appropriate levels of pay, the Remuneration Committee will continue to have regard to the packages awarded to chairmen of other UK listed companies of a similar size and complexity.
The President is paid an annual fee of 13,000, which has not increased since his appointment in 1992. b.
Appointment of Non-executive Directors Non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years.
Their appointment can be terminated by the Company giving notice in writing.
Re-appointment may be made after further three-year term s. Any re-appointment beyond three terms of three years would be subject to annual review.
Non-executive Directors serve the Company under letters of appointment and do not have service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee plans to review these letters of appointment during the forthcoming financial period to ensure they meet best practice standards.

The cash and cash equivalent as at the date of grant of the nil-cost options values are also indicated in the bonus figures in the table above.
For Ralph Bernard GCap Media plc Annual Report 2005 06 53 Directors remuneration report continued this amounted to 224,000: for Steve Orchard 132,500 and for Wendy Pallot 120,000.

The benefits in kind shown in the above table relate principally to a fully expensed company car or the receipt of a company car allowance and medical health cover for the Executive Directors and their immediate family.
Wendy Pallot received relocation payments amounting to 28,817. b. Explanatory statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee relating to payments made to departing Executive Directors Shareholders deserve a full explanation of the payments made to the Executive Directors who resigned during the year.
The payments are substantial and amount to more than 2.5 times the base salary.
One might expect that an executive serving on a contract with a notice period of 12 months would be entitled to less than this.
However, the payments are a consequence of the contracts under which the Executive Directors served, dated January and February 2001.
Shareholders will recall the environment for media companies at that time, where securing the services of management was more difficult in the sector.
The Board of GCap Media made the decision that the Executive Directors concerned were good leavers, in that they were not dismissed for cause.
The contracts were quite explicit in the terms of the severance payments on termination.
Shareholders will have noted the outline of these Executive Directors contracts in the accounts of GCap Media for the pre-merger period to 31 March 2005 page 24 of those accounts.
The Executive Directors concerned were entitled to 95% of the sum of 12 months salary and the value of other benefits including annual bonus.
This is a forward-looking sum, running from the date that the contract is terminated.
No short-term bonus is being paid to any Executive Director in respect of the profit-related element of the bonus scheme put in place by the Remuneration Committee for 2005 06.
However, other bonuses, including in respect of general management achievements and the Interim Merger Scheme, are being paid to the remaining Executive Directors.
Legal advice was received that similar payments to the departing Directors were contractual, as were bonuses payable for the period between 1 April 2005 and the termination date of the relevant contract.
The only non-contractual payments made were in respect of a compromise agreement that prevents any claim for constructive or unfair dismissal, plus a small contribution to the executives legal costs, made directly to the lawyers concerned.
If the Company had paid the executives on a monthly basis during the period of notice, there was a possibility that the overall payments might have been even larger, since they could have claimed a share in higher bonuses than the termination payments estimated, and they could have claimed a participation in the 2005 LTIP.
Shareholders may be assured that no current Executive Director of the company has such a contract, and the Remuneration Committee would not recommend the Board to award such contracts in the future.
GCap Media plc Annual Report 2005 06 54 c. Share incentive plans The total interests of Directors in the issued share capital of the Company are shown on page 42.
Share options held by the Executive Directors who resigned during the year were granted under either the Capital Radio 1986 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme or the 1998 Share Option Scheme in accordance with criteria prevailing at the date of grant to reflect individual contribution to the business.
Options were granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant and are exercisable during the period between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The exercise of share options under the Capital Radio 1986 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme is not subject to satisfaction of a performance condition as it was not market practice to impose such a condition at the time the scheme was implemented.
The last grants were made in December 1996 and no further grants can be made under this scheme.
The exercise of share options under the GCap Media Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE and the GWR Group Savings Related Share Scheme SAYE are not subject to satisfaction of a performance condition as the scheme is Inland Revenue approved and open to all eligible employees.
The options over GWR Group plc shares held by Ralph Bernard, Steve Orchard and Wendy Pallot under the GWR SAYE Scheme became options over the Companys shares upon completion of the Merger.
The figures shown represent the number of options held over the Companys shares at the rebased price.
As at 31 March 2006, the market price of the Companys Ordinary Shares of 2.5p was 2.29.
During the period 1 April 2005 and 31 March 2006, the share price moved within the range of 2.26 and 4.025.
GCap Media plc Annual Report 2005 06 55 Directors remuneration report continued d. Capital Radio plc Long-Term Incentive Plan Details of the shares conditionally awarded to the Directors under the Capital Radio Long-Term Incentive Scheme LTIP are given in the table below.
Subject to satisfaction of performance conditions a proportion of the shares will vest with the individuals on the vesting dates.
These will remain in force subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions at the normal date.
The vesting level will then be scaled down to reflect their actual period of service during the three-year performance period.
The awards made in November 2003 and November 2004 vest in November 2006 and December 2007 respectively.
At the date of this Report the performance percentage, reflecting performance to date, was 0% for the awards vesting in November 2006 and December 2007. e.
