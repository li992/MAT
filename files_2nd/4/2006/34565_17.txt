The Remuneration Committee has elected to adjust the total return calculation to eliminate the effect of the CULS premium write-off because the CULS buybacks enhanced shareholder value.
The potential value of the awards made is the number of shares multiplied by the current share price.
The purpose of the scheme is to enable employees to build up long-term shareholdings in the Company.
Capital Appreciation Plan In accordance with the terms of the plan, the directors have been awarded the following interests in the performance fees receivable by the Group in respect of the financial year 2006.
The interests awarded will only be paid in full if none of the shares conditionally awarded under the LTIP in 2006 vest in 2009.
The value of the initial award will be reduced pro rata to the extent that any part of the performance fees received by the Group in respect of 2006 are clawed back as a result of under-performance of the funds in 2007 or 2008.
Consequently, no payments will be made in respect of the 2006 awards until 2009, when this clawback right lapses.

Under these contracts CRPM is paid a performance fee based on a share of the out performance over and above certain benchmarks as described on page 8.
The allocation of the CAP award between executive directors and other senior management is also decided by the Remuneration Committee based on the contribution of each individual to the total performance of the Group assessed following consultation with the Chairman and Chief Executive.
