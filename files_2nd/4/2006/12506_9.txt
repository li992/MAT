Adjusted existing options under the ESOS, SAYE and the LTIP to reflect the one for one rights issue announced on 14 August 2006.
Conducted a review of the long-term incentive arrangements for senior executives that would be appropriate subject to the acquisition of RHM plc, resulting in the design and implementation of the new CIP and changes to the 2007 LTIP to provide higher incentive rewards for truly outstanding performance, to secure improved shareholder value.
Remuneration policy Broad Policy The broad policy of the Board and the Committee is to continue to set remuneration levels so as to attract and retain highcalibre executives and to encourage and to reward superior business performance.
Remuneration for executive directors is intended to reward against criteria that are relevant and realistic but also challenging, so that superior performance is encouraged.
Therefore, remuneration policy is revised annually and focuses on performance-related incentives, rather than annual salary, to encourage the alignment of operating objectives as well as delivering shareholder value.
Annual salaries continue to be rigorously tested and reviewed and set at levels not normally exceeding median.
In relation to bonuses and long-term incentive plans, the policy will continue to be to provide an opportunity for executives to earn total remuneration packages in the upper quartile range, provided that stretching and demanding performance conditions are met.
The Committee have reviewed all aspects of the remuneration policy, including pay benchmarking for the most senior roles and consideration of the performance measures used, and have not made any changes to the remuneration policy adopted in 2005.
The remuneration policy in place for senior executives is designed to place emphasis on key performance objectives and strengthening executive shareholding.
While committed to the use of equity-based performance-related remuneration as a means of aligning directors interests with those of shareholders, the Committee is aware of shareholders concerns on dilution through the issue of new shares to satisfy such awards.
Therefore, when reviewing remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into account the effects such arrangements may have on dilution.
In determining the remuneration arrangements for executive directors, the Committee is sensitive to the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group, especially when determining base salary increases.
Share ownership A minimum shareholding requirement was introduced in 2006 whereby executive directors are required after three years to hold shares with a market value at least equal to their annual basic salary.
At 31 December 2006, Mr Schofield held shares with a total market value equivalent to 7.08 times his annual basic salary and Mr Thomas held shares with a total market value equivalent to 5.40 times his annual basic salary.
52 Premier Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Directors remuneration report For the year ended 31 December 2006 Remuneration for executive directors The Committee considers that the remuneration package of an executive director should be aligned closely with the interests of shareholders and, therefore, that a significant proportion of the remuneration package should be performance related.
In arriving at the balance between fixed and variable remuneration it is agreed that the fixed portion will relate only to annual salary, whilst the variable portion includes both annual bonuses and long-term incentive arrangements.
It is the Committees policy that, for 2007, the balance between fixed and variable remuneration for the executive directors shall be as follows: Chief Executive Officer Fixed vs Variable Finance Director Fixed vs Variable Target Max Target Max Fixed 40% Fixed 13% Fixed 44% Fixed 16% Variable 60% Variable 87% Variable 56% Variable 84% Base salaries Basic salary for executive directors takes into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual.
This is normally reviewed annually unless responsibilities change.
Salary levels are targeted at the median of companies of a comparable size, complexity and market sector, and for 2007 are set at 595,000 for the Chief Executive and 400,000 for the Finance Director.
Annual bonus At the discretion of the Committee, executive directors are eligible to receive an annual bonus subject to the achievement of performance targets which are set each year by the Committee.
Bonus potentials are set on an individual basis.
Following an external benchmarking exercise the current management bonus plan was deemed to be low when compared to similar sized organisations.
For 2007, the annual bonus potentials are set at 100% of salary for Mr Schofield and 75% for Mr Thomas, with a target level of 50% of salary.
The performance targets will be based on profit before tax and growth in branded sales.
In addition, until executive directors have built up a significant personal shareholding in the Company see page 51, they are required to defer 50% of any bonus earned into shares in the Company.
The deferred bonus shares will normally vest three years after their award.
Generally, the deferred bonus shares will not be forfeitable.
However, in the event that the executives employment is terminated by reason of his gross misconduct or by reason of a material breach of his employment contract, his deferred bonus shares may, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, be forfeited.
Pensions Executive directors are eligible to participate in the Premier Foods Pension Scheme PFPS which is a funded, contributory, exempt-approved scheme that provides benefits on a defined benefit final salary basis and is contracted out of the State Second Pension.
The executive directors participation is subject to the earnings caps imposed by the Finance Act 1989.
In addition, Mr Schofield elected for enhanced protection under the Scheme with effect from 6 April 2006.
This means that he no longer benefits from accruals under the Scheme.
Further details can be found on page 59.
53 Premier Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Other benefits Each executive director is entitled to a car and telecommunication services and an allowance for personal tax and financial planning.
Each executive director is also provided with private health cover and permanent health insurance.
Mr Thomas is entitled to a housing allowance of 18,303 p. a.
Other directorships The Group is supportive of executive directors who wish to take on a non-executive directorship with a publicly quoted company in order to broaden their experience.
They are entitled to retain any fees they may receive.
Neither Mr Schofield nor Mr Thomas currently serves as a director of another public company.
Share Plans Following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of RHM plc in 2006, the Committee determined that the critical nature of the size and scale of the transaction justified a review of the Companys long-term incentive arrangements for executive directors and key senior executives to ensure that those who are most able to have a real impact on performance are sufficiently incentivised.
As a result of this review the CIP was developed.
Shareholder approval for the CIP was obtained at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 15 February 2007.
The CIP is intended to be the primary long-term incentive arrangement for executive directors and other key individuals.
The Premier Foods LTIP will be retained for the purposes of incentivising other members of senior management.
It is intended that individuals will not be invited to participate in both plans in the same year other than in exceptional circumstances e. g. in relation to recruitment.
There is currently no intention to grant further options to executive directors under the Premier Foods plc Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, other than in exceptional circumstances.
Awards made under the CIP, LTIP and ESOS are all subject, in part, to Total Shareholder Return TSR based performance conditions.
All TSR measurements for the purposes of calculating vesting under the relevant plans will be calculated on an independent basis by Deloitte.
Co-Investment Plan The CIP requires participants to commit and retain a significant amount of capital in the form of Premier Foods shares.
The purpose of the commitment was so that the participants are encouraged to adopt the attitudes of shareholders.
CIP participation is restricted to individuals who will have a real and measurable impact on the delivery of the acquisition in line with plan, and the long-term growth in shareholder value.
Based on the current senior team of Premier, this is considered to be 12 to 15 individuals including the executive directors.
However, this number may grow to reflect executive responsibilities post-acquisition, but shall not be more than 20 in any one Plan cycle.
Participants in the CIP will not be eligible for participation in any other form of discretionary share plan operated in the same year other than in exceptional circumstances.
The CIP is structured as a share matching plan.
An investment of shares pledged or purchased by the participant can be matched by Company-provided shares on the basis of the achievement of the performance targets over a three year period.
To the extent that the performance conditions are achieved, then the level of Company matching of the purchased pledged shares is enhanced.
At the maximum level of performance, a match of 3:1 i. e. 300% Company shares is provided for the achievement of exceptionally stretching performance criteria.
At the time awards vest under the CIP participants will be required to retain no less than half of the vested matching shares until such time that they are no longer an employee of the Company.
In order to further align the interests of participants with shareholders, dividends will accrue over the matching period on any matching shares that eventually vest.
The Committee will decide the maximum level of individual share purchases or pledges that may be made within the terms of the CIP, taking account of Company and individual performance.
The maximum level of invested shares pledged or purchased by executive directors is 200% of salary.
At tiers of participation below executive director level, the level of investment from the employee will be set at a maximum of 100% of base salary.
54 Premier Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Directors remuneration report For the year ended 31 December 2006 In subsequent years of the CIPs operation, the Committee will decide the appropriate level of share purchase pledge, and the associated match up to a maximum of 3:1, taking full account of Company and personal performance at that time.
Following the approval of the CIP in February 2007, Mr Schofield was invited to pledge or purchase into the scheme shares up to value of 200% of salary and Mr Thomas was able to participate up to 150% of salary.
Future Company success will be measured on the basis of strong EPS growth and by delivering shareholder returns ahead of those provided by the market.
The Committee has therefore agreed a performance target for the 2007 CIP awards which is based on a combination of EPS growth performance measured in absolute real terms, and performance against the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a three year period.
5.0% 8.0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 50% 100% 100% 150% 200% 5.0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 50% 100% 100% 150% 10th 20th 30th 40th 50th 60th 70th 80th 90th Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile TSR against FTSE 250 index constituents It should be noted that a combination of truly exceptional real annual EPS growth and TSR market out-performance is required for the maximum match.
The Committee has, of course, considered carefully the impact on absolute EPS performance of the acquisition and believes that the performance scale represents a truly exceptional level of stretch which will require a confluence of both internal and external factors.
There will be no retesting of performance conditions under the CIP.
To the extent that performance conditions are not met on the vesting date, all matching awards shall lapse.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards under the LTIP have been made since 2005 see page 59.
The executive directors will not participate in this scheme in 2007.
Following the approval and implementation of the CIP, the Committee have also reviewed the performance conditions of the LTIP.
The Committee has decided that the performance conditions used for the CIP will also apply to the LTIP, in order to align all levels of senior management.
Vesting of awards under the LTIP will therefore be subject to a combination of EPS growth and TSR-based performance conditions, as measured over a three-year period.
The vesting schedule for the CIP as detailed above will also apply to awards made under the LTIP in 2007, with the exception that no investment shares will be required in order to qualify for matching shares.
The value of shares awarded under the LTIP in previous years was subject to individual limits that would not generally exceed 100% of base salary.
As a result of the move to bring the LTIP performance conditions in line with the CIP, the value of awards made under the LTIP will now not generally exceed 33% of base salary.
This is because maximum vesting is now considered to be 300% of the size of the award see table above.
Therefore, to retain the maximum award size at 100% of base salary, the maximum award size will be reduced to 33% of base salary with a maximum vesting of 300%.
As with the CIP, there will be no retesting of performance conditions under the LTIP.
To the extent that performance conditions are not met on the vesting date, LTIP awards shall lapse.
The Committee may determine that alternative secondary performance conditions might apply for future awards under the LTIP.
55 Premier Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 As part of the process of ensuring a successful integration of the RHM business into the Premier Foods group, former RHM employees who held outstanding RHM share awards have been given the opportunity to receive proportionate replacement Premier Foods LTIP awards.
The performance conditions applicable to these replacement awards are identical to the performance conditions on outstanding Premier Foods LTIP awards for the equivalent performance periods see page 59.
The Committee believes that this is the most appropriate way of aligning all levels of senior management throughout the enlarged Premier Foods group.
Share options The Premier Foods plc Executive Share Option Scheme the ESOS The Company adopted the ESOS at the time of Admission.
Options granted under the ESOS may be exercised between three and 10 years after grant provided that the applicable performance criteria have been met.
Options were granted to executive directors under the ESOS at the time of Admission in 2004.
The grants were split into three portions, each subject to a stretching performance condition.
Two of the portions representing 50% of the total award are subject to a performance condition based on TSR, and the third portion representing the other 50% of the total award is subject to a performance condition based on adjusted earnings per share EPS.
The performance conditions which are summarised in the table below were chosen because they align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders.
TSR: against select TSR: against FTSE 250 comparator group EPS 25% of Option 25% of Option 50% of Option 50% of the above portion vests for median Full vesting of the above portion if Increase in adjusted earnings performance, rising on a straight-line basis the Company is in first or second per share must be equal or to full vesting for upper quartile performance.

None of the above portion if the Company is below fourth position.
No retesting No retesting One retest at end of fourth year from same base year The current intention is that no further options will be granted under the ESOS, other than in exceptional circumstances e. g. in relation to recruitment.
Details of outstanding awards made to executive directors can be found on page 58.
56 Premier Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Directors remuneration report For the year ended 31 December 2006 Performance graph The following graph shows the TSR performance of the Company since listing in July 2004, against the FTSE 250 which was chosen because it represents a broad equity market index of which the Company is a constituent and the FTSE Food Producers and Processors Index which was chosen because it contains the Companys key comparators.
TSR was calculated by reference to the growth in share price, as adjusted for reinvested dividends.

There are no performance conditions attached to this scheme.
Service Agreements The Committee periodically reviews the Companys policy on the duration of directors service agreements, and the notice periods and termination provisions contained in those agreements.
The current policy of the Committee is that notice periods contained in executive directors service contracts should be limited to 12 months other than in exceptional circumstances, such as for the purposes of recruitment and that provisions for early termination should reflect prevailing market practice.
Executive directors have service agreements that continue until terminated by 12 months notice on either side but which in any event terminate on their 60th birthday.
Both Mr Schofields and Mr Thomas service agreements are dated 20 July 2004.
In the event of early termination other than for a reason justifying summary termination in accordance with the terms of the service agreement the Company may but is not obliged to pay to the executive director, in lieu of notice, a sum equal to the annual value of the executive directors then salary, benefits, pension contributions and on-target bonus calculated on a pro rata daily basis which he would have received during the contractual notice period the sum of which shall be payable in 12 monthly instalments.
To the extent that the executive director receives any sums as a result of alternative employment or provision of services while he is receiving such payments from the Company, the payments shall be reduced by the amount of such sums.
The service contracts of executive directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the Company.
None of the non-executive directors has employment contracts with the Company.
However, each has entered into a letter of appointment with the Company confirming their appointment for periods ranging from two to three years, unless terminated by either party giving the other one months written notice.
The appointments are subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 and the Companys Articles of Association, in particular the need for periodic re-election.
Continuation of an individual non-executive directors appointment is also contingent on that non-executive directors satisfactory performance, which will be evaluated annually.
TSR rebased to 100 at July 2004 57 Premier Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 There are no provisions for compensation being payable upon early termination of an appointment of a non-executive director.

Relative TSR performance will be measured against two appropriate comparator groups: 50% based on performance measured against the FTSE 250 excluding investment companies and 50% based on [1] performance measured against a group of relevant companies from the food sector.
For both parts of awards, 30% will vest for median performance, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
In addition, to ensure that underlying financial performance is also achieved, vesting of awards will be subject to the minimum requirement that Premier Foods EPS must have exceeded the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by an average of at least 2% per annum, over the performance period.
[1] The food sector comparator Group for the 2005 and 2006 awards at the date of grant was Arla Foods plc, Associated British Foods plc, Cadbury Schweppes plc, Cranswick plc, Dairy Crest Group plc, Devro plc, Greencore plc, Geest plc, Northern Foods plc, Richmond Foods plc, Robert Wiseman Dairies plc, Tate & Lyle plc and Uniq plc.
Richmond Group was removed from the Group after the company fide-listed on 3 July 2006.
Kerry Group plc were substituted into the Group for Geest plc who were taken over, and subsequently fide-listed in May 2005.
Kerry Group plcs TSR will be measured from the beginning of the performance period.
Pension entitlements Following the Finance Act 2004, Mr Schofield applied for enhanced protection as part of the transitional arrangements of the new regime.
He no longer accrues benefits under the PFPS.
Mr Thomas is a member of the PFPS, described on page 52, and is subject to the earnings cap imposed by the Finance Act 1989.
Under the PFPS, he will be provided with a pension of 1 45th of salary up to the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap for each year of pensionable service.
Mr Thomas normal pension date is age 60 and he is not required to make contributions to the PFPS.
The following tables set out information on directors defined benefit pension entitlements under the PFPS: Total accrued Increase in Years benefit at Increase in accrued benefit Age at service at 31 December accrued benefit during the year, 31 December 31 December 2006 during the year excluding inflation 2006 2006 Robert Schofield 4 years 55 10 months 17,376 1,380 756 Paul Thomas 4 years 51 6 months 10,540 2,591 2,281 For each director, the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2006 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement, given the length of service and salary of each director at 31 December 2006.
The increase in accrued benefit earned during the year represents the increase in this expected pension including the effect of inflation when compared with the position at 31 December 2005.
The increase in accrued pension excluding the effect of inflation over the year is also shown.

The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
For each director, the value of the increase in accrued benefit under the requirements of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 is the amount obtained by subtracting from the transfer value of the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2006 the corresponding transfer value at 31 December 2005.
The value of the increase in accrued benefit under the Listing Rules is the transfer value at 31 December 2006 of the increase in accrued benefit during the period, excluding inflation.
The transfer values disclosed above are net of directors contributions and do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director.
Instead, they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
