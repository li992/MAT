This additional benefit, known as the Exchange Offer Incentive EOI, is only payable when the new option is exercised or lapses above market value.
To qualify for this additional cash benefit, participants had to retain these options until at least the second anniversary of the effective date of the merger.

None of the other Directors had an interest in any option over the companys shares.
The table below sets out, for grants of share options in respect of the last four financial years, the grant year, the performance period, whether or not the options have vested, and the performance targets.

The Committee determined that UK GAAP would be used for the 2002 grant performance period 1st January 2003 to 31st December 2005 as two out of the three years would be reported under UK GAAP, and thereafter IFRS would apply.
At the average exchange rate for the year, the above gain made by Dr Garnier amounted to 922,893.
An EOI benefit of $192,639 104,129 was paid to Dr Garnier on exercise of these options.
This benefit has been included in the table on page 73.
On 8th February 2007, Dr Garnier exercised a further 68,411 options with a grant price of $32.09 market price on date of exercise was $55.81 giving rise to a gain of $1,622,709 877,140.
Dr Garnier also received $219,531 118,665 in respect of the EOI benefit arising on the exercise of these options.
At the average rate for the year, the above gain made by Dr Yamada amounted to 330,655.
An EOI benefit of $60,204 32,543 was paid to Dr Yamada on the exercise of these options.
The highest and lowest closing prices during the year ended 31st December 2006 for GlaxoSmithKline shares were 15.77 and 13.26, respectively.
The highest and lowest prices for GlaxoSmithKline ADSs during the year ended 31st December 2006 were $58.38 and $50.15, respectively.
The market price for a GlaxoSmithKline share on 31st December 2006 was 13.44 31st December 2005 14.69 and for a GlaxoSmithKline ADS was $52.69 31st December 2005 $50.48.
The prices on 23rd February 2007 were 14.50 per GlaxoSmithKline share and $56.92 per GlaxoSmithKline ADS.
The increase in this balance of 36,648 relates to dividends reinvested during the year of 1,648 and a further 35,000 PSPs which vested during the year that Dr Garnier elected to defer.

The total gain on vesting of PSP awards made by Executive Directors is 1,285,677 2005 1,431,804.
The PSP is a medium-term incentive scheme introduced during 2001.
Under the terms of the PSP the number of shares actually vesting is determined following the end of the relevant three-year measurement period and is dependent on GSKs performance during that period as described on pages 68 and 69.
The share awards were previously granted annually in November or December prior to the start of the performance period, but since the 2006 grant they are granted in February of the first year of performance period.
The measurement period commences on 1st January ending after three years on 31st December.
For awards with a performance period commencing on 1st January 2005 and subsequent awards, dividends are reinvested on the PSPs awarded to members of the CET.
Dividends are reinvested in the quarter in which payment is made.
Under the terms of the PSP, US participants may defer receipt of all or part of their vested awards.
The PSP awards granted in December 2003, with the performance period starting on 1st January 2004 and ending on 31st December 2006 did not vest for the Executives who were in ofce in 2003 because GSKs relative TSR performance was below the median and as a result the awards lapsed.
The awards made in 2003 to other senior executives, including Dr Slaoui and Mr Heslop, were dependent in part on TSR performance and in part on EPS performance.
GSK Annual Report 2006 79 REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS Remuneration Report continued The following vesting schedules apply to awards made in 2003, 2004 and 2006.

Both Aventis and Sano-Synthelabo were in the comparator group prior to their merger to form Sano-Aventis.
For the purposes of calculating TSR over the performance period for the awards granted in December 2003, the starting price of the shares of the two individual companies will be compared to the price of the merged company at the end of the performance period, adjusted by the merger ratio.
Dividends will be treated as having been reinvested during the performance period.
TSR is measured on a pro-rata basis.
Where GlaxoSmithKlines performance falls between two of the comparators, the level of vesting will be determined by the actual relative level of TSR rather than simple ranking.

The awards are subject to a 3-year vesting period and the vesting is contingent on their continued employment with GSK.

The plan closed to new entrants upon completion of the merger and no further participations have been granted.
Where a final award of ADSs is made, receipt of the award may be deferred by a Director.
Dr Garnier deferred receipt of the full amounts vested in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.
The deferred awards, together with any additional ADSs subsequently received through dividend reinvestment, are not included in the Directors interests table on page 76 since they are retained in the MTIP until paid out.

Dr Shapiro is a member of GlaxoSmithKlines scientific Advisory Board SAB.
Dr Shapiro was a member of SmithKline Beechams SAB from 1993 until the completion of the merger with Glaxo Wellcome.
Along with other members of the SAB, she received annual grants of SmithKline Beecham SARs which, in general, vested three years from the date of grant and will expire 10 years from the date of grant.
Grants of SARs to SAB members ceased in 1999.
SARs entitle the holder to a cash sum at a future date based on share price growth between the date of grant and the date of exercise.
Full provision is made in the financial statements for accrued gains on SARs from the date of grant.
In connection with the merger, all previously granted SARs became immediately exercisable.
