A D M I R A L G R O U P p l c 5 Remuneration report The following report has been approved by the Remuneration Committee the Committee and the Board for submission to shareholders.
Section 1: Information not subject to audit The Remuneration Committee The Committee is chaired by John Sussens, the Senior Independent Non-executive Director, with the other members being Martin Jackson and Margaret Johnson.
Margaret Johnson was appointed to the Committee on 4 September 2006.
Gillian Wilmot who resigned from the Committee and Board on 18 May 2006 had previously been the third Non-executive member.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters to be decided other than as shareholders.
The Chairman and Chief Executive are invited to meetings where the Committee considers it appropriate to obtain their advice on the matters under review.
The Committee determines the Admiral Group Executive Board Directors' remuneration.
The Committee also reviews and approves the fees of the Chairman of the Board.
The Committee also reviews and recommends any changes proposed to the Groups share plans, as well as having an overview of shares awarded under the terms of the Groups Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan The Unapproved Free Share Plan.
During the year the Committee did not purchase any consultancy services.
Policy on Executive Directors remuneration Two of the three Executive Directors Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens are founding Directors.
They and the Committee continue to hold the view that the significant shareholdings held by them provide a sufficient alignment of their interest in the performance of the Group with the interests of other shareholders.
In light of this, their remuneration packages consist of base salary reviewed against market rates by the Committee and benefits such as private medical cover, permanent health insurance and death in service cover.
The Group does not contribute to any pension arrangements on behalf of these Executive Directors, and it is not intended that they will participate in any Group share schemes.
Their remuneration was reviewed in May 2006 and Henry Engelhardt was awarded a rise of 5.5% taking his salary to 290,000.
David Stevens declined to accept a rise in his remuneration, which stayed at 250,000.
There is only one other Executive Director.
Kevin Chidwick joined the Board on 4 September 2006 as the Finance Director, replacing the retiring Andrew Probert.
The Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration of the Finance Director is fair and in line with market rates and is designed to provide rewards for achieving increases in shareholder value.
Remuneration report 35 - 39 6 R e M U N e R At I O N R e P O R t There are two main elements to the Finance Directors remuneration package: Basic annual salary Awards under the Unapproved Free Share Plan.
It is the Committees general strategy to pay salaries at or slightly below median levels with increased remuneration coming from the value of the awards under the Unapproved Free Share Plan.
In addition to his salary of 200,000 Kevin Chidwick received an award of 21,186 shares on 18 April 2006 and a further 18,480 on 5 September 2006 on his appointment to the Board.
The awards are the maximum number of shares that could vest after a three year period and are subject to performance criteria.
Maximum awards vest if the Groups earnings per share growth over the three year period is significantly better than a LIBOR return.
Further details of the Unapproved Free Share Plan are set out in the Financial Review.
Awards to staff under the Unapproved Free Share Plan are made upon the advice of the Chief Executive.
The Committee reviews the approach taken and approves any awards greater than 100% of salary.
The actual number of shares that vest under the scheme is dependent upon meeting the performance criteria with regard to earnings per share growth.
The remuneration of the Chairman is decided by the Remuneration Committee and that of the Non-executive Directors by the full Board.
The Non-executive Directors do not participate in meetings when Non-executive Director fees are discussed.
A summary of their contracts and remuneration is shown in the following section.
There is no minimum shareholding requirement for any Director, although the Board encourages directors to buy shares in the Company should they wish to.
