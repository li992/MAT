The Restaurant Group plc Directors remuneration report 24 Annual Report 2006 Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7a of the Companies Act 1985.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with Schedule 7a of the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee the Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The members of the committee during the year were John E. Jackson, Andrew Thomas, and Robert Ivell until his resignation from the Board on 8 September 2006, who were all independent non-executive Directors.
David H. Richardson was appointed to the Remuneration Committee on 1 February 2007.
The Committee is chaired by Andrew Thomas.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the Company other than as shareholders.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
In determining the other executive Directors remuneration for the year the Committee consulted Alan M. Jackson Chairman about its proposals.
Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibre needed to progress and develop the Group and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
In addition, the Committee determines the remuneration for the Chairman.
The remuneration of the other non-executive Directors is determined by the Board.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors: Basic annual salary including Directors fees and benefits: Annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 100% 2006: 75% of basic salary for executive Directors: Long-Term Incentive Plan awards: and Pension arrangements.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive Directors should be performance related.
As described below, executive Directors may earn annual incentive payments of up to 100% of their basic salary together with the benefits of the participation in the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
During 2006, the Company undertook a review of its remuneration and incentive arrangements for executive Directors and other senior management, with the advice of New Bridge Street Consultants LLP appointed independent advisers who provided no other services to the Group during the year, encompassing all elements of the remuneration packages.
The Committee believes that this management team will be highly attractive to other listed companies as well as private equity-backed businesses.
The retention of this team is critically important and the Committee has made some significant adjustments to their remuneration packages to ensure that there is adequate lock-in and reward for continued excellent performance and shareholder value creation.
Following the review of the remuneration and incentive arrangements of executive Directors, base salary levels have been increased and the maximum level of bonus payable has been increased from 75% to 100% of base salary.
The incremental 25% that is potentially payable to executive Directors is based on a more stretching outperformance against budget by the Group.
Furthermore, any bonus earned in excess of 75% of salary must be invested in shares in The Restaurant Group plc as part of the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The Remuneration Committee has been advised that the potential maximum level of bonus payable, as well as the total level of cash remuneration, is in line with comparable companies and the tougher targets and share-based deferral element make the plan tougher than those found in most companies.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company or Group.
There is no requirement for Directors to remit fees earned from appointments outside of the Company or Group to the Company or Group.
Basic salary An executive Directors basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and by reference to remuneration levels at other companies in the leisure and hospitality sectors.
Basic salaries were reviewed in December 2005 with increases taking effect from 1 January 2006.
They were again reviewed in December 2006 with increases from 1 January 2007.
Executive Directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to basic salary, the executive Directors receive pension contributions and certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car or car allowance, and health and life insurance.
This information has been extracted from the statutory accounts of the group which were approved on 4 April 2007.
This information in itself does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 Companies Act 1985.
The Restaurant Group plc 25 Annual Report 2006 Annual bonus payments The annual bonus is based on the achievement of stretching profit before tax targets.
Performance targets are set annually as part of the budgeting process and performance is reviewed against those targets at the end of the financial year.
The maximum performance related bonus that can be paid in respect of performance in 2007 is 100% of basic annual salary and for significant bonuses to be paid, performance must be outstanding.
Long-term incentives The Company operates the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, and the 2003 SAYE Scheme under which awards may be granted to Directors.
No further awards may be granted under the 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme or 2003 Executive Mirror Option Scheme following the introduction of the LTIP in 2005.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 9 November 2005, is the primary long-term incentive scheme of the Company.
Under the terms of the LTIP, individuals may receive an award of conditional free shares Conditional Awards with a face value at grant of up to 100% of salary per annum, vesting at least three years after grant subject to performance conditions and continued employment.
In addition, the Plan has the flexibility to grant conditional awards on a matching basis, pro rata to the number of shares purchased via annual bonus Matching Awards.
Matching Awards may be granted over shares worth up to 37.5% of base salary per annum.
The aggregate value of annual awards Conditional and Matching is capped at 137.5% of base salary.
The Committee considers that Earnings Per Share EPS and Total Shareholder Return TSR are the most appropriate measures of performance, with EPS targets rewarding significant and sustained earnings growth and TSR providing a balance to the financial performance and retaining a share price discipline in the remuneration package.
For the Conditional Awards to executive Directors to be made in 2007, two separate performance conditions apply to a proportion of the award.
These have been reviewed to ensure their continued appropriateness: The performance condition attached to 50% of the Conditional Awards requires average annual EPS growth from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009 of between RPI plus 4% to RPI plus 10% p. a. for between 30% and 100% of this part of the award to vest i. e. between 15% and 50% of the total award.
The performance condition attached to the other 50% of the Conditional Awards is based on Total Shareholder Return TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap Index over a single three-year period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009 for between 30% for median performance increasing on a straight line basis to 100% for upper quartile performance of this award to vest i. e. between 15% for median and 50% for upper quartile performance of the total award.
Awards will vest on a straight line basis between minimum and maximum thresholds.
For Matching Awards, there will be a 0.3:1 match for average EPS growth of RPI plus 4% p. a. rising on a straight line basis to the full 1:1 match for average EPS growth of RPI plus 10% p. a..
Performance against the TSR and EPS targets will be independently calculated and reviewed by the Committee.
Following the approval of the LTIP, shareholding guidelines for executive Directors have been introduced, linked to the out-turn of the Plan.
At the time Conditional and Matching Awards vest under the Plan or any other executive plan established in the future, there is a requirement to retain no fewer than 50% of the shares net of taxes until a shareholding with a market value equal to 100% of base salary is achieved.
SAYE Scheme The Company also operates a SAYE Share Option Scheme, the 2003 SAYE Scheme, for eligible employees under which options may be granted at a discount of up to 20% of market value.
Eligible employees are full time employees and executive Directors who have worked for the Group for at least one year.
Under the terms of the Scheme the eligible employees are able to purchase shares under a three-year savings contract.
Awards under the SAYE scheme were made in 2004 and 2006 to eligible employees and Directors.
Pension arrangements Executive Directors have individual pension arrangements in the form of personal pension plans.
The Company makes a contribution at a rate of up to 20% of basic salary towards funding each executive Directors pension plan.
To the extent that this funding exceeds the relevant current HMRC limit, the surplus may be paid as a salary supplement.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangement for Directors.
The Restaurant Group plc Directors remuneration report 26 Annual Report 2006 continued Performance graph As required by the Regulations, the graph below compares the Companys total shareholder return performance with the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index for each of the past five years.
The FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index has been selected for this comparison because it is the index most relevant to gauging the Companys relative performance.
Total Shareholder Return 700 600 500 400 300 200 The Restaurant Group plc FTSE All-Share Index 100 FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index Source: Thomson Financial 0 1 Jan 2002 1 Jan 2003 1 Jan 2004 1 Jan 2005 1 Jan 2006 1 Jan 2007 This graph shows the value, by 1 January 2007, of 100 invested in The Restaurant Group plc on 1 January 2002 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index.
As can be seen, performance against these two indices has been excellent.
An investment in shares in The Restaurant Group plc on 1 January 2002 would have generated a return of 542% by 1 January 2007 assuming dividends were reinvested into the shares on a net basis over the period.
Directors contracts It is the Companys policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one years notice.
However, it may be necessary occasionally to offer longer initial notice periods to new Directors.
All executive Directors have contracts which are subject to one years notice by either party.
In the event of early termination, the Directors contracts provide for compensation in line with their contractual notice period.
The details of the executive Directors contracts are summarised in the table below: Date of contract Notice period Andrew Page 28 August 2002 1 year Stephen M. A. Critoph 7 July 2004 1 year Kevin J. Bacon 17 March 2003 1 year Patricia A. Corzine 31 March 2003 1 year Non-executive Directors The service contracts of the non-executive Directors were each set for an initial three-year period thereafter renewable for periods of three years.
They are required to submit themselves for re election every three years and the Board believes this to be appropriate in the Companys circumstances.
Alan M. Jackson, Andrew Thomas and John E. Jackson were re-elected in 2006.
In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, David H. Richardson offers himself for election at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on 16 May 2007, being the first opportunity for shareholders to approve his appointment.
In accordance with best practice, John E. Jackson is standing for re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 16 May 2007 as he has served on the Board for more than nine years.
Their appointments were made as follows: Date of appointment as non-executive Director Notice period Alan M. Jackson 9 November 2005 1 year John E. Jackson 1 October 1996 nil Andrew Thomas 1 May 2001 nil David H. Richardson 1 February 2007 nil Alan M. Jackson was previously Executive Chairman of the Company, and was appointed in March 2001.
From 1 January 2006 he has held the position of non-executive Chairman.
All non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board based on a review of fees paid to non-executive Directors of similar companies and reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of each role.
The basic fee paid to the non-executive Directors excluding Alan M. Jackson in the year was 40,000.

Note 1 : Alan M. Jackson was granted an option over 2,400,000 ordinary shares on 5 June 2001 at an exercise price of 45p per share.
This option was divided into three tranches of 800,000 shares, each of which may only be exercised if certain performance criteria are met.
The Companys share price must meet a specified target, which is 75p in the case of the first tranche, 105p in the case of the second tranche and 135p in the case of the third tranche.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Group before any tranche of the option can be exercised.

Each tranche of the option will lapse six years following the date of the grant if the target share price has not by then been met.
