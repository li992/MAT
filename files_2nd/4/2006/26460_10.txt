REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board and comprises only non-executive directors.
The Committee meets regularly to determine, on behalf of the Board, the framework of executive remuneration.
During 2005 06, the Committee met on three separate occasions.
Its remit includes the remuneration of the Chairman, executive directors and the next level of senior management including the awards made under the performance related incentive schemes.
The four members of the Committee remain: Nigel Stapleton Chairman Baroness Janet Cohen Peter Meinertzhagen Robert Webb QC The Committees terms of reference, which are reviewed regularly and approved by the Board, are available on the Companys website and are summarised in the Corporate Governance Report pages 26 to 28.
The members of this Committee do not have any personal financial interests or any conflicts from cross-directorships that relate to the business of the Committee.
The members do not have any day to day involvement in the running of the Company.
For the purposes of the Combined Code 2003, Peter Meinertzhagen is the sole member not regarded as being independent for the reasons explained on pages 26 to 28.
During 2005 06, the Committee continued to utilise the services of New Bridge Street Consultants LLP.
They have been appointed by the Committee to provide professional advice on all matters relating to remuneration and have not supplied other services to the Company.
To assist the Committee, the results of market surveys are also made available and, where appropriate, the Committee also invites the views of the Chief Executive, Chairman, Director of Finance and Head of Human Resources.
These individuals did not participate in any decision relating to their own remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY The Exchange is committed to the primary objective of maximising shareholder value over time.
Each year the remuneration framework and the packages of the executive directors and the most senior executives are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they continue to achieve this objective.

the remuneration policy have been maintained.
Specifically, whilst the Company and its directors and employees have been subject to restrictions on dealings in the Companys shares due to the Takeover Code and the UKLAs Listing Rules it has not been considered appropriate for non-executive directors to receive a proportion of their fee in shares.
Throughout 2005 06, nonexecutive directors fees have been paid entirely in cash.
Awards under the LTIP for 2005 06 were made in February and March 2006 when the Company became free from sharedealing restrictions for a period of time.
This was in line with our declared intention to make awards at the earliest opportunity.
It is intended that awards for 2006, and for subsequent years, will be made as soon as possible after the announcement of final results in that year starting with an award this year.
The Share Incentive Plan SIP approved by shareholders in 2004 was not launched and no awards were made under the SAYE scheme during 2005 06.
