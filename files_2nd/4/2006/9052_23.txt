The company has additional contractual commitments to provide pension benefits to certain executives in respect of their earnings over the HM Revenue & Customs earnings cap in force before 6 April 2006.
These additional benefits are currently provided through an unfunded unapproved arrangement.
On 6 April 2006 A Day a new tax regime applicable to pension schemes came into force.
The new regime allows more flexibility in the accrual and payment of members benefits whilst still preserving the favourable tax treatment which applied to schemes approved for tax purposes by HM Revenue & Customs before A Day.
In some cases, the new regime will allow KGPP executive members the possibility of accruing higher benefits in the KGPP whilst still receiving preferential tax treatment.
In order to take advantage of this new flexibility, KGPP executive members have been given the option of accruing these benefits either on a funded basis under the KGPP or continuing to receive pension rights on an unfunded basis under the unapproved arrangement.
The new arrangements will not affect the overall benefits to the member, or increase the cost to the company.
The company has made separate accounting provision for unfunded liabilities under the unapproved arrangement.
