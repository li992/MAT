The Plan is a funded occupational pension scheme which has registered status with HM Revenue & Customs and therefore is subject to preferential tax treatment compared to unregistered schemes such as MABETUS.
It has a final salary section of which these Executive Directors are members.
For these Directors, benefits up to the earnings cap are provided by the Plan and MABETUS is used to provide benefits in excess of the cap which limits the amount of benefits which receive preferential tax treatment under a registered scheme.
The Plans main features applicable to these Executive Directors are: a normal pension age of 60: pension accrual of 1 30th of final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service: life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary: pensions payable in the event of ill health: and spouses and dependants pensions on death.
Mike Bramley has opted out of the Plan for future accrual with effect from 5 April 2006.
Death benefits up to the Lifetime Allowance will be provided by the Plan.
All other future benefits will be provided by MABETUS.
The absolute increase in accrued pension during the year.
The increase in accrued pension during the year, excluding any increase for inflation.
Accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at 60, based on service to 30 September 2006.
Members of the Plan have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions, but members of MABETUS are unlikely to benefit by doing so: neither any such contributions, nor the resulting benefits, are included in the above table.
