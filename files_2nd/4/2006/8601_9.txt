Shares to the value of 30 per cent of salary will be released at median performance.
Awards will be pro rated at every position between the median and first position in the comparator group.
The Companys relative performance is determined by reference to TSR, being the increase in the value of a share, including reinvested dividends, over the threeyear period.
This measure was chosen to incentivise participants for maximising shareholder return over the medium term.
Since the end of the financial year it has been confirmed that, as a result of the TSR calculation for the 2003 allocation, 45,410 shares will be released to Roger Matthews on 17 May 2006.
The conditional awards for Roger Matthews have been pro rated to the date he left the Company.
On joining the Company, Justin King received a cash equivalent award, which will be pro rated on a time basis over the performance period, as if he had received a conditional award under the grants made in 2003.
Based on performance and pro rated time he will receive a cash award in respect of 65,789 shares at the end of May 2006.

3 The performance conditions attaching to the award are set out on page 86.
4 The J Sainsbury plc Share Plan 2005 is a nil cost option plan.
Restricted Share Plans 2004 and 2005 As previously disclosed, Justin King and Darren Shapland gave up valuable entitlements arising from the Marks & Spencer Executive Incentive plans and the Carpetright Executive Incentive plans respectively when they joined the Company.
The Committee agreed to compensate them for these lost entitlements, but rather than making a cash payment, awards of restricted shares were made.
As the awards compensate them for lost entitlements there are no performance conditions.
Shares will be released on the vesting dates if they remain employees of the Company on the relevant dates.
The awards will vest before the release dates if their service contracts are terminated by the Company other than for cause, in the event of death or on a change of control, unless the awards are replaced by the acquiring company.
If they leave employment for any other reason, the awards will be forfeited.
