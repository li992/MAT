Remuneration committee The remuneration committee the committee comprises three independent non-executive directors and no director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The committee members during 2006 consisted of: Per Utnegaard Chairman, John Burns, and Philip Rogerson.
Since the year end John Burns has resigned from, and from 1st March, Ren Schuster will be appointed to, the committee.
The Chairman and Chief Executive are invited to attend meetings but may not take part in any discussion on matters concerning themselves.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC is the appointed remuneration adviser to the committee and provides no other services to the company.
The terms of reference of the committee are regularly reviewed and approved by the board.
The committees role includes determining the companys policy on senior executive remuneration, considering and approving the individual salaries and other terms of the remuneration packages for the executive directors and the Chairman, monitoring remuneration of other senior executives, and setting an overall framework for share schemes throughout the company.
The terms of reference are available on the companys website or upon request from the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy The committees policy is: to provide appropriate levels of remuneration to its senior executives, taking into account their experience, the size and complexity of their jobs, relevant market comparative data and any material special factors which may arise from time to time: and to ensure that a significant proportion of executives remuneration is determined by performance so as to align directors interests with those of shareholders.
In 2005 the committee, with the assistance of NBSC, undertook a formal review of the level and structure of executive remuneration which included benchmarking remuneration against a group of similarly-sized companies in the Support Services sector and also against a more general group of FTSE 250 companies of broadly similar turnover, market capitalisation and internationality.
The committee is satisfied that the revised remuneration structure arising from this review approved by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting and summarised below remains appropriate for the 2007 financial year.
The committee will keep the appropriateness of this structure under periodic review.
The remuneration packages for executive directors and other senior executives comprise what the committee considers to be an appropriate mix for a company of this nature between xed remuneration annual salary, provision of a company car, life assurance, medical expenses insurance and retirement benets and variable remuneration annual bonus and performance share awards whereby, at a target level of performance, approximately a third of the total package comprises variable remuneration.
Salaries Salaries for executive directors were reviewed and the following annual salaries, considered by the committee to be appropriate given market data and the experience and performance of the individuals, were made effective from 1st January 2007: Roger Dye 435,000 and Kevin Quinn 265,000.
Retirement benets Roger Dye has a personal pension arrangement to which the company makes payments equivalent to 30% of salary.
Kevin Quinn has a personal pension arrangement to which the company makes payments equivalent to 20% of salary.
Life assurance cover of four times salary and permanent health insurance of up to 75% of salary are also provided.
Short-term performance bonuses The maximum annual bonus for 2007 will be unchanged at 60% of base salary for senior executives, including the executive directors.
A quarter of any bonus earned must be invested in company shares for two years and will normally be forfeited if the executive leaves during that period.
80% of the bonus will be determined by demanding targets relating to group adjusted earnings per share or divisional profit performance as appropriate to the individual role.
The balance of the bonus will be based on the achievement of specic financial and developmental targets relevant to the individual.
Normally no bonus will be payable under either part of the plan unless targeted profit is achieved for the year.
Long-term incentives Senior executives, including the executive directors, receive awards of performance shares under the Davis Service Group Performance Share Plan 2006 PSP.
The committee has the ability under the PSP to make performance share awards worth up to 100% of base salary each year with a 200% limit in exceptional circumstances such as in the case of recruitment or where there are acute retention needs.
The committee intends to limit individual awards in 2007 to no more than 75% of salary.
Awards granted under the PSP will be subject to satisfaction of a performance condition whereby the companys TSR is compared with the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts over a single three-year period.
Awards will fully vest for upper quartile performance reducing on a sliding scale to 25% vesting for median performance.
No awards will vest for below median performance.
This condition was chosen to align the interests of executives and shareholders by requiring superior TSR performance compared with similar sized companies.
Additionally, to ensure that the underlying financial performance of the company is also sound, awards will only vest if the growth in the companys adjusted earnings per share as identied in our Annual Report and Accounts matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over a single three-year period.
The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2006 32 Report on directors remuneration continued To the extent that their awards vest, award holders will be entitled, at that time, to receive a payment in shares of an amount equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid on the shares subject to that award between the time when they were granted and when they vested.
The committee is keen for executive directors and other senior employees to hold shares in the group.
In support of this policy, all executives and senior employees, who receive a grant of awards under the PSP, are required to work towards holding shares with a value equivalent to 100% of their basic annual salary.
All UK employees, including executive directors, are eligible to participate in the companys sharesave plan.
Directors service agreements Both executive directors have service agreements dated 21st April 2005 and 16th May 2005 for Roger Dye and Kevin Quinn respectively which are terminable on one years notice by either party.
Upon termination, the director would receive salary, target bonus, benets and pension contribution in respect of the outstanding notice period.
Other than following a change of control, this amount is subject to mitigation if the director has obtained alternative employment which he is under obligation to seek.
Under their service agreements, executive directors are allowed subject to board approval to hold one non-executive post and retain the fee received from any such post.
Currently Roger Dye is a non-executive director of Nestor Healthcare plc and received an annual fee of 35,000 2005: 37,000 in respect of that role.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors The Chairmans annual fee is set by the Committee and is currently 100,000.
The non-executive directors receive annual fees at a level approved by the entire board, currently set at 37,500 together with an extra 5,000 if they chair a committee.
They are able to claim reimbursement of actual expenditure incurred in carrying out their duties.
There is no entitlement to participate in the companys pension scheme, bonus scheme or share schemes and no compensation is payable for early termination of their contracts or terms of ofce.
The Chairman has been appointed for a xed term of three years to April 2008, terminable at three months notice by either party.
The terms of ofce of non-executive directors are for periods not exceeding three years which can be terminated by either party giving one months notice.
These terms of ofce are subject to shareholders approval when non-executive directors seek re-election at annual general meetings.
Total shareholder return TSR The Committee believes that the FTSE Mid 250 Index Share price graph Total shareholder return Davis Service Group TSR vs. FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts excluding Investment Trusts is the most suitable index against which to compare the historic TSR of the company, due to the 300 Davis Service Group Total Return Index FTSE Mid 250 excluding Investment Trusts Total Return Index size of the company and because the constituents of the index 250 are used as comparators in the PSP.
The adjacent chart shows 200 the TSR of the company compared with the index over the five year period to 31st December 2006.
