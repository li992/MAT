37 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 REMUNERATION REPORT The Remuneration Report is presented to shareholders by the Board and sets out the remuneration policies operated by the Company and details the remuneration of each director.
The Remuneration Report will be put to the Annual General Meeting for approval by the shareholders.
This vote is advisory only.
The Board has an established Remuneration Committee, the members of which are disclosed on page 32.
During the year New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC continued to provide advice on directors remuneration and the Companys share incentive schemes and the Group HR Director was also invited by the Committee to provide advice.
NBSC provided no other services to, and has no other connection with, the Company.
A review of the requirements for external advice on remuneration and incentive schemes has resulted in Kepler Associates Kepler replacing NBSC as advisers to the Remuneration Committee and Group HR in the early part of 2007.
Kepler provides no other services to, and has no other connection with, the Company.
Remuneration policy In determining the remuneration packages of the executive directors, the Committee has regard to two fundamental principles: The importance of attracting, motivating and retaining management of the highest calibre: and Linking reward to the Groups performance.
The Committee has applied, and continues to apply, these principles to develop remuneration packages which: Provide a competitive base salary designed to attract and retain executive directors of the highest calibre and to reflect their role and experience: Provide incentive arrangements which are subject to challenging performance targets, reflect the Companys objectives and recognise the importance of providing sustained motivation of management to focus on annual, as well as longer-term, performance: and Align the interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Committees approach is that a substantial proportion of the overall remuneration package should be linked to performance, through participation in short-term and long-term incentive schemes.
For on-target performance the expected ratio between fixed and performance based remuneration will be 43% to 57%, excluding pensions and benefits.
The Committee constantly reviews developments in executive remuneration and relevant corporate governance practice and determines remuneration packages with regard to the prevailing pay and benefits conditions across the Groups markets.
Remuneration package of executive directors The main components are: Base salary and benefits Base salary and benefits are determined on an annual basis by the Committee after a review taking into account the individuals performance, market trends and the performance of the Group as a whole and, where relevant, the performance of the business for which the executive is responsible.
For guidance, the Committee has regard to available research and published remuneration information on companies within the same industry and markets in the countries in which the executives are based.
Base salaries prevailing at the date of this report are: Robert Lerwill 658,350: Jeremy Hicks 339,900: Adrian Chedore 345,000: Mainardo fide Nardis 468,000 and David Verklin 420,000.
A summary of the benefits payable to executive directors is given on page 40.
As reported on page 29 Alicja Lesniak is joining the Company as Chief Financial Officer and her base salary will be 375,000.
Bonus schemes All of the executive directors participate in the Groups Annual Cash Bonus Scheme based upon a mix of group financial targets profit before tax and management charges and achievement of personal objectives and, in the case of directors with operational responsibilities, business regional performance.
The committee believes that linking short-term incentives to profit targets helps to reinforce the companys business objectives.
This may result in the payment of cash bonuses of up to 75% of base salary 100% for the Chief Executive Officer.
For on-target financial performance, one half of the maximum bonus opportunity is payable in the case of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and one third is payable in the case of Adrian Chedore, David Verklin and Mainardo fide Nardis.
In addition, Adrian Chedore, David Verklin and Mainardo fide Nardis participate in a separate deferred annual cash bonus scheme based on achievement of a demanding year on year excess profit above target financial performance of the businesses for which they are responsible.
This additional plan has been in operation in order to provide competitive total cash remuneration using, as a benchmark, other media businesses and to reflect their critical contribution to the business.
This additional bonus is potentially worth up to 200% of base salary.
It should be noted that the cap is set in relation to extremely stretching levels of performance as it is based on profit in excess of the existing plan for these individuals.
Each year end any bonus earned under the plan is accrued to a personal bonus pool.
Only half of the bonus pool is then paid out in any one year with the remaining 50% being carried forward to the following year end.
This deferred bonus pool will normally be forfeited in the event that the director leaves the Group.
Actual payouts have averaged 35% of salary since inception.
Share-based incentives At the 2003 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved the adoption of a new 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme and a new 2003 Performance Share Plan.
These schemes replaced all of the previous share-based incentive schemes and were designed to comply with changes in the guidelines issued by institutional shareholders and reflect developments in market practice.
i 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme In any financial year, an executive can receive share options worth at market value no more than three times basic salary in normal circumstances.
The exercise of options is based upon the Companys earnings per share EPS growth relative to inflation RPI, and the following performance conditions will apply to options granted in 2007: 38 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 REMUNERATION REPORT AVERAGE ANNUAL EPS GROWTH IN EXCESS OF RPI PROPORTION OF OPTION GRANTS EXERCISABLE 3% Up to 0.5 x salary 3% to 7% 0.5 to 1x salary pro rata on a straight line basis 7% to 12% 1 to 2 x salary pro rata on a straight line basis 12% to 17% 2 to 3 x salary pro rata on a straight line basis Following a review by the Remuneration Committee in 2005, the EPS growth targets were increased as detailed above for grants made in 2005 and 2006 in recognition of the outlook for the business, to ensure that performance conditions remain appropriately stretching.
The committee has reviewed the EPS condition again in March 2007 and believes that the targets as detailed above continue to be appropriately challenging.
EPS growth targets for awards made in 2003 and 2004 are detailed on page 41.
These EPS performance conditions are tested after three financial years beginning with the year in which options are granted.
For grants made after 31 December 2004 there is no provision for retesting.
To the extent that the performance conditions are not satisfied, the options lapse.
ii 2003 Performance Share Plan In any financial year, an executive can receive a conditional award of shares worth at market value no more than two times basic salary in normal circumstances.
However, normal awards are one and a half times salary for the CEO and one times salary for other Executive Directors.
The extent to which awards vest is determined partly by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to a group of similar businesses and partly by reference to the Companys EPS growth relative to RPI.
The following TSR targets apply: TSR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO PEER GROUP PROPORTION OF AWARD VESTING Median or below Nil 1st or 2nd 50% For intermediate performance Nil to 50% pro rata on a straight line basis The following companies will be included in the peer group for calculation of TSR performance: Dentsu Inc. Reed Elsevier plc Havas S. A. Taylor Nelson Sofres plc IPSOS S. A.
The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. Omnicom Group Inc.
The News Corporation Limited Pearson plc Viacom Inc. Publicis Groupe S. A. WPP Group plc The committee has reviewed the constituent members of the TSR comparator group and the vesting schedule in March 2007 and believes that the current mix of companies remains appropriate and the stretching vesting schedule will reward strong relative performance.
The following EPS performance conditions apply: AVERAGE ANNUAL EPS GROWTH IN EXCESS OF RPI PROPORTION OF AWARD VESTING 3% or less Nil 15% 50% 3% to 15% Nil to 50% pro rata on a straight line basis The committee has reviewed the EPS condition in March 2007 and believes that the targets as detailed above continue to be challenging.
These TSR and EPS performance conditions are tested after three financial years beginning with the year in which awards are made.
There is no provision for retesting.
To the extent that the performance conditions are not satisfied, the awards lapse.
The assessment of these performance conditions will be carried out by Kepler, in its capacity as adviser to the Committee.
In relation to EPS measurement, the Remuneration Committee will ensure that a consistent basis of measurement is used during the transition to international financial accounting standards.
The use of EPS for both options and part of the performance share award is considered appropriate after recognising the difference between the two incentives and the different level at which the EPS ranges are targeted.
The Committee believes that using both EPS growth and TSR for awards under the Performance Share Plan provides a balanced incentive between assessing the Companys relative returns to shareholders and its underlying financial performance.
For share options, the sole use of EPS as a performance condition is considered an appropriate underpinning performance condition to the requirement inherent in an option to grow the share price.
The blend between EPS and TSR performance conditions and the two different types of plan are considered to provide a well-rounded incentive for the Companys executives.
39 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 REMUNERATION REPORT Overall, the value of long-term incentives is considered to be in line with arrangements at peer companies and provide an appropriate balance to other elements of the directors remuneration package.
No further awards will be made under the previous closed schemes, although awards granted in the past will continue to be exercisable in accordance with the rules of each respective scheme.
The closed schemes are the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme and the 1998 Management Incentive Scheme.
Details of the 2003 schemes and the performance conditions of these and the closed schemes are given on pages 37, 38, 41 and 42.
Details of all share incentive awards outstanding for each executive director serving during 2006 are set out on pages 41to 43.
Pensions Jeremy Hicks participates in an Inland Revenue approved group personal pension scheme.
Mainardo fide Nardis and Robert Lerwill have chosen not to join the group personal pension scheme and instead receive an appropriate level of additional salary with which to make their own pension arrangements.
Pensionable salary is limited to base salary excluding all bonuses and other benefits.
No changes to pension arrangements were made as a result of A-day and no compensation has been provided for any increased tax due.
Adrian Chedore and David Verklin have arrangements in line with local Hong Kong and USA respectively market conditions and statutory obligations.
Annual employer pension contributions or salary equivalent payments are shown in the Audited Directors Remuneration table on page 40.
Service contracts Details of the service contracts of those who served as executive directors during the year are set out below.
All directors have rolling service contracts which expire at normal retirement age unless terminated beforehand in accordance with the terms of the individual contract.
All contracts contain non-compete obligations.
NAME CONTRACT DATE NOTICE PERIOD FROM COMPANY NOTICE PERIOD FROM DIRECTOR Robert Lerwill 22.02.05 12 months 6 months Adrian Chedore 21.02.03 12 months 6 months Jeremy Hicks 09.02.01 12 months 6 months Mainardo fide Nardis 18.08.06 12 months 6 months David Verklin 01.07.98 6 months 6 months NOTES: Mainardo fide Nardis has a contract of employment which contains a liquidated damages clause providing for a payment equal to one years basic salary should the company commit a repudiatory breach of his contract of employment within 12 months from the date of commencement of employment.
This clause expires on 18 August 2007.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this provision is reasonable and appropriate given the circumstances surrounding the Company it was in an offer period at the time of the negotiations with Mainardo fide Nardis for him to join the Company.
David Verklin retains a contractual entitlement on termination of an amount equal to 12 months salary and benefits in addition to any payments in respect of his normal 6 months notice period.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this provision is appropriate in this instance given the need to retain a key senior operational executive in the context of highly competitive market conditions in the USA.
No payment will be made to Jeremy Hicks related to his resignation.
Details of the treatment of his outstanding share options and performance share plan awards on the cessation of his employment are set out on pages 42 and 43.
Unless there are exceptional circumstances, it is the Companys policy that under any new service contracts, notice periods to be given by the Company will not exceed 12 months.
In addition, new contracts will not normally include liquidated damages clauses and any termination payments will be calculated on normal contractual principles taking into account a directors duty to mitigate loss.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of three years with a one month notice period.
Renewal of appointments for a further term of three years is not automatic.
The fees of the non-executive directors are approved at a board meeting at which the non-executive directors do not vote.
Fees are based on time commitment and responsibility and are regularly reviewed, taking advice from Kepler.
Fees are disclosed on page 40.
Non-executive directors have letters of engagement rather than service contracts and do not receive benefits or pension contributions and do not participate in any Group incentive scheme.
Benefits relate to the provision of a car, life assurance, disability and health insurance and, in the case of Adrian Chedore resident in Hong Kong, a housing allowance of 65,963 and home leave allowance of 2,932. b.
The main terms of the bonus schemes are summarised on page 37.
For executive directors, whose annual cash bonus is determined by the Companys financial performance, between 66% and 71% of the maximum potential was earned in respect of 2006.
For executive directors, whose annual cash bonus is determined by business regional performance, between 25% and 50% of the maximum potential was earned in respect of 2006 for the annual cash bonus and between 0% and 48% of maximum potential was earned in respect of the deferred bonus.
The annual cash bonus figure for Mainardo fide Nardis shows the walk-in arrangements agreed on his joining the Company.
The deferred annual cash bonus figure for Adrian Chedore includes 179,000 following a reassessment of the basis of calculation for three prior years bonuses.
David Verklins annual cash bonus includes 105,097 in respect of his additional responsibilities for Asia Pacific in 2005. c. During 2006 Leslie Van fide Walle had a standing instruction through the Companys brokers to use his fees received monthly net of taxes to purchase shares in the Company.
This arrangement ceased with effect from 1 January 2007.
It is the Boards policy that executive directors with external non-executive positions are allowed to retain any fees from such positions.
However, before an executive director can accept an external non-executive position permission must be sought from the Chairman who will take into consideration the amount of time involvement.

No further options or Performance Share Plan awards would be granted unless executives retained shares in accordance with these guidelines.
Performance graph The following graph illustrates the Companys TSR between 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2006 relative to the FTSE All Share Media Index, in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Aegis Group plc is a member of the FTSE All Share Media Index and the Remuneration Committee considers that a comparison of the Companys TSR relative to similar businesses is more appropriate than a comparison with a general FTSE Index, in order to reduce the impact of general stock market trends.
