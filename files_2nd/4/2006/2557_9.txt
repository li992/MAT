As far as is practicable it pursues a consistent policy of terms and conditions across the divisions.

1 Executive Directors The Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate the Executive Directors to maintain the profitable growth of the business.
As far as possible, it is the Committees intention to align Executive Directors interests with those of the shareholders.
Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Committee after a review of individual performance and having regard to competitive practice.
All of the Executive Directors are eligible to participate in a short term incentive scheme for which targets are set annually by the Remuneration Committee.
Currently these relate to improvements in profit before taxation and goodwill amortisation on a basis consistent with previously reported UK GAAP, the achievement of working capital targets and personal objectives.
The maximum payable under the scheme during 2005 2006 was 65% of basic salary.
For the financial year 2006 2007, the maximum payable under the scheme will be 65%.
All of the Executive Directors participate in long term incentive schemes, details of which are set out overleaf.

23 Report of the Remuneration Committee Long Term Incentive Schemes There were three schemes in operation during the year: 1.
The BSS Group PLC Performance Share Plan: A new performance share scheme, the BSS Group PLC Performance Share Plan the Plan, was approved at the Annual General Meeting on 21st July 2005.
This plan will be used as a means of incentivising employees, including senior management and Executive Directors, to maintain the profitable growth of the Company such that their interests continue to be aligned with those of the shareholders.
The Plan is structured to reward performance where the Company achieves strong growth in earnings per share in excess of growth in the Retail Prices Index RPI.
For initial awards under the Plan, such performance will be measured over three financial years ended 31st March 2006, 31st March 2007 and 31st March 2008.
The principal features of the Plan are as follows: participants will receive a promise of free shares subject to meeting specific performance conditions: and vesting of awards will only take place once the performance conditions have been satisfied.
With a view to linking rewards to performance, average EPS growth per annum for the first award shall result in vesting as follows: Growth in EPS average per annum over RPI Vesting Less than 5% EPS No part of the award will vest Between 5% and 10% inclusive Straight line proportionate vesting between 30% and 100% inclusive More than 10% EPS 100% of the award will vest In order to fund part of this plan, the Group purchased 90,000 of its own shares on 30th November 2005.
It is the intention of the Group to seek this authority to make purchases of its own shares on an annual basis.
The BSS Group PLC Approved and Unapproved Share Option Scheme: Under the Approved and Unapproved Share Option Schemes, options were granted at 175.83 pence rebased for the 4:1 share split, as detailed on page 26, on 1st June 2004.
The options are exercisable from 1st June 2007 to 1st June 2014 and can only be exercised if the following cumulative earnings per share EPS target is met: Year Ending 100% Exercise EPS 50% Exercise EPS March 2005 65.5p 63.2p March 2006 72.4p 70.0p March 2007 81.9p 76.1p Cumulative EPS 219.8p 209.3p Below the 50% target none of the options will vest.
For EPS performance between 100% exercise and 50% exercise there will be interpolation to achieve an intermediate position.
EPS will be calculated based on a pre-goodwill amortisation and pre-exceptionals basis and under the rules of UK GAAP prevailing at the time of grant.
The cumulative actual EPS over the three years ending 31st March 2007 will be compared with the cumulative EPS targets as set out above to determine whether any of the options will vest and if so how many.
The maximum number of shares or share options granted to any Director in any one year is equivalent to one year of basic salary.
There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for share options granted in the prior two financial years.
Phantom Share Options: Phantom share options held under the Long Term Incentive Plan at the start of the year, which with the announcement of last years results fulfilled the conditions of vesting, are as follows: there are no outstanding commitments under the phantom share option scheme at 31st March 2006 Phantom Shares Option price at grant Date of Grant Gain on exercise P S Wood retired 87,719 285.00 pence 19th March 2001 664,910 P S Wood retired 155,038 322.50 pence 19th September 2001 1,117,017 K M Higginson 39,215 255.00 pence 18th April 2001 309,014 K M Higginson 46,511 322.50 pence 19th September 2001 335,103 Pre-share split.
