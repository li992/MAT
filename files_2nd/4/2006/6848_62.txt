The HMRC earnings cap restricts the pension that the scheme can provide for Michael Shallow.
The scheme pension was, therefore, supplemented through a funded unapproved pension arrangement, operating on a targeted defined contribution basis.
The companys contribution to the fund for the period was 130,477 2005 - 88,300.
As a result of the agreement reached with Michael Shallow on his departure, the company has no further liability towards his fund.
Similar restrictions apply to the pensions for Rooney Anand and David Elliott who prior to A-Day participated in funded unapproved arrangements operating on a defined contribution basis.
The company made a contribution towards the tax liabilities incurred from payments to funded unapproved arrangements and these contributions are disclosed as other cash benefits in the emoluments data shown above.
Since A-Day both Rooney Anand and David Elliott have established self-invested personal pension schemes.
Justin Adams, Ian Bull and Mark Angela have also established self-invested personal pension schemes since A-Day.
During the year and prior to ADay, the company accrued contributions for them, to the tune of 13,959, 11,640 and 27,399 respectively, representing the amount which would have been contributed by the company towards a funded unapproved arrangement for those directors, together with interest at a rate of 4% per annum.
These contributions have been paid into the directors' self-invested personal pension schemes.

Save as set out above, there have been no changes to the date of this report.
Options issued under the schemes can only be exercised if a performance condition has been met.

Following Michael Shallow's resignation on 31 December 2005, the remuneration committee determined, as permitted by the rules of the scheme, that he should be entitled to receive a proportion of the benefits due to him under the LTIP, based on his length of service since each of the awards, taking into account the extent to which the performance conditions had been met during the relevant period.
As a consequence 47,076 shares in respect of the 2003 award and 21,538 shares in respect of the 2004 award were transferred to Michael Shallow following his resignation, with the remaining awards lapsing.
