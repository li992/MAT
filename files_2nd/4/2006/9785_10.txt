The accrued entitlement at 1 April 2006 or date of leaving represents the deferred pension at age 60 based upon the actual leaving date of 30 April 2005.
The additional pension relates to the increase in the deferred pension during the year gross and net of inflation under the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, and the Listing Rules respectively.
The transfer value of the deferred pension calculated as at 1 April 2006, or date of leaving, has been calculated at the actual leaving date of 30 April 2005 and is based on factors supplied by the actuary of the relevant Company pension scheme in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The equivalent transfer value calculated as at 2 April 2005 is on the assumption that the director had left service at that date.
Inflation has been assumed to be equivalent to the actual rate of price inflation which was 2.7% for the year to 30 September 2005.
The measurement date accords with the Listing Rules.
The transfer values are the lump sums which could have been paid to another pension scheme for the benefit of the director.
It is not possible for a transfer value to be paid directly to the director personally.
Stuart Rose, Ian Dyson and Steven Sharp do not participate in the Company Pension Scheme.
