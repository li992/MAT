Policy overview In determining remuneration policies for the current, following and subsequent financial years, the Committee has followed the provisions of Section B of the Combined Code.

The objective of the Committee is to ensure that the remuneration of directors and of senior managers is adequate to attract, retain and motivate high calibre management.

The Committee has adopted a revised policy are entitled to invest up to 50% of their short term bonus for the previous year in Boots requiring executive directors to achieve by 2010 or within five years of appointment, shares in return for a matching opportunity of up to 2:1.
The size of the match depends on if later, and retain, a holding in the companys shares having a value equivalent to one EPS growth over a three-year performance cycle.

The rules of the plan allow the performance target to be changed in executive directors for achieving operating efficiencies and profitable growth in the relevant such circumstances, provided that the adjusted targets are materially neither easier nor year by reference to challenging but achievable targets derived at the beginning of the year more difficult to satisfy than when the award was first granted.
It also rewards personal performance.
The maximum short term bonus that could be earned in the year 2005 06 was 100% of base salary.
One-third of the available bonus depended on individual performance against personal targets, and twothirds depended upon business performance targets for operating profit one-third of the available bonus, sales and return on capital one-sixth each.
Achieving the targets set by the Committee on all business measures would generate a bonus of 50% of the maximum bonus available for those measures.
The business targets were chosen for their relevance in driving short term performance of the business.
The Committee has decided in respect of 2006 07 that, if the proposed merger with Alliance UniChem becomes effective, then performance to the effective date of the merger will be measured, and business targets for the remainder of the year reviewed to ensure their continued relevance.
