Report on directors remuneration Remuneration committee On 23rd May 2006, Mr Yeatman stood down as a director of the company and was replaced on the committee by Mr Corbyn who then served with Mr Neathercoat under the chairmanship of Mr Farnes for the rest of the year.
Following the merger with London Merchant Securities plc, Mrs fide Moller and Mr Newell joined the committee.
None of the members who have served during the year had any personal interest in the matters decided by the committee, nor any day to day involvement in the running of the business and, therefore, are considered to be independent.
During the year, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP provided the performance statistics required to operate the share option scheme and long term incentive plan.
They provide no other services to the company.
No director had any involvement in determining his own remuneration although some of the matters considered by the committee were discussed with Mr Burns.
Policy The committees objective in formulating the remuneration policy for the executive directors is to ensure that the company attracts, employs and motivates executives that have the skills and experience necessary to make a significant contribution to the delivery of the groups objectives.
When setting the level of remuneration, the committee aims to achieve broad comparability with other FTSE 250 companies that have delivered similar long term returns to shareholders whilst having particular regard to the levels of remuneration prevailing in the property sector.
The committee recognises the importance of aligning, as far as possible, the interests of the directors with those of the shareholders.
To this end, a combination of basic salary, annual bonus and long-term incentives is used, by which the committee aims to provide a significant proportion of the directors total remuneration through performance related elements.
Service contracts The service contracts of Messrs Burns, Silver and Odom are dated 20th May 1997 whilst those of Messrs George and Williams are dated 31st March 1999.
The contracts have no stated termination date but require 12 months notice of termination by the company or six months notice by the executive.
A provision is included whereby the company will pay, by way of liquidated damages, a cash amount equivalent to 12 months salary and benets in kind plus a pension contribution or salary supplement of at least 20% of basic salary.
Mr Friedlos has a service contract dated 1st February 2007, which terminates when he reaches the age of 65.
It is also terminable by the company giving 12 months notice or Mr Friedlos giving six months notice.
The contract provides similar benets as those for the other executive directors, except for the following provision.
For six months from 1st February 2007, the contract preserves Mr Friedloss right which was previously contained in his service contract with LMS Services Limited to terminate his employment, by giving at least one months notice, and claim predetermined compensation of 536,758.
This right arose as a consequence of the change of control of London Merchant Securities plc.
The remuneration committee reviews the service contracts periodically.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts and are appointed for three year terms which expire as follows: Mr Ivey, 12th December 2008: Mr Neathercoat, 28th February 2008: Mr Farnes, 31st March 2009: Mr Corbyn, 23rd May 2009: Mrs fide Moller and Mr Newell, 31st January 2010.
Mr Rayne has a letter of appointment, which runs for three years, expiring on 31st January 2010.
In addition to his fee as chairman, it provides for a car, driver and secretary, together with a contribution to his ofce running costs.
His letter of appointment also contains provisions relating to payment in lieu of notice, which are similar to those of the executive directors.
Basic salary and benets Basic salaries for executive directors are reviewed annually by the remuneration committee having regard to the remuneration policy set out above.
Pension contributions for the six executive directors are based solely on basic salaries and paid into a dened contribution scheme.
Directors may, if they so elect, receive, at no extra cost to the company, a salary supplement in lieu of their pension contribution.
The principal benets in kind comprise a company car and medical insurance.
The remuneration for non-executive directors, which consists of fees for their services in connection with board and board committee meetings and, where relevant, for additional services such as chairing a board committee, is set by the whole board.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate in the companys bonus or equity based incentive schemes.

If the growth in NAV is less than the IPD Index, no proportion of Part B will vest.
