f This Retained Incentive Opportunity is specific to Robert E Diamond Jr, under which he retains an opportunity broadly equivalent to a prior opportunity to participate in a Barclays Capital long-term incentive arrangement.
It is intended to maintain close alignment of reward with Robert E Diamond Jrs continued contribution to the performance of Barclays Capital.
The performance measure is the cumulative EP performance of Barclays Capital during the period 1st January 2005 to 31st December 2007.
To achieve the maximum potential value shown above, Barclays Capital would need to generate cumulative EP of 2bn over the performance period.
If EP for the performance period is less than 500m, Robert E Diamond Jr will not be eligible for any award.
If the minimum performance requirement of 500m EP is met, the potential value of the award would be in a range of 0.65m to 1.08m.
The potential value of the Retained Incentive Opportunity between 500m cumulative EP and 2bn cumulative EP is subject to a performance curve graduated to deliver higher proportionate value at higher levels of cumulative EP.
Robert E Diamond Jr must normally be in the employment of the Barclays Group on the vesting date, to remain eligible.
In determining the potential value of the Retained Incentive Opportunity, the Committee will take into account Robert E Diamond Jrs individual contribution during the performance period, and the underlying financial health of the Barclays Group.
The amount and basis for determining any entitlement under the Retained Incentive Opportunity will not be altered to the advantage of Robert E Diamond Jr without prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
g Under the Retained Incentive Opportunity, 50% of any potential award would be payable in cash on the vesting date.
A recommendation would be made to the trustee of ESAS for an award of Barclays shares, in the form of a provisional allocation, in respect of the remaining 50%.
Any shares under the ESAS award would be releasable after 12 months from the award date.
The Retained Incentive Opportunity is not pensionable.

The performance condition for the 1999 ESOS grant was met.
b Under ISOP, executives were awarded options at market value over Barclays shares which are normally exercisable after three years.
The number of shares over which options can be exercised depends upon performance against specific performance conditions.
For ISOP awards granted in 2000 to 2003, the first 40,000 target shares under option for each award was subject to an EP performance condition, tested over a period of three years.
Any amount above 40,000 target shares was subject to a relative TSR performance condition, to be tested initially over three years.
Because the TSR performance condition was not met over three years in relation to the awards in 2003, the TSR condition was tested over a period of four years from the original start date.
Awards in 2004 were subject to a relative TSR performance condition.
For the 2003 and 2004 grants under ISOP, which become exercisable in 2007, Barclays was ranked sixth in the peer group under the TSR performance condition.
This was sufficient for only 25% of the maximum number of shares under the TSR condition to vest.
c Robert E Diamond Jr received a grant under the BGI EOP in March 2004.
He was not a Director of Barclays PLC at that time.
The BGI EOP is an option plan, approved by shareholders in 2000 and offered predominantly to participants in the US.
Under the BGI EOP, participants receive an option to purchase shares in Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited.
The exercise price is based on the fair value at the time of grant.
The option normally vests in three equal tranches on the first, second, and third anniversary of the date of grant.
Participants must, in accordance with the Articles of Association of Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited, keep their shares for 355 days after the date of exercise, before they may be offered for sale.
In line with market practice, the options were not subject to performance conditions.
Robert E Diamond Jr is not eligible to receive further awards under the BGI EOP.
The shares shown in respect of the BGI EOP in the above table are shares in Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited.
d The number of shares shown for ISOP options represents the target award shares under option, or the actual number of shares under option if the award had vested as at 31st December 2006.
The target number of shares takes account of the stretch in the performance condition and the probability of vesting.
e The independent trustee of the Barclays Group PSP Employees Benefit Trust granted Matthew W Barrett a share award in 1999 comprising an option on similar terms to options granted under ESOS.
For convenience these are described as granted under ESOS in the above table.
f Frits Seegers was appointed as an executive Director on 10th July 2006 and therefore no participation in the above plans has been offered to him.
g Nothing was paid by the participants on the grant of options.
