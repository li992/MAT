Remuneration policy on executive directors remuneration The Companys remuneration policy is formulated to attract and retain high-calibre executives and motivate them to develop and implement the Companys business strategy in order to optimise long term shareholder value creation.
It is the intention that this policy should conform to best practice standards and that it will continue to apply for 2007 and subsequent years, subject to ongoing review as appropriate.
The policy is framed around the following key principles: total rewards will be set at levels that are suf ciently competitive to enable the recruitment and retention of high-calibre executives: total incentive-based rewards will be earned through the achievement of demanding performance conditions consistent with shareholder interests: incentive plans, performance measures and targets will be structured to operate soundly throughout the business cycle: the design of long term incentives will be prudent and will not expose shareholders to unreasonable financial risk: in considering the market positioning of reward elements, account will be taken of the performance of the Company and of the individual executive director: and reward practice will conform to best practice standards as far as reasonably practicable.
Representatives of the Companys principal investors are consulted on changes to remuneration policy.
Elements of executive director remuneration CEO expected values 3.1 Remuneration mix Each executive directors total remuneration consists of salary, annual bonus, long term incentives and bene ts.
An appropriate balance is maintained between xed and performance-related remuneration and 31% between elements linked to short term financial performance and those linked to longer term shareholder 34% value creation.
35% Assuming on-target performance, the Committees policy is that at least 50% 60% for the chief executive or more of total executive director remuneration is performance-related.
In 2006, 69% of the chief executives remuneration on an expected-value basis was performance-related: for the other executive Fixed directors, on average, the gure was 64% see illustrative charts.
Performance-related annual bonus Performance-related The Bonus Share Plan BSP and the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP are designed to align the longer term long term incentives interests of shareholders and executives and to underpin the Companys performance culture.
The Committee monitors the relevance and appropriateness of the performance measures and targets applicable Average other executive directors to both plans.
Further details of the BSP and of the LTIP are set out below and on page 68. expected values 3.2 Basic salary The basic salary of the executive directors is reviewed annually and is targeted at the market median of companies of comparable size, market sector, business complexity and international scope.
This is adjusted 34% either way based on experience and other relevant factors.
The market for executives of main board calibre, 36% in large international resource companies in particular, is currently very competitive and it is therefore deemed sensible to position basic salary for executive directors at no lower than the median point.
30% Company performance, individual performance and changes in responsibilities are also taken into consideration in setting salary levels each year.
Fixed 3.3 Bonus Share Plan BSP Performance-related annual bonus The BSP was first operated in 2004 and all executive directors are normally eligible to participate in it.
Performance-related long term incentives The BSP requires executive directors to invest a signi cant proportion of their remuneration in shares, thereby more closely aligning their interest with those of shareholders, and encourages management at all levels to build up a meaningful personal stake in the Company.
Awards under the BSP are made annually and consist of three elements: a performance-related cash element: Bonus Shares as a conditional award to a value equal to the cash element: and an additional performance-related element in the form of Enhancement Shares.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 | 67 ANGLO AMERICAN plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 REMUNERATION REPORT These bonus awards are not pensionable.
The BSP operates as follows: the value of the bonus is calculated by reference to achievement against annual performance targets which include measures of corporate and, where applicable, business unit performance as well as the achievement of speci c individual objectives.
For executive directors, the corporate element is based on stretching Earnings Per Share EPS targets which are calculated using underlying earnings reconciled in note 11 of the financial statements.
The key individual objectives are designed to support the Companys strategic priorities and in 2006 included safety improvement, strategy implementation, production growth, people management, succession planning, cost reduction and operational ef ciencies: the Committee reviews these measures annually to ensure they remain appropriate and suf ciently stretching in the context of the economic and performance expectations for the Company and its operating businesses: in 2006, 60% of each annual bonus was based on the corporate or business measure and the remaining 40% on key personal performance measures.
The level of bonuses payable is reduced if certain overall safety improvement targets are not met.
Bonus parameters are set on an individual basis: in the case of the directors and top tier of management, half of the bonus is payable in cash.
The maximum cash element has been 90% of basic salary in the case of the chief executive and 75% of basic salary for the other executive directors from 2007, the maximum cash element for the new chief executive will be 75% as outlined on page 74.
The maximum bonus would only be paid for meeting targets which, in the opinion of the Committee, represent an exceptional performance for the Group.
The other half of the bonus is in the form of a conditional award of Bonus Shares equal in value to the cash element.
These Bonus Shares vest only if the participant remains in employment with the Group until the end of a three-year holding period or is regarded by the Committee as a good leaver : and VESTING OF ENHANCEMENT SHARES in order to encourage continuing focus on medium term performance, executive directors also receive a conditional award of Enhancement Shares at the same time as the award of Bonus Shares.
The maximum potential, at face value, of the Enhancement Shares is 75% of the face value of the Bonus 75% Shares i. e. in the case of the chief executive a maximum of 68% of basic salary.
Awards of Enhancement Shares made in 2006 will vest after three years only to the extent that a challenging performance condition real EPS growth, based on earnings per share growth against growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI is met see illustrative chart.
33% Real EPS growth is viewed as the most appropriate performance measure for this element of the BSP because it is a fundamental financial performance indicator, both internally and externally, and links directly to the Companys long term objective of improving earnings.
The targets have been approved by the Committee after reviewing performance over a number of years and have been set at a level which provides 0% RPI RPI RPI RPI RPI RPI RPI stretching performance levels for management.
At the end of each performance period, the level of 0% 3% 9% 9% 12% 15% 18% performance achieved and the proportion of awards vesting will be published in the subsequent Real EPS growth over three years remuneration report.
3.4 Share options and all-employee share schemes No share options were granted to executive directors under the Companys Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS in 2006 and there is no intention to make future grants under the ESOS to executive directors.
However, the ESOS is retained for use in special circumstances relating to the recruitment or retention of key executives.
Executive directors remain eligible to participate in the Companys Save As You Earn SAYE and Share Incentive Plan SIP schemes.
As these schemes are offered to all UK employees, performance conditions do not apply to them.
3.5 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Grant levels Conditional LTIP awards are made annually to executive directors.
The maximum grant level under the LTIP is 200% of basic salary.
It is anticipated that in 2007, grants under the LTIP will be made at 175% of basic salary for all the executive directors, including the new chief executive.
The Committee is content that the performance conditions that need to be satis ed for these awards to vest in full are suf ciently stretching in the context of the award levels.
In determining annual award levels, the Committee also gives consideration to market competitiveness and has set the levels taking account of median expected value of long term incentives relative to other companies of a similar size.
These awards are discretionary and considered on a case-by-case basis.
Performance measures As in previous years, vesting of the LTIP awards made during 2006 is subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets relating to Total Shareholder Return TSR and to an operating measure, currently return on capital employed ROCE, over a xed three-year period.
68 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 Additional percentage of Bonus Shares acquired Half of each award is subject to a Group TSR measure while the other half is subject to a Group ROCE measure.
These performance measures were selected on the basis that they clearly foster the creation of shareholder value and their appropriateness is kept under review by the Committee.
At the end of each performance period, the level of ROCE performance achieved and the level of award earned will be published in the subsequent remuneration report.
There is no retesting of performance.
The LTIP closely aligns the interests of shareholders and executive directors by rewarding superior shareholder return and financial performance and by encouraging executives to build up a shareholding in the Company.
Total shareholder return TSR The Committee considers comparative TSR to be a suitable long term performance measure for the Companys LTIP awards.
Executives would bene t only if shareholders have enjoyed returns on their investment which are superior to those that could have been obtained in other comparable companies.
For awards made from 2005 onwards, the portion of each award that is based on TSR is measured 50% against the Sector Index and 50% against the constituents of the FTSE 100.
Maximum vesting on the TSR element of an award will only be possible if Anglo American outperforms by a substantial margin both the sector benchmark as described below and the largest UK companies across all sectors.
Maximum vesting of the whole LTIP award, would, in addition, depend on the Companys performance exceeding demanding ROCE targets also as described below.
Taken as a whole, vesting depends on a very challenging set of performance hurdles.
Sector Index comparison One half of the TSR element of an LTIP award vests according to the Companys TSR over the performance period, relative to a weighted basket of international natural resource companies the Sector Index.
Up until the end of 2006, the Sector Index comprised three categories: the first consisted of six international diversi ed mining companies, the second of four international paper and packaging companies, and the third of four international industrial minerals companies.
From the start of 2007 the paper and packaging element will no longer be part of the Index because of the imminent demerger of the Groups paper and packaging division.
The Committee may amend the list of comparator companies in the Sector Index, and relative weightings, if circumstances make this necessary for example, as a result of takeovers or mergers of comparator companies.
In calculating TSR it is assumed that all dividends are reinvested.
For awards made in 2006, the companies constituting the Sector Index were as follows up until 31 December 2006.
After this date the percentage attributable to Paper and Packaging will fall to zero : Mining Paper and Packaging Industrial Minerals Category weighting 78% 13% 9% Comparator companies BHP Billiton plc Sappi Limited CRH plc CVRD SCA Hanson plc Rio Tinto plc Stora Enso Oyj Holcim Limited Teck Cominco UPM-Kymmene Group Lafarge Vedanta Resources plc Xstrata plc Target performance for the Sector Index is assessed by calculating the median TSR performance within each sub-sector category, and then weighting these medians by the category weightings shown above.
Shares contingent upon the Sector Index element of the TSR performance will vest as follows: The Companys relative TSR compared to the Sector Index % Proportion of TSR element vesting Below Target 0 Target matching the weighted median of the Sector Index 20 Target plus 5% per annum 50 Target plus 7.5% per annum or above 75 Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between the levels shown in the table above.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 | 69 ANGLO AMERICAN plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 REMUNERATION REPORT FTSE 100 Comparison The vesting of the other half of the TSR element of an LTIP award will depend on the Companys TSR performance over the performance period compared with the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index, as follows: The Companys relative TSR compared to the FTSE 100 % Proportion of TSR element vesting Below the median TSR of the FTSE 100 0 Equal to the median TSR of the FTSE 100 20 Equal to the 90th percentile TSR of the FTSE 100 50 Above the 90th percentile TSR of the FTSE 100 75 Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between the levels shown in the table above.
The targets above were calibrated such that for the TSR element of the award there is approximately a 10% chance of achieving full vesting and a 25% chance of two-thirds vesting.
These probabilities were assessed by  LLP using the same Monte Carlo model used for calculating fair values of the LTIP under IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
The estimated average fair value of an award under the TSR element is 48% of the value of shares awarded.
Graphs showing the Companys TSR performance against the weighted average of the Sector Index and against the FTSE 100 for the five years from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006 can be found on page 73.
Return on capital employed Group ROCE is the second performance measure for LTIP grants.
The Committee considers this to be among the most important factors which drive sustainable improvements in shareholder value in a natural resources business, as well as one of the most important measures of differentiation in performance in this sector.
The proportion of shares vesting based on Group ROCE will vary according to the degree of improvement in the Groups average annualised ROCE over the performance period.
Unless certain minimum targets for improvement in returns on both capital employed for the financial year preceding the start of the performance period existing capital employed and on the additional capital employed during the performance period incremental capital employed, no shares will vest under this performance measure.
The maximum ROCE targets are based on stretching levels of return on the existing capital employed.
The ROCE targets for each element conditionally awarded in 2006 are shown below.
These are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects, capital in progress and for relevant changes in the composition of the Group.
Existing capital employed Incremental capital employed Minimum ROCE Target 21.3% 10% Maximum ROCE Target 23.3% 10% The ROCE elements of the award vest as shown in the table below: Proportion of ROCE element vesting Below or equal to the Minimum Target 0% Equal to or greater than the Maximum Target 100% Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between the Minimum Target and the Maximum Target.
70 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 3.6 Vesting of share incentives in the event of change of control or termination of employment In the event of a change of control of the Company, the following provisions apply under the Companys incentive plans: share options granted under the former ESOS may be exercised irrespective of whether the applicable performance conditions have been met: the number of shares that vest under the LTIP will be calculated by reference to the extent to which the applicable performance conditions have been met at the time of the change of control: Bonus Shares awarded under the BSP will be released, but Enhancement Shares awarded under the BSP will vest on change of control, to the extent that the performance condition has been met at the time of the change of control: SAYE options may be exercised to the extent of savings at the date of exercise : and participants may direct the SIP trustee as to how to deal with their SIP shares although Matching Shares may be forfeited in some circumstances.
In the event that a directors employment is terminated, vesting of outstanding share options under the former ESOS is dependent upon the reasons the contract is terminated.
Performance conditions fall away in the event of redundancy.
However, if the executive resigns voluntarily, then all such options lapse unless the Committee determines otherwise.
In the case of LTIP interests, if a director resigns voluntarily, then his interests lapse.
If he is made redundant, vesting at the end of the performance period is based on the normal performance criteria and then pro rated for the proportion of the performance period for which the director served.
In the case of the BSP, if a director ceases to be employed before the end of the year in respect of which the annual performance targets apply, then no award will be made unless the Committee determines otherwise taking into account the proportion of the year for which the director was an employee of the Group and of performance to date against the annual performance targets at the date of cessation.
If a director resigns voluntarily before the end of the three-year vesting period, the Bonus Share awards lapse and the Enhancement Shares are forfeited.
If a director is made redundant, Bonus Share awards will be transferred as soon as practicable after the date of leaving and the Enhancement Shares will vest at the end of the performance period, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
3.7 Employee Share Ownership Trust and policy on provision of shares for incentive schemes The Group established an Employee Share Ownership Trust the Trust in 1999 to acquire and hold shares to facilitate the operation of the Companys share schemes.
As at 31 December 2006, the trust held 19,856,385 ordinary shares in the Company, registered in the name of Greenwood Nominees Limited.
Shares held by the trust are not voted at the Companys general meetings.
It is the Companys current policy and practice not to use newly issued shares to meet the requirements of share incentives.
Such shares are provided from the Trust or from Treasury or by market purchase.
3.8 Pensions Pension and life insurance bene ts for executive directors re ect practice in the countries in which they perform their principal duties.
Details of individual pension arrangements are set out on pages 79 and 80.
During the year, in the light of the new UK pensions regime which applied from 6 April 2006, the Committee decided that it would consider requests from executive directors that their contracts be altered for future service, so that further pension bene ts are reduced or cease to accrue and that a pension allowance be paid having the same value as the fide ned contribution bene ts forgone.
Similarly, the Committee decided that it would consider requests from executive directors as is the case for employees more generally that their contracts be altered for future service, so that supplementary pension contributions are made into their fide ned contribution pension arrangements, in return for equivalent value reductions in their future basic salary and or the cash element of the BSP.
3.9 Other bene ts Executive directors are entitled to the provision of either a car allowance or a fully expensed car, medical insurance, death and disability insurance, social club membership in accordance with local market practice, limited personal taxation financial advice and reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
The provision of these bene ts is considered to be market-competitive in the appropriate locality for executive director positions.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2006 | 71 ANGLO AMERICAN plc ANNUAL REPORT 2006 REMUNERATION REPORT 4.
Executive shareholding targets Within five years of their appointment, executive directors are expected to acquire a holding of shares with a value of two times basic salary in the case of the chief executive and one times basic salary in the case of other executive directors.
The Committee takes into consideration achievement against these targets when making grants under the Companys various long term incentive plans.
At 31 December 2006, all executive directors with more than one years service on the Board had met or exceeded their shareholding targets.
External appointments Executive directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or of ces without the approval of the Board: if approved, they may each retain the fees payable from one such appointment.
During the year ended 31 December 2006, Ren Mdori retained fees from one such appointment, amounting to 47,000.
Policy on non-executive directors remuneration Non-executive directors remuneration is approved by the Board as a whole on the recommendation of the chairman and executive directors.
The Companys policy on non-executive directors remuneration is based on the following key principles: Remuneration should be: suf cient to attract and retain world-class non-executive talent: consistent with recognised best practice standards for non-executive directors remuneration: in the form of cash fees, but with the exibility to forgo all or part of such fees to acquire shares in the Company if the non-executive director so wishes after deduction of applicable income tax and social security contributions : and set by reference to the responsibilities taken on by the non-executives in chairing the Board and its committees.
Non-executive directors may not participate in the Companys BSP, share option schemes, LTIP or pension arrangements.
The Board reviews non-executive directors fees periodically to ensure they remain market-competitive.
Additional fees are paid to the chairmen of Board committees and to the senior independent director SID.
Where non-executive directors have Executive Board roles within subsidiaries of the Company, then they may also receive additional remuneration on account of these increased responsibilities.
With the exception of Bobby Godsell, who is remunerated by AngloGold Ashanti Limited in his capacity as its chief executive, none of the non-executive directors has any such role.
Chairmans fees The chairmans fees are reviewed periodically on a different cycle from the review of non-executive directors fees.
A recommendation is then made to the Board in the absence of the chairman by the Committee and chief executive, who take external advice on market comparators.
Directors service contracts Cynthia Carroll and Simon Thompson are employed by Anglo American Services UK Limited: Tony Trahar and David Hathorn have contracts with Anglo American International IOM Limited and with Anglo Operations Limited and Ren Mdori is employed by Anglo American International IOM Limited.
It is the Companys policy that the period of notice for executive directors will not exceed 12 months and the employment contracts of all executive directors except that of Cynthia Carroll are terminable at 12 months notice by either party.
As part of Cynthia Carrolls terms upon joining the Company, her initial notice period will be 24 months, which will reduce to 12 months after the initial 12 month period.

Further details on the structure of the LTIP, the required level of performance for the 2006 award and how performance against targets is measured can be found on pages 68 to 70.
The market price of the shares at the date of award was 20.72.
2 The performance period applicable to each award is three years.
The performance period relating to the 2003 LTIP awards which were granted on 11 April 2003 ended on 31 December 2005.
Vesting was subject to two performance conditions: the first based on the Companys TSR relative to a weighted group of international natural resource companies and the second based on an underlying operating measure which focused on improvements in the Companys ROCE in the medium term.
Part of each award was based on the TSR measure and part on the operating measure.

The ROCE targets are a function of targeted improvement in returns on existing capital employed at the start of the performance period and targeted returns in excess of the cost of capital on new capital investment over that period.
The entry level target for any LTIP has been the actual return achieved on the capital employed, excluding capital work in progress, in the year immediately preceding the commencement of the performance period.
In order to maintain the effectiveness of the plan in driving long term performance, the actual returns in the final performance year are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects e. g. translation windfalls, capital in progress to re ect the fact that mines under construction absorb large amounts of capital before producing a return, for relevant changes in the composition of the Group e. g. signi cant acquisitions and disposals and other one off factors which would otherwise result in a misleading outcome.
The threshold blended target i. e. the target on existing and new capital for the performance period for the 2003 LTIP was 18.8% and the upper blended target 20.3%.
The ROCE achieved was 21.1% and the outcome on this element of the LTIP was thus 100%.
On the TSR measure, Anglo American achieved a TSR over the three year performance period of 129% which generated a nil vesting in terms of the 2003 Comparator Group.
The overall vesting level for those directors with a 50% Group ROCE, 50% TSR split was therefore 50%.
3 In addition to the LTIP award disclosed above, Ren Mdori was in June 2005 granted 50,600 forfeitable shares, of which 30,360 were released to him on 1 May 2006 and 20,240 will be released to him on 1 May 2007.
These awards are conditional on his continued employment in the Group and are in partial compensation for long term incentives forgone at his previous employer.
The market price of the shares at the date of this award was 13.34.

Mercer undertook the review at the request of the chairman of the Committee in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration processes followed are appropriate and that the Committee has complied with the policies set out in the Remuneration Report.
In order to reach our opinion, we reviewed the Committees Terms of Reference and the minutes of its meetings held during the year as well as material presented to the Committee for its review.
We also interviewed the Chairman and Secretary of the Committee.
Our review was not intended to audit the compensation data set forth in the Remuneration Report or to evaluate the merits of Anglo Americans remuneration programme.
Based on our review, Mercer is of the opinion that the processes followed by the Committee during 2006 were fully consistent with its Terms of Reference and that the decisions taken by the Committee were in line with the principles set out in the Remuneration Report.
It continues to be our view that the Committee takes a suitably robust and pro-active approach to its work.
We note the Committee has re ned its modus operandi each year taking into account any comments we have made in our reviews.
In addition, the Committee has taken steps to improve its processes re ecting areas for improvement highlighted in the Evaluation of the Committee undertaken with input from external advisors.
As a result we believe that the Anglo American Remuneration Committee is exemplary in its conduct, decision making and reporting.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are regularly updated on executive compensation and corporate governance matters.
Further detail regarding the Mercer review is included in a letter of this date addressed to the Committee Chairman which we understand will be made available on the Companys website.
