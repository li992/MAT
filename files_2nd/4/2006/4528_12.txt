REMUNERATION REPORT This report for the year ended 2 September 2006 has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the provisions of the Combined Code relating to directors remuneration.
At the Annual General Meeting on 12 December 2006 shareholders will be asked to approve the report.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is comprised exclusively of independent non-executive directors of the Company.
It is chaired by Richard Gillingwater and its other members are Adam Crozier, Peter Long and Dennis Millard.
The members of the committee have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
The committee keeps itself informed of all relevant developments and best practice in the field of remuneration and corporate governance and seeks advice where appropriate.
KPMG LLP has been appointed as external adviser to the Remuneration Committee and has provided advice on directors remuneration and share plans.
The committee has appropriate policies and procedures to monitor the size of potential remuneration awards and KPMG verify the methodology used to model potential outcomes.
KPMG have no other connection with the Company except that they advise on matters relating to the Companys share and pension plans.
The Chairman, Human Resources Director and Group Company Secretary also assist the committee by providing advice, except in relation to their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committees remit is set out in its terms of reference, which are published on the Companys website.
Its delegated responsibilities include setting the remuneration of all executive directors and the Chairman.
Since Admission the re-listing of the Company on the London Stock Exchange on 9 May 2006 there have been two meetings of the Committee attended by all members except that due to holiday commitments Adam Crozier did not attend the meeting on 24 August.
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the board and is made up of an annual fee for acting as a non-executive director of the Company and fees for chairing and for membership of a board committee.
The non-executive directors do not take part in discussions on their own remuneration.
The fees are set to reflect the time which they are required to commit to their duties, their experience and the amounts paid to non-executive directors in comparable companies.
Remuneration policy The Companys policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages that will attract, retain and motivate directors and other individuals of the quality required to successfully run the business.
The remuneration policy is designed to support the business strategy, align executives interests with shareholders and be cost effective.
In constructing the remuneration packages, the committee aims to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and variable compensation for each executive.
Accordingly a significant proportion of the remuneration package depends on the attainment of demanding performance objectives, both shortand long-term.
The annual bonus is designed to incentivise and reward the achievement of demanding financial and non-financial corporate and individual objectives.
Long-term share plans are designed to align the interests of executives with the longer-term interests of shareholders.
The Performance Share Plan, in which the executive directors participate, has performance measures that reflect both shareholder value total shareholder return and underlying financial performance through the earnings per share measure.
Excellent results have been achieved in the three years when the Company was able to motivate its directors and employees within a private company environment and the Remuneration Committee considers it important that this approach to remuneration should be maintained so far as possible.
Basic salary The committee normally reviews the executive directors and other senior executives remuneration annually against companies similar in size and sector.
This year that review was carried out at the time of Admission as well as at the year end and KPMG provided data for the purpose of the review.
The committee sets salaries at levels to reflect the individuals position, responsibilities, experience and performance.
The committee also considers executive salary increases in the context of salary increases across the Group's wider employee population.
39 Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2006 REMUNERATION REPORT Annual bonus Executive directors and other senior executives participate in a discretionary annual bonus plan that provides for payment of cash bonuses subject to achieving pre-determined annual performance targets.
In normal circumstances, executive directors could potentially earn an annual bonus of up to 100 per cent of salary subject to the achievement of stretching sales, profit and cash flow targets, and specific strategic objectives.
In the year under review an additional bonus was paid to Michael Sharp following the Admission of the Company to the London Stock Exchange.
In determining the bonus targets each year the committee takes into consideration the business strategy, the long-term business plan, prevailing trading and economic conditions, shareholder expectations and competitor forecasts.
The following sections relating to long-term share plans including the former incentive arrangements, directors emoluments, pension, the share schemes, total shares options outstanding and directors shareholdings have been audited.
Long-term share plans The Company gained approval in advance of Admission to put in place certain long-term share plans, details of which are set out below in the section headed Debenhams current long-term incentive arrangements.
When the Group was private share schemes were put in place for senior executives and managers and details of those schemes are given in the section headed Debenhams former incentive arrangements.
No further awards will be made under these schemes.
In order to maintain the retention element of the schemes, 70 per cent of the BELP shares and 50 per cent of the options will not be transferred or become exercisable until 365 days after Admission.
Debenhams current long-term Incentive arrangements The Company has gained approval for and adopted this year the Debenhams Deferred Bonus Matching Plan, Debenhams Performance Share Plan, the Debenhams 2006 Executive Share Option Plan, the Debenhams 2006 Sharesave Sheme and the Debenhams 2006 Sharesave Scheme Ireland the Debenhams share plans.
Awards were made following Admission under the Debenhams Performance Share Plan and the Debenhams 2006 Executive Share Option Plan.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to grant awards under any one, a combination or all of the Debenhams share plans in any one year.
When exercising their discretion to grant awards the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration the overall quantum and structure of the compensation package.
The Debenhams Performance Share Plan the PSP The PSP is intended to facilitate the retention of senior executives of the Company and to align their interests with those of shareholders by enabling executives to receive shares the number of which is determined by the extent to which a performance condition is achieved on vesting provided that they remain employed in the Group.
Awards under the PSP comprise an option to receive free shares or a nil cost option.
Awards under the PSP were made to 107 senior executives on 9 May 2006, over a total of 3,350,452 shares, including to the executive directors as follows: Market price 3 September Date at date Number Exercised Lapsed 2 September Name 2005 of grant of award of shares in year in year 2006 Rob Templeman nil 9 May 2006 205p 468,750 468,750 Chris Woodhouse nil 9 May 2006 205p 318,750 318,750 Michael Sharp nil 9 May 2006 205p 296,250 296,250 40 Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2006 A further award was made on 6 June 2006 to one senior executive, over 3,113 shares.
These awards will normally vest on the preliminary announcement of the results in October 2008 and the maximum value of the shares subject to these awards was accordingly reduced to recognise the fact that they will vest over a period of two and a half years rather than the normal three-year period.
No awards may be granted to an individual in any financial year over a maximum number of shares whose market value is greater than 200 per cent of that individuals gross annual rate of salary at the date of grant although the Remuneration Committee has a discretion, in exceptional circumstances which include recruitment, to grant awards over shares with a market value of up to 250 per cent of gross annual salary at the date of grant.
An award will normally only vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant two and a half years in the instance of the first award subject to performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time awards are granted and if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Company over the performance period is sufficient to justify the vesting of the award.
Half the initial PSP awards are subject to a performance target based on the adjusted earnings per share EPS growth of the Company above the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index RPI over a three-year performance period starting at the end of the 2004 05 financial year.
Adjusted EPS was chosen as the Remuneration Committee considers it to be a key underlying value driver of the business that will focus managements attention on continued growth and profitability.
The remaining half of the initial PSP awards are based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR against the weighted TSR of each company in the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index over a three-year performance period starting at the end of the 2004 05 financial year.
The weighted TSR is the aggregate of the TSR of each company in the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index weighted by their respective market capitalisations at the start of the relevant three-year performance period.
A three-month average TSR at the start and end of the performance period will be used to mitigate the effect of any potential spot share price volatility.
The committee considers TSR to be an approximate proxy for shareholder value and it chose this comparator group as Debenhams and its main listed general retail competitors are a constituent of the index.
The committee determined that a weighted index is a fairer and more reasonable method of determining relative performance as opposed to a conventional TSR ranking as it factors in the size of each comparator company and therefore the absolute levels of value that each company generates relative to its size.
When determining the maximum TSR target, the committee took into consideration the historical TSR performance of the comparator companies over the last ten years.
The current maximum target of 12 per cent per annum above the index broadly equates to upper quartile TSR performance.
The initial awards granted on Admission will vest as follows: Percentage growth over the performance Percentage of period of Debenhams underlying EPS award that vests Below RPI 14 per cent per annum None RPI 14 per cent per annum 30% RPI 21 per cent per annum 100% Between 14 per cent and 21 per cent per annum Straight-line basis between 30% and 100% Performance of Debenhams against the FTSE 350 Percentage of General Retailers Index of companies by reference to weighted TSR growth award that vests Debenhams TSR is less than the weighted TSR of the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index 0% Debenhams TSR is equal to the weighted TSR of the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index 30% Debenhams TSR is equal or more than 12 per cent per annum above the weighted TSR of the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index 100% Between the latter two points Straight-line basis between 30% and 100% 41 Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2006 REMUNERATION REPORT If one or both of the performance conditions are not met at the end of the performance period, 50 per cent or 100 per cent as appropriate of the awards will lapse immediately and there will no opportunity to re-test the relevant performance condition.
The Remuneration Committee may set different performance conditions for future awards and may decide that different conditions should be applicable to different executives awards depending on their job function.
The Remuneration Committee intends to make an award under the PSP during the 2006 07 financial year.
The Debenhams 2006 Executive Share Option Plan the ESOP The ESOP allows the Company to grant options to acquire shares to eligible employees.
Options granted under the ESOP may either be Her Majestys Revenue & Customs approved options up to the prescribed limit or unapproved options.
Share options were granted over 2,916,251 shares on 9 May 2006 to 589 senior managers at an option price of 205 pence being the middle-market price at the close on the grant date.
A further grant was made on 6 June 2006 to 15 employees, over 58,870 shares, at an option price of 185 pence the closing price on that date.
These options will normally become exercisable following the end of a three-year performance period based on the end of the 2004 05 financial year a period of two and a half years from the date of grant.
The maximum market value of shares over which options may be granted to an employee under the unapproved part of the ESOP in any financial year as measured at the date of grant may not be greater than 100 per cent of the employees annual basic salary at the date of grant.
However, the Remuneration Committee has a discretion, in exceptional circumstances which include recruitment, to grant awards over shares with a market value in excess of this amount.
The exercise of options will be subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition, which will be stated at the date of grant.
For the initial grant of options the performance condition will require that earnings per share growth will be at least equal to the percentage increase in RPI 14 per cent per annum over a period of three years commencing with the 2004 05 financial year.
There will be no re-testing of the performance condition.
No options under the ESOP were granted to executive directors during the year.
The Remuneration Committee intends to grant options under the ESOP during the 2006 07 financial year but not to executive directors or other senior executives who participate in the PSP.
EPS In both plans, the PSP and the ESOP, EPS growth is measured by comparing the Companys annualised EPS for the base year and for its final year on a compound annual growth basis.
In determining the EPS targets, the committee takes into consideration the business strategy, the longterm business plan, prevailing trading and economic conditions, shareholder expectations and competitor forecasts.
Under the rules of both plans, to ensure comparability of financial years of the Company within the EPS performance period and for the base year, the Remuneration Committee may following consultation with its independent advisers and the Companys external auditors adjust the reported figure for earnings per share as calculated in accordance with the relevant accounting standard including adjustments to achieve consistent measurements of performance during the transition to international accounting standards to arrive at a figure that is a fair and reasonable reflection of the underlying business performance of the Group.
Such adjustments to the base year for the initial awards, on which the Remuneration Committee has consulted with its advisers and the external auditors, shall include, but are not limited to, adjusting the issued share capital on a comparable basis, excluding exceptional items, adjusting for the effect of a 53rd week, adjusting for the effect of incremental costs or charges, adjusting for property profits no longer accruing, adjusting for the effect of interest on pre-Admission levels of borrowing and adjusting to reflect the underlying tax rate.
42 Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2006 Debenhams 2006 Sharesave Scheme the Sharesave Scheme Under the Sharesave Scheme, employees may be granted an option to acquire shares at a fixed exercise price.
At the end of the savings period the employee may either exercise the option within six months of the end of the savings period using the savings contributions and bonus which he has accumulated or have the savings and bonus repaid to him.
No options have been granted under this scheme The Debenhams Deferred Bonus Matching Plan the DBMP Under the DBMP participants will be able to invest up to the full amount of their annual bonus on an after-tax basis in shares.
If the participant remains in service for three years, he will, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target, be eligible to receive a matching share award based on the pre-tax amount of the bonus that has been invested.
The Remuneration Committee has not determined what performance conditions will apply to awards under the DBMP although it is intended that they be appropriately demanding and linked to the Companys performance.
If the performance target is not met at the end of the performance period, the awards will lapse immediately and there will be no opportunity to re-test the performance condition.
No awards have yet been made under the DBMP.
Directors service agreements and letters of appointment It is the Companys policy to minimise the termination obligations of directors contracts recognising however the market requirements for executive directors contracts.
The arrangements set out below reflect the Companys policy.
The non-executive directors have each entered into a letter of appointment as set out below: Date of joining Date of letter of Position Annual fee the Group appointment Philippe Costeletos Non-executive director 40,000 8 September 2003 24 April 2006 Adam Crozier Independent non-executive director 45,000 9 May 2006 18 April 2006 Jonathan Feuer Non-executive director 40,000 8 September 2003 24 April 2006 Richard Gillingwater Senior independent non-executive director 62,500 9 May 2006 20 April 2006 Peter Long Independent non-executive director 45,000 9 May 2006 24 April 2006 Dennis Millard Independent non-executive director 55,000 9 May 2006 10 April 2006 Guido Padovano Non-executive director 40,000 8 September 2003 24 April 2006 Paul Pindar Independent nonexecutive director 50,000 9 May 2006 19 April 2006 The appointments may be terminated by either party giving one months notice and are subject to the provisions of the Companys Articles.
The terms of appointment of the non-executive directors are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours and at the AGM.
Richard Gillingwater waived his fee during the financial year ended 2 September 2006: it has been paid from 3 September 2006 as he then became part-time Chairman of the Shareholder Executive and as such able to receive his non-executive fees.
John Loverings appointment is terminable by either party giving not less than one months written notice.

Each executive director entered into a new service agreement with the Company on 3 May 2006.
Each agreement is terminable by either party giving not less than 12 months written notice, save that Michael Sharp is required to give the Company six months notice.
The Remuneration Committee has considered the financial consequences of early termination of directors service contracts.
If the Company terminates the employment of an executive director by exercising its right to pay in lieu of notice, or terminates the employment other than in accordance with the terms of his service agreement, the Company is required to make a payment equal to the aggregate of the executive directors basic salary for the notice period, the value of his contractual benefits for the notice period and an amount equal to the average of the annual bonus paid to the executive director in the two years prior to the termination of his employment.
