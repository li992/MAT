He also received a conditional award over 73,500 shares on May 2, 2006.
Following his resignation, on October 31, 2006 his outstanding entitlements over 241,160 shares held under the LTIP lapsed.
3 S N Vivian, a former Executive Director of the Company, left on June 30, 2003.
He retained certain entitlements to the conditional shares awarded to him under the LTIP prior to the date of him leaving.
Under the 2003 Award, which vested on March 1, 2006 as detailed above, 27,444 shares vested to S N Vivian.

5 During the period January 1, 2007 to February 22, 2007 there was no change in the interests of Executive Directors in the LTIP.
Conditional awards under the LTIP will usually be made annually and the maximum annual level of award is 200% of basic salary.
Awards vesting under the LTIP are not pensionable.
Share Option Plan Executive Directors and a selected number of senior executives from the Companys worldwide operations during the period 2001-2005 participated in the Share Option Plan.
Under this Plan, participants were granted options over a number of shares during the period 2001-2005 but the proportion of those shares under option which may be exercised is subject to the achievement of performance targets over a three year performance period set by the Committee.
To the extent an option or part of an option becomes capable of being exercised at the end of the three year performance period it will ordinarily remain exercisable at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant.
The economic value added and TSR performance targets for the conditional options granted to Executive Directors in the years ending December 31, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 were the same as for the awards made in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 to the Executive Directors under the LTIP, as detailed above, with no retesting.
Consequently, for the grant made in 2004, it is anticipated that 65% of the number of shares under option will become exercisable following the end of the three-year performance period.
biz 65 The table below shows the numbers of shares under option of Executive Directors relating to conditional grants made under the Share Option Plan.
2 On September 1, 2006, J C Nicholls exercised options over 24,000, 17,325 and 71,349 shares at exercise prices of 473.3p, 461.75p and 290.4p per share, respectively.
Following his resignation, on October 31, 2006 the outstanding options over 167,660 shares held by J C Nicholls under the Share Option Plan lapsed.
3 S N Vivian, a former Executive Director of the Company, left Hanson on June 30, 2003.
The option grants made to him and outstanding at the date of leaving remained subject to the performance criteria as outlined above.
Following the end of the three year performance period 56% of the shares under the conditional options granted on March 1, 2003 became capable of being exercised.
In respect of this grant, S N Vivian became entitled to an option over 27,444 shares at an exercise price of 290.4p per share.
He exercised his option on September 28, 2006 and has no outstanding option entitlements remaining.
4 During the period January 1, 2007 to February 22, 2007 there were no changes in the interests of Executive Directors in options under the Share Option Plan.
No grants of options were made in 2006 and no further grants of options will be made under the Share Option Plan.
Any gains made under the Share Option Plan are not pensionable.
Sharesave Scheme Many Hanson employees in the UK have built up an equity interest in the Company through the UK HM Revenue & Customs approved savings related Sharesave Scheme where options may be granted at a discount of up to 20% to the market price at the date of grant.
The term of options granted could be from three to seven years and any option is conditional on a commitment by the participant to make regular savings from pay.
The savings are held by an independent Sharesave provider to buy shares at the end of the option period.
The exercise of options under the Sharesave Scheme can be satisfied by the issue of new shares or the transfer of existing shares.
At December 31, 2006, there were approximately 3,250 participants in the Sharesave Scheme and the number of shares under options granted to Executive Directors under the Sharesave Scheme are shown in the table below: Market Gain on Balance at Granted Exercised price at date Balance at Exercise price exercise during Range of Jan 1, 2006 during year during year of exercise p Dec 31, 2006 p the year exercise dates A J Murray 1,530 1,530 611 6 09-11 09 G Dransfield 3,099 3,099 318 12 07-05 08 1,993 1,993328 06 09-11 09 Notes 1 Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme during the year were at an exercise price of 611p per share, being a 20% discount to the market price on March 16, 2006.

3 During the period January 1, 2007 to February 22, 2007 there were no changes in the interests of Executive Directors in options under the Sharesave Scheme.
Any gains made under the Sharesave Scheme are not pensionable.
The range of the market quotations for Hanson shares, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List, during the period January 1 to December 31, 2006 was 616.5p to 784.5p.

Performance review The following graph shows the TSR performance of the Company and that of the FTSE 100 Index over the five-year period to December 31, 2006.
The FTSE 100 Index was selected due to its broad range of constituents of a large capitalisation, of which Hanson is a constituent company.

Termination payments are limited to the Directors normal compensation, including basic salary, annual incentives and benefits, for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Pension entitlement will also accrue for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
In the event that Hanson terminates a service contract without notice, the unexpired portion of the notice period will count towards the calculation of entitlements under the Companys LTIP and Share Option Plan: these awards would still remain subject to their respective performance conditions.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts with Hanson.
Each is appointed at the will of the Company and the Chairman and Non-executive Director concerned under the terms of an appointment letter.
The terms and conditions of employment of the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors are available on request from the Company Secretary.
External appointments The Company acknowledges that its Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other leading companies and that such Nonexecutive duties can broaden experience and knowledge to the benefit of Hanson.
Executive Directors are limited to one such Non-executive position and the policy is that fees may be retained.
J C Nicholls was a Non-executive Director of Man Group plc during the period January 1 to July 20, 2006, in respect of which he received fees of 41,532.
No other such positions are held by any of the other Executive Directors.
Pensions The Executive Directors are members of a defined benefit plan the pension plan which, in accordance with HM Revenue & Customs HMRC limits, provides them with a maximum pension of two-thirds of basic salary on retirement.
The pension plan is contributory until such time as the Director has completed the maximum pensionable service allowed under the pension plan.
For service accruing after July 1, 2004 member contributions are 7.5% of pensionable salary which does not include bonuses.
The Executive Directors have a normal retirement age of 60, with the right to receive early retirement pensions to be paid from age 55 in certain circumstances.
In preparation for the HMRC tax simplification changes for pensions, which became effective on April 6, 2006, the Committee reviewed the impact of the proposals on all employees, including the Executive Directors.
The approach adopted, following recommendations from the independent advisor to the Committee, was for solutions which were essentially cost neutral to the Company with no compensation for changes in tax legislation.
A contribution was made to the provision of independent financial advice for the affected individuals, including the Executive Directors.
Under the new tax regime, each member now has a Lifetime Allowance LTA initially set at 1.5m and a new tax, called the recovery charge, is levied at retirement if the value of their pension benefit from all sources exceeds this amount.
However, for any member whose total benefit on April 6, 2006 exceeded the LTA, transitional arrangements allowed them to register the higher value so that they would not be subject to a large retrospective recovery charge.
To qualify for this enhanced protection the member was required to opt out of pension plan membership as regards future service accrual.
A J Murray and G Dransfield elected to opt out of pension plan membership as regards future service accrual as a result of registering for enhanced protection with HMRC.
An unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme UURBS has been arranged in respect of A J Murray to provide an accumulation of benefit no greater than a total pension promise of two-thirds of final pensionable salary.
An appropriate provision has been made in respect of the UURBS which at December 31, 2006 was 237,000.
As G Dransfield had already completed the maximum pensionable service allowed under the pension plan, no further arrangements were put in place for him.

It was Hansons policy to provide executives with appropriate benefits outside of the pension plan in relation to that part of their salary which exceeded the cap.
The contributions made during the year were subject to income tax as a benefit in kind and the Executive Director concerned J C Nicholls, for whom a contribution of 77,785 was made on April 1, 2006 was liable to settle the tax liability himself.
