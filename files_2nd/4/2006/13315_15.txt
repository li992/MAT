Each executive directors total remuneration consists of the above elements and other benefits described on page 52.
The total remuneration of each executive director should comprise a balance between fixed and variable performance-related remuneration, the latter comprising elements of both short-term financial performance and long-term shareholder value creation.
The table below shows the approximate mix between fixed and variable pay for on-target performance in respect of 2006 remuneration for the current executive directors.
The policy, currently and in future years, is that a significant proportion of the total remuneration should be performance-related.
On-target performance Chief executive Chief financial officer Base salary 45% 50% Pensions 10% 10% Annual incentive 20% 25% Long-term incentive 25% 15% Base Salaries Executive directors base salaries are reviewed with effect from 1 January each year.
The committee takes into account company performance and the experience and contribution of individuals.
Deloitte has been appointed by the committee and provides the committee with market analysis, using data for companies of comparable size and complexity.
Bonuses At the start of each financial year, the committee sets the performance measures and targets that must be met if a bonus is to be paid under the Senior Executives Bonus Scheme.
The performance measures are designed to focus senior management on the business priorities for the coming financial year and align executives interests with those of shareholders.
With regard to the Senior Executive Bonus Scheme 2006, approximately 500 senior executives were eligible to participate in the scheme.
The performance measures related to group divisional business profit and turnover, as appropriate, as well as non-financial personal objectives.
Threshold performance levels must be achieved for bonuses to be payable.
Cash bonus entitlements under this scheme were subject to a maximum of 50% of basic salary: 80% for members of the CEB: and 100% for the chief executive.
Bonuses are typically awarded in March following the end of the financial year to which they relate.
The maximum bonus for the chief financial officer, who is an executive director, has been increased for 2007 to 100% of basic salary.
47 Rentokil Initial plc [Directors Remuneration Report] Long-term Incentives At the 2006 annual general meeting, shareholders approved a new Performance Share Plan designed to enable executive directors and other employees selected on a discretionary basis to earn shares in the company based on achieving stretching performance targets.
The principal features of the plan are as follows: Awards are made over shares with a face value set by reference to a multiple of base salary, which vest subject to the achievement of performance conditions over a three year period.
Under normal circumstances, awards will be granted annually with the face value of awards ranging between 25% and 200% of base salary depending on seniority.
In exceptional circumstances, a grant of up to 250% of base salary may be made to a participant in any year.
The performance conditions that apply relate to Rentokil Initials relative total shareholder return TSR performance 50% of the award and growth in earnings per share EPS growth 50% of the award.
The committee decided upon a combination of TSR and EPS as the most appropriate way to link potential rewards to company performance and the delivery of value to shareholders.
The committee views a split between TSR and EPS as providing a clear focus on financial performance of the company and the creation of shareholder value.
TSR performance conditions: Rentokil Initials TSR performance is compared against two different groups of companies established at the date of the award: 75% of the TSR part of the award is based on a comparison against the constituents of the FTSE 100, excluding financial services and resources companies.
25% of the TSR part is based on a comparison with a selected group of international support services companies.
For awards made in 2006, these companies are: Brambles Industries, The Capita Group, Compass Group, The Davis Service Group, Group 4 Securicor, Hays, MITIE Group, Prosegur Compaia fide Seguridad SA, Rexam, Serco Group, Securitas AB, SGS SA and Sodexho Alliance SA.
TSR will be calculated in accordance with the rules of the plan by the committees advisers and approved by the committee.
The TSR part of an award is subject to the following vesting schedule: % vesting of relevant TSR against relevant comparator group part of award TSR performance at or above upper quartile 100% Pro-rating between these points TSR performance at median 25% TSR performance below median 0% EPS performance conditions: For awards made in 2006, and for awards made in future years unless the committee decides otherwise, the EPS part of awards will vest depending on the cumulative annual growth in EPS over a three year period as follows: % vesting of EPS Cumulative EPS growth over performance period part of award 8% per annum 100% Pro-rating between these points 5% per annum 33.3% Below 5% per annum 0% EPS will be calculated on a normalised, pre-exceptional earnings per share basis, as determined by the committee, to ensure consistency for comparative purposes, and may be adjusted to take account of matters such as material acquisitions and disposals to reflect the business structure properly.
The committee will periodically review the performance conditions when making new awards to ensure they remain appropriately stretching in respect of each grant.

He assumed the position of executive chairman in August 2004.
In 2005, he received fees in that capacity at the annual rate of 750,000.

The level of fees was reviewed with the benefit of the advice of Deloitte in 2005.

The executive directors have rolling contracts which are subject to one years notice by the company and six months notice by the relevant director and are dated as follows: Doug Flynn, 26 September 2005: and Andrew Macfarlane, 17 August 2005.
The companys policy in respect of the notice periods for the termination of executive directors contracts conforms with the Combined Code.
The committee is fully aware that under the Combined Code it should take a robust line in reducing compensation to reflect departing directors obligations to mitigate loss.
On termination, executive directors are entitled to base pay and the value of benefits only, for the duration of the notice period.
Executive directors are entitled to accept one non-executive directorship or similar appointment outside the company, provided that the boards permission is obtained and to retain the fees in connection with such appointment.
Mr Flynn does not hold any external appointments.
Mr Macfarlane was a non-executive director of Invensys plc until August 2006 when he relinquished the appointment.
During the year he received and retained fees of 33,442.
Recognising investors preferences for executive shareholding requirements, the company introduced shareholding guidelines in 2006.
Executive directors will be expected to build if necessary, over a period of up to five years and subsequently maintain a holding of company shares with a market value equivalent to their annual salary.
The committee may take into account executives compliance with the shareholding guidelines acknowledging any special circumstances that may apply when considering future long-term incentive awards.

The chief financial officers maximum for 2006 is 80% of base salary.

In particular, the committee and the board is pleased with progress that has been made in respect of: the significant acquisitions and disposals programme from which we are building both strong and integrated market positions: progress in restructuring the UK pest control and UK washrooms businesses which brings greater operational efficiency and renewed focus on our customers: and improved customer relations and contract portfolio growth which have, in turn, led to strong revenue growth.
