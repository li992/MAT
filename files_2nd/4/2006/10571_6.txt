Directors remuneration report 70252 3 Directors 1 3 07 12:39 Page 30 Morgan Sindall Report and Accounts 2006 Introduction This report is prepared in accordance with schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 the Act.
This report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in 2003 the Code.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the Company to be held on 19 April 2007.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Act.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration committee The members of the remuneration committee the committee during 2006 were Gill Barr chair, Bernard Asher and Jon Walden, all of whom are independent non-executive directors.
The committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with the Board the broad policy for the remuneration of the executive directors, including the executive chairman.
It sets the salaries and remuneration packages for the executive directors and monitors the structure and level of remuneration for other senior executives.
The terms of reference of the committee are available on the Companys website and on request from the company secretary.
During the year the committee was assisted by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC on a number of aspects of the remuneration packages for the executive directors, including awards made under the Morgan Sindall Executive Remuneration Plan 2005.
In addition,  advised the committee in relation to an amendment to the Morgan Sindall 1995 share option scheme as described below.
The committee also consulted the chief executive, the finance director and the chairman, but not in relation to their own remuneration.
Save for advising the Company on share based accounting and providing Total Shareholder Return TSR calculations in respect of the 1995 share option scheme, NBSC did not provide any other services to the Company or the Group during the year.
 provides tax and related legal advice to the Group.
Policy on executive directors' remuneration The committee seeks to develop remuneration packages which satisfy the following principles: to attract, retain and motivate the best possible person for each position to be perceived as simple and fair and, therefore, valued by participants to ensure that the fixed element of remuneration salary, pension and other benefits is set no higher than market rates and that a significant proportion of the total remuneration package is determined by the Companys performance to recognise the importance of rewarding over-performance but not under-performance in both the short and long-term to reward directors fairly for their contributions whilst remaining within the range of benefits offered by similar companies in the sector to align the interests of executives with those of the shareholders The committee considers that the Companys remuneration structure, which was put in place for 2005 and retained for 2006 provides an appropriate combination of fixed and performance-related remuneration with a balanced mix of long-term and short-term rewards to ensure that executives focus on sustained performance rather than just short-term performance.
The long-term rewards for executive directors focus on Group performance with demanding criteria over a three year period, whilst short-term rewards are more closely linked to targets for the financial year and, in the case of senior executives, targets in the specific areas of responsibility of each individual.
The committee has decided to retain the same remuneration structure for 2007.
Base salary The base salary of individual executive directors is determined by the committee prior to the beginning of each year and, if appropriate, if an individuals position or responsibilities change.
A formal benchmarking exercise of executive directors remuneration is carried out periodically on behalf of the committee to ensure that the committee remains aware of relevant market data.
The last such exercise was carried out by NBSC prior to setting the 2005 base salaries using a comparator group of twenty-five companies of a similar size and profile.
Adjustments to the base salaries by the committee for 2006 reflected the significantly increased size and complexity of the Group and the need to maintain overall remuneration packages at competitive levels.
30 Directors remuneration report 70252 3 Directors 5 3 07 11:07 Page 31 Other benefits The executive directors receive certain other benefits, principally a car allowance, private medical insurance and life assurance.
Annual bonus At the end of each financial year the committee establishes the targets to be met for the executive directors to earn a cash bonus in respect of the following year.
For the 2006 financial year, the performance criteria were Group profit based targets, taking into account the previous year's likely outturn profit and growth expectations.
The maximum bonus payable in cash represented 75% per cent of base salary and required profit before tax for 2006 to exceed brokers forecasts at the time of setting the targets by more than 10% and this target was achieved.
For the 2007 financial year, executive directors will have the potential to earn a cash bonus worth up to 75% of base salary based on a range of challenging profit based targets set by reference to the Group budget.
For other senior executives, performance criteria focus primarily on the performance of the divisions over which they have a direct management influence.
Long-term incentives Morgan Sindall Executive Remuneration Plan 2005 the 2005 Plan The 2005 Plan was approved by shareholders in April 2005 and gives the Company the ability to offer senior executives performance shares and or share options by way of long-term incentive.
The committee considers that the flexibility to grant both types of award provides a suitable balance of performance related incentives, with options rewarding share price growth, performance shares encouraging executive retention and both types of incentive rewarding sustained growth in earnings.
A summary of the 2005 Plan is set out below: Award levels In normal circumstances the maximum annual award, which is subject to the achievement of testing performance targets, will be performance shares worth 75% of base salary 100% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
For the grant of awards made in 2006, in accordance with the Plan rules, executives were given the choice at the time of grant of receiving their awards either in the form of performance shares or by electing to receive share options to replace some or all of their performance shares at a rate of 4 share options for every 1 performance share.
It is anticipated that future awards will give executives a similar choice, with the awards to be granted in 2007 being offered on the same ratio.
Performance conditions The committee believes that long-term incentives should be structured so as to incentivise growth in the Groups earnings by use of an earnings per share EPS performance condition.
In the committees opinion, an EPS performance condition will provide a clear linkage between performance and reward for senior executives and will also only reward executives for significant improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group, which should be reflected over time in enhanced shareholder value.
The vesting of share options and performance shares awarded will be determined by the Groups EPS performance against the Retail Prices Index RPI over a single three year period with no opportunity to re-test performance.
The committee has determined that the vesting schedule for performance shares and share options should be as follows for the awards to be made in 2007, based on a three year performance period to 31 December 2009.
Average annual EPS performance in excess of RPI Vesting percentage Performance shares Share Options Less than 4% pa Less than 5% pa 0% 4% pa 5% pa 25% 10% pa 10% pa 100% Between 4% and 10% pa Between 5% and 10% pa Pro rata on a straight-line basis Pension arrangements The Company makes contributions equivalent to 10% of base salary, in the case of David Mulligan, to The Morgan Sindall Retirement Benefit Plan and, in the case of the other executive directors, to their individual personal pension plans.

This is considered by the committee to be the most suitable comparable broad index against which the Companys performance should be measured for this purpose.
350 Cumulative TSR for the five years to 31 December 2006 based on original 300 notional value of 100 250 200 Morgan Sindall plc 150 FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts 100 50 0 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Service contracts It is the Companys policy that executive directors' service contracts should be terminable on one year's notice.
In circumstances of termination by notice except in cases of removal for misconduct, compensation will be determined by the committee having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.
The committee's guidelines will be to determine an equitable compensation package while avoiding rewarding poor performance and having regard to the departing director's obligations to mitigate his loss.
In ordinary circumstances, base salary and employer pension contributions for the full period of notice of one year would be paid together with accrued bonus entitlements and shares or share options granted under long-term incentive schemes where the relevant performance criteria had been satisfied.
Other employee benefits would also be maintained for the notice period subject to the rules of the appropriate Group scheme.
The dates of the executive directors' contracts are: John Morgan 28 October 1994 Paul Smith 18 February 2003 David Mulligan 1 March 2004 Paul Whitmore 21 March 2000 At the discretion of the Board, executive directors are allowed to act as non-executive directors of other companies and retain any fees relating to that post.
Currently John Morgan acts as a non-executive director of Genetix plc for which he receives a fee of 20,000 per annum and Newfound N. V. for which he receives a fee of 15,000 per annum.
Non-executive directors The dates of the terms of engagement of the non-executive directors are: Bernard Asher 4 February 1998 Gill Barr 11 August 2004 Jack Lovell 2 August 2001 Jon Walden 5 April 2001 All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement being an initial period of three years which thereafter may be extended by mutual consent, subject always to the requirements for re-election and the Companies Act.
Their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the articles of association of the Company and is based on surveys together with external advice as appropriate.
Fees for 2007 will comprise a basic fee of 35,000 and, to reflect their additional responsibilities and time commitment, an additional fee of 5,000 and 3,000 will be paid to the chairs of the audit and remuneration committees respectively.
Jack Lovell retained awards granted to him before ceasing to be an executive director but non-executive directors do not otherwise participate in any Company share based incentive plan and do not receive any other benefits.

No awards have been granted under the LTIP since 2003 and there is no intention to grant further awards.
The awards were conditional upon the Groups TSR performance over a three year period compared with a selected peer group.
Once shares have been allocated to the executive after the three year performance period, the executive is entitled to receive dividends in respect of those shares and to exercise voting rights but may not transfer or otherwise deal in those shares until a further two years have elapsed and he may be required to forfeit the shares if he ceases to be employed by the Company during that period.
After two years they will vest in his name.

No long-term incentive awards were made to the executive directors in respect of that financial year.
The nil-cost options will be exercisable for five years from 10 March 2008, being three years after the date of grant.
The market value of a share on the date of grant was 7.13.

John Morgan 8,046 Paul Smith 10,241 David Mulligan 4,114 Paul Whitmore 6,876 Additionally, as disclosed in last years directors remuneration report Paul Smith was awarded a one-off bonus of 20,000 shares, in respect of his and the Companys performance in 2005.
These shares are held in trust and deferred for two years and subject to forfeit if he ceases to be employed by the Company during that period.

Options were granted to Paul Smith under the 1995 scheme as part of his initial employment package in 2003 and in lieu of participation in the LTIP.
No other executive director has any options outstanding under the 1995 scheme.
Details of options granted under the 1995 scheme to other employees in the Group are shown in note 22 to the accounts on page 64.
No further options may be granted under the 1995 scheme.
Outstanding options under the 1995 scheme are only exercisable if the Companys TSR is ranked at or above the upper quartile compared to a comparator group of FTSE 100 companies over a period of five consecutive financial years.
On 7 September 2006, the committee resolved to amend the 1995 scheme to allow the Company to settle options on exercise on a net basis subject to obtaining the consent of the option holder.
This decision was made after careful consideration of the need to reduce unnecessary dilution of shareholder interests and follows advice from  on market practice in this area.
Net settlement does not impact on the economic position of the option holder on exercise.
In its monitoring of its share dilution position, the committee will continue to take the full potential dilution into account i. e. assuming that outstanding options will be settled on a gross basis until any lower level of dilution crystallises upon settlement.
