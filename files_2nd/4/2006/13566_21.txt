The accrued pension increased by 9k 7k excluding the effect of inflation between December 31, 2005 and March 9, 2006 to 351k.
The transfer value as at December 31, 2005 was 5,749k.
This increased by 144k 118k excluding the effect of inflation to 5,893k at the date of transfer.

5 The transfer values stated represent liabilities of the Rolls-Royce sponsored pension schemes and not sums paid to the individuals.

7 John Cheffins and Colin Smith have opted out of future pension accrual with effect from April 1, 2006.
They each receive a cash allowance in lieu of future pension accrual.
Had they elected to continue to accrue pension the estimated cost of that accrual would be higher than the cash allowance to be paid in lieu.
8 The Group operates the Rolls-Royce Supplementary Retirement Scheme.
The purpose of the Scheme is to fund pension provision above the pensionable earnings cap which was imposed on approved pension schemes under the 1989 Finance Act.
Membership of the Scheme is restricted to executive directors and to a limited number of senior executives.
The members of the Scheme include Andrew Shilston.
He joined the Group after the introduction of the earnings cap and his terms and conditions on joining the Group included a commitment to provide pension and life cover based on total salary, in line with other directors and senior executives.
Employer contributions to the Scheme during 2006 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2006 for the approved defined benefit plans, and are therefore included in the figures shown in the right hand column of the first table.
In addition, the employer has paid 13k to Andrew Shilston directly in order to meet the income tax liability that he will incur on these employer contributions prior toAday to this unapproved scheme.
9 The lump sum entitlement shown is that which would be paid on immediate retirement based on service to the end of the year.

12 James Guyette is a member of two defined benefit plans in the US, one qualified and one non-qualified.
He accrues a retirement lump sum benefit in both of these plans.
The aggregate value of the retirement lump sums accrued in these two plans, and the transfer values of these benefits, are shown in the second table.
In addition, James Guyette is a member of two 401 K Savings Plans in the US, one qualified and one non-qualified, to which both he and his employer, Rolls-Royce North America Inc. contribute.
James Guyette is also a member of an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan in the US, to which his employer makes notional contributions.
Employer contributions to these three plans during 2006 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2006 for the defined benefit plans, and are therefore included in the figures shown in the right hand column of the second table.
