58.31 PF DirectorsReport JD P8:Layout 1 16 3 07 15:46 Page 59 Provident Financial plc 59 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2006 Directors remuneration report 1 Introduction This is the directors remuneration report of Provident Financial plc the company for the financial year ended 31 December 2006 which has been prepared pursuant to, and in accordance with, section 234B of the Companies Act 1985 the Companies Act.
In accordance with section 241 of the Companies Act, a resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the annual general meeting AGM of the company to be held on 16 May 2007.
2 The remuneration committee 2.1 From 1 January to 31 December 2006, the remuneration committee the committee consisted of Ray Miles and Graham Pimlott under the chairmanship of John Maxwell.
On 31 December 2006 Tony Hales became a member.
On 27 February 2007, Graham Pimlott ceased to be a member.
On 28 February 2007 John Maxwell ceased to be Chairman: Ray Miles became Chairman and Robert Hough became a member of this committee.
2.2 The committee met eight times during the year.
2.3 Pursuant to its terms of reference, the committee considers the framework of executive remuneration and makes recommendations to the board.
It determines the specific remuneration packages and conditions of service of the Chairman, the executive directors and the Company Secretary, including their service agreements.
It also monitors the level and structure of the remuneration of the most senior management below board level within the group.
No director is involved in determining his own remuneration.
2.4 The committee has appointed Kepler Associates Limited Kepler as remuneration consultant.
This consultant is independent and does not provide any other services to the group.
Kepler has provided advice to the committee in 2006.
The committee has also been advised by Slaughter and May which is the groups city solicitor and has advised the group on other legal matters, including the proposed demerger of its international business, during the year.
In all cases the advisors were instructed by the secretary on behalf of the committee.
The Chairman of the company normally attends and speaks at meetings of the committee other than when his own remuneration or any matter relating to him is being considered.
The Company Secretary, Rosamond Marshall Smith, is secretary to the committee and attended the meetings of the committee in 2006: as a solicitor she provided legal and technical support to the committee.
3 Statement of the companys policy on directors remuneration Remuneration policy 3.1 The remuneration policy applied by the committee is based on the need to attract, reward, motivate and retain executive directors in a manner consistent with the long-term accumulation of value for shareholders.
The committee is also conscious of the need to avoid paying more than is reasonable for this purpose and therefore the policy of the committee is to pay remuneration at market levels, with a significant proportion subject to performance.
3.2 The executive directors remuneration consists of a basic salary, an annual cash bonus subject to performance conditions and other benefits.
They also participate in pension schemes.
Additionally, they may participate in a performance share plan which necessitates the waiver of part of the annual cash bonus, a long-term incentive scheme and a senior executive share option scheme, all of which are subject to performance conditions, and an employee savings-related share option scheme which is not subject to performance conditions.
The remuneration policy is designed to ensure that a significant proportion of the executive directors remuneration is linked to performance, through the operation of the annual cash bonus and the equity incentive schemes.
3.3 The committee normally reviews the executive directors remuneration annually.
In December 2006 the committee reviewed the salaries of the executive directors and awarded an increase of 5%.
The committee also reviewed the salary of the Chairman, who became acting Chief Executive with effect from 1 January 2007 and adjusted his salary for the period he is so acting to 400,000 a year.
3.4 The fees for the non-executive directors, other than the Chairman, are fixed by the board and are designed both to recognise the responsibilities of non-executive directors and to attract individuals with the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the future growth of the group.
Their business expenses are reimbursed by the company.
Full details of their fees for 2006 with 2005 comparative figures are set out in the table of directors remuneration on page 61 in paragraph 4.
Cash bonuses 3.5 An annual cash bonus is payable, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions.
The bonus is calculated as a percentage of salary.
The purpose of the bonus scheme is to provide a meaningful cash incentive for executive directors which is clearly focused on improving the groups performance and aligns, so far as is practicable, shareholder and executive director interests.
3.6 Executive directors are eligible for annual cash bonuses by reference to audited earnings per share as defined in the bonus scheme and achievement of specific objectives.
The total bonus payable cannot exceed 100% of salary.
In exceptional circumstances, the committee may make such adjustments to the calculation of earnings per share as it considers fair and reasonable.
For 2007, Peter Crook, Andrew Fisher and John Harnett are eligible for an additional cash bonus of up to 100% of salary by reference to successful completion of, and the value created through, the demerger of the international business.

Equity incentive schemes 3.8 The grant of awards under equity incentive schemes to executive directors and senior managers is normally considered once in each year after the announcement of the companys results in accordance with a formula determined by reference to salary.
The company currently operates three schemes: the Provident Financial Executive Share Option Scheme 2006 the ESOS, the Provident Financial Long Term Incentive Scheme 2006 the LTIS and the Provident Financial Performance Share Plan the Performance Share Plan.
No further options can be granted under the Provident Financial plc Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 the 1995 scheme or the Provident Financial plc Unapproved Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 the 1996 scheme.
The ESOS 3.9 The ESOS contains both an Inland Revenue approved and unapproved section.
All options are subject to a performance target.
For options granted in 2006 the target requires the companys average annual growth in earnings per share to be equal to or greater than RPI plus 3% over a period of three consecutive years, the first of which is the financial year starting immediately before the grant date.
At that level 25% of the shares under option would be exercisable with the option becoming fully exercisable at average annual growth in earnings per share in excess of RPI plus 6% over the three-year period.
A sliding scale for vesting will apply between these levels.
Although basic earnings per share is generally used for the performance calculation, for 2006 awards earnings per share before Yes Car Credit closure costs was used for the starting point to avoid participants benefiting from a low start point due to the impact of the closure of the Yes Car Credit business.
Earnings per share is considered to be the best measure of the companys financial performance and complements the use of relative total shareholder return TSR in the LTIS.
Maximum awards will normally be limited to 100% of salary.
No executive options have been granted at a discount.
The LTIS 3.10 The LTIS rewards TSR percentage outperformance against a tailored peer group of financial services companies as listed on page 64 in paragraph 6.7.
The committee believes that relative TSR is an objective measure of the companys success, is a fair measure of management performance and helps align the interests of executive directors and shareholders.
The awards made in 2006 require the companys TSR over a three-year performance period, when measured against the tailored peer group, to be at least median 25% vesting with full vesting if TSR exceeds the median by 8.5% a year and straight line vesting in between these two levels.
Participation is currently limited to executive directors and maximum annual awards will normally be limited to 100% of salary.
Performance Share Plan 3.11 The Performance Share Plan entitles executive directors who waive up to 50% with a minimum of 25% of their annual cash bonus, and other eligible employees who waive up to 50% or 30% depending on their level of seniority of their annual cash bonus, to be considered for participation.
Participants receive a basic award of shares of up to the value of the waived bonus, together with a matching award of an equivalent amount which is subject to a performance condition.
Generally, the matching award will vest only if the companys average annual growth in earnings per share is equal to or greater than RPI plus 3% over a period of three consecutive financial years, the first of which is the financial year starting immediately before the grant date of the matching award.
The performance conditions were selected by the committee after consideration of other possible types of condition.
The committee took the view that the use of this earnings per share target aligned, so far as is practicable, the interests of the directors with those of the shareholders.
However, the committee has decided not to operate the Performance Share Plan in 2007 because of the proposed demerger.
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 3.12 The executive directors together with other eligible group employees may participate in the Provident Financial plc Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 2003.
Participants save a fixed sum each month for three or five years and may use these funds to purchase shares after three, five or seven years.
The exercise price is fixed at up to 20% below the market value of the shares at the date directors and employees are invited to participate in the scheme.
Up to 250 can be saved each month.
This scheme does not contain performance conditions as it is an Inland Revenue approved scheme designed for employees at all levels.
Other benefits 3.13 The executive directors are provided with company-owned cars and fuel or a cash alternative, long-term disability cover under the companys insured permanent health policy and medical cover for them and their immediate families.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Share ownership policy 3.14 The company has a share ownership policy for executive directors.
An executive director must retain half of vested shares, net of tax and exercise costs, until he has a beneficial shareholding equivalent to one times his annual salary: in performing the calculation, post-tax embedded gains on vested unexercised share options may be included.
The committee reviews the shareholdings of the executive directors in the light of this policy once a year.
Due to the non-payment of the annual cash bonus in 2006 and the appointment of two executive directors in 2006, this ownership target is stretching: however, the committee considers that it should be retained.
Service agreements 3.15 The current policy is for executive directors service agreements to provide for both the company and the director to give one years notice.
No director has a service agreement containing a liquidated damages clause on termination: in the event of the termination of an agreement, it is the current policy to seek mitigation of loss by the director concerned and to aim to ensure that any payment made is the minimum which is commensurate with the companys legal obligations.

However, any proposed appointment will require the approval of the board.
In accordance with the Combined Code, the board would not permit an executive director to take on the chairmanship of a FTSE 100 company.
Senior management remuneration 3.17 The committee considers the structure and level of pay for the most senior level of management within the group.
Their current salaries are as follows: Salary band Number of employees 130,000 160,000 5 160,001 190,000 3 190,001 220,000 1 220,001 250,000 2 Total 11 Changes to the remuneration policy 3.18 It is anticipated that the remuneration policy will be reviewed after the demerger of the international business later this year to ensure that it remains appropriate.
Detailed information 3.19 Full details of salaries, bonus earnings and other benefits for 2006 with 2005 comparative figures for the executive directors are set out in the table of directors remuneration in paragraph 4 below.
Full details of share options are set out in the tables on page 62 in paragraph 5.1 and on page 64 in paragraph 6.1 below.
Full details of awards under the performance share plan are set out in the table on page 64 in paragraph 7.1 below.

Options granted under the LTIS are shown separately in the table on page 64 in paragraph 6 below.
5.3 The performance conditions which apply to the exercise of executive share options under the 1995 scheme, the 1996 scheme and the ESOS are as set out in paragraphs 5.3.
1 Performance condition A referred to in the table above applies to options granted prior to 2002.
Over a three-year period the real growth in the companys earnings per share must average 3% a year after making appropriate adjustments for inflation.
2 Performance condition B referred to in the table above applies to options granted in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005.
Where the option is granted over shares with an aggregate exercise price of up to one times the directors salary, the performance condition is that, over a fixed three-year period, the real growth in earnings per share after adjusting for inflation must average 3% a year if the condition is not satisfied after the three years the period will be extended to four years and then, if the condition is still not satisfied, to five years, whereupon if the condition is still not satisfied, the option will lapse.
For options granted in excess of one times the directors salary, the condition is 4% rather than 3% real growth in earnings per share.
3 Performance condition C referred to in the table above applies to options granted under the ESOS.
For options granted in 2006 the target requires annual earnings per share growth to exceed RPI plus 3% averaged over a three-year period.
5.4 In 2006, the committee adjusted the performance conditions of relevant options to reflect the fact that earnings per share is now calculated under IFRS rather than UK GAAP.
This was achieved by taking the IFRS earnings per share figure for 2004 and applying the same percentage changes, as experienced under UK GAAP, for the years back to 2001, to derive equivalent IFRS figures.
5.5 The companys highest paid director in 2006 was John Harnett, whose emoluments amounted to 686,000 2005 Robin Ashton 524,000.
His notional gain representing the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the shares at the date of exercise on the exercise of share options amounted to nil 2005 Robin Ashton nil and the value of vested shares under the Performance Share Plan was 19,612 2005 nil.
5.6 The aggregate notional gain representing the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the shares at the date of exercise made by all the directors on the exercise of share options during 2006 amounted to nil 2005 140,438.
5.7 The mid-market closing price of the companys shares on 31 December 2006 was 701p and the range during 2006 was 535p to 706.5p.
5.8 No consideration is payable on the grant of an option.
5.9 There were no changes in directors share options between1 January and 28 February 2007.
5.10 None of the directors has notified the company of an interest in any other shares, transactions or arrangements which requires disclosure.

8 Pensions and life assurance 8.1 There are two directors, 2005 two for whom retirement benefits are accruing under the Provident Financial Senior Pension Scheme the senior pension scheme, and two directors 2005 two for whom retirement benefits are accruing under defined contribution schemes.
The senior pension scheme is a defined benefit scheme, with two sections: cash balance and final salary.
Details of the cash balance section are set out in paragraph 8.6 below and details of the final salary section are set out in paragraph 8.7 below.
The cash balance section of the senior pension scheme was introduced with effect from 1 April 2006 for future service.
For those who elected to remain in the final salary section of the senior pension scheme, the member contribution rate was increased from 7% to 14% of basic salary.
Where the value of an executive directors pension benefit was in excess of the lifetime allowance on 6 April 2006, he could elect to cease accruing benefits in respect of future service and receive a salary supplement of 30% of basic salary instead.
8.2 Peter Crook and Andrew Fisher are members of the cash balance section of the senior pension scheme.
Robin Ashton who ceased to be a director on 31 December 2006 and David Swann who ceased to be a director on 17 May 2006 and an employee on 31 May 2006 were in the final salary section but elected to cease accruing benefits after 31 March 2006 and to receive a salary supplement.
8.3 John van Kuffeler and John Harnett each has a defined contribution personal pension arrangement.
Life assurance benefit is provided by the senior pension scheme.
8.4 For John van Kuffeler, the company contributes 23% of his salary as non-executive Chairman to his pension arrangements.
The contributions are invested to produce benefits at age 60 or on death.
He is also eligible for a lump sum death benefit of four times salary at date of death.
The companys contributions in respect of John van Kuffeler during 2006 including the cost of the life insurance amounted to 30,498 2005 30,938.
John van Kuffelers salary was adjusted on 1 January 2007 as a result of his additional role of acting Chief Executive.
However, his pension arrangements remain unchanged.
8.5 For John Harnett, the position is identical to that specified in paragraph 8.4 for John van Kuffeler, except that the company contributes 30% of his basic salary to his pension arrangements.
The companys contributions in respect of John Harnett during 2006 including the cost of the life insurance amounted to 103,087 2005 105,263.
8.6 The cash balance section of the senior pension scheme provides Peter Crook and Andrew Fisher with a pension credit of 35% of their basic salary each year to a retirement account.
Directors contribute at the rate of 5% of basic salary.
Currently, the pension credit increases each year by the lower of the increase in the RPI plus 1.5% and 6.5%.
At retirement up to 25% of the total value of the directors retirement account can be taken as a lump sum, with the balance used to purchase an annuity.
If the director dies in service, a death benefit of six times salary plus the value of the retirement account is payable.

The pension provided in respect of service prior to 1 January 2000 is up to two-thirds of basic salary at the normal retirement date at age 60 reduced by an amount approximately equal to two-thirds of the single persons basic rate state pension from state pension age.
The senior pension scheme also provides spouses pensions of two-thirds of the directors pension if the director dies whilst he is either a deferred member or in retirement.
If the director does not leave a spouse, the pension will be paid to any dependants at the discretion of the trustees of the senior pension scheme.
With the consent of the company, a director can retire under the senior pension scheme rules at any time between ages 50 and 60, in which case the pension payable would be the accrued pension based on salary and pensionable service at the date he leaves the service of the company or 31 March 2006 if the director has elected to cease accruing benefits reduced to reflect the longer period for which it will be paid.
Pensions in respect of service up to 1 January 2000 are guaranteed to increase, when in payment, at a rate of 5% each year.
Pensions in respect of service from 1 January 2000 are guaranteed to increase each year by the lower of the annual increase in the retail prices index and 5%.
Discretionary increases may be granted by the trustees with the consent of the company.
There are no discretionary benefits for which allowance is made when calculating transfer values on leaving service.
8.8 Details of the pension entitlements earned under the final salary section of the senior pension scheme during 2006 are set out below: Transfer Transfer value of value of pension pension Decrease benefits benefits in transfer Age Accrued annual pension Decrease increase in accrued at accrued at value less 31 December 31 December 31 December annual pension Directors contribution 31 December 31 December directors 2006 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 contributions Directors name 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Robin Ashton 48 180 179 5 23 9 33 2,763 2,806 52 David Swann 59 170 196 14 19 5 21 4,776 4,973 202 Net of 3.6% inflationary increase.
As these individuals ceased to accrue final salary benefits on 31 March 2006 and there has been no increase in their pensionable earnings over 2006, the accrued pension has fallen in real terms over 2006.
David Swanns decrease in accrued pension is also partly due to the reduction made to his pension upon his early retirement, and partly due to his decision to commute part of his scheme pension for a tax free lump sum of 383,300.
The accrued pension excludes the scheme bridging pension payable from the date of retirement until the basic state pension becomes payable.
8.9 Details of the pension entitlements earned under the cash balance section of the senior pension scheme are set out below: Increase Accrued Transfer Transfer in transfer Age cash balance lump sum Increase in value at value at value less 31 December 31 December 31 December cash balance lump sum Directors contribution 31 December 31 December directors 2006 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 contributions Directors name 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Peter Crook 43 87 87 12 87 75 Andrew Fisher 48 70 70 10 70 60 Whilst the member is in service, the accrued cash balance lump sum will increase in line with RPI plus 1.5% until retirement.
At retirement, up to 25% of this balance can be taken as a lump sum, with the remaining amount used to purchase an annuity.
8.10 Employees who joined the group on or after 1 January 2003 are eligible to join the Provident Financial Stakeholder Pension Plan.

Tony Hales, Robert Hough and Christopher Rodrigues are offering themselves for election at the AGM.
Details of the service agreement of each director with the company or letter of appointment, as relevant, are set out in paragraphs 9.1.
1 Peter Crook, Andrew Fisher and John Harnett each has a service agreement which requires one years notice of termination to be given by the company and one years notice of termination to be given by the director.
No notice of termination has been given by either the company or any of the directors and thus in each case the unexpired term is one year.
Each service agreement terminates on the date of the directors sixty-fifth birthday.
There are no provisions for compensation payable upon early termination of any of the agreements.
However, in the event that a director is not re-elected at an AGM of the company, the agreement is automatically terminated and this is treated as a breach by the company.
The dates of the service agreements are as follows: Peter Crook 27 April 2006 amended by letter of variation on 1 February 2007 : Andrew Fisher 30 June 2006 amended by letter of variation on 17 January 2007 : and John Harnett 30 January 2002 amended by letters of variation on 24 December 2003 and 5 February 2007.
2 The Chairman, John van Kuffeler, has a service agreement dated 29 January 2002 amended by letters of variation on 24 December 2003, 17 January 2007 and 30 January 2007 which requires one years notice of termination to be given by the company and six months notice of termination to be given by him.
No notice of termination has been given by either party and thus the unexpired term is one year.
The service agreement will terminate on the date of his sixty-fifth birthday.
3 Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of appointment.
Each director is appointed for a fixed period of three years, subject to election by shareholders.
The initial three-year period may be extended by one further three-year period and, in exceptional cases, further extended subject to re-election by shareholders.
The dates of the letters of appointment and the unexpired terms are as follows: Charles Gregson 6 February 2007 unexpired term: to 31 May 2008: Tony Hales18 May 2006 unexpired term: to 31 October 2009: Robert Hough 18 October 2006 unexpired term: to 31 January 2010: John Maxwell 6 February 2007 unexpired term: to 31 May 2008: Ray Miles 21 December 2006 unexpired term: to 31 December 2009.
