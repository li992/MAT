Remuneration Report The Board of Directors presents its Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2006, which includes a proposed new remuneration policy effective from 1 January 2007.
A resolution to approve this Report will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 19 April 2007.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Board has established a Remuneration Committee the Committee which is responsible for setting each executive Directors remuneration.
The Committees current terms of reference were adopted on 25 February 2004 and are available on the Companys website or from the Group Company Secretary.
The Committee is comprised of three non-executive Directors, Adam Applegarth Chairman, David Thompson and Neil Davidson, all of whom the Board considers to be independent.
Adam Applegarth was appointed to the Committee on 21 April 2006, the date that Hamish Leslie Melville, the previous Chairman, retired from the Committee.
During the year the Committee sought independent advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC, who are leading advisors on executive remuneration.
In addition, the Committee consulted with the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive, although neither participated in any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
NBSC do not provide any other service to the Company.
REMUNERATION REVIEW At the time of the introduction of the Synergy Incentive Plan in January 2006, several of the Companys leading institutional shareholders encouraged the Company to review the current remuneration policy for executive Directors, with a view to bringing it more into line with market practice for a FTSE 100 company.
In particular, several shareholders felt strongly that the policy should be adjusted so as to provide for a proportionately higher level of reward for long-term value creation, so as to avoid the need to resort to arrangements like the one-off Synergy Incentive Plan in the future.
Although the previous policy complemented the excellent performance of the Company, the Group has grown significantly since the last remuneration policy was introduced in 2001 following a full investor consultation.
In addition, the size and shape of the Board has changed significantly over the past two years, with the retirement of the former Chairman, Duncan Davidson, the founder of the Company, the change of role of John White from Chief Executive to Executive Chairman and the promotion of Mike Farley to Chief Executive.
Finally, the corporate governance environment has changed substantially since that time.
In the light of the above, the Committee considered that the time was right to carry out a detailed review and it is anticipated that the new policy, which will take effect from 1 January 2007, will not need any significant adjustment for the foreseeable future.
As part of the review, the Committee has benchmarked the existing executive Directors remuneration packages primarily against a set of companies either side of Persimmon in the FTSE 100 20 above and 20 below ranked by market capitalisation.
Although the Committee considers that this is a reasonable comparator group, it is aware that Persimmons current level of pre-tax profitability is significantly higher than the vast majority of these companies.
The executive Directors have been responsible for delivering very significant value to investors through organic growth and seamless integration of several acquisitions and this proven track record makes this team attractive to quoted competitors and private equity backed businesses.
The Committee considers that it is important that these executive Directors are appropriately rewarded for continuing to deliver exceptional value to shareholders and to retain their expertise.
The review of remuneration highlighted the following issues with the current remuneration policy compared to other FTSE 100 companies of a similar size: Basic salaries are significantly below market levels.
The level of bonus payable for target performance is much higher.
Whilst recognising that the Company has been an excellent performer and bonuses, historically, have paid out close to or at the maximum level, the bonus plans structure has been unusual in that the proportion of the bonus payable at target has been relatively high, at around 80 90% of the maximum bonus payable albeit the target level of performance determined by the Committee for annual bonus purposes has been relatively challenging.
In addition, the difference to the level of bonus payout is relatively small in relation to different levels of performance.
Long Term Incentive Plan awards are generally just above lower quartile reflecting both a relatively low grant multiple which is referenced off a relatively low basic salary.
REMUNERATION POLICY The overriding objective has been to redesign the packages so they are more closely aligned with market standards and best practice, in particular a more market related basic salary and a more conventionally structured annual bonus plan.
However, we recognise that some aspects of the current remuneration package, in particular the higher than typical emphasis on variable pay, has helped to drive the excellent performance of the Company.
Accordingly, the re-design has sought to incorporate some of the key principles of the existing pay philosophy particularly the focus on performance related pay and annual bonus.
At the same time the re-design seeks to incorporate a greater reward potential in the package for longer term value creation, subject to more stretching annual bonus and long term incentive plan performance conditions.
The proposed changes to the policy should be viewed in a total remuneration context taking together the value of basic pay, pension, annual bonus and long term incentives.
Under this approach, where there are increases proposed to one element of the package this may be offset by a reduction to one or more other elements of the package.
For instance, despite some substantial increases to the level of basic salary, the level of target bonus potential has been reduced significantly and the targets attached to both plans have been made significantly more demanding.
38 Persimmon Plc Remuneration Report The overall impact of the changes on the target value of the executive Directors remuneration packages can be summarised as follows: John Whites package has not changed materially.
Mike Farleys package has increased so as to equalise it with that of John White, as he now has full CEO responsibilities.
This approach is recognised as being transitional, until such time as John White begins to step back from full time executive duties, when his remuneration would, of course, reduce commensurately.
At the current time, the Committee is satisfied that these two very highly rated executives should be paid at market competitive rates for a company chief executive.
John White brings a wealth of experience of the sector and knowledge of the Company which, particularly since Duncan Davidson retired, the Board considered essential for the Company to retain.
Mike Killorans package has increased.
This increase is considered appropriate, recognising his outstanding ability, track record and the broader corporate finance element to his role compared to many other finance directors.
David Bryants package has not increased substantially.
Overall, the total employment cost of the Executive Board taking account of all of the elements of the package is less than in 2005 despite a large increase in the size and complexity of the business.
The Committee believes that it is essential that this talented management team is retained and appropriately rewarded for continuing to deliver outstanding shareholder value.
This is, without doubt in our mind, an exceptional management team and the Committee is comfortable with the principle that their remuneration should also potentially be exceptional, provided that the performance related pay elements of the package are triggered.
To ensure that such rewards will only continue to be payable for ongoing excellent performance, a higher than usual by market standards proportion of the package will continue to be weighted in favour of performance related pay: around two thirds of the package will be performance related compared to the FTSE 100 average of around 55%.
In this way, if the level of performance reduces in the future, the value of the packages will reduce more sharply than in most FTSE 100 companies.
The Committee has considered this review carefully and is satisfied that the proposed changes are more in line with market practice whilst creating a sharper and more performance orientated remuneration package, building on the value already created for shareholders.
In addition to changing the mix between the various components of the package, some changes are proposed to the structure of the annual bonus and long term incentive plan awards.
Full details of both the quantum of the individual components of the packages and the structure of annual bonus, long term incentive awards and pension provision, are summarised below.
BASIC SALARY The basic salaries for 2006 were set by the Committee as at 1 January 2005 and were fixed for two years until 31 December 2006, except for Mike Farleys salary, which increased when he took up his role as Group Chief Executive in April 2006.
As part of the package of proposed changes to the remuneration policy, basic salaries will be increased to a broadly market median level, by reference to other FTSE 100 companies of a similar size.
Basic salaries for 2007 are proposed as follows 2005 and 2006 salary level in brackets : John White 615,000 430,000 Mike Farley 615,000 400,000 Mike Killoran 400,000 320,000 David Bryant 265,000 235,000 from April 2006 ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonuses will be performance related and non-pensionable.
The Committee has determined that the total level of potential annual bonus payable to the executive Directors will be capped at a predetermined figure, which varies by Director.
Maximum annual bonus potential for 2007 as a percentage of salary will be as follows 2006 maximum bonus level in brackets : John White 250% 431% Mike Farley 250% 375% Mike Killoran 250% 292% David Bryant 175% 220% The balance of any 2006 bonus earned in excess of 200% of basic salary is required to be invested in the Companys shares Bonus Shares, which vest in two equal tranches over a two year period.
Recognising the increase in basic salary levels for 2007, the threshold will be reduced from 200% to 150% for 2007 annual bonuses.
It is worth noting that the executive Directors already have significant shareholdings.
Bonus Shares are awarded at the same time as the cash bonus, with the first tranche vesting on the date of announcement of the Groups preliminary results in the following year and the second tranche on the date of announcement of the Groups preliminary results the year after.
Any unvested Bonus Shares would be forfeited on termination of employment if the executive Director resigns or is dismissed summarily.
39 Persimmon Plc Remuneration Report The number of Bonus Shares awarded for 2006 was calculated by dividing the balance of any bonus earned in excess of 200% of basic salary by the average share price in the period 1 January to 14 February prior to the announcement of the Groups preliminary results.
The 2006 annual bonus plan was based on a mix of Profit Before Tax PBT and Group Earnings Per Share EPS growth targets.
For John White, Mike Farley and Mike Killoran, the PBT part of the annual bonus is based on being entitled to a fixed percentage of Group PBT, subject to a floor and a cap.
For example, for the 2006 bonus plan John White was entitled to 0.133% of PBT, with a floor of 525m and a cap of 640m.
A similar approach, based on PBT, also applied to the bonuses for Mike Farley and Mike Killoran.
David Bryant was entitled to a percentage of the PBT of the Eastern Region.
For the Group EPS part of the bonus, a more conventional approach has been taken with a sliding scale of EPS targets set around a target figure each year.
The following changes are proposed for the annual bonus plan for 2007, applicable to all of the executive Directors: The percentage of PBT approach has been discontinued as it provides relatively little differential in bonus payout between different performance outcomes.
Instead, 50% of the bonus will be based on PBT targets i. e. not divisional PBT for David Bryant since he is now predominately fulfilling solely a Group role.
The remaining 50% will be based on EPS targets, as previously.
Each year, the Committee will set an appropriate sliding scale around a target figure for both EPS and PBT.
For the 2007 bonus, it is intended that, at threshold, 25% of the maximum bonus will be payable threshold will not be less than 90% of the target.
Two thirds of the maximum bonus will be payable at target and 100% of the bonus will be payable for a stretching outcome above target generally in the range of 10%.
A target level of bonus equivalent to two thirds of the maximum is considered appropriately challenging, recognising the high level of profitability of the Company and the stretching nature of the targets.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN The existing LTIP incorporating an individual limit of 100% of basic salary will expire in 2008.
In view of the short time to expiry, it is proposed that a new LTIP is introduced.
Full details of the proposed new LTIP are contained in the shareholder circular accompanying this years Notice of Annual General Meeting.
This is a relatively standard plan incorporating the latest best practice features.
Whilst the plan rules will incorporate a degree of flexibility for the operation of the plan over its ten year life, key features of the policy for 2007 are summarised below: Initially, John White and Mike Farley will receive an award of 200% of basic salary within a limit of 250% of salary, and Mike Killoran and David Bryant will receive an award equivalent to 150% of basic salary.
As with the policy in previous years, awards will vest based on Return on Capital Employed ROCE and Total Shareholder Return TSR targets.
This provides a good blend between rewarding long term financial performance and superior stock market performance.
However, it is proposed to make some changes to the structure of these targets in 2007.
For grants under the LTIP in 2006, 50% of an award was based on TSR versus 10 other housebuilders with 40% of this part of the award vesting at median performance and all of this part of the award vesting for upper quartile performance.
The remaining 50% of an award was based on ROCE performance, with 50% of this part of an award vesting for average annual ROCE of 13%, with all of this part of the award vesting for average annual ROCE of 20% with intermediate steps between.
For awards in 2007, the 50% of an award based on TSR performance will be measured against the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index excluding Investment Trusts as at the date of grant.
The vesting schedule has been made steeper with 25% of an award rather than 40% vesting for median TSR performance.
Full vesting will remain at the upper quartile.
The FTSE 100 is considered to be a better benchmark against which to compare Persimmons TSR as we believe there to be an insufficient number of large housebuilders to provide a robust comparator group and the sector may consolidate further.
For the remaining 50% of an award based on ROCE targets, the lower and upper targets have been increased from 13% and 20% respectively to 15% and 22% respectively for between 25% and 100% of the award to vest.
This range, in the view of the Committee, currently reflects the outlook for the Housebuilding Sector.
For grants in future years, the Committee will review the ROCE range in the light of the outlook for the Housebuilding Sector at that time.
PENSION 1 The executive Directors are members of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme.
Prior to 6 April 2006, all executive Directors accrued pension at a rate of 45th of basic salary.
As Mike Killoran was subject to the pre 6 April 2006 HMRC earnings cap, he also received a contribution into a FURBs.
The normal retirement age for executive Directors is 60.
John Millar who retired as a Director in April 2006 had an agreed retirement age of 62.
In early 2006 the Committee considered whether alternative remuneration should be provided to executive Directors in the event that they wished to stop accruing pension in the defined benefit pension scheme, as a result of the changes to pension legislation which became effective on 6 April 2006.
When considering alternatives, the Committee agreed that any alternative arrangements should be cost neutral to the Company.
The Committee further agreed that an executive Director who elected to cease further service in the Groups defined benefit scheme would receive a total salary supplement of 30% of basic salary, in lieu of all pension benefit.
Messrs White, Farley and Bryant elected to cease accruing further service and instead opted for the salary supplement they will remain a member of the scheme for life insurance purposes.
Mike Killoran elected to continue to accrue service.
The Committee has considered the impact of the significant salary increases on pension benefits accrued to 5 April 2006 under the final salary defined benefit pension scheme which is based on the final salary at the date of retirement.
Therefore, recognising that it would be inappropriate to provide executives with the immediate benefit of this one-off significant salary increase on their accrued pension yet at the same time acknowledging that it would be normal for accrued benefits to be based on final salary, a salary cap for pension purposes will be introduced.
40 Persimmon Plc Remuneration Report John White and David Bryant will receive a 10% increase to their 2006 basic salary for pension purposes.
Mike Farley will receive a 5% increase to his 2006 basic salary for pension purposes in view of the significant increase he received in 2006 on his appointment as Chief Executive.
Mike Killorans pension for service prior to 6 April 2006 will be linked to the earnings cap of 105,600 increased by 10% on 1 January 2007.
The pensionable salary caps for Messrs White, Farley, Bryant and Killoran will increase thereafter annually by not more than 5% p. a. until retirement.
The Committee has decided that, from 6 April 2006, for future service only Mike Killoran should participate in the defined benefit scheme on an uncapped basis receiving benefits based on his basic salary.
These provisions will soften the impact of the significant salary increase on the level of historic pension benefit, whilst providing a fair outcome for executives who would normally have pension provision calculated using their final salary under such schemes and taking into account that the salary level is no higher than market median levels.
BENEFITS IN KIND In addition to the above, the executive Directors remuneration also includes fully financed cars, membership of the Group private medical scheme and the Group income protection scheme, subscriptions and some telephone costs.
These benefits are not pensionable.
ALL EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEME The executive Directors may also participate in the Companys Save as You Earn Scheme, which is open to all permanent employees who have more than six months service.
SERVICE CONTRACTS All executive Directors have service contracts and in line with the recommendations of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, the notice period for each executive Director does not exceed 12 months.
The contracts expire on the Directors 60th birthday.
In circumstances following a change of control, or where dismissed in breach of contract, an executive Director is entitled to payments for termination of employment, but in no circumstances will such payments exceed 12 months remuneration.
The executive Directors contracts are all dated 24 April 2002 but are effective from 1 January 2002.
None of the non-executive Directors have service contracts.
Mike Farley, David Bryant, Hamish Leslie Melville and Neil Davidson retire at the Annual General Meeting and are offering themselves for re-election.
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES The Committee has for some time encouraged significant long term share ownership of the Companys shares by the executive Directors.
In order to comply with best practice, formal share ownership guidelines were established in 2002.
As a result, the Committee now requires each executive Director to hold Persimmon shares.
John White has to hold a minimum value of shares equivalent to three times his basic salary and all other executive directors were required to build and maintain shareholdings equivalent in value to two times their basic salary.
In all cases the executive Directors shareholdings are significantly in excess of the shareholding guideline.
The Committee recognises that executive Directors may be required to sell sufficient shares in the Company to satisfy any tax liability arising on the vesting of Bonus Shares or the exercise of options and vesting of awards granted under the Companys share option, LTIP and Synergy Incentive plans from time to time.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS None of the executive Directors currently has an external appointment.
Should an executive wish to take up an external appointment, he must first seek approval from the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH Shown below is the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE 100 Index over the last five financial years.
The Board has chosen this comparator as it is the benchmark for measuring the stock market performance of large UK listed companies.
As the chart shows, the Companys performance has been outstanding, with the value of an investment in Persimmon shares on 31 December 2001 delivering a return of more than 4.5 times the original investment.

They do not qualify for performance related bonuses.
The Board as a whole determines the fees of the non-executive Directors.
Adam Applegarth, Hamish Leslie Melville and David Thompson received additional fees as Chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committees.
THE AUDITORS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT ON THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING PART OF THIS REPORT.
As a result the salaries paid to members of this scheme were reduced by 9% which would have been the members rate of contribution to the scheme.
Salary related benefits remain based on the headline salaries published on page 39.
The performance-related bonus for 2006 cash and deferred shares has been paid as a result of the exceptional performance by reference to Group or divisional PBT and EPS.
Once again, year-on-year profit has improved significantly.
Notwithstanding this excellent performance, maximum bonus levels have not been payable.
As set out in the policy section, annual bonus earned for 2006 in excess of 200% of basic salary is deferred in shares for up to two years.
m Benefits include payments made in lieu of a company car, in accordance with the Group policy for all company car drivers.
Other emoluments are salary supplements in lieu of pension benefits.
During the year no Director waived his entitlement to any emoluments.
Mr J Millar, who retired as a Director on 30 April 2006 continued to be heavily involved in the Westbury integration in addition to his responsibilities associated with a number of major Group projects.
Mr Millar received a salary and bonus for the remaining 8 months of the year of 375,982 and benefits of 18,615 in his capacity as a Group Special Projects Director.
Mr Millars responsibilities will reduce in 2007 with a commensurate reduction in remuneration.
