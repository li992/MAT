12997ENTERPRI 11 12 06 4:23 pm Page 28 Directors Remuneration Report Information not subject to audit: Remuneration Committee and advisers The Companys Remuneration Committee the Committee is composed entirely of independent non-executive directors and is chaired by Mr A J Stewart, its other members being Mr D A Harding and Mrs S E Murray.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters being decided.
Mr H V Reid and Mr G E Tuppen attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee, if necessary, except when their own remuneration is being discussed.
The Committees key objectives are to: n determine and recommend to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, an overall remuneration package for executive directors: and n monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior management.
The Committee has been constituted and operated throughout the year in accordance with the provisions of Schedule A and B of the Combined Code.
This report also complies with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 which incorporates the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
During the year the Committee and the Company have continued to use the services of Ernst & Young LLP E&Y who have provided specific advice on remuneration matters relating to share schemes and the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans and who were appointed by the Committee for this purpose.
E&Y are the Groups auditors and also provide advisory services in respect of non-audit matters and taxation.
In addition, the Committee has sought advice relating to directors remuneration and the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan 2005 from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP who were appointed by the Committee and who provide no other services to the Company save in respect of advice in connection with the operation of the Companys incentive schemes.
The Committee, amongst other matters, determines the level of awards made under the Companys incentive plans, considers feedback from shareholders and undertakes an annual review of its effectiveness.
When setting the remuneration of the executive directors, due regard is given by the Committee to pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Remuneration Policy Executive Directors The Remuneration Committees policy is designed to ensure that the level and structure of remuneration arrangements allows the Company to attract, retain and motivate the exceptional individuals required to continue to enhance shareholder value.
Base salaries will be set accordingly, with a significant proportion of executive directors remuneration performance-related so that appropriate levels of reward are available for outstanding performance.
In addition, the Committee is, at all times, mindful of remuneration practices in other relevant companies.
To achieve this, the remuneration package comprises: n fixed elements: comprising basic salary, benefits and pensions: and n performance related elements: comprising short-term performance related cash and deferred share bonuses and long-term incentive arrangements satisfied by the award of shares.
It is the Committees policy that the performance related elements of the package should equate to around 60% of total remuneration for the executive directors based on an on-target, expected value approach to valuing the package.
The Committee believes that these performance related incentive arrangements provide rewards which reflect an appropriate balance between individual and Group performance and align the rewards to executive directors with the long-term interest of shareholders.
Share-based awards are satisfied by the use of existing shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust.
28 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2006 1 12997ENTERPRI 11 12 06 4:23 pm Page 29 Directors Remuneration Report The details of individual components of the remuneration package and service contracts are as follows: Basic salary and benefits Basic salary is a fixed cash sum payable monthly.
The basic salary and benefits are reviewed annually against appropriate comparators and taking account of individual performance.
Benefits principally comprise car allowances or the use of a motor car, fuel and private medical insurances.
Pensions The pension contributions are amounts equal to 25% of basic salary.
Current Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans the Plans For the year in review the Company had the following relevant Plans: n at the Annual General Meeting held on 24 January 2002 an ordinary resolution was passed adopting the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan 2002 the 2002 Plan.
The 2002 Plan provided for participants to earn non-pensionable cash bonuses and short-term and long-term share incentives: and n at the Annual General Meeting held on 20 January 2005 ordinary resolutions were passed adopting the Enterprise Inns 2005 Annual Bonus Plan and the Enterprise Inns 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan the 2005 Plan.
The 2005 Plan has replaced the 2002 Plan and no further awards will be made except under the 2005 Plan.
Further details of the Plans are set out below: Short-term share incentives under the 2002 Plan Under the terms of the 2002 Plan, the short-term incentive depended upon achievement of annual growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI.
There was a one year performance period for awards.
No short-term award was made unless adjusted EPS growth exceeded RPI by at least 2.5% over the performance period.
To achieve the maximum award of 20% of salary, adjusted EPS growth must have exceeded RPI by 15%.
Awards between the minimum and maximum limits were calculated on a straight-line basis pro rata to the growth in adjusted EPS between the minimum and maximum targets.
Short-term incentives may not ordinarily be exercised for 36 months after the end of the performance criteria period and then remain exercisable for a further period of 72 months.
Short-term cash and share incentives under the 2005 Plan Under the terms of the 2005 Plan executive directors are eligible to participate in an annual cash bonus scheme as determined by the Committee.
The maximum award level under the 2005 Plan for the Chief Executive is 100% of salary.
For the other executive directors the maximum award level is 75% of salary.
Awards under the 2005 Plan are subject to demanding Company performance targets such that no less than 75% of an executives bonus will be subject to a sliding scale of challenging annual adjusted EPS growth targets, with no more than 25% subject to challenging personal targets.
60% of any bonus earned will be paid in cash, with the remaining 40% deferred into shares a deferred share award.
Deferred share awards may not ordinarily be exercised for 36 months after the end of the performance criteria period and then remain exercisable for a further period of 6 months.
Awards between the minimum and maximum limits are calculated on a straight-line basis pro rata to the growth in adjusted EPS between the minimum and maximum targets.
The cash bonus awards for the year are shown in the remuneration table on page 33.
Long-term share incentives under the 2002 Plan Under the 2002 Plan, awards of ordinary shares were made to participants upon achievement of compound growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI over 3 years.
To qualify for any award, adjusted EPS growth must have exceeded RPI over a three year period by 5% compound 15.8% simple, and to qualify for the maximum award of 100% of salary averaged over a three year period, adjusted EPS growth must have exceeded RPI over a three year period by 20% compound 72.8% simple.
Long-term incentives may not ordinarily be exercised until 24 months after the end of the performance criteria period and then remain exercisable for a further period of 108 months.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2006 29 12997ENTERPRI 11 12 06 4:23 pm Page 30 Directors Remuneration Report Long-term share incentives under the 2005 Plan Under the 2005 Plan, long-term incentive awards have two elements: n an award of Performance Shares worth up to 150% of salary each year : and n an award of Matching Shares linked to the co-investment of up to 25% of salary in Investment Shares, which are then matched on a 2:1 basis.
Shares that can count as Investment Shares are: n shares subject to the Deferred Share Award under the 2005 Plan: and n shares acquired by participants using their cash bonus or other funds, up to the 25% of salary maximum.
Performance Share and Matching Share awards vest subject to the satisfaction of a sliding scale of average compound annual adjusted EPS growth targets and the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE 100.
More specifically, for awards made under the 2005 Plan in the past and it is currently intended in the future, one-half of an award will be subject to a performance condition based on average compound annual adjusted EPS growth.
This EPS based condition will measure the Companys average compound annual adjusted EPS growth by comparing the Companys adjusted EPS for the year prior to the date of grant the base year with the adjusted EPS for the third financial year following the base year, such that awards will vest as follows: Level of match under the relevant Percentage of relevant portion of Matching Award Average compound portion of Performance Matching Award Shares: annual adjusted EPS growth Award that vests Investment Shares Less than 7% 0% 0:1 7% 20% 0.4:1 15% 100% 2:1 Straight-line vesting will occur if average compound annual adjusted EPS growth is between 7 per cent and 15 per cent.
The remaining half of the award will be subject to a TSR condition which compares the Companys TSR performance over the three year period commencing on the date of grant with the TSR of the FTSE 100 as at the date of grant as follows: Level of match under the relevant Percentage of relevant portion of Matching Award Companys TSR ranking v. portion of Performance Matching Award Shares: the FTSE 100 Award that vests Investment Shares Below median 0% 0:1 Median 20% 0.4:1 Upper quintile 100% 2:1 Straight-line vesting will occur if the Companys TSR ranking is between median and upper quintile.
All awards vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant and remain exercisable for a further period of 6 months.
TSR will be calculated by averaging the Net Return Index of each company over the six month period prior to grant and vesting, unless the Committee determines that a shorter or longer period is a more appropriate way of ensuring that the condition constitutes a fair measure of the Companys TSR performance over the period.
30 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2006 1 12997ENTERPRI 11 12 06 4:23 pm Page 31 Directors Remuneration Report In addition, irrespective of the Companys TSR performance, no part of this portion of the award will vest unless the Companys adjusted EPS grows by at least 10% over the performance period, unless the Committee believes that it is inappropriate to apply this underpin.
For the avoidance of doubt, if both the threshold TSR hurdle of median performance against the FTSE 100 and the threshold adjusted EPS growth hurdle of 7% average compound annual adjusted growth are met, 20% of the total award will vest.
The Committee believes that these performance conditions are appropriate for the following reasons: n the adjusted EPS growth targets will encourage the executive team to deliver substantial annual adjusted EPS growth over the three year performance period: and n the TSR targets will require the Company to deliver returns to shareholders in excess of its FTSE 100 peers.
The Committee will, however, review the appropriateness of these performance conditions and the operation of the 2005 Plan as a whole on a regular basis in light of the Companys circumstances and prospects.
The Committee will seek independent advice to determine the extent to which the adjusted EPS growth and TSR targets are met.
In particular, the Committee will seek independent advice as to how to determine the extent to which EPS-based performance targets have been met in light of the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards, with the Committees objective of achieving a consistent measurement of performance.
Remuneration Policy Non-executive directors The fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board within the limits in the Articles of Association.
The non-executive directors are not involved in any discussions or decision about their own remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors takes the form solely of fees, which are set by the Board having taken advice on appropriate levels in light of the time commitment and responsibilities of each individual.
The Chairmans fee is approved by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee.
Service contracts The Companys policy is for all executive directors to have a service contract of no fixed term under which they are entitled to receive twelve months notice of termination.
There are no special provisions in the executive directors contracts for compensation in the event of loss of office.
The Committee would consider the circumstances of any individual case of early termination and would determine compensation payments accordingly.
A fair but robust principle of mitigation would be applied to the payment of compensation in the context of professional advice received as to contractual entitlement.
The service contracts of the executive directors include the following terms: Executive Directors Date of Agreement Effective Date Notice Period G E Tuppen 25 October 1995 1 October 1995 12 months D C George 25 October 1995 1 October 1995 12 months W S Townsend 31 October 2000 1 October 2000 12 months The terms of appointment for Mr H V Reid, Mr A J Stewart, Mr D A Harding and Mrs S E Murray reflect best practice.
Their respective appointments shall continue on an annual basis from AGM to AGM, subject to reelection, when applicable.
