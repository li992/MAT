Each executive director has a target bonus varying between 100% and 150% of salary and a For awards made in 2004 and 2005, a range of EPS growth maximum of 200% of salary.

The Committee has reviewed the bonus plan for 2007 to ensure that it complies with best practice and it remains relevant to the Company.
For 2007, the Committee has decided that the executive directors bonuses would continue to be primarily based on achieving Group PBT targets and, where appropriate, PBT targets in respect of the relevant business unit, in addition to the achievement of individual objectives.

The Committee is employee share schemes on the same terms as other confident that they will rise to these challenges, but when the employees.
Committee was considering the EPS targets for the 2006 awards, it was clear that there would be no significant growth Details of awards granted to executive directors during 2006 in 2006.
The outlook for 2007 and 2008 was more under the LTIP 2004 and in former years under other all encouraging but, taking the three years together, the employee share schemes are set out on pages 40 to 41.
Committee believed that the range of RPI plus 3% p. a. to RPI plus 10% p. a. would not be realistic for the 2006 awards.
Other benefits The Committee strongly believed that the senior management Other benefits include life assurance cover equal to four times team should be retained and incentivised to perform in order basic salary, company cars which may be used for private to take the business forward.

their families and accumulated dividend equivalent income on share awards when they vest.
Consequently, the Committee decided that, for the 2006 award, 25% of the award should vest for EPS growth over the performance period of RPI plus 2% p. a. with pro rata vesting until 100% vesting occurs if RPI plus 5% p. a. is achieved.
In the context of the outlook for growth from 2005 to 2008, this is considered a significant challenge for management and is considered by the Committee as being as challenging in the circumstances as the range originally proposed in 2004.
Accordingly, the awards were made on these terms in November 2006 to senior management at the 200% of salary level to Mr D J Burke and at the 150% of salary level to other executive directors.
The Committee intends to make further LTIP awards in 2007 of the same amounts.
Reflecting the improved outlook for profitability after the considerable work put in by management in 2006, the range of EPS growth targets for the 2007 awards will be RPI plus 3% to 9% p. a. for 15% to 100% of an award to vest.
The Committee believes that this range is challenging and is fully aligned with the best interests of shareholders.
These issues have been discussed with the Companys major shareholders, the ABI and RREV.
