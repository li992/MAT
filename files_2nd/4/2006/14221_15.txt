THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Board has a long established Remuneration Committee the Committee, which meets at least twice a year.
It is comprised solely of independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Committee comprises the following Non-Executive Directors: Mr. P. H. Blackburn who chairs the Committee, Mr M. J. C. Borlenghi and Mr. D. A. Haxby, all of whom are independent within the definition set out in the Code.
They comprised the Committee for all of 2005, the entire year under review and up to the date of this report.
Biographical details of all of the Committee members are set out on page 36.
The fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board.
The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any way in connection with the determination of their own fees.
The role of the Committee is to determine on behalf of the Board, the salary and benefits received by the Chairman and the Executive Directors and for overseeing the remuneration of other Senior Executives.
The Committees Terms of Reference are set out on the Companys website www.
Its key responsibilities are: to design specific remuneration packages which include salaries, bonuses, incentive payments, pension rights and benefits: to review the Executive Directors service contracts: to ensure that failure is not rewarded and that steps are always taken to mitigate loss on termination, within contractual obligations: to review remuneration trends across the Group: and to approve the terms of and recommend grants under the Groups incentive plans.
The Chief Executive, Mr. D. Williams, is consulted on the remuneration of Executive Directors and attends meetings by invitation but does not participate when his own remuneration is discussed.
The Chairman of the Board also attends meetings by invitation but does not participate in any way in connection with the determination of his own salary.
The Company Secretary provides information to the Committee and is in attendance at meetings.
During the year the Committee met four times.
The Committee also takes independent professional advice, on an ad hoc basis, as required.
The Committee reviews its own performance annually and considers where improvements can be made.
In January 2006, the Remuneration Committee appointed  LLP PwC, a leading consultancy firm with substantial expertise in Executive remuneration to assist the Committee in refining its strategy on rewarding and compensating its Senior Executives and in so doing have regard for market comparability and the remuneration policies of the Groups peers and competitors.
PwC advised the Committee during the 2006 financial year particularly in relation to the continued implementation of the Groups remuneration strategy and the provision of relevant market information.
PwC also provides the Company with taxation advice and consultancy services.
POLICY ON REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The Companys policy for 2006 and subsequent years is to provide remuneration packages that fairly reward the Executive Directors for the contribution they make to the business and are competitive enough to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and Senior Managers of the right calibre.
The policy is designed to incentivise the Directors to meet the Companys financial and strategic objectives such that a significant proportion of remuneration is performance related.
The bar chart below explains the relative importance of the elements of the remuneration package that are performance-related and those that are not.

indd 13 05 04 2007 11:09:27 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE POLICY ON REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CONTINUED In reviewing Executive Directors salaries due consideration is given to the levels of increase granted to other employees within the Group and the Committee reviews and notes the total individual remuneration packages of each of the other Senior Executives.
The Committee established in 2003 that the Executive Directors remuneration packages were considerably below both market rates and the median of the Companys comparator group, which comprises 23 companies of broadly similar market capitalisation to the Companys excluding finance and real estate companies and 20 companies having broadly similar levels of turnover.
The salary increases awarded to the Directors in 2004, 2005 and 2006 reflected the ongoing process of alignment with market rates for the various positions.
Basic salaries are reviewed annually or when a change of responsibility occurs.
The Committee considers that the targets set for the different elements of performance related remuneration including the share option schemes are appropriate and demanding in the context of the Companys trading environment and the business challenges it faces.
The Committee believes that the Earnings per Share EPS condition is appropriate for its share incentive schemes i. e. LTIP and DABS as it requires substantial improvements in the underlying financial performance of the Company in order for the options to become exercisable.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, in their capacity as Auditors, are required to review the calculations as to whether the performance targets for all relevant share schemes have been achieved before any exercise is permitted.
The main components of Executive Directors remuneration are given below: BASE SALARY AND BENEFITS Base salary and benefits are determined on an annual basis by the Committee based upon the recommendations of the Chief Executive and after a review of the individuals performance, experience and market trends.
The Chief Executive does not make recommendations to the Committee in respect of his own remuneration.
The Committee takes into account published remuneration information on comparable companies and salary policy within the rest of the Group.
Benefits comprise a company car, medical and permanent health insurance.
The value of benefits is not pensionable.
The annual rates of base salary in force during the year are shown in the table below: Annual rate Annual rate of salary of salary Name 2006 2007 Increase D. Williams 455,000 480,000 5.5% G. W. Davies 270,000 285,000 5.5% M. J. Chivers 245,000 258,000 5.3% C. J. Davies appointed 12 February 2007 219,000 The rates of increase in base salary for Executive Directors were higher than those for other employees in the Group because of the realignment necessary to bring their remuneration packages into line with the market.
ANNUAL BONUS The annual performance related bonus provides Executive Directors with an incentive to achieve performance targets, which are set at the beginning of a financial year.
The performance metrics for the year under review and the following year are shown in the table below: Profit Personal Maximum before tax objectives bonus % of % of % of Name salary salary salary D. Williams 2006 90% 10% 100% 2007 90% 10% 100% M. J. Chivers 2006 60% 60% 2007 62% 12% 74% G. W. Davies 2006 50% 10% 60% 2007 60% 14% 74% C. J. Davies 2006 2007 63% 9% 72% The pre-determined performance targets and personal objectives for 2006 were achieved in full by Mr. G. W. Davies and 73.4% by Mr. D. Williams resulting in the maximum 60% of base salary being payable to Mr. G. W. Davies and 73.4% of base salary being payable to Mr. D. Williams.
Mr. M. J. Chivers pre-determined performance targets, which relate to the profit performance of those businesses under his direct control and to the SIG Group as a whole were substantially achieved resulting in an amount of 49% of base salary being payable.
For the 2007 financial year the Committee has agreed that the maximum bonus that can be earned should be 74% 192,000 for Mr. M. J. Chivers, 74% 210,000 for Mr. G. W. Davies and 100% 480,000 for Mr. D. Williams.
Mr. C. J. Davies maximum bonus is 72% 162,000.
However, the maximum bonus will only be paid on the achievement of very stretching targets and personal objectives.

indd 14 05 04 2007 11:09:27 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED INCLUDING THE STATEMENT OF REMUNERATION POLICY FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 PENSION SCHEMES All Executive Directors are members of the Groups contributory defined benefit pension scheme, which enables members to retire at age 60 with a maximum pension after 40 years pensionable service equivalent to two thirds of final pensionable salary.
Pensionable salary is basic salary, excluding bonuses.
Final pensionable salary is the average of the highest three consecutive pensionable salaries in the last ten years before retirement.
For service up to 31 July 2002, pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase by 5% per annum compound.
Following consultation with the active membership of the scheme certain changes were made to the contribution levels and benefits in order to limit future liabilities and, consequently, for service from 1 August 2002, pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase by the lower of 5% per annum or the increase in the Retail Price Index.
On death before retirement, a lump sum equal to four times current salary is paid, together with a spouses pension of 50% of pensionable salary.
As part of this scheme, all Executive Directors are covered by permanent health insurance.
In March 2006 the Board agreed that the rules of the Groups contributory defined pension scheme should be amended to permit continued accrual in the Scheme to age 65.
Members will still be permitted to take their benefits at age 60 without abatement if they so wish.
SHARE OPTION SCHEMES Long Term Incentive Plans LTIP All Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the LTIP.
Under the LTIP participating Directors and other designated Senior Managers are granted nil cost share options having a value of up to a maximum of 70% of base salary.
In 2004 Shareholders approved the adoption of a new LTIP.
Options were granted in each of the five years ended 31 December 2003 under the old Plan and in 2004, 2005 and 2006 under the new Plan.
As set out on page 50 in the Directors share options table under the heading Long Term Incentive Plan, Mr. D. Williams, Mr. M. J. Chivers and Mr. G. W. Davies have no awards which had not vested at 31 December 2006 under the old Plan.
Awards under the LTIP are not pensionable.
Awards under both of the LTIPs are exercisable between three and seven years from the date of grant but the right to exercise options terminates upon the employee ceasing to hold office with the Group, subject to certain exceptions and the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
All LTIP awards are subject to earnings per share performance conditions.
The performance targets attaching to LTIP Awards that are still subject to performance are set out below.
In the case of the LTIP Awards made in 2004, 2005 and 2006, the performance condition is based on real in excess of RPI annual compound growth in EPS as shown below.
The three year performance period for Awards starts at the beginning of the financial year in which the Award is made.
There is no facility for retesting the performance condition after the end of the three year performance period.
Real annual compound growth in Group EPS over three years Percentage of Award vesting Threshold 3% 30% Maximum 10% 100% Between Threshold and Maximum 3% 10% Pro-rata between 30% and 100% For the Awards to be granted in 2007 the Committee has decided that the threshold at which 30% of the Award vests will be increased to requiring 5% real annual compound growth in EPS over the three year performance period.
The above performance conditions were chosen because they were believed to be challenging and not only take account of the need for long term performance and commitment but also are an important means of aligning the interests of employees and Shareholders.
At the end of the relevant period the Remuneration Committee assesses whether the performance conditions have been satisfied.
In 2006 Awards were made under the LTIP to Mr. D. Williams with a value of 70% of his base salary and to Mr. M. J. Chivers and Mr. G. W. Davies with a value of 50% of their base salary as shown in the table on page 50.
Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme DABS In 2004, Shareholders approved the introduction of a DABS.
Participants including Executive Directors are invited to use up to 50% of their annual performance-related cash bonus after income tax and national insurance in respect of the preceding financial year to purchase shares in the Company.
The purchased shares must be retained for three years.
Participants purchasing such shares will be eligible to receive up to a maximum of one additional free matching share for every share purchased, providing certain pre-set real in excess of RPI annual compound EPS growth targets are met over a three year period.
For 2006 the performance targets for the DABS are shown below: Real annual compound growth in Group EPS over three years Percentage of Award vesting Threshold 3% 50% Maximum 5% 100% Between Threshold and Maximum 3% 5% Pro-rata between 50% and 100% The above performance conditions were chosen because they were believed to be challenging and not only take account of the need for long term performance and commitment but also are an important means of aligning the interests of employees and Shareholders.
Awards made under the DABS are not pensionable and are set out in the table on page 50.

indd 15 05 04 2007 11:09:27 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES CONTINUED 1997 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Under the ESOS, Executives could be awarded an annual grant of share options at market price, provided that the total amount payable by him to exercise options under the ESOS or any other share option scheme of the Group excluding savings related schemes granted during the immediately preceding ten years does not exceed four times base salary, bonus and benefits.
Awards under this scheme are not pensionable.
Options under the ESOS are exercisable between three and ten years for the Inland Revenue approved scheme and three and seven years for the unapproved scheme from the date of grant.
The Committee has resolved that following the introduction of the DABS, no further options will be granted under this scheme.
Employee Share Schemes The Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys Share Incentive Plan SIP, which commenced in November 2005 and is open to all UK employees of the Group.
This replaced the Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE for UK employees as a decision has been taken not to operate both schemes at the same time.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, do not have service contracts The Companys policy is that Non-Executive Directors, are appointed for specific terms of three years unless otherwise terminated earlier by and at the discretion of either party upon three months written notice.
Non-Executive Directors appointments are reviewed at the end of each three year term.
Non-Executive Directors will normally be expected to serve two three-year terms, although the Board may invite them to serve for an additional period.
The Executive Directors are responsible for recommending to the Board the fees of Non-Executive Directors.
The basic Non-Executive Director fee is calculated by reference to current market levels and takes account of the time commitment and the responsibilities of the Non-Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors do not receive benefits from the Company and they are not eligible to join the Companys pension scheme or participate in any bonus or incentive scheme or any of the Companys share option schemes.
Any reasonable expenses that they incur in the furtherance of their duties are repaid by the Company.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors fees are reviewed in May each year with any increase being payable from 1 June.
The dates of their letters of appointment and annual entitlement to fees are set out below: Chairman of Senior Remuneration Date of Independent Audit Committee Total letter of Basic fee Director fee fee annual fees appointment L.

The service contract for Mr. D. Williams is dated 4 December 2006.
The Company can terminate his employment forthwith in lieu of a 12 month notice period or any unexpired portion thereof by paying to him an amount equal to his basic salary for such period and an amount in lieu of the bonus which he would have received had he remained employed during the notice period and providing him with all benefits to which he is entitled.
If the Company terminates employment without giving notice or making a payment in lieu, any damages to which he may be entitled is to be calculated in accordance with common law principles, including those relating to mitigation of loss and accelerated receipt.
The service contracts for Mr. M. J. Chivers, Mr. G. W. Davies and Mr. C. J. Davies are dated 1 January 1995, 1 August 2002 and 12 September 2002.
The Company can discharge any obligation in relation to the unexpired portion of their notice period or any notice required to be given under their service contracts by making a payment in lieu thereof subject to the deduction of tax and national insurance.
If the Company terminates employment without giving notice or making a payment in lieu, any damages to which the Executive may be entitled is to be calculated in accordance with common law principles, including those relating to mitigation of loss and accelerated receipt.
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES To better align Executive Director interests with those of Shareholders the Company has established the principle of requiring Executive Directors to build up and maintain a beneficial holding of shares in the Company equivalent to a minimum of one times basic salary.
Under normal circumstances it is expected that this should be achieved within five years of 31 December 2004, or within five years of appointment, whichever is the later.
It is anticipated that the satisfaction of this target will be mainly achieved by the vesting of shares through the Companys share schemes.
