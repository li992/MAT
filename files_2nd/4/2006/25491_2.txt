2 These conditions require growth in headline earnings per share EPS over the relevant option period to equal or exceed the UK Retail Price Index RPI, plus 3% compounded annually over the same period.
In choosing the performance targets for this plan, the committee considered the merits of EPS-based targets against other possibilities, such as comparative performance or comparative growth in return on average shareholders' funds ROE against a basket of other companies.
The committee determined that EPS-based targets are most appropriate as they measure our underlying growth.
The committee intends to continue to apply this during the 2007 financial year but keeps the whole matter of the suitability of target-linked share based remuneration under periodic review.
