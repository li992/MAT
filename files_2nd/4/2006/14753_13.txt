Following the disposal of the Groups medical business and the resultant reduction in earnings, the Committee reviewed the performance conditions attaching to options granted under the SSL 1990 Share Option Scheme and 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme.
It was agreed that the performance criteria should be rebased to fairly compare historical earnings with those in the ongoing business, but the rebased figures should be no less stretching than the previous targets.
Given the share price at the times of grants which was in excess of 4.80, the Committee determined that only earnings since the financial year ended 31 March 2002 would be reviewed.
Consequently the earnings per share figures for the financial years ended 2002, 2003 and 2004 were rebased.
The calculations to determine the new figures have been independently checked by Ernst & Young LLP, although Ernst & Young LLP express no opinion on the accuracy of the base data and the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions.
No options were exercised in the period or the previous period.
There are no performance criteria for exercise of options under the SAYE schemes or for exercise of options under the 1990 Scheme.
The market price of the Companys shares was 321.75 pence on 31 March 2006 and ranged from 256.0 pence to 332.0 pence during the year.
