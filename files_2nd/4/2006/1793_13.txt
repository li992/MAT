The remaining one-third will be deferred in the form of ordinary shares of the Company which will be released to the Director on 31 March 2010, providing he is still employed by the Company at that time.
The number of shares comprising the deferred element will be determined based on the share price at the award date of 30 March 2007.
As Jim Cohen retired on 18 February 2007, the entire bonus is payable in cash in March 2007 and this amount is shown in the table above.

59 Balfour Beatty plc Annual report and accounts 2006 Remuneration report continued Directors pensions Executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund.
The scheme provides for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 under Balfour Beatty Pension Fund rules and each Director pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of pensionable salary.
The pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more years pensionable service at normal retirement age is targeted at two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to HMRC limits.
With effect from 6 April 2006, HMRC limits were changed, and as a result the earnings cap is no longer used when determining the maximum permissible benets.
However, the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund has retained a Fund specic earnings cap.
The salaries of Jim Cohen, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Fund specic earnings cap for pension purposes and details of the Companys contributions to additional arrangements for them are noted underneath the second table below.
Directors have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions, but neither the contributions nor the resulting benets are included in the tables below.
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the scheme at normal retirement age based on each executive Directors service to 31 December 2006 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.
