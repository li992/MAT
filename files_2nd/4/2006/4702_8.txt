Directors remuneration report.......................................................................... Dear shareholder Since the introduction of the current executive remuneration policy in 2004, the remuneration committee has conducted regular reviews to ensure that the policy remains appropriate for both the company and shareholders.
Our current policy continues to be based upon our wish to attract and retain the best global talent to deliver Diageos strategy within a framework of good corporate governance.
The key principles of the policy, which are interdependent, are: Our senior executive remuneration arrangements are intended to attract and retain the best global talent.
We believe that pay should vary significantly with performance over both the short and long term.
Our base salaries are generally set around the median of the relevant market for each role.
In exceptional circumstances, base salaries may be positioned above the median if justified by the requirement to recruit or retain key executives.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash after the end of each financial year and are determined by performance in the year against pre-set stretching business targets.
Our long term incentives comprise a combination of share option grants and share awards in each year, and vary with three year EPS and TSR performance respectively.
Our senior executives are required to hold shares in Diageo to participate fully in our share option and share award plans.
As a result of this years review, the remuneration committee has carefully considered the existing executive remuneration policy and concluded that it remains appropriate, however, its application has been modified in three areas to ensure that we continue to support our stated principles.
Annual performance bonus Toward the end of calendar year 2005, the remuneration committee engaged independent remuneration consultants to undertake a survey of bonus scheme practices in other large companies to ensure our annual bonus scheme continued to provide relevant and stretching performance targets and measures, incentivise year on year delivery of short term performance goals and reflect current best practice.
As a result of the review, the remuneration committee made a change to the profit measures used to determine annual performance bonuses, moving from profit before exceptional items and tax PBET only to a combination of PBET and net sales from 1 July 2006 whilst maintaining the overall proportion of profit measures of 70%.
Service contracts During the financial year, the service contracts for the executive directors were amended.
As before, they will require 12 months notice to be given on termination.
If a termination payment becomes due under the new service contracts, the remuneration committee may exercise its discretion to require half of the termination payment to be paid in monthly instalments and, upon the executive commencing new employment, to be subject to mitigation.
If the board determines that the executive has failed to perform his duties competently, the remuneration committee may exercise its discretion to reduce the termination payment on the grounds of poor performance.
Pensions In 2005, Diageo reviewed its UK pension strategy and as a consequence of this review, additional pension contributions were introduced for all employees.
The executive directors are now required to pay contributions of 2% of pensionable pay with effect from April 2006 rising to 4% from April 2007 and 6% from April 2008 onwards.
As a result of the changes affecting the taxation and limits on pensions introduced by the Finance Act 2004 Diageo has offered its employees whose benefits exceed the Lifetime Allowance LTA the option of having benefits in excess of this LTA paid from an unfunded non-registered arrangement.
No compensation payments have been paid to employees for the change in taxation treatment of pensions.
Further details regarding the revision of these arrangements for executive directors are provided in the body of the report.
I am confident that the committees approach and the current executive remuneration policy aligns our executive remuneration with the interests of our shareholders as well as appropriately motivating and rewarding the highly talented and committed team that is leading this company.
Lord Hollick of Notting Hill Senior non-executive director and chairman of the remuneration committee 50 | Diageo Annual Report 2006.......................................................................... What this report covers This report to shareholders for the year ended 30 June 2006 covers: the policy under which executive and non-executive directors are remunerated: and tables of information showing details of the remuneration and share interests of all the directors.
The report was approved by the remuneration committee, which is a duly appointed and authorised committee of the board of directors, on 29 August 2006 and was signed on its behalf by Lord Hollick who is senior non-executive director and chairman of the remuneration committee.
As required by The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations, this report will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting.
The board has followed and complied with the requirements of the Companies Act in particular, Schedule 7A of the Regulations and section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance in preparing this report and in designing performance-related remuneration for senior executives.
KPMG Audit Plc has audited the report to the extent required by the Regulations, being the sections headed Directors remuneration for the year ended 30 June 2006, Long term incentive plans and Executive directors pension benefits.
Terms defined in this remuneration report are used solely herein.
The remuneration committee The remuneration committee is responsible for making recommendations to the board on remuneration policy as applied to Diageos senior executives, being the executive directors and the executive committee.
The remuneration committee consists of all the independent non-executive directors: LM Danon from 1 January 2006, Lord Hollick, Dr FB Humer, M Lilja, WS Shanahan, HT Stitzer, JR Symonds and PA Walker.
Lord Hollick is chairman of the remuneration committee.
The chairman of the board and the chief executive may, by invitation, attend remuneration committee meetings except when their own remuneration is discussed.
Further information on meetings held and director attendance is disclosed in the corporate governance report.
The remuneration committees terms of reference are available at www.
com and on request from the company secretary.
Advice During the year ended 30 June 2006, Diageos human resources director and director of performance and reward were invited by the remuneration committee to provide their views and advice.
The remuneration committee also appointed the following independent and expert consultants: Deloitte & Touche LLP who provided external market data on levels of senior executive remuneration.
They also provide HR systems, accountancy and personal tax services to Diageo, including services to support the process for assessing risk management, control systems and processes.
Kepler Associates who reviewed and confirmed the total shareholder return of Diageo and the peer group companies for the 2003 TSR plan the performance cycle which ended on 31 December 2005, and provided a monthly performance update on all outstanding performance cycles.
They provided no other services to Diageo during the year.
Additional remuneration survey data published by Hewitt Associates, Monks Partnership, Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt was presented to the committee during the year.
Remuneration philosophy Diageos remuneration philosophy for senior executives is based on a belief in: Performance-related remuneration: it influences and supports performance and the creation of a high performing organisation.
Rewarding sustainable performance: it is at the heart of Diageos corporate strategy and is vital to meeting investors goals.
Measuring performance over three years: it aligns with the time cycle over which management decisions are reflected in the creation of value in this business.
Providing a balanced mix of remuneration: base salary, benefits, short term cash incentives, longer term equity incentives and pension.
Providing a competitive total remuneration opportunity: it helps Diageo compete for the best talent among companies with global operations and global consumers.
The board of directors continues to set stretching performance targets for the business and its leaders in the context of the prevailing economic climate.
To achieve these stretching targets requires exceptional business management and strategic execution to deliver performance.
This approach to target setting reflects the aspirational performance environment that Diageo wishes to create.
In Diageo, annual incentive plans aim to reward the delivery of short term performance goals with commensurate levels of remuneration.
Long term incentive plans aim to reward long term sustained performance.
Under both sets of plans, if the stretching targets are achieved, high levels of reward may be earned.
All incentives are capped to ensure that inappropriate business risk taking is neither encouraged nor rewarded.

52 | Diageo Annual Report 2006.......................................................................... Share ownership Senior executives are required to hold shares in Diageo to participate fully in the share option and share award plans.
This policy extends to the top 80 senior leaders and reflects Diageos belief that its most senior leaders should also be shareholders.

These are the tax approved share incentive plan and savings-related share option scheme in the United Kingdom.
Service contracts The executive directors have service contracts which provide for six months notice by the director or 12 months notice by the company and contain non-compete obligations.
In the event of early termination by the company without cause, the agreements provide for a termination payment to be paid, equivalent to 12 months base salary for the notice period and an equal amount in respect of all benefits.
The remuneration committee may exercise its discretion to require half of the termination payment to be paid in monthly instalments and, upon the executive commencing new employment, to be subject to mitigation.

54 | Diageo Annual Report 2006.......................................................................... Long term incentive plans payment and gains for the year ended 30 June 2006 In addition to the above emoluments, in the year the executive directors received payments and made gains under long term incentive plans as follows: 2006 2005 Executive 2003 share option a TSR plan exercises SEPSOS Total Total 000 000 000 000 000 Executive directors NC Rose 465 505 970 1,527 PS Walsh 808 934 9 1,751 1,568 Total 1,273 1,439 9 2,721 3,095 a The Senior Executive Phantom Share Option Scheme SEPSOS operated within GrandMet as a share price related bonus scheme and the last grants under it were made in 1996.
All remaining phantom options under SEPSOS were exercised in the previous financial year and a final payment was made to PS Walsh in November 2005.
Long term incentive plans LTIPs A review of executive share incentive schemes was conducted during the year and the committee remains satisfied that existing arrangements remain appropriate for both the company and shareholders whilst providing consistency of approach and stability over the longer term.
Annual awards of LTIPs are granted under both the total shareholder return plan TSR plan and the senior executive share option plan SESOP.
The level of award is considered each year in light of performance and the regular review of the performance measures and the vesting schedule used in each plan ensures that the LTIPs continue to support the business objectives and are in line with current best practice.
TSR plan Under this plan, at the discretion of the remuneration committee, participants are granted a conditional right to receive shares.
All conditional rights awarded vest after a three year period the performance cycle subject to achievement of two performance tests.
The primary performance test is a comparison of Diageos three year total shareholder return the percentage growth in Diageos share price assuming all dividends and capital distributions are reinvested with the TSR of a peer group of 17 other companies.
TSR calculations are converted to a common currency US dollars.
The second performance test requires that the remuneration committee does not recommend the release of awards unless it considers that there has been an underlying improvement in Diageos three year financial performance, typically measured by an adjusted earnings per share measure EPS.
For awards made before July 2005 the performance cycles began on 1 January each year.
For awards made after July 2005 the performance cycle begins on 1 July each year.
For the performance cycles 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2005 and 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2006, the peer group consists of Altria, Anheuser-Busch, Campbell Soup, Carlsberg, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Heineken, Heinz, Inbev, Kelloggs, McDonalds, Nestl, PepsiCo, Pernod Ricard, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Yum!
There are no reserve companies remaining for the 2003 or 2004 plans.
For performance cycles from 1 January 2005, the peer group consists of Anheuser-Busch, Brown Forman, Cadbury Schweppes, Carlsberg, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Groupe Danone, Heineken, Heinz, Inbev, Nestl, PepsiCo, Pernod Ricard, Procter & Gamble, SAB Miller, Scottish & Newcastle and Unilever.
The reserve company is LOral.
The following table shows the percentage of the award that will normally be released at the end of the performance cycle: 2005 2007 and subsequent performance cycles Ranking in peer group 1-2 3456789 10-18 % of award released 150 142 114 94 83 72 61 35 nil For the Jan 04 Dec 06 performance cycle the level of vesting is 50% of the initial award.
Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 55 Directors remuneration report continued.......................................................................... Directors interests in TSR plan awards The following table shows the directors interests in the TSR plan.
Details of executive share options are shown separately below.
For the 2003 and 2004 plan cycles, 50%, and for plan cycles from 2005 onwards, 35%, of this number of shares would be released for achieving position nine in the peer group.
No shares would be released for achievement of position 10 or below.
b This number reflects that 150% of the number of shares initially awarded would be released for achieving position one or two in the peer group.
c The three year performance cycle for the 2003 TSR award ended on 31 December 2005.
The number of shares released was 61.1% of the initial award.
This was based on a relative TSR ranking of position eight in the peer group at the end of the performance cycle.
Kepler Associates independently verified the TSR increase and ranking.
The remuneration committee reviewed and confirmed Diageos EPS growth over the performance cycle exceeded the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index RPI over the same period and determined this represented an underlying improvement in financial performance that permitted the release of the awards.
d The price on 17 February 2006, the release date.
The market price was 624 pence when the award was made on 21 February 2003. e The directors interests at 14 August 2006 were the same as at 30 June 2006. f For performance cycles ending on 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007, the remuneration committee will normally approve the release of awards in the February following the end of the performance cycle.
For awards made with effect from July 2005, the remuneration committee will normally approve their release in the August following the end of the relevant performance cycle.
g The timing of awards under the TSR plan was aligned with the financial year in 2004.
To effect this transition, awards granted on 18 February 2005 were a one-off half size award with a performance cycle that began on 1 January 2005. h The market price on 2 September 2005, the award date, was 815 pence.
Senior executive share option plan SESOP Options granted under SESOP cannot normally be exercised unless a performance condition is satisfied.
The current performance condition is based on the increase in Diageos EPS over a three year period.
If the increase in this EPS measure is at least 15 percentage points greater than the increase in the RPI over the same period, then all the options can be exercised.
If the increase in this EPS measure is at least 12 percentage points greater than that of the RPI but less than 15 percentage points, half of the options can be exercised.
For options granted prior to October 2004, if the options fail either initial performance condition, the three year assessment period will be rolled forward by a year and a re-test carried out at that time.
However, the performance condition can only be rolled forward a maximum of three times.
For options granted from October 2004, no re-test is permitted.
The following table shows, for the directors who held office during the year, the number of options held under all executive share option schemes and savings-related schemes.
The mid-market price for ordinary shares at 30 June 2006 was 917 pence 30 June 2005 823 pence: 14 August 2006 941 pence.
The highest mid-market price during the year was 928 pence and the lowest mid-market price was 778 pence.
Exercisable options are those that have vested and can be exercised in the option period:not exercisable are those options where the minimum holding period has not been completed or the performance conditions have not yet been met.
The option period starts from the earliest month in which the options may be exercised and ends with the month in which the options lapse.
Growth in Diageos EPS over the three years ending 30 June 2006 did not exceed the performance condition and therefore the options are not yet exercisable and the performance condition will be re-tested in 2007.
The facility to re-test was removed in October 2004 and as such this is the last grant eligible for re-testing under the Rules of the Plan.
b Options granted under the savings-related share option scheme.
Long term incentive plans and change of control In the event of a change of control, outstanding TSR plan awards would be released and outstanding share options would become exercisable, based on the extent to which the relevant performance conditions had been met since the initial award or grant respectively, and time apportioned to reflect the shortened performance period that had elapsed, and at the remuneration committees discretion.
Measurement of performance under IFRS For the year ended 30 June 2006, the group no longer reports its financial statements under UK GAAP and has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
The remuneration committee has reviewed the impact of the introduction of IFRS for incentive scheme purposes to ensure that performance achievement was and will be measured on a consistent basis for existing plans.
For those plans impacted by this change, a review of the material differences between IFRS and UK GAAP has been conducted and, where appropriate, the 2006 results have been restated to UK GAAP.
Pension provision Scheme details NC Rose and PS Walsh are members of the Diageo pension scheme.
They accrue pension rights at the rate of onethirtieth of base salary each year.
Bonus payments and other benefits are not included in pensionable pay.
The pension at NRA will not be less than two-thirds of base pay in the 12 months prior to retirement less any pension benefits accrued elsewhere.
Subject to the consent of the company, no actuarial reduction is currently applied upon early retirement on or after age 57.
Pensions in payment are increased each year in line with increases in the RPI subject to a maximum of 5% per annum, and a minimum of 3% per annum.
Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 57 Directors remuneration report continued.......................................................................... On death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable salary would become payable, together with a spouses pension of two-thirds of the executive directors prospective pension.
Upon death after retirement, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the executive directors pension before commutation is payable.
Employee contributions equal to 2% of base pay were introduced on 1 April 2006, increasing to 6% of base pay by 1 April 2008.
As a result of changes introduced by the Finance Act 2004 affecting the taxation of pensions from 6 April 2006, executive directors were offered the option of having benefits in excess of their personal LTA provided by an unfunded non-registered arrangement.
Both directors have opted to have part of their benefits provided from this unfunded arrangement.
No compensation payments were paid as a result of the change in legislation.
All benefits remain subject to the Inland Revenue limits that were in force on 5 April 2006.
Executive directors pension benefits Details of the accrued pension to which each director is entitled had they left service on 30 June 2006 and the transfer value of those accrued pensions are shown in the following table.
The accrued pensions shown represent the annual pension to which each executive director would be entitled at NRA.
The transfer value is broadly the cost to Diageo if it had to provide the equivalent pension benefit.
The transfer values shown in the following table have been calculated in accordance with the Guidance Note published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries GN11.

c The increases in the transfer values during the year were attributable to an additional years service 36% for NC Rose and 25% for PS Walsh and the salary increase in the year 36% for NC Rose and 38% for PS Walsh.
The remainder of the increase is attributable to changes in market conditions, in particular, interest earned on the transfer value and changes in index-linked gilt markets over the year.
d Employee pension contributions were introduced from 1 April 2006.
NC Rose made pension contributions during the year of 2,850 30 June 2005 nil and PS Walsh made pension contributions of 4,950 30 June 2005 nil.
Share and other interests The beneficial interests of the directors in office at 30 June 2006 in the ordinary shares of the company are shown in the table below.
NC Rose and PS Walsh are among the potential beneficiaries of these trusts and are deemed to have an interest in all these shares and shares subject to call options.
Performance graph The graph below shows the total shareholder return for Diageo and the FTSE 100 Index since 30 June 2001.
The FTSE 100 Index reflects the 100 largest UK quoted companies by market capitalisation and has been chosen because it is a widely recognised performance benchmark for large UK companies.
The graph shows that Diageo outperformed the FTSE 100 Index over this five year period.
The TSR plan, which measures TSR against a defined peer group of 17 other companies, is not based on the same performance period.
