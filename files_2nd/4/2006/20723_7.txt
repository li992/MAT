Dundee, 17 March 2006 The transfer values of the accrued pensions and the transfer values of the inflation adjusted increases in the accrued pensions in the period have been calculated by the actuary of the scheme in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11.
The changes in the transfer values between 31 January 2005 and 31 January 2006 are significantly influenced by the assumptions underlying their calculation and market conditions.
The disclosure of the increases in the inflation adjusted accrued pensions and the transfer values of those increases is a requirement of the UK Listing Authority.
The other disclosures are required by the Companies Act 1985.
Alan Young was credited with 5 years pensionable service in August 1988.
It was funded as to 2 years 1 month by a transfer in from a scheme connected with previous employment and 2 years 11 months by a discretionary increase.
Mr Youngs service is also being enhanced by six months in respect of each actual year of service over a period of 10 years ending on his 60th birthday.
By agreement, however, Mr Young will cease to accrue benefits under the pension scheme on 5 April 2006 without prejudice to the above enhancement.
His pensionable salary, like that of Sheila Ruckley, is not subject to the earnings cap as they both joined the pension scheme before June 1989.
Alan Hardens pension benefits accrue on the basis of a 1 30th accrual rate, which is twice that of the normal accrual rate for other scheme members.
From 1 April 2004, David Deards pension benefits accrue on the basis of a 1 40th accrual rate, which is one and a half times that of the normal accrual rate for the scheme.
