Individual aspects of remuneration were as follows: Salary Pension Accommodation Benefits 2006 2005 i ii iii fee supplement allowance Bonus in kind Total Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Executive: S Y Brikho from 1 October 2006 162 27 61 203 12 465 J D Early 292 58 62 16 428 400 S J Siddall 378 53 136 21 588 540 Sir Peter Mason to 30 September 2006 480 88 107 33 708 895 J A Monville to 27 July 2006 224 838 8 1,070 539 C A Riva to 31 July 2005 901 iv Non-executive: J M Green-Armytage 200 200 200 E P Airey 65 65 58 J A Dallas 64 64 49 M O Hesse 70 70 53 P J Byrom 64 64 39 T W Faithfull 63 63 39 J-P Jacamon to 31 August 2006 45 45 53 Total board 2,107 226 61 1,346 90 3,830 3,766 Notes i Sir Peter Mason, Mr Siddall and Mr Brikho received a taxable supplement of 20 per cent of salary above the pension earnings cap.
Mr Early has received a supplement of 20 per cent of total salary in lieu of further pension accrual.
ii The bonuses detailed above represented the following percentages of their base salaries for the year against a maximum potential of 80 per cent: Sir Peter Mason 20 per cent, Mr Early 21.2 per cent and Mr Siddall 36 per cent.
Sir Peter Masons bonus is calculated on base salary for the 10 months of the year that he worked, including October when he was no longer a director.
No bonus has been paid this year in respect of the AMEC plc profit element which was below the threshold target.
The awards made reflect varying degrees of achievement against other specific business targets and personal objectives which included AMEC plc cash flow, the SPIE disposal and the strategic review in the case of Sir Peter and Mr Siddall, and profit and cash flow of the Investments business in the case of Mr Early.
As outlined in last years report, the figure for Mr J A Monville relates to a special incentive geared to both the proceeds of the sale of AMEC SPIE, which exceeded original expectations, and the maintaining of budgeted financial performance up to the point of sale.
This replaced his normal annual bonus for the year.
Mr Brikhos bonus represented the maximum 125 per cent of base salary for the three months of the year after joining AMEC, reflecting his excellent performance since his appointment.
As part of his joining arrangements, he had been guaranteed a minimum payment of 75 per cent of this maximum for the balance of 2006. iii The value of benefits in kind received during the year relates principally to the provision of a company car or car allowance, travelling expenses and private medical expenses insurance.
Unemployment insurance was also made available to Mr Monville in accordance with French practice.
iv As a one-off arrangement, non-executive directors other than the chairman each received additional fees of 20,000 to recognise the exceptional time commitment resulting from the companys strategic review and sale of SPIE.
Ms Airey received 1,667 for chairing the trustee boards of the main UK pension schemes up to 1 March 2006.
Ms Hesse received US$ 10,000 for chairing the North America Advisory Board.
The performance conditions relating to Mr Monvilles share awards were tested at the time of leaving.
The minimum conditions were considered not to have been met and as a result the awards lapsed.
iii The awards made to Mr Brikho under the Recruitment Plan that vest in Dec 2006, Dec 2007 and Feb 2009 are not subject to performance conditions.
These replaced share awards made by his former employer which were forfeit on joining AMEC.
iv The first portion of Mr Brikhos award under the Recruitment Plan vested on 8 December 2006 at a vesting price of 415.5 pence, being the closing market price for the previous day.
v The terms and conditions of the Performance Share Plan 2002 have not been varied during the year.
vi The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2006 was 421.50 pence 2005: 343.50 pence.
vii The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 271.25 pence to 439.50 pence.
viii The register of directors interests, which is open to inspection at the companys registered office, contains full details of directors shareholdings, share options and awards under the performance share plans.
ix Had the restricted shares detailed above vested in full as at 31 December 2006 the approximate latent value before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Mr Brikho, 2,933,000: Mr Early, 1,352,000 and Mr Siddall, 2,079,000.
These hypothetical figures assume that all performance conditions would have been fully met, which in practice may not transpire.

The minimum performance condition which applies to the awards made in 2002 was not met at the second time of testing.
These awards are subject to a further retest in 2007.
The minimum performance condition which applies to the awards made in 2003 was not met at the first time of testing.
These awards are subject to further retests in 2007 and 2008.
Executive Share Option Scheme awards made from 2004 onwards are not subject to retest.
iii A proportion of Sir Peter Masons award made in 2004 lapsed on his retirement to take account of the unexpired portion of the performance period.
The performance conditions relating to Mr Monvilles options were tested at the time of leaving.
iv Had the options been capable of being exercised and vested in full as at 31 December 2006, the approximate latent gain before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Mr Early, 434,000 and Mr Siddall, 528,000.
v The terms and conditions of the Option Schemes have not been varied during the year and all subsisting awards were made at nil cost.
Pension arrangements The following directors were members of defined benefit schemes provided by the company during the year.

ii Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
iii The value of net increase represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption service terminated at the year end.
It is based on the accrued pension increase after deducting the directors contribution.
iv T he change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company and directors, such as stockmarket movements.
It is calculated after deducting the directors contribution.
v V oluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
vi S ir Peter Mason retired on 31 October 2006 and elected to take a lump sum of 178,803 and residual pension of 28,987 per annum.
The figures in the table include allowance for these amounts.
If allowance for the lump sum is excluded, in accordance with Companies Act Regulations, the year end value reduces to 655,540.
The change in value during the period also reduces by the same amount, such that the transfer value at the end of the period is actually 96,053 less than the transfer value at the beginning.
