Group overview Operational review and Financial review and Financial statements CSR governance 59 Directors remuneration report Part I Unaudited information This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and has been approved by the Board.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee advises the Board on executive remuneration and sets the remuneration packages of each of the executive directors.
The Committee has written terms of reference and is comprised solely of independent non-executive directors.
During the year, the members were John C Morgan Chairman, Roberto Monti, D John Ogren and Neil Smith, who joined the committee in August.
The Remuneration Committee charter is publicly available on the Groups website.
At the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, the Chairman attended meetings in 2006, except when his own remuneration was being discussed, to provide advice on setting remuneration for other executive directors.
In addition, the Groups Head of Human Resources provided advice to the Committee, and MM&K Limited, a rm of remuneration consultants, provided advice in relation to the Groups Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS.
Remuneration Policy The Committee gives full consideration to the relevant provisions of the Combined Code and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 in formulating remuneration policy.
The Committees policy is designed to ensure executive directors are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Group and that their rewards are in keeping with the overall compensation goals and structures which apply across the Group.
Remuneration packages are designed to be competitive with those offered by a range of companies within the same business sectors and geographic areas as the Group.
Remuneration packages comprise performance related and non-performance related elements.
The current total remuneration package for each executive director comprises a basic salary, bene ts-in-kind, annual cash bonus, annual deferred cash bonus, LTIS and participation in the Groups pension arrangements.
In addition, M H Papworth, the executive director who joined the Board during 2006, participated in the Groups Long Term Retention Plan LTRP.
The Chairman does not participate in the Groups LTIS, LTRP or share option schemes.
This report also sets out the Groups policy on executive directors remuneration for 2007 and, so far as practicable, for future years, subject to changes in the Groups business environment and in market remuneration practices.
Basic Salary In determining the basic salaries of the executive directors, the Committee seeks to set total remuneration at competitive levels while ensuring that performance related pay makes up a signi cant part of the total package.
Annual Cash Bonus Annual cash bonuses are based on a combination of i the executive directors performance against annually agreed personal objectives aimed at achievement of the Groups business related goals, including goals in relation to the achievement of HSE performance targets and ii the Groups financial performance, measured against annually established financial budgets, comprising both an EBITA and a capital ef ciency measure.
In 2006, the capital ef ciency measure was Return on Capital Employed but for 2007 the measure will be the ratio of Operating Capital Employed to Revenues.
70% of the annual cash bonus relates to financial performance and 30% to the executive directors performance against his personal objectives.
The Committee xed the maximum cash bonus potential for executive directors for 2006 at 50% of basic salary.
Actual bonuses for the year are disclosed in the table in Part II of this report and re ect the Remuneration Committees assessment of each directors achievement of his objectives.
For 2006 performance, the overall bonus range was 41% to 46%.
Bonus payments are not part of pensionable earnings for service after 5 April 2002.
60 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2006 Directors remuneration report continued Annual Deferred Bonus A deferred bonus scheme was introduced in 2005.
This scheme matches the annual cash bonus but defers the payment of the additional amount for two years and is subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances.
In a year where the Groups pro t increase is less than a target level set by the Remuneration Committee, no annual deferred bonus will be awarded.
LTRP As disclosed in Part II of this report, an LTRP award was granted to M H Papworth during 2006.
Pensions All UK based executive directors are members of the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Bene t Scheme JWG RBS which is a fide ned bene t pension scheme.
With effect from 6 April 2007 future bene ts within the JWG RBS will be provided on a Career Average Revalued Earnings CARE basis.

Share Schemes Share Option Schemes The Group adopted the John Wood Group PLC No 1 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme and the John Wood Group PLC No 2 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme the Share Option Schemes after approval by the shareholders on the listing of the Group in June 2002.
The John Wood Group PLC No 1 2003 Long Term Retention Plan and the John Wood Group PLC No 2 2003 Long Term Retention Plan the LTRP Schemes and the proposed parameters of their operation were approved by shareholders at the 2003 AGM.
The Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS and the proposed parameters of its operation were approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM.
Prior to listing on the London Stock Exchange the Group operated an approved executive share option scheme, the John Wood Group PLC 2000 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and an unapproved executive share option scheme, the John Wood Group PLC 2000 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme the Former Share Option Schemes.
The options granted under the Former Share Option Schemes vest on the basis of periods of continuous employment with the Group and do not have additional performance conditions attached which have to be satis ed prior to vesting.
The Board has resolved that no further options will be granted under the Former Share Option Schemes.
Options granted under the Share Option Schemes are exercisable between four and ten years from the grant date and options granted to executive directors are subject to the achievement of performance criteria.
Options granted to employees are not subject to performance criteria.
This is to ensure that the Groups option package is competitive in all locations where it has operations, in particular in the USA where the Groups competitors do not normally impose performance criteria on the vesting of options.
The current performance condition for Board members in the Share Option Schemes is that annualised earnings per share growth over the measurement period must be an average of 3% per annum greater than the percentage increase, if any, in the RPI, over that period.
The measurement period is a period of four consecutive financial years, starting from the financial year commencing immediately before the date of grant.
The operation of the Share Option Schemes is subject to ongoing review by the Remuneration Committee with regard to eligibility, level of allocation and frequency of issue, taking into account the practice of comparable companies.
Grants of options are considered on an annual basis by the Remuneration Committee and grants to any individual are generally phased rather than awarded in blocks.
In the absence of exceptional circumstances, the Share Option Scheme rules set one times annual salary as a maximum individual award level.
62 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2006 Directors remuneration report continued Long Term Retention Plan LTRP The principle behind the LTRP Schemes is that an overall bonus pool will be calculated annually based on growth in the Groups adjusted earnings per share in the prior year.
The Remuneration Committees intention, based on current conditions, is that there will be no bonus pool if the prior year adjusted EPS growth is under a threshold of RPI plus 3% per annum.
The maximum bonus pool would be 5% of EBTA earnings before tax, amortisation and non-recurring items, which would be awarded if the adjusted EPS growth meets or exceeds RPI plus 10% per annum.
In setting limits the Remuneration Committee is of the view that they should be challenging but achievable.
To increase the retention value and to align with shareholder interests the annual awards from this notional bonus pool will be made wholly in shares under the LTRP Schemes, which then vest four years later if the executive continues to be employed by the Group.
The level of share award from the notional bonus pool to an individual will be calculated based on the market value of the shares at the time of grant.
The method of granting these share awards will be by way of par value options, which will be exercisable between the fourth and fifth anniversary of grant.
In the absence of exceptional circumstances, the LTRP Scheme rules set one times annual salary as a maximum individual award from the notional bonus pool, although it is the Remuneration Committees intention that individual awards would not normally be more than 50% of annual salary.
Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS In line with the policy of ensuring remuneration is competitive with that offered by a range of companies within the same business sectors and geographic areas as the Group, the Remuneration Committee introduced a LTIS for executive directors and other key senior executives in 2005.
It is the intention that executive directors and other key senior executives participating in the LTIS will generally not receive further grants from the existing share option and LTRP schemes.
Participation in the LTIS has been limited to those executive directors and other key senior executives who, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, can materially in uence the achievement of the Groups long term business goals.
The executive directors excluding the Chairman and about 30 key senior executives have been approved by the Remuneration Committee to participate in the LTIS.
Performance is measured in relation to a performance cycle of three financial years.
The start date of the cycle was 1 January 2005 and the cycle ends on 31 December 2007.
It is not anticipated that there will be a second cycle under this scheme.
The LTIS provides for share awards to be made after the end of the performance cycle.
It also provides for interim share awards to be made after the end of the first and second financial years of the performance cycle depending on performance from the start of the cycle to the end of the relevant financial year.
Share awards will be in the form of restricted shares.
An award will be deferred for two years after the award date and will be subject to forfeiture if participants cease to be employed in the Group except in certain speci ed circumstances within the deferral period.
During that time participants may not exercise any voting rights and cannot sell or transfer any restricted shares awarded to them.
However, participants receive dividends paid to ordinary shareholders by reference to a record date falling after the award date.
No share awards may be made unless the Remuneration Committee is satis ed that the underlying financial performance of the company justi es the making of an award.
The Remuneration Committee will set performance measures and targets in respect of each performance cycle.
For the executive directors, the performance measures are operating pro t, Return On Capital Employed ROCE and growth in the companys share price.
Energy Supporting Energy Group overview Operational review and Financial review and Financial statements CSR governance 63 Left to right: Mayra Sanchez Gordon Stirling Gregor Dunn There are Threshold, Target, Exceptional and Maximum levels for each performance measure and no share awards will be made for performance at or below Threshold.
The Remuneration Committee has set performance gures to be achieved across each of the LTIS performance measures.
After careful review and taking into account the strength of the oil eld services market, the Remuneration Committee has chosen to exercise its discretion to vary the performance gures for the executive directors upwards for both 2006 and 2007 to be ahead of the original levels so that, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the performance gures are as challenging as when they were originally set.
For 2007, the performance gures are 41% higher than those originally set for the Target level of performance.
LTIS awards for executive directors are based on 100% of opening salary at Target, 200% at Exceptional, and 300% at Maximum over the 3 years, i. e. at Maximum, the rewards, in the form of restricted shares deferred for two years, would be equivalent to 100% of salary each year over the period, converted at a share price of 146p.
For the other key senior executive participants, the LTIS operates on similar principles to those for the executive directors except that the performance measures will not include share price growth.
Instead, the performance measures are a blend of Group, division and company operating pro t and ROCE, as appropriate.
The overall potential award levels for the other key senior executives are two-thirds of the level for executive directors.
Since the introduction of the LTIS, its operation and effectiveness have been under constant review by the Remuneration Committee which, after consultation with professional advisers and discussion with some of our larger shareholders, has decided that a new Scheme, with a different design and structure, would now be appropriate.
Details of the new Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, which if approved would be based on three year rolling performance cycles with the first cycle beginning on 1st January 2008, will be outlined in a resolution for the Annual General Meeting.
The Share Option Schemes, the LTRP and the LTIS operate in aggregate within the Association of British Insurers dilution limits in terms of the issue of new shares.
The awards made to the executive directors with respect to 2006 are shown in Part II of the Directors Remuneration Report.
Service Contracts The executive directors service contracts have no xed term and are terminable by either party giving to the other not less than 12 months written notice of termination.
It is the Remuneration Committees view that these contractual notice periods continue to be appropriate and in line with current best practice.
None of the service contracts provides for pre-determined amounts of compensation in the event of early termination.
On termination of service contracts by the Group, in certain circumstances, executive directors are entitled to the payment of their salary and bene ts in kind provided that they will be subject to a general duty to mitigate their loss.
Within contractual constraints, the Remuneration Committee will endeavour to ensure that executive directors do not receive unwarranted payments if it is judged that their performance has had a detrimental effect on shareholder value.
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external directorships or other signi cant appointments without the Boards prior consent.
The service contracts for Sir Ian Wood, A G Langlands, A G Semple and W R Brooks came into effect on 1 May 2002.
The service contracts for T M Noble and L J Thomas came into effect upon their appointment as Group directors on 19 May 2004.
The service contract for M H Papworth came into effect upon his appointment as a Group director on 16 January 2006.
64 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2006 Directors remuneration report continued Non-executive directors Non-executive directors are paid directors fees, which re ect the commitment expected of them, and are reimbursed all necessary and reasonable expenses in the performance of their duties.
Additional fees are paid in respect of membership of a committee of the Board.
Non-executive directors do not participate in the Groups annual bonus, share option, LTRP, LTIS or pension plans.
The non-executive directors have each entered into letters of engagement addressing remuneration, services to be provided, con icts of interest and con dentiality.
Subject to the requirement for retirement by rotation under the Articles of Association, the letters of engagement do not have xed terms and are terminable by either party giving to the other not less than 90 days written notice of termination.
