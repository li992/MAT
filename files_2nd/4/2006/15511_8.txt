24 telent Annual Report 2006 Report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration A Introduction This Report outlines the Companys policy on remuneration of executive and non-executive directors of the Company and senior executives of the Group and details actual remuneration of both executive and non-executive directors of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2006.
During the year the remuneration of the Chairman and the executive directors was considered by the Companys Remuneration Committee.
The fees of non-executive directors were reviewed and determined by the Board.
This Report will be put to an advisory vote of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Board unanimously recommends that shareholders vote in favour of this Report.
B The Remuneration Committee: 1 Membership The Remuneration Committee was established by the Board with effect from 19 May 2003.
The Committee currently comprises the following non-executive directors: P C F Hickson Chairman M K Atkinson K R Flaherty W K Koepf D F McWilliams P C F Hickson has chaired the Committee throughout the year.
In accordance with the best practice recommendations of the Combined Code the Committees members are all independent of management and free from any business or other relationship, which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
2 Terms of reference The Committee operates in accordance with written terms of reference, which have been determined by the Board and take into account best practice and the requirements of the Combined Code.
The Committee meets formally at least twice a year and otherwise as required.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on broad policy to be adopted for executive remuneration and on the total remuneration packages of the Chairman and the executive directors and certain other senior executives of the Group.
This includes, where appropriate, the determination of basic salary, cash bonuses and other incentive scheme entitlements, other benets including pensions and the terms of individual service agreements.
The Committee has access to the advice and services of Nigel Baldwin the Group Human Resources Director and Peter Harris the Head of Compensation, Pensions and Benets neither of whom have been formally appointed by the Committee.
The Committee also takes the advice of the Chairman and Chief Executive, as appropriate, on the performance of executive directors and other senior executives but they do not participate in any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
Kepler Associates have advised the Committee on executive remuneration policy and practice and provide no other services to the Company.
3 Remuneration policy and practice The key principles adopted by the Committee in assessing remuneration packages for directors and senior executives are: remuneration will be set at levels which enable the recruitment and retention of talented executives: short and long-term incentives are required to retain and motivate executives to continue to deliver value to shareholders: and rewards will be dependent on performance and top-performing executives should attain base salaries and total remuneration above market medians and vice versa.
The main elements of remuneration of the Chairman and the executive directors during the year to 31 March 2006 were: basic salary: share-based incentives: and pension.
During the year to 31 March 2006 the Chairman and the executive directors were remunerated by a combination of xed and performance related elements.
Fixed remuneration consists of basic salary, pension and benets in kind.
Performance related remuneration consists of share options.
The performance related elements of remuneration are intended to provide a significant proportion of their potential total remuneration.
Basic salary Basic salaries for the Chairman and the executive directors are normally reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
The general approach adopted by the Committee, when determining the level of salaries, is to take into account business performance, individual performance and skills and external competitiveness in conjunction with other elements of remuneration.
In assessing competitiveness, the Committee considers pay levels primarily across European companies in similar or adjacent market sectors, companies of a similar size, companies with whom we may compete for executive talent and pay levels generally across the Group.
As a result of the 2005 annual review, the basic salary of P S Binning was increased to 325,000 with effect from 1 July 2005.
J F Devaneys basic salary was increased to 350,000 with effect from 1 December 2004.
No further changes are planned as a result of the 2006 annual review.
25 telent Annual Report 2006 Share-based incentives The Company currently operates the Senior Management Share Option Plan the Management Plan, the Employee Share Option Plan the Employee Plan and the Sharesave Plan the Sharesave Plan.
The Remuneration Committee will determine, if appropriate, any future grants under these plans.
1 The Management Plan Options may be granted under the Management Plan for a period of up to five years from 19 May 2003 the Plan start date.
Under the initial grant made on 24 June 2003, options become exercisable in five tranches between 12 and 63 months after the Plan start date subject to the achievement of the following performance conditions: Percentage of shares subject to option that vest % Participants who released retention and emergence Other Tranche plan rights participants Condition 1.

between 51 months between 51 months and 63 months of and 63 months of the Plan start date the Plan start date 20 20 Does not apply to P S Binning and J F Devaney.
P S Binnings options became exercisable from 20 October 2003 being the date of commencement of his employment with the Company.
These performance conditions and the numbers of options granted to each participant were determined in order to: provide an incentive to deliver value to the Companys shareholders through the repayment of debt and growth in market capitalisation: and provide a level of reward appropriate to the Companys performance.
The performance criteria in respect of tranches 1 to 4 have now been met and tranches 1 to 4 have vested.
In order for tranche 5 to become exercisable, the rolling average market capitalisation must exceed the stated target for a 90-day period.
In order to recognise the creation of value for shareholders, the rules of the Management Plan and the Employee Plan were amended subsequent to shareholder approval granted at the EGM, held on 21 December 2005, such that the amount and timing of the return of cash to shareholders, which took place on 27 March 2006 and any subsequent returns of cash value to shareholders, are included in the assessment of the achievement against the market capitalisation target to which any remaining unvested options are subject.
Options were granted to P S Binning, J F Devaney and M W J Parton under the Management Plan.
Details are set out on page 31 of this report.
Each of these grants is subject to the performance conditions explained above although the dates on which the option granted to P S Binning becomes exercisable differ.
No director holds any share options or any other long-term incentive, which are not subject to performance conditions.
No further grants will be made to the Chairman or the executive directors under the Management Plan.
26 telent Annual Report 2006 Report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration continued 2 The Employee Plan Options may be granted under the Employee Plan for a period of up to five years from 19 May 2003.
Options granted under the Employee Plan only become exercisable to the extent that the performance targets to which they are subject have been satisfied.
The performance targets and vesting schedule for the initial grant of options are the same as those for the initial grant under the Management Plan.
Further options were granted under the Employee Plan in December 2004 subject to performance conditions, which are aligned with the initial grant of options.
These conditions are: Market capitalisation achieved after date of grant Percentage of shares under option that become exercisable Below 1.35 billion 0% 1.35 billion 25% if achieved before 19 August 2007 16.67% if achieved before 19 August 2008 1.5 billion and above 100% if achieved before 19 August 2007 66.67% if achieved before 19 August 2008 Between 1.35 billion and 1.5 billion percentage of shares vesting will be pro rated i no option can become exercisable within 24 months of grant: and ii any option, which does not become exercisable before 19 August 2008, will lapse.
The exercise price of options under the Employee Plan is determined by the Remuneration Committee and is not less than the middle market price of the Companys shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Ofcial List on a date or dates, in the case of an average quotation not more than 30 days prior to the date of grant of the options or such other period as the Inland Revenue may agree in relation to Inland Revenue Approved Options.
No options have been granted to the Chairman or the executive directors under the Employee Plan.
3 The Sharesave Plan The Sharesave Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2004 annual general meeting.
Options granted under the Sharesave Plan are linked to a savings contract, the proceeds of which may be used to exercise the option.
All employees including the Chairman and the executive directors are eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plan.
A total of 1,724, 274 options were granted to employees under the Sharesave Plan on 3 February 2005.
No further options were granted in the year ended 31 March 2006.
The Remuneration Committee will determine if any future grants will be made under the Sharesave Plan.
Cash bonuses Annual Incentive Plan At the 2005 annual general meeting shareholders approved an amendment to the Companys Articles of Association, by the deletion of Article 111, to allow participants in the Management Plan to join the Companys Annual Incentive Plan the AIP with effect from 1 October 2005.
Accordingly, the executive directors are now eligible to participate in the AIP with payments being based on Group financial performance for each financial year and on target maximum payments being 80 160% of basic salary.
However, it was determined that the executive directors would not participate in the AIP for the year ended 31 March 2006.
Pension P S Binning, J F Devaney and M W J Parton are members of the Groups approved UK pension scheme, the G. E. C. 1972 Plan.
Payment of pension benets is not linked to performance.
They have a normal retirement age of 62, other than J F Devaney who has a normal retirement age of 65.
J F Devaney was admitted to the G. E. C. 1972 Plan under standard terms and conditions with effect from 19 May 2003 and has accrued benets in the G. E. C. 1972 Plan since that date.
P S Binning was admitted to the G. E. C. 1972 Plan under standard terms and conditions with effect from 22 October 2003 and has accrued benets in the G. E. C. 1972 Plan since that date.
Basic salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable for P S Binning, J F Devaney and M W J Parton.
The earnings of P S Binning, J F Devaney and M W J Parton are subject to an earnings cap that restricts the benets that can be accrued.
Each has an arrangement to provide additional life assurance benets from those accrued under the G. E. C. 1972 Plan.
Funded Unapproved Retirement benefit Schemes FURBS were also operated during the year for P S Binning and M W J Parton.
As a result of the enactment of the Finance Act 2004, pension provisions came into force on 6 April 2006 that removed the tax advantages, which accrued for members of FURBS.
As a consequence, both M W J Parton and P J Binning have elected to have the contributions that were previously paid to the trustee of the FURBS paid direct to them from April 2006.
There is no additional cost to the Company in making this change.
Further details about the benets of the Chairman and the executive directors under the G. E. C. 1972 Plan and FURBS can be found in Section G. Other benets In addition to basic salary the Chairman and the executive directors receive certain other benets including car allowance, private medical insurance and life assurance.
C Directors service agreements The Remuneration Committee determines the terms and conditions of the Chairman and the executive directors service agreements with the Company including duration, notice period and termination provisions.
It is the Companys policy that: service agreements should be on rolling terms subject to individual retirement and termination provisions see below and have notice periods not exceeding one year: and in determining any termination provisions or payments, the Remuneration Committee will pay due regard to both individual circumstances and the need for mitigation.

28 telent Annual Report 2006 Report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration continued D Non-executive directors The policy on remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the Board, by reference to practice in companies similar in size to the Company and reects the importance and increasing complexity of the role.
A new fee structure for all non-executive directors was effective from 1 January 2005.
The fee structure is as follows: Senior Committee Committee independent membership Name of director Basic fee Chairman fees director fee fees Total fees M K Atkinson 35,000 20,000 15,000 5,000 75,000 K R Flaherty 35,000 5,000 5,000 45,000 P C F Hickson 35,000 15,000 5,000 55,000 W K Koepf 35,000 13,000 48,000 D F McWilliams 35,000 10,000 45,000 The non-executive directors are also paid advance fees, which, by agreement with the non-executive directors, are specically used to purchase shares in the Company.

29 telent Annual Report 2006 E Performance graph The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the Company to provide, in this Report, a line graph illustrating the Companys performance, measured by Total Shareholder Return TSR, as compared with an appropriate and broad equity market index.
TSR is dened as the return shareholders would receive if they held a notional number of shares in the Company.
It measures the percentage growth in the Companys share price together with the value of any dividends paid, assuming that the dividends are reinvested in the Companys shares.
The following graphs show, since 19 May 2003, being the date on which the Companys shares commenced trading on the London Stock Exchange, the TSR on a holding of shares in the Company as against that of a hypothetical holding of shares made up of shares of the same kinds and number as those by reference to which the FTSE 250 Index is calculated.
The FTSE 250 Index was selected for this purpose as it is a widely recognised performance comparison for UK companies of a similar size to the Company.

G Retirement benets The Chairman and the executive directors are members of the Groups principal pension scheme, the G. E. C. 1972 Plan, which is a dened benefit scheme.
The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2005.

Company contributions made during the year ended 31 March 2006 amounted to 8.2% of pensionable earnings.
Such Company contributions were restricted in a similar manner to the members own contributions.
30 telent Annual Report 2006 Report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration continued Following enactment of the Finance Act 2004, Inland Revenue restrictions on contributions have been removed.
In order to ensure there was no unexpected increase in members accrued rights under the dened benefit scheme, a scheme specic earnings cap similar to the previous IR cap has been introduced with effect from 6 April 2006.
Details of the Funded Unapproved Retirement benefit Schemes FURBS operated during the year for P S Binning and M W J Parton are set out below.
The Company made contributions to the FURBS established for M W J Parton during the year ended 31 March 2006.

The Company made contributions to the FURBS established for P S Binning during the year ended 31 March 2006.
A gross contribution of 25% of basic salary was paid as a pension allowance, 60% of which was paid to the FURBS established for him with the balance of 40% being paid direct to P S Binning.
As a consequence, both M W J Parton and P S Binning have elected to have the contributions that were previously paid to the trustee of the FURBS paid direct to them from April 2006.
