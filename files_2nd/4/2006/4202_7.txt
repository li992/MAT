Group accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
Intangible assets These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value Basis of preparation of the consideration given for a business exceeds such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with IFRS, IFRIC to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The standards Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of this impairment testing.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions used are those published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and endorsed by the EU at the time of after 31 December 1997 and prior to 1 January 2004 was amortised over its estimated useful life: such amortisation preparing these statements February 2007.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made prior to 31 December 1997 was written off directly to reserves in the year of acquisition, as a matter of accounting policy, and under IFRS 1 and IFRS 3 such goodwill will Accounting estimates and judgements remain eliminated against reserves and will not be written back to the income statement in the event of disposal.
The Groups critical accounting policies under IFRS have been set by management with the approval of the Audit Committee.
The application of these policies requires estimates and assumptions to be made concerning the future and judgements to Research and development be made on the applicability of policies to particular situations.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are Research expenditure, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure, whereby research findings are under the circumstances.
Under IFRS an estimate or judgement may be considered critical if it involves matters that are highly applied to a plan for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes, is charged to income in the uncertain, or where different estimation methods could reasonably have been used, or if changes in the estimate that would year in which it is incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Measurement and other have a material impact on the Groups results are likely to occur from period to period.
The critical judgements required when uncertainties generally mean that such criteria are not met.
Where, however, the recognition criteria are met, intangible preparing the Groups accounts are as follows: assets are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives from product launch.
Intangible assets relating to products in development are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date or earlier upon indication of i Provisions as disclosed in note 21, the Group has made significant provision for potential environmental liabilities and for the costs of the restructuring exercise following the acquisition of Uniqema.
The rationale behind these provisions is impairment.
Any impairment losses are written off immediately to income.
The directors believe that these provisions are appropriate based on information currently available.
Computer software ii Goodwill and fair value of assets acquired the Groups goodwill carrying value has increased significantly in the year Acquired computer software licences covering a period of greater than one year are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred following the acquisition of Uniqema as disclosed in note 28.
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives three to five years.
any impairment and the Groups goodwill value has been supported by detailed value-in-use calculations relating to the recoverable amounts of the underlying cash generating units.
These calculations require the use of estimates, however Revenue recognition as recoverable amounts far exceed carrying values, including goodwill, there is no sensitivity with regard to impairment.
Sales of goods Revenue comprises the fair value for the sale of goods, excludes inter-company sales and value-added taxes and represents New IFRS standards and interpretations not applied net invoice value less estimated rebates, returns and settlement discounts.
Group sales are recognised as revenue in the The IASB and IFRIC have issued additional standards and interpretations which are effective for periods starting after period in which the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party.

The following standards and interpretations have yet to be adopted by the Group: i IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures.
This standard will be applicable to the Group in 2007 and will primarily Interest and dividend income affect disclosures relating to debt, the interest rate swaps and any foreign currency contracts at year end.
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
ii Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements.
This will impact in 2007 and requires entities to disclose information that will enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the entitys objectives, policies and processes Segmental reporting for managing capital resources.
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products and services that are subject to risks iii IFRIC 10 Interims and Impairments.
This standard impacts any impairment losses which are recognised in interim or returns that are different from those of other segments.
A geographical segment operates within a particular economic financial statements which cannot subsequently be reversed in subsequent interim or annual financial statements.
environment that is subject to different risks and returns from other economic environments.
This standard will be applicable in 2009.
Employee benefits Pension obligations Group accounts The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
In respect of defined benefit plans Subsidiaries pension plans that define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation, obligations are measured at discounted present to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of pension plans is the net of the plan obligations and assets.
No allowance is made in the past service liability in respect of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date either the future expenses of running the schemes or for non-service related death in service benefits which may arise in that control ceases.
The operating costs of such plans are charged to operating profit and the finance costs are recognised as financial income or expense as appropriate.
Service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their of recognised income and expense.
Payments to defined contribution schemes pension plans under which the Group fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition pays fixed contributions into a separate entity are charged as an expense as they fall due.
over the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Associates Associated undertakings are those companies in which the Group has a beneficial interest of between 20% and 50% in the equity capital and where the Group exercises significant influence over commercial and financial policy decisions.
The consolidated income statement includes the Groups share of post-acquisition profits after tax, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense includes the Groups share of other recognised gains and losses, and the consolidated balance sheet includes the Groups share of the underlying net tangible assets of associated undertakings.

The entitlement to these benefits Exceptional items are non-recurring material items which are outside the normal scope of the Groups ordinary activities is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service such as liabilities and costs arising from a fundamental restructuring of the Groups operations.
Such items are disclosed period.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology separately within the financial statements.
similar to that for defined benefit pension plans.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation, with the exception of assets acquired as part Termination benefits of a business combination which are recorded at fair value.
The Groups policy is to write off the difference between the Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or cost of all property, plant and equipment, except freehold land, and their residual value on a straight line basis over their whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
The Group recognises termination estimated useful lives.
Reviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either i terminating the employment of current employees according productive assets, taking account of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear, and to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or ii providing termination benefits as a result of an offer adjustments are made where appropriate.
Under this policy it becomes impractical to calculate average asset lives exactly.
made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
However, the total lives range from approximately 15 to 40 years for buildings, and 3 to 15 years for plant and equipment.
All individual assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Share based payments The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using the Black-Scholes or binomial model as appropriate.
Impairment of non-financial assets In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payments the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting The Group assesses at each year end whether an asset may be impaired.
If any evidence exists of impairment, the estimated period of the options.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting as the recoverable amount is compared to the carrying value of the asset and an impairment loss is recognised where appropriate.
Group does not use market-based performance criteria.
In addition to this, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
