Equity Compensation Plan 2000 Schroders Key employees receive deferred bonus awards under the Equity Compensation Plan on Remuneration report terms designed to identify their interests with our shareholders and to retain their services in the Group.
The level of mandatory deferral is determined by the Committee in accordance with a matrix that is agreed in advance of the annual compensation review.
These awards do not give rise to any immediate entitlement but will vest in full on the third 26 27 anniversary of the grant date provided that the participant continues to be employed within the Group.
This Plan allows deferred awards to be granted in either share awards, fund awards or a combination of both.
Share awards Share awards can be granted over either ordinary or non-voting ordinary shares in the Company and are normally structured as rights to acquire shares at nil cost.
Historically awards under this Plan were made over non-voting ordinary shares.
As a result of a resolution approved at the 2006 Annual General Meeting share awards for 2005 and 2006 are in respect of ordinary shares.
If a participant resigns before the three years have elapsed then the following forfeiture provisions apply: Completed years of service from date of award Less than 1 1 and 2 2 and 3 3 Percentage of share award forfeited 100% 72% 44% 0% During the deferral period these awards do not attract dividends.
To the extent that the employee chooses to leave share awards within the Equity Compensation Plan for a further two years after vesting, the employee is rewarded with additional shares of 11.1 per cent.
of the number of shares which vest at the third anniversary.
This compensates for dividends foregone during this period.
Fund awards Fund awards are notional investments in a range of Schroder investment funds and can be granted by the Committee as an alternative to share awards.
They give holders a personal interest in the performance of our funds.
Fund awards have a three-year vesting period, with no option to extend, and have the following forfeiture provisions in the event of resignation: Completed years of service from date of award Less than 1 1 and 2 2 and 3 3 Percentage of fund award forfeited 100% 66.6% 33.3% 0% These deferred awards will be re-valued in line with the performance of the selected products and will be paid out in cash at the end of the deferral period.
In 2006 the first 60,000 of the deferred bonus award was delivered in share awards and any balance, above a minimum level, was delivered equally in share awards and fund awards.
In overseas locations where it was not possible to deliver fund awards the deferred bonus award was delivered solely in the form of share awards.
Equity Compensation Plan awards are not subject to further performance conditions as they are considered as already having been earned by reference to performance.
Share Option Plan 2000 Under the Share Option Plan 2000, the Company has granted market value share options over non-voting ordinary shares.
Options usually become exercisable if the option holder remains with the Group for at least three years and, for executive Directors, if the performance target has been met at the third anniversary.
Share options granted to other employees have no performance conditions.
In line with market practice, the performance target is that the Companys earnings per share growth defined as the earnings per ordinary share before any items considered exceptional, as derived from the Companys Annual Report and Accounts must be at least four per cent.
per annum above the increase in the Retail Price Index over a threeyear period.
There is no re-test if the target is not met after three years.
This performance target is a general condition and standard for each executive Director.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP confirms the performance criteria calculations annually for the Committee based on audited results.
Outstanding awards held by executive Directors under these Plans are disclosed in the Directors rights to shares table on page 32.
