remuneration report remuneration report Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were Mr K S Beeston Chairman, Mr T M Gateley, Mr L Browne, from 2 March 2006 Ms A M Frew and from 1 September 2006, Mr N B M Askew, the Company's non-executive Chairman.
In accordance with the revised Combined Code, issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2006, all of the foregoing non-executive directors were regarded by the Board as independent and Mr Askew was considered independent on his appointment as Chairman of the Company.
Prior to his appointment to the committee Mr Askew was consulted on remuneration matters generally.
The committee also consulted the Chief Executive, Mr M J Lamb, regarding the remuneration of the other executive directors and senior managers.
It also received the advice and services of the Finance Director Mr T J Slack and from 1 July 2006 Mr D M Hurt, the Group Pensions Manager, Mr P Flanagan, and the Company Secretary, Mr J OShea, who acted as secretary to the committee.
Deloitte & Touche LLP was engaged by the committee to provide advice on directors remuneration to the committee and played a central advisory role in relation to a review of pension arrangements carried out by the committee.
Deloitte & Touche LLP also attended certain meetings at the request of the committee.
During the year Deloitte & Touche LLP also provided due diligence, financial and tax consulting services to the Company.
Watson Wyatt LLP was also engaged by the committee to report on the impact of the governments proposed changes to the tax regime for occupational pensions.
Watson Wyatt LLP are the actuaries, investment advisers and administrators to the Companys main UK pension fund and also provide pensions advice to the Company.
Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw advised the committee on age discrimination issues and pension terms for executive directors and also acted as legal advisers to the Company's main UK pension fund and provided pensions-related legal advice to the Company.
Non-executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined, after reference to external benchmarks, by the Chairman and the executive directors.
However, the non-executive Chairmans remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The policy on non-executive remuneration is to pay an appropriate level on a comparative basis for their time and work on the Board and its committees.
They do not participate in any bonus or employee share schemes of the Company and no part of their remuneration is conditional upon the performance of the Company.
The Remuneration of the non-executive directors is shown in the table on page 45 and will be reviewed in 2007 the last review being in 2005.
For 2006 annual remuneration was as follows: Chairman 175,000, non-executive director 35,000 and additional remuneration for chairing a committee of 10,000 and for the senior non-executive director of 5,000.
The Board has established a shareholding guideline for non-executive directors, each of whom is encouraged to build up a holding of at least 7,500 shares, or 10,000 shares in the case of the Chairman, within twelve months of appointment.
All of the non-executives hold the relevant number of shares except for Mr L Browne, who intends to acquire further shares during 2007.
The normal period for initial appointment and first renewal is three years.
The appointment of the Chairman runs for an initial three year term.
Appointments are made under a letter of agreement subject to retirement by rotation and removal under the Companys articles of association.
There are no provisions for the Company to give notice or pay compensation in relation to the early termination of the appointment of the Chairman or any non-executive director.
There is a provision in the appointment letters to the effect that a non-executive director is normally expected to give one months prior notice of termination to the Company.
The dates and unexpired terms of the letters of appointment for the non-executive directors, which are available for inspection at the annual general meeting and at the Companys registered office, are as follows: Date of letter Unexpired term as at Date appointed of appointment 31 December 2006 as a director Mr N B M Askew 28.04.05 1 year 4 months 14.05.05 Mr K S Beeston 07.03.05 1 year 2 months 08.03.05 Mr L Browne 16.12.04 1 year 01.01.05 Ms A M Frew 16.02.06 2 years 2 months 02.03.06 Mr T M Gateley 30.10.06 2 years 10 months 01.11.03 38 Remuneration report Executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment Statement of policy The Company aims to ensure that remuneration generally and incentives in particular provide strong links between individual performance and shareholder interests.
The remuneration policy also recognises that the Company operates in global and highly competitive markets with the vast majority of its activities outside the UK.
The policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, motivate, reward and retain executives of the calibre required, and to align their interests with those of shareholders by relating a significant element of the remuneration package to specific performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee considers it to be important to maintain the flexibility to respond to individual circumstances.
However, its normal approach has been to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges, combined with realistic potentials for above market total compensation if performance is outstanding.
Remuneration comprises basic salaries, annual performance bonuses and benefits in kind, pension arrangements or a cash allowance and participation in a deferred bonus plan and a performance share plan.
In setting the remuneration of each executive director, the Remuneration Committee takes into account their role and responsibilities, skills and individual performance and makes reference to market rates as evidenced by published studies and comparisons with international UK-based groups of a similar size and complexity.
In this connection the committee considered market trend data prepared by Deloitte & Touche LLP.
The committee uses such data with caution in view of the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels.
It also has regard to pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group.
The policy of the committee is to set performance conditions which are both stretching but also reasonably attainable in the environment in which the Company is then operating.
The charts below show the proportion of executive directors aggregate remuneration paid as salary or performance-related pay based, respectively, on maximum and on target vesting under the annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements mentioned above assuming reinvestment of half of annual bonus payments in the deferred bonus plan and excluding the impact of changes in share price.
For the Chief Executive the maximum and on target levels of performance-related pay would account for 76% and 59%, respectively.
Maximum performance pay On target performance pay 25% 42% Salary Salary 75% 58% Performance Performance related related remuneration remuneration Consistent with the policy on service contracts, the executive directors service contracts are subject to termination on one years notice by the Company or the executive.
Contractual retirement age for UK directors was changed from 60 to 65 during the year in response to the new age discrimination law.
All such contracts allow the Company to elect to make payment in lieu of notice but do not include any other specific provision for compensation payable upon early termination.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to limit any compensation which might be paid in the event of early termination of an executive directors contract to the legal minima, taking into account mitigation and other relevant factors.
39 IMI plc Annual Report 2006 remuneration report remuneration report The dates of the contracts and period to normal retirement age for those serving as executive directors during the year are as follows: Date joined Date of Date of service Notice period Period to normal Group appointment contract retirement age to Board as at 31 December 2006 Mr M J Lamb 31.10.86 18.07.96 01.10.06 12 months 19 years Mr T J Slack 05.01.76 01.08.97 01.02.99 12 months Retired in July 2006 Mr D M Hurt 01.05.06 01.07.06 01.10.06 12 months 14 years 6 months Mr D C Nicholas 08.03.04 08.03.04 01.10.06 12 months 8 years Mr W R Whitney 03.08.87 01.03.04 01.03.04 12 months 2 years 10 months Retired on 31 January 2007 60 for Mr W R Whitney and 65 for all others Annual bonus Executive directors are awarded annual performance bonuses.
Maximum bonus is only payable if the stretching targets set by the Remuneration Committee are met.
The maximum bonus opportunity is 100% of salary.
For 2006 the annual bonus targets related to and for 2007 will relate to operating profit before restructuring costs and intangible amortisation, organic revenue growth and working capital.
During 2006 operating profit increased by 17%, organic revenue growth was 4.2% and there was an improvement in working capital efficiency.
On this basis the Remuneration Committee determined that bonuses in respect of 2006 be 88% of salary 2005: 100%, of which half must be deferred into the Deferred Bonus Plan.
Annual bonuses are non-pensionable in the case of all executive directors.
The auditor reviewed the computation of the annual bonus payable to the executive directors and confirmed to the committee that it was calculated correctly.
"Long term incentive arrangements The Deferred Bonus Plan ""DBP"" runs in conjunction with the annual bonus plan for executive directors and was approved by shareholders at the 2005 annual general meeting following consultation with major shareholders and institutional investor representative bodies."
Under the DBP, at least one half of each executive director's earned annual bonus will be mandatorily deferred for three years and delivered in shares in the Company.
The executive may also elect to voluntarily defer all or part of the remaining 50% of their annual bonus.
Additional shares, in the form of a matching award, may be earned to a maximum of 100% of the deferred bonus at the entry share price level or 125% for the Chief Executive if stretching performance conditions are met by the Company over the three year deferral period.
"The first awards were made in 2006 subject to economic profit, also known as ""economic value added"" EVA, based performance conditions."
EVA was chosen as the performance measure because it combines profitability with return on capital in a single measure and is being used across the Group as a management decision-making tool.
The EVA performance conditions attached to these awards are tiered with linear progression within each band from 0% to 20% of maximum vesting for positive EVA up to 100 million, 20% to 50% at EVA of between 100 million and 150 million, 50% to 85% at between EVA of 150 million to 200 million and 85% to 100% at EVA of between 200 million and 210 million.
The calculation of EVA is based on operating profit after tax, with appropriate adjustment for restructuring costs, less a capital charge on the invested capital in the business reflecting IMIs cost of capital.
"The Performance Share Plan ""PSP"" was also introduced in 2005 with shareholder approval and allows for share-based awards worth up to the normal policy maximum of 100% of annual salary."
Details of the awards made in 2006 are contained in the table of directors' awards on page 48.
The vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions over a three year period.
"One half is subject to earnings per share ""EPS"" performance conditions and the other to comparative total shareholder return ""TSR""."
40 Remuneration report For PSP awards, TSR performance is measured against a comparator group over a three-year period.
TSR is well understood and accepted as a performance measure for long term incentives and links rewards to shareholder value.
The comparator group for the relative TSR was chosen by reference to the companies' size, international spread and industry sector relative to IMI and comprises the following 18 companies Pilkington was originally included but has since ceased to be independent : Aga Foodservice ?
Weir Group If, at the end of the three-year period, the Company is ranked median in the comparator group, then 30% of the TSR-dependent awards will vest.
If the Company is ranked at the point between median and upper quartile i. e. at the 62.5th percentile, 55% of the TSR-dependent awards will vest.
If the company is ranked in the upper quartile top 25% of the comparator group, then the TSR-dependent awards will vest in full.
Awards will vest on a straight line basis if the Company's TSR performance is between these points.
If the Company's TSR performance is below the median, the TSR dependent awards will lapse without retesting.
To ensure that TSR reflects improvement in the underlying performance of the Company the Remuneration Committee also imposed a financial underpin.
"No PSP awards will vest unless the compound annual earnings per share growth exceeds inflation measured against the Retail Price Index, or ""RPI"" by at least 3% per annum during the three year performance period."
The performance condition for the second 50% of PSP awards is based on the Company's compound annual earnings per share growth above RPI over a three-year period.
EPS was chosen as an appropriate measure which rewards absolute growth in underlying earnings and because the Remuneration Committee believed it works well in combination with TSR which is a comparative measure.
The Remuneration Committee sets the EPS targets in respect of each annual award at the level it considers appropriately stretching given the conditions in which the Company is operating.
In respect of the EPS-dependent element of the 2006 PSP award, 30% will vest if compound earnings per share growth exceeds RPI by 3% per annum during the three-year performance period.
If the Company's compound annual earnings per share growth exceeds RPI by 12% per annum, then the EPS-dependent awards will vest in full.
Awards will vest on a straight line basis if the Company's EPS growth is between these points.
Awards lapse without retesting as to this element and also the TSR-dependent portion if EPS growth is below RPI plus 3% per annum.
The EPS targets for the 2005 PSP awards were set on the same basis except that maximum vesting required 15% real EPS growth and the measure excluded the impact of the Polypipe Group which was sold during 2005.
The EPS measure for PSP awards is otherwise based on IFRS earnings per share subject to certain adjustments including the elimination in whole or in part of restructuring costs, share buy backs, intangible amortisation and the change in fair value of financial instruments and derivatives.
As regards the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS, to the extent that any material adjustments are considered appropriate to ensure a like for like comparison, these will be reviewed and agreed by the auditor.
This applies to both the current and legacy incentive arrangements.
Executive directors who are eligible to participate in the DBP and the PSP, will be encouraged to acquire and maintain a shareholding in the Company with a value equal to 100% of their annual salary, within three years of appointment or June 2008 for those in office in 2005.
The Chief Executive attained the required holding during the previous year.
41 IMI plc Annual Report 2006 remuneration report remuneration report Legacy incentive arrangements Expired share option schemes Executive share options were last awarded to executive directors in 2004 under the Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme which expired in May 2005.
All outstanding options granted under this scheme were granted subject to stretching tiered performance conditions related to growth in earnings per share above inflation over a fixed period of three financial years as further described below.
For options granted over shares representing one times salary, vesting required growth in earnings per share of at least 6% above the rate of increase in the RPI over a three-year performance period.
This hurdle doubled to 12% growth above RPI for awards representing between one and two times salary, and the hurdle was 24% for awards of between two and three times salary.
The Remuneration Committee had a policy of awarding annual share option grants to executive directors of up to two times salary and up to three times salary for the Chief Executive.
Details of directors' share options are set out on page 48.
Options were priced at full market value without discount.
There is no retesting of performance conditions and options will therefore lapse if applicable performance conditions are not met in the relevant three-year performance period.
All options granted in 2004 will become exercisable in 2007 because, when measured on a comparable basis, adjusted EPS growth over the three-year performance period ending 31 December 2006 was in excess of RPI plus 24%.
The method adopted to assess whether performance conditions attached to options under the Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme were satisfied by reference to earnings per share for the three years ended 31 December 2006, was based on IFRS adjusted earnings per share for 2006 subject to certain adjustments including the elimination in whole or in part of restructuring costs, share buy backs, intangible amortisation and the change in fair value of financial instruments and derivatives.
The auditor reviewed the earnings per share computation and confirmed to the committee that the adjustments made were appropriate and correctly calculated.
Legacy long term incentive plan LTIP The last LTIP awards were made to executive directors in 2005 as part of the transition to the new long term incentive arrangements introduced in 2005.
The LTIP allowed cash awards to senior executives, including executive directors, up to a maximum potential value of 50% of salary for each year of participation.
The policy was to make an annual LTIP award to each executive director subject to performance conditions related to the economic profit of the Group as a whole over a period of three years.
As with executive share options, awards lapse without retesting if targets are not met in the relevant three-year period.
Economic profit is based on the net operating profit after tax of the Group derived from the audited financial statements subject to certain adjustments such as for acquisition goodwill and a capital charge.
At the end of the performance period, the net of tax value of any LTIP payments earned by eligible executive directors is to be invested in market purchases of the Companys ordinary shares pursuant to a deferred share plan.
Such share purchases are made through an employee trust and, if held for a further three-year period, an executive director will receive a matching award of one additional share for every four.
The LTIP awards maturing in 2006 will result in vesting worth 50% of 2006 salary against a target maximum economic profit of 54.3m.
SAYE plan The Company operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved savings-related share option scheme which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees, including the UK-based executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20 per cent below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees to use their own money to purchase shares in their employers business or group.
All Employee Share Ownership Plan The UK-based executive directors also participate in an All Employee Share Ownership Plan which is open to the majority of the Group's UK employees.
In May 2007 shares to a value equal to the lesser of 3,000 and 0.75% of each participants basic salary will be acquired at market value by the trustee of the plan in respect of their participation during 2006.
The plan is not operated subject to specific performance conditions but the level of shares awarded to participating employees is set taking into account performance, in particular that of the UK operations of the Group.
Eligible employees are also able to invest up to 1,500 annually in a tax-efficient manner in purchasing partnership shares under the plan.
Each of the UK-based executive directors makes the maximum contribution from their salary towards partnership shares under the plan.
Up to two matching shares may be awarded for every one partnership share acquired under the plan, although the policy to date has been not to award any matching shares.
42 Remuneration report Save as indicated below, the remainder of this report has been audited.
Pension entitlement UK-based executive directors except for Mr D M Hurt participate in the IMI Pension Fund.
Their normal retirement age under the Fund is 65, although Mr M J Lamb and Mr D C Nicholas may elect to retire and receive a pension at any time after age 57 without any actuarial discount.
On death after retirement a dependants pension is provided equal to two-thirds of the members pension.
If death occurs in the first five years of retirement a lump sum is also paid equal to the balance of five years pension payments.
Pensions in payment, in excess of any guaranteed minimum pension, are increased each year in line with price inflation up to a maximum of 5%, in respect of pension built up before 1 January 2006, and 2.5% in respect of pension built up after 1 January 2006.
With effect from April 2006 the taxation arrangements for occupational pension schemes in the UK changed and the Remuneration Committee gave the then serving UK-based executive directors the choice of remaining in the UK scheme for future service or opting out and either building up benefits in a new employer-financed retirement benefits scheme or receiving a cash allowance instead of pension benefits.
These alternatives were designed to be cost neutral to the Company and honoured the Company's commitment to the existing defined benefit arrangements.
The committee received confirmation from independent actuaries that the alternative arrangements were expected to be no more expensive than the overall cost of providing the benefits that would otherwise have arisen under the IMI Pension Fund when compared by reference to the long term actuarial assumptions adopted for the fund as a whole in the 31 March 2005 actuarial valuation.
Mr D C Nicholas was a member of an unfunded unapproved arrangement that provided compensation for the legislative restriction of his pensionable pay in the IMI Pension Fund to the earnings cap.
From April 2006 he elected to forgo his benefits under this arrangement and remain in the IMI Pension Fund on the basis that the revised arrangements would mean the earnings cap would no longer apply.
Mr T J Slack also remained in the IMI Pension Fund from April 2006 and retired at age 60 in July 2006.
In April 2006 Mr M J Lamb opted-out of the IMI Pension Fund and receives a cash allowance equal to 35% of his basic salary instead of accrual for future service from that date, although accrued benefits generally continue to be linked to final salary inflation and fund benefits were preserved in relation to ill-health retirement, death-in-service and retirement after age 50 for redundancy or otherwise at the Company's instance.
On joining the Company in May 2006, Mr D M Hurt elected not to join the Company's defined contribution pension scheme and receives a cash allowance equal to 35% of his basic salary instead of pension benefits.
The policy regarding pension arrangements for new appointments will be flexible to take account of the individual position, the cost of pension arrangements to the Company, including in particular the cost of defined benefits, and the alternative forms of pension provision.
However, the norm would not be to offer defined benefits to new executive directors.
Mr W R Whitney was a USA-based executive director and during the year was a member of two pension arrangements in the USA.
The first was a defined contribution arrangement, the IMI 401 k Plan.
In the period from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2006 employer contributions of 4,757 were made to this plan 2005: 4,621.
The second was a defined benefit arrangement, the IMI Americas Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.
His pension payable from age 60 would be 60% of basic salary less any pension from the employer's contributions to the defined contribution plan and an amount representing the Social Security Primary Insurance payable.
There are no post retirement increases provided under the plan.
Normally no dependants' pension is payable on death after retirement but Mr Whitney has opted for a reduced members pension with such an attaching dependant's pension.
On death prior to retirement a dependant's pension, equal to the member's pension, is payable.
43 IMI plc Annual Report 2006 remuneration report remuneration report Details of the pension benefits earned in the IMI Pension Fund or the IMI Americas Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan are summarised in the following table.

Retired in July 2006, receiving an annual post-commutation pension of 185,589 and a lump sum provided by commutation of pension of 890,966.
The 2006 transfer value reflects these benefits.
The accrued pension as at 31 December 2006 of 120,393 pa reduces to 106,756 pa following Mr Whitneys election for a death after retirement dependants pension.
The transfer value as at 31 December 2006 reflects this lower accrued pension and attaching dependants pension.
All relevant benefits are provided in US Dollars and figures shown were converted at 1 to $1.96 2005: 1 to $1.72.
The accrued pension benefits at the end of the year July 2006 for Mr T J Slack represent the annual deferred pension to which each executive director would have been entitled had he left service at the end of the year.
This is based on completed pensionable service and pensionable earnings at the relevant date.
The increase in the accrued pension during the year reflects the completion of further pensionable service and the increase in pensionable earnings, both before and after inflation.
During 2006 the trustee of the IMI Pension fund adopted new assumptions for the calculation of cash equivalent transfer values payable from the fund.
The main changes were to allow for longer life expectancy and for investment returns in excess of gilt yields for members close to retirement.
In broad terms the overall impact of the changes was to increase transfer values for younger members by around 10% with small reductions for those close to or over normal retirement age.
Changes to pension benefit arrangements in place at the start of the year were made with effect from April 2006 as described above.
The above figures exclude any benefits from the executive directors' voluntary contributions.
Transfer values calculated in accordance with the guidance note GN11 published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries are also shown in the table.
A transfer value is the estimated capital value of the future pension payments in retirement.
Under the method and assumptions used by the Company to account for the costs associated with its defined benefit pension schemes see note 20 to the financial statements on page 77, the aggregate value of the accrued benefits as at 31 December 2006 for the executive directors was 8.65 million 2005: 13.11 million.
Mr R M Twite, age 40, was appointed as an executive director from 1 February 2007.
From 31 January 2007 he opted-out of the IMI Pension Fund, retaining a deferred pension based on service to 31 January 2007 of 53,256 pa and receiving a cash allowance of 35% of basic salary instead of pension benefits.
His deferred pension is payable from age 60 and on death after retirement a dependants pension equal to 50% of his pension is payable.
If death occurs within five years of retirement the dependants pension is increased to 100% of his pension for the remainder of this five year period.
The transfer value of his deferred pension as at 1 February 2007 was 428,000.
Mr W R Whitney ceased to be a director in January 2007 and will be retiring as an employee in July 2007.
His accrued pension benefits will reflect his earnings and service at the date of leaving as described above and no additional pension entitlements will arise as a result.
2 Ms Frew was appointed on 2 March 2006 3 Mr Leng retired from office with effect from 13 May 2005.
4 Mr Hurt was employed from 1 May 2006 and appointed as a director on 1 July 2006.
5 Mr Slack retired as a director on 1 July 2006 and retired as an employee on 31 July 2006.
6 Mr Whitney retired as a director on 31 January 2007 and retires as an employee on 31 July 2007.
All of his remuneration was provided in US dollars and figures shown were converted at the average exchange rate for the year of 1 to $1.85.
Half of the Bonus and all of the LTIP payments shown above must be invested in the relevant share matching arrangement as described above in the case of all eligible executive directors.
Remuneration shown above as salaries for non-executive directors includes fees of 169,073 2005: 134,166.
No compensation for loss of office was paid to or receivable by any director in 2006 and none is payable in respect of the retirement of Mr W R Whitney.
Benefits in kind provided to executive directors consist of the provision of private health care arrangements, life insurance and All Employee Share Ownership Plan awards.
A fully expensed motor car was provided for Mr W R Whitney and Mr T J Slack.
Mr D M Hurt, Mr M J Lamb and Mr D C Nicholas, elected for a cash alternative scheme, instead of a company car.
Sums paid by way of taxable allowances in the above table include cash allowances instead of company car and pension benefits and in the case of Mr D M Hurt, who joined the Company during the year, a relocation allowance of 90,000.
External appointments Executive directors may accept one external appointment with the consent of the Board, and are normally allowed to retain fees from external non-executive directorships.
Mr M J Lamb was a non-executive director of Spectris plc until 17 May 2006, in respect of which office he received remuneration of 17,500 in 2006.
