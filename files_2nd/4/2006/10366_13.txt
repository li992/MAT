Page 50 Misys plc Annual Report 2006 Executive Directors service contracts The contract for each of the executive Directors provides that either the Director or the Company may terminate the employment by giving 12 months written notice.
There is no contractual obligation to pay any sum in lieu of notice or by way of compensation or damages.
Any severance payment would normally be based on net pay and benefits for any unexpired notice period, in the expectation that the Director will make reasonable attempts to mitigate his loss.
Directors contracts The contractual arrangements with each executive and non-executive Director who served in the year are summarised below.
Date of current contract letter of appointment Notice period unexpired term of appointment J K Lomax 26 July 2002 12 months: re-elected for a further three year term at 2003 AGM H Evans 17 July 2002 12 months: re-elected for a further three year term at 2004 AGM J P McMahon 17 July 2002 12 months: re-elected for a further three year term at 2005 AGM T K Skelton 18 July 2002 12 months: re-elected for a further three year term at 2005 AGM i Sir Dominic Cadbury 13 March 2000 Appointed as Chairman for an initial three year term, expiring 22 March 2009 i A G L Alexander 1 May 1996 Re-elected for a further one year term at 2005 AGM i G L Farr 17 June 1998 Re-elected for a further three year term at 2003 AGM J G King 2 November 2005 1 month J Ormerod 21 September 2005 1 month A Ramji 25 January 2005 1 month: elected for a three year term at 2005 AGM i Dr J Zech 19 September 2002 Re-elected for a further three year term at 2003 AGM i Non-executive Directors appointed before 2005 do not have a formal notice period within their letters of appointment.
From 2005, terms of appointment for non-executive Directors include a notice period of one month.
Ivan Martins contract with the Company as CEO of Misys Banking Systems was terminated, with immediate effect, by mutual agreement on 31 December 2005.
In lieu of the payments that Mr Martin could have received during a period of 12 months notice, Mr Martin received the following amounts: a termination payment of 317,876: a compensatory payment of 45,000 for loss of his statutory rights: continued private health cover until 31 May 2006 and 9,043 in lieu of life assurance and private health insurance cover to 31 December 2006: 100,000 as compensation for loss of participation in annual bonus arrangements for the financial year 2006 07.
This amount was paid on 30 June 2006 following fulfilment of agreed post-termination obligations: 150,000 additional pension contribution as compensation for loss of pension benefits: and 80,000 as compensation for loss of use of the rental accommodation previously provided in connection with his duties, including settlement of liabilities related to use of this property in previous years.
The duty of Ivan Martin to mitigate his losses was considered by the Committee but the Committee acting on legal advice was unable to materially reduce the agreed payments because of the commercial importance of ensuring the enforceability of Mr Martins contractual noncompete covenants for a period of 12 months from his departure.
Additionally, Mr Martins age and length of service affected Mr Martins ability to mitigate.
The Remuneration Committee additionally applied the following policy in relation to Mr Martins share-based incentives: all share awards subject to performance conditions Long-term Share Incentive Plan awards and Discretionary Share options could be retained by Mr Martin but these may only be exercised if the original performance conditions are fulfilled.
The maximum number of shares available has been reduced on a time pro-rata basis: retention-based awards made to Mr Martin before he joined the Board that have vested were allowed to be retained by him: Mr Martins outstanding awards under the Companys share plans linked to deferral of annual bonus the Misys Annual Award Plan until 2004 and the Misys Senior Executive Bonus Plan in 2005 that had not fulfilled the two year deferral period by 31 December 2005 will be treated as vested from 30 July 2006.
Under the rules of the Annual Award Plan, Mr Martin may retain all unexercised awards that had vested at the date of his termination of employment.
The Committee believes that the application of these treatments to Mr Martins share incentives was an appropriate use of the discretions reserved to it under the Companys share plans in the context of Mr Martins departure.
In accordance with its stated policy, performance conditions are applied to all performance linked awards over the original performance period, and time pro-rating is applied.
The Committee permitted Mr Martin to retain those share awards linked to deferral of annual bonus as these would have been expected to vest if the Company had not restructured its executive director team.
Page 51 Directors remuneration report continued Directors emoluments The amounts payable by the Company to each Director for financial year 2005 06 are set out below.
These figures exclude share benefits, which are shown separately.
No Director has waived any emoluments.
J Ormerod became senior independent Director from 3 November 2005 and his additional fee for this position has been paid at the rate of 10,000 p. a. for the period 1 December 2005 to 31 May 2006.
For the period from 3 November 2005 to 1 December 2005, the fee was paid on the basis of 20,000 p. a. ii Half of the bonus is payable in cash and half is deferred for two years to be satisfied in cash or shares.
The performance conditions for the 2005 06 Annual Bonus Plan for J K Lomax, H Evans and J P McMahon were based on a range of Group operating profit targets set at the beginning of the financial year.
The targets required to be achieved in 2005 06 were a range of 1.5% to 12.5% above the comparable performance achieved the prior year.
The Annual Bonus Plan for T K Skelton was based on the comparable operating profit for Healthcare.
iii Benefits in kind include all taxable benefits arising from employment by the Company, namely car fuel provision, private healthcare and use of home telephone and the cost of providing additional lump sum life cover.
I Martins total includes costs associated with the provision of rented accommodation in connection with his duties.
iv Car allowances are the only expense allowances.
v The figure for I Martin comprises those payments detailed on page 51.
T Skelton received cash for unused holiday entitlement under arrangements that apply for all US employees.
vi The total for J K Lomax represented contributions to the Companys pension plan until 31 March 2006.
From 1 April 2006, Mr Lomax began receiving an allowance that replaces contributions to the Companys pension plan.
This allowance will be reduced to reflect the cost to the Company of employers National Insurance Contributions so that the overall cost to the Company is not increased.
The total for H Evans is an allowance to enable him to contribute to personal pension arrangements.
The total for I Martin includes an allowance equivalent to 6% of base salary to enable him to make personal pension arrangements in addition to the Companys pension plan.
The amount for T K Skelton comprises an allowance equivalent to 20% of base salary to enable him to contribute to personal pension arrangements 68,918 and to a 401k plan 4,955.
These pension allowances form part of the Directors total emoluments for the purpose of disclosure under the Companies Act 1985.
Therefore, the total of such emoluments is 4,253,454 2005: 4,011,357. vii Payments made to T K Skelton were made in US dollars and have been converted using the rate US$1.776 1. viii Fees paid to G L Farr, R A Ingram, and J G King were converted to US dollars on payment and those to Dr J Zech were converted to euros on payment.
Page 52 Misys plc Annual Report 2006 External directorships The Company recognises that executive Directors may broaden their experience by serving as non-executive Directors of other companies and they are permitted to accept such appointments by prior agreement with the Board.
It is normal practice for executive Directors to retain fees received for non-executive appointments.
Kevin Lomax served as a non-executive Director of Marks and Spencer Group plc and Chairman of its Audit Committee during the financial year for which he received a fee of 61,667.
Share Options and Long-term Share Incentive Plan The executive Directors hold options granted under Misys current share plans and under the share plans which were operated previously.
Jasper McMahon and Tom Skelton each also hold options granted before their appointment to the Board.
The performance criteria that applied to options granted and Long-term Share Incentive Plan awards made in 2005 06 are the same as those proposed for grants in 2006 07, described on page 50 above.
The options held by each executive Director over shares in the Company are summarised below.
The exercise price per share is above market price at year end in cases marked a and below in cases marked b. ii Options marked TI are classed by Misys as Type I.
The Committee has set performance conditions for Type I options, based on adjusted earnings per share growth above growth in RPI over a fixed three year period, with targets ranging from 3% to 12% per annum.
iii Nil cost options under the Misys Annual Award Plan are not subject to any performance criteria, only employment conditions.
iv Nil cost options under the LTIP vested in 2001 at 31.22% of their maximum potential and became exercisable in three equal annual tranches three, four and five years after grant.
Until 2002 nil cost options under the LTIP were subject to performance targets based on compound growth in adjusted earnings per share.
LTIP awards granted in 2003 were subject to targets based on comparative total shareholder return against a comparator group.
LTIP awards granted in 2004 and 2005 are subject to performance conditions as described on page 50. v On 23 November 2001, prior to their appointment to the Board, market value options were granted which vested on 23 November 2004. vi Nil cost options under the Misys Senior Executive Bonus Plan are not subject to any performance conditions, only employment conditions.
Under arrangements existing prior to the adoption of the current plans, executive Directors participated in a number of market value approved and unapproved share option schemes, and in the Misys Share Incentive Programme.
All options granted under these prior arrangements have now vested in full.
Executive Directors have also participated in the Companys savings related share option schemes or US stock purchase plan on the same basis as other employees.
The options set out above were granted under the Misys share plans current at the time of grant.
The options shown with a zero exercise price were granted as nil-cost options under the Misys 1998 Long-term Share Incentive Plan, Misys Annual Award Plan and the Misys Senior Executive Bonus Plan.
All other options were granted at market value.
Page 54 Misys plc Annual Report 2006 Movements in the executive Directors share options during the year are summarised below.
1998 LTIP awards granted in 2002 also failed to satisfy the minimum performance criteria required of compound annual growth rate in adjusted EPS of 10% and hence lapsed on 25 July 2005.
The aggregate gain on options exercised by executive Directors during the year was 620,999 2005: 191,773.
There have been no changes in executive Directors share options between 31 May 2006 and 27 July 2006.
