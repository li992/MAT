The Remuneration Committee and its Role The Remuneration Committee comprises of three Non-Executive Directors namely Ray Miles, Christopher Fisher and Joseph Baratta.

Remuneration Policy This report sets out the Companys policy on Directors remuneration for the financial year 2006 and, so far as practical, for future years.
Any changes in policy for future years will be described in future Remuneration Reports.
The Companys overall policy on remuneration is to attract, develop, motivate and retain individuals at all levels, pay competitive salaries and align remuneration arrangements with the Groups strategy and objectives.
As part of the process of preparing for Admission onto the London Stock Exchange, and using the expertise of third party consultants, a comprehensive review of Executive remuneration was undertaken.
Following this the Boards policy on Executive remuneration is to: l pay basic salaries that are competitive with other companies of similar size and standing: l to have a significant part of remuneration linked to the achievement of performance targets: l to have performance-related remuneration aligned to the interests of shareholders: and l encourage executives to hold shares in the Company.
In establishing these policies, the Board has given full consideration to the requirements of the Combined Code.
Executive Remuneration Packages Executive remuneration packages for the current period comprised basic salary and benefits, annual performance-related bonus, long-term share incentives and pension benefits.
Further details of each element are given below: Basic Salary and Benefits The Committee reviews basic salary and benefits each year, taking into consideration Group financial performance, individual responsibilities, skills and experience.
Consideration is also given to the salaries and benefits paid to Executives by other companies of similar size and standing.
The last such review took place during the process of preparing for Admission onto the London Stock Exchange.
Basic salaries for the Executive Directors are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash.
The value of benefits for Executive Directors is included in the remuneration table on page 32 and consists of car allowance and life and health insurance.

Awards under the PSP are on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 100% of annual basic salary as at the award date, unless the Remuneration Committee decides that exceptional circumstances exist in relation to the recruitment or retention of an employee, in which case the limit will be 200% of annual basic salary.
On 4 September 2006, 2,365,332 awards were granted with an exercise price of Nil.
A summary of the vesting conditions are included below.
Vesting of awards made under the PSP takes place at the expiry of the three-year performance period of the plan and are subject to attainment of agreed performance targets.
70% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on Earnings Per Share EPS.
For the purposes of calculating the EPS condition, net income is defined as profit after taxation before deduction of future minimum rental increases, goodwill impairment, annual bonuses paid to participants in the PSP and the cost of share options charged to the income statement under the PSP.
The remaining 30% will vest on attainment of a performance target based on Total Shareholder Return TSR.
In respect of the EPS performance target, 100% of the award will vest if the PSP EPS for the 2008 financial period exceeds 23.13p per share and no awards will vest if PSP EPS is below 18.61p per share, with straight-line vesting between these two points.
The remaining 30% will vest subject to TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts.
100% of the award will vest if the Companys TSR growth is in the upper quartile and 40% will vest if growth is at the median, with straight-line vesting between the two points.
If the Companys growth is below the median then no awards shall vest.
