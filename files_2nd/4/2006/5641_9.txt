The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on remuneration policy as applied to Filtronas senior executives, including Executive Directors.
It consists wholly of independent Non-executive Directors: Paul Drechsler who chairs the Remuneration Committee, Adrian Auer and Warren Knowlton.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and Director of Group Human Resources of the Company may, by invitation, attend the Remuneration Committee meetings, except when their own remuneration is discussed.
The Remuneration Committee met four times during the year.
Remuneration policy The Board as a whole establishes remuneration policy.
The Remuneration Committee determines and recommends to the Board the framework of Board policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
It also ratifies the Chief Executives remuneration proposals for the members of the Executive Committee and for other senior executives reporting directly to him.
The Remuneration Committee also takes note of the remuneration policy and details as set by the Chief Executive in respect of other levels of management in the Company.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors and Chairman is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee and the remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is the responsibility of the Board as a whole.
No Director is involved in determining or voting on their own remuneration.
In determining the policy for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committees objective is to ensure that those individuals are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, having regard to the performance of the Company, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration in a competitive form and amount to attract, retain and motivate high quality management.
The importance of aligning the interests of Executive Directors and senior executives with shareholders is carefully considered, particularly in the design of the performance-related elements of their remuneration packages.
Advice During the year ended 31 December 2006, Filtronas Director of Group Human Resources was invited by the Remuneration Committee to provide views and advice.

For the year ended 31 December 2006, the performance targets were approved by the Remuneration Committee and based upon Filtronas adjusted earnings per share.
Company performance was required to reach a minimum adjusted earnings per share target for a bonus of 30% of basic salary to be payable 15% in cash and 15% in deferred shares under the DASB.
For the year ended 31 December 2006, the Companys performance exceeded the minimum target and the Remuneration Committee approved a bonus of 70% of basic salary for each of the Executive Directors 35% in cash and 35% in deferred shares under the DASB.
For the financial year ending 31 December 2007, the Remuneration Committee determined that for the Executive Directors the same maximum bonus criteria will apply.
Targets have been set relating to the growth in adjusted earnings per share over the prior year.
Any payment is entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Executive share-based incentive plans The Remuneration Committee is firmly of the view that offering Executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity to be awarded shares in the Company is an important part of motivating, rewarding and retaining key employees so that they may participate in the future growth in value of the Company.
It is also of the view that the Executive Directors and other senior executives should be encouraged to invest directly in the Company through the purchase of shares.
The Companys DASB and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP consisting of Part A Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Options and Part B Performance and Matching Share Awards are both intended to support these objectives.
35 Filtrona plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 www.
com Executive share-based incentive plans continued Awards under Part B are performance options exercised at nil cost by the participant.
The award of shares or options under the Executive share-based incentive plans is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account, inter alia, the role of the individual, and other such criteria as they may determine from time to time.
The current policy is that participation in the DASB and Part B of the LTIP is restricted to Executive Directors, members of the Executive Committee and certain other nominated senior executives.
Participation in Part A of the LTIP is extended to a wider group of employees.
The Companys current executive share-based incentive arrangements, implemented at demerger, reflected those of Bunzl plc, the former parent company.
In order to determine whether those plans continue to provide a proper alignment of Executive Director and senior executive interests, with those of shareholders, it is the intention of the Remuneration Committee that they are reviewed prior to the end of 2007.
The Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan The DASB provides for Executive Directors and nominated senior executives to receive existing issued ordinary shares in the Company for nil payment.
The number of shares subject to an award is determined at the time the award is granted, based upon the performance in the Companys preceding financial year, of the participant and or the Group and or the business in which the participant works.
Under the rules of the DASB the aggregate value of shares made subject to awards granted to a participant in any one financial year may not exceed 100% of their basic salary as at the award date.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that, in accordance with the Companys bonus arrangements, awards under the DASB will not normally exceed 50%.
Shares awarded under the DASB are held in trust until 1 March in the third calendar year after the calendar year in which the award was made, at which point they are transferred to the participant.
The Long Term Incentive Plan Part A Part A of the LTIP provides for participants to receive share option awards over shares worth up to two times basic salary or 250,000 whichever is the greatest in any financial year, subject to performance conditions.
During 2006 participants received share option awards over shares worth up to 90% of basic salary, with the exercise price set equal to the share price at the date of grant.
A share option award will normally be exercisable between three and ten years following its grant, but only if the specified performance condition has been satisfied.
The performance conditions attached to Part A awards made in 2006 were based on the Companys earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which did not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance and intangible amortisation relative to inflation over three financial years, requiring such earnings per share growth to exceed inflation by an average of at least 3% per annum.
The performance condition will be tested after three financial years and there will be no provision for retesting.
To the extent the performance condition has not been met after three financial years, the relevant share option awards will lapse.
The Remuneration Committee review the performance conditions each time share options are awarded under Part A of the LTIP in order to ensure that they remain challenging and may impose different conditions on share options awarded in subsequent years, provided that any new conditions are no less challenging.
In addition to the LTIP, the Company operates a Save As You Earn scheme SAYE.
During the year the Company made its first awards under the rules of the SAYE.

Participants will make no payment for the grant and exercise of performance share awards.
Participants may receive performance share awards, excluding matching share awards, of shares worth up to two times their basic salary in any financial year.
In May 2005, following the demerger, the Executive Directors and other senior executives were granted a one-off matching share award linked to their investment in the Companys shares.
A performance share award, including any matching share award, will not normally be exercisable before the third anniversary of its award and may only be exercised to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied.
For employees based outside the US, the options remain capable of being exercised up to the sixth anniversary of grant.
For employees based in the US, once the performance conditions have been satisfied the options must be exercised within 30 days of vesting.
In the case of the vesting of the matching share awards, granted by reference to shares purchased by participants, not only will applicable performance conditions have to be satisfied but those awards will only vest to the extent that participants have retained the shares they bought in May 2005.
The extent to which performance share awards vest is subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over a fixed three year period relative to the TSR performance of a specified group of companies.
For the initial performance share awards the comparator group is the FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts at the start of the three year performance period.
Identical conditions were attached to the matching share awards.
The three year performance period for the TSR usually starts at the beginning of the calendar month in which a performance share award is made and the relevant TSR figures are averaged over a one month period at the beginning and end of the performance period.
In the case of the initial performance share awards, the three year performance period started on the date of the award.

For median performance one quarter of such awards vests, rising proportionally up to full vesting thereafter.
For below median performance, no such awards will vest.
The performance condition will be tested after three years and there will be no provision for retesting.
To the extent the performance condition has not been met after three years, the relevant performance or matching share awards will lapse.
The Remuneration Committee review the performance conditions each time performance share awards are granted under Part B of the LTIP in order to ensure that they remain challenging and may impose different conditions on share awards granted in subsequent years provided that any new conditions are no less challenging.
