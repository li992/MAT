REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION AND RELATED MATTERS The Board presents its Report on Directors Remuneration and related matters including details of Total Shareholder Return, Remuneration Policy and Directors Remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that during 2006 07 it will undertake a comprehensive review of executive directors remuneration, including short-term and long-term incentive arrangements.
The Company will consult with major shareholders on any proposals, and proposals that require shareholder consent will be submitted for approval at the 2007 AGM.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Guy Peyrelongue and its other members during the year were Philip Bowman, John Peace and Caroline Marland until her resignation from the Board on 31 January 2006.
Stephanie George was appointed a member of the Committee on 19 May 2006.
The Remuneration Committee decides both the level and structure of executive directors pay and monitors senior management pay.
The remuneration of the Chairman and non-executive directors is a matter for the Board as a whole.
The Committee meets at least twice a year and holds additional meetings as necessary.
During the year under review, the Committee held four meetings which were fully attended with the exception that Guy Peyrelongue and Caroline Marland were each unable to attend one meeting.
To assist in making its decisions, the Remuneration Committee has appointed external advisers.
For the year to 31 March 2006, the Committees principal remuneration advisers were Kepler Associates.
Kepler does not provide other services to the Company.
Supplementary analysis was carried out for the Committee by Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting also advised Burberry on salary benchmarking, pensions, and on the employee-related issues arising from the Groups demerger from GUS plc GUS.
Save as described below, the constitution and operation of the Remuneration Committee are in compliance with the principles of good governance and Code of Best Practice, as set out in the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The Combined Code on Corporate Governance published by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 the Code states that the Remuneration Committee should consist only of independent non-executive directors.
John Peace was appointed as a member of the Remuneration Committee pursuant to the Relationship Agreement with GUS and, until the Companys demerger from GUS, was not considered to be independent for the purposes of the Code.
As stated in last years Annual Report, the Company considers John Peaces presence on the Committee prior to the demerger as being in shareholders interests overall given that GUS was the beneficial owner of approximately 65% of the Companys Ordinary Shares until December 2005.
The Relationship Agreement was terminated on completion of the demerger from GUS in December 2005.
As set out in the Corporate Governance report, John Peace is now considered by the Board to be independent for the purposes of the Code following the demerger.
To date, the Chairmans remuneration has been a matter reserved for the Board as a whole excluding the Chairman.
Since the IPO there has been no change in the Chairmans remuneration and, following the demerger, the Company intends to review whether this matter should be for the Remuneration Committee as part of a broader review of the terms of reference of the Companys main Board Committees.
Remuneration Policy The Committee believes Burberrys remuneration should be competitive and strongly linked to performance.
Therefore it has a remuneration policy based on the following two principles.
First, in order to attract, motivate and retain exceptional talent to enable Burberry to compete effectively with the worlds leading luxury brands, the Committee bases the quantum of total remuneration on competitive practice.
For some roles Burberry competes for talent in the same global marketplace as other luxury brands, many of which are based in the US.
Total remuneration for executive directors and other senior executives is benchmarked against main global competitors and UK companies of comparable size.
The Committee recognises that for each executive the relative importance of each of these benchmarks may be different.
Benefits are based on competitive market practice for each executive, having regard to individual circumstances.
The second principle is to emphasise variable pay in order to establish a clear link between pay and performance, and to align pay more closely with shareholders interests.
To provide a balanced focus between short and long-term business objectives, variable pay for executive directors includes an annual cash bonus based on growth in profit before tax and individual performance and long-term share-based incentives linked primarily to increases in shareholder value and to continued employment over 3 to 5 years.
Remuneration packages are established and regularly reviewed against the agreed policy to ensure that they meet the policy principles.
When seeking to attract new executives the Committee endeavours to incorporate these policy objectives into the remuneration package.
30 Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION AND RELATED MATTERS CONTINUED Performance graph The following graph shows the Total Shareholder Return TSR for Burberry Group plc compared to the companies in the FTSE 100 Index assuming 100 was invested on 12 July 2002, the date of the IPO.
The FTSE 100 Index has been selected because Burberrys market capitalisation is close to that of companies at the lower end of the FTSE 100 Index.
Value of 100 invested on Burberry flotation date Burberry FTSE 100 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 Jul-02 Mar-03 Mar-04 Mar-05 Mar-06 Elements of Remuneration Remuneration is structured such that performance-related elements represent more than half of total remuneration.
Burberry implements its remuneration policy through the provision of the following elements of remuneration.
Base salary The Company aims to provide salaries which are competitive with those of comparable roles at companies of similar size and global reach within the luxury goods sector including those in North America and those which are privately-owned and UK companies of similar size.
These companies are representative of Burberrys competitors for executive talent.
When making salary determinations the Remuneration Committee takes into account not only this competitive information but also each executive directors contribution to the business during the year.
On recruitment, the Committee also considers the executives current remuneration and the overall package required to attract the relevant executive.
Annual bonus Each year the Remuneration Committee sets bonus targets by reference to internal and external expectations.
Bonuses are currently based on profit growth and individual performance.
The Committee believes that linking incentives to profit growth helps to reinforce the Companys profitability and growth objectives.
Targets are calibrated by Kepler Associates using benchmarks that include broker earnings estimates for Burberry, earnings estimates for competitors, straight-line profit growth consistent with median upper quartile shareholder returns, latest projections for the current year, budget, strategic plan, long-term financial goals, etc.
Actual bonus awards are subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Executive Directors are eligible for a maximum bonus of 100% of base salary up to 150% for Ms. Ahrendts.
Target bonus is 50% of maximum.
The Burberry Co-investment plan Burberry encourages executive directors and other senior executives to hold shares in the Company.
To facilitate this, executive directors may defer receipt of their annual bonus and invest it in Burberry shares, with up to a 2:1 match based on individual and Company performance during the year.
Matching shares are forfeited if the executive leaves within 3 years.
The Burberry 2004 Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan the 2004 RSP The 2004 RSP was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting.
Under this plan, executives may be awarded shares up to a maximum value of 1x base salary up to 2x in exceptional circumstances.
The vesting of RSP shares is based 50% on Burberrys 3-year Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to peers and 50% on 3-year growth in Profit Before Tax PBT.
Awards vest in full only if Burberry achieves at least upper quartile TSR relative to its global peers and at least 15% per annum profit growth, and the executive remains in employment with Burberry for at least 5 years.
A proportion of an award 12.5% may vest if TSR performance exceeds the median of the peer group or if PBT growth exceeds 5% per annum over 3 years.
Of the shares which meet the performance criteria, 50% vest after three years.
The remaining 50% vest in two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the award date.
The Committee chose TSR relative to a group of Burberrys global peers because it felt that this is an objective measure of the Companys success and aligns with shareholder interests.
Growth in PBT was chosen as it continues to be the primary measure used by management and the Committee believes strong profit growth is key to delivering superior shareholder returns.
The TSR peer group for the 2004 and 2005 awards comprised: Barneys New York, Bulgari, Christian Dior, Coach, Compagnie Financiere Richemont, Hermes, Hugo Boss, IT Holding, LVMH Louis Vuitton Mot Hennessey, Movado, Neiman-Marcus, , Polo Ralph Lauren, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany, Tods, Tommy Hilfiger and Waterford Wedgwood.
Following recent corporate activity, Barneys New York, Neiman-Marcus and Tommy Hilfiger cease to be listed.
For future cycles, the following companies will be added to the peer group: Este Lauder, Fossil, Liz Claiborne and Nordstrom.

Burberry does not offer such terms unless the Remuneration Committee considers it absolutely necessary in the particular circumstances to attract a highly talented individual and even in these circumstances will ensure that after an initial period termination payments will not exceed one years remuneration.
Save for the service contract of Ms Ahrendts, there are no service contracts for any director which could result in termination payments of more than one years remuneration.
Rose Marie Bravo Ms Bravo was employed by Burberry as Chief Executive under a service agreement dated 28 May 2002 which was amended in June 2004 and October 2005.
The 2005 amendment addressed Ms Bravo ceasing to be the Chief Executive on 30 June 2006 and becoming Vice Chairman on a part time basis.
As her role of Chief Executive ends on 30 June 2006 all unvested shares under the IPO Restricted Share Plan will vest consistent with the terms of her service agreement.
In respect of her new position as Vice Chairman, Ms Bravo will be paid an annual salary of US$650,000 for a minimum of 12 days work a month.
Her maximum bonus entitlement remains 100% of annual salary.
Benefits will continue to be paid to Ms Bravo as provided for under her current service agreement.
However all allowances will cease from 31 December 2006.
If Ms Bravos service agreement is terminated without cause or as a result of a change of control she would be entitled to 12 months salary and half her maximum bonus entitlement.
If any person acquires control of Burberry, including by acquiring 25% or more of the voting rights in Burberry, Ms Bravo can terminate her employment and such termination would be deemed to be by Burberry without cause.
If payments due to Ms Bravo are deemed of a level that would subject her to US federal excise tax under Section 280G b 2 of the US Internal Revenue Code 1986, Burberry Limited US would pay Ms Bravo an additional amount so that she will be in the same net after-tax position had the excise tax not been applied.
Angela Ahrendts Ms Ahrendts relocated from the US to the UK and commenced her employment with Burberry as an Executive Director on 9 January 2006 under a service agreement dated 10 October 2005.
Under the terms of that agreement, Ms Ahrendts will assume the position of Chief Executive Officer on 1 July 2006.
Ms Ahrendts may terminate the service agreement on six months notice, such notice not expiring earlier than January 2007.

Under the service agreement: The Company has agreed to pay Ms Ahrendts a special recruitment and retention bonus of US$4m payable in four tranches, the first of which was paid on 9 January 2006.
The remaining payments will be made on 9 October 2006, 9 July 2007 and 9 January 2008: Ms Ahrendts is eligible for a personal achievement bonus subject to achievement of objectives set by the Remuneration Committee of up to US$4m payable as follows: US$1.75m on 31 December 2006, US$1.5m on 31 December 2007 and US$750,000 on 31 December 2008: Ms Ahrendts was granted a restricted share award as stated on page 34.
If Ms Ahrendts service agreement is terminated without cause before January 2008, she would be entitled to two times her annual salary and two times her maximum annual bonus opportunity and the balance of her recruitment and personal achievement bonus.
Her share incentives will vest on a time pro-rated basis subject to a minimum vesting of 50% in respect of her restricted shares.
She will also receive her pension and overseas allowances for a further 12 months together with relocation expenses.
After January 2008 if Burberry terminates the agreement without cause but in circumstances where the Remuneration Committee determines that Ms Ahrendts performance or that of the Group does not meet the financial expectations of the Board or shareholders, her entitlements in respect of salary and bonus will be reduced so that she will receive 12 months salary and half of her maximum bonus opportunity.
However if Burberry terminates the service agreement after January 2008 in circumstances where there is not poor performance as described above, then the termination payments will remain as provided for in the paragraph above, save that the entitlements in respect of salary and bonus would decline to 12 months salary and 12 months maximum bonus opportunity over the period from January 2009 to January 2010.
If any person acquires control of Burberry before 9 January 2008, Ms Ahrendts can terminate her employment on 30 days notice but her entitlement will be determined on the basis of poor performance as set out in the paragraph above.
