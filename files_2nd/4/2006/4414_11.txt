Mr Labroue also participates in mandatory French retirement benefit arrangements.

Under his service contract, Mr Labroues employment may be terminated on not less than six months notice given by either party.
Kesa Electricals SAS may require Mr Labroue not to serve out his notice but in that case Kesa Electricals SAS must maintain his contractual remuneration and benefits save for bonus and incentive arrangements during the notice period.
In addition to notice, if certain conditions are met, Kesa Electricals SAS may be required under French law to make a further payment to Mr Labroue as compensation for the termination of his employment.
This payment is not likely to exceed twelve months remuneration.
In addition, Mr Labroues service contract provides that if during the twelve months immediately following a change of control of Kesa Electricals, Kesa Electricals SAS gives Mr Labroue notice of termination of his employment other than cause he is entitled to receive a liquidated damages payment equivalent to twelve months remuneration.
For these purposes, one months remuneration for Mr Labroue is calculated by reference to his annual basic salary at the time including the allowance for his travel outside France, and such bonus and benefits provided to him in the 12 months prior to the month in which the change of control occurs.
Any amounts payable under French law to Mr Labroue on any termination of his employment count towards the liquidated damages payment and are not deducted from the contractual obligations.

12 Shareholding guideline It is one of the tenets of Kesas reward strategy that shareholders and Directors interests be aligned.
To reinforce this, the Remuneration Committee expects that over a period of years Executive Directors will build a personal holding in Kesa shares.
To underpin this commitment, the Committee expects that, while the guideline holding remains unfulfilled, Executive Directors will not dispose of any shares vesting to them under any of the Kesa incentive plans save for any disposals necessary to meet tax liabilities arising from them, until they hold shares worth the following percentage of their base salary.
Chief Executive Officer 150% of base salary Other Executive Directors 100% of base salary Executive Committee Members 50% of base salary 13 Directors interests The beneficial interests of the Directors which includes holdings by their spouses or other related parties, together with non-beneficial interests in the ordinary shares of the Company are shown below.
