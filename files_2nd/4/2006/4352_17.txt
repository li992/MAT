Graphs Graphs of DMGTs performance against each of its comparators for each of these periods are set out on pages 49 and 50.
These graphs have been plotted using the relative rankings of each comparator at the end of each month.
As such, they are approximations to the actual rankings under the rules, which are calculated using a two month average for the starting point and for each subsequent month.
This may give a different result between the graphs and the table above.
The graphs on page 48 compare the DMGT total shareholder return with that of the FTSE 100 index and of the media index over a period of five years, as required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
As a constituent of the FTSE 100 from February 1999 to June 2006 and as a constituent of the media index throughout the period, the Directors regard both indices as the most appropriate indices for purposes of comparison of the Groups performance.
