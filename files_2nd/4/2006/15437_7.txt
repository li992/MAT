40 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006 Directors Remuneration Report continued Directors contracts It is the companys policy that executive directors should have contracts of employment providing for a maximum of one years notice.
However, it may be necessary occasionally to offer longer notice periods to new directors.
Where this arises, it is the companys policy to reduce the notice period to one year within one year of appointment of the director.
Terms and conditions of appointment of all directors are available for inspection as described in the 2007 Annual General Meeting circular to shareholders.
The details of the directors contracts are summarised in the table below: Name Date of contract Unexpired term Notice periods Notice periods Normal retirement Current months Company months Director months age age Ian Smith 23 December 2006 12 12 6 65 53 Peter Johnson 1 November 2002 12 12 12 60 52 Ian Smiths contract contains a provision, which was agreed to in connection with his recruitment, that the company shall not serve notice before the earlier of the date of the first PSP award made to him and 31 December 2007.
It is the companys policy that liquidated damages should not apply on the termination of an executive directors contract.
In accordance with this approach, payment for early termination of contract without cause by the company is, in the case of each of the executive directors, to be determined in accordance with normal principles of English law, which requires mitigation of liability on a case-by-case basis.
Any such payment would typically be determined by reference to the main elements of a directors remuneration, namely: salary: contractual bonus: benefits-in-kind: and pension entitlements.
The executive directors' contracts contain no express provisions relating to a change of control of the company.
In such event the directors rights and entitlements would be ascertained as stated above.
Non-executive directors None of the non-executive directors has a service contract, as their terms of engagement are regulated by letters of appointment as follows: Name of director Date of appointment Date of initial letter Term of Notice period by Notice period by as a director of appointment appointment company months director months Norman Askew 29 July 2003 25 July 2003 1year, reviewed 3 3 annually Mike Davies 13 October 2003 29 September 2003 1year, reviewed 1 1 annually Katherine Innes Ker 1 July 2001 21 May 2001 1year, reviewed 1 1 annually Andrew Dougal 18 November 2002 31 October 2002 1year, reviewed 1 1 annually Vernon Sankey 1 January 2004 15 December 2003 1year, reviewed 1 1 annually Proposed for re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting.
