northumbrian Water Group plc 42 Annual report and financial statements 2005 06 Directors remuneration report the remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee of the Board the Committee determines the remuneration and terms of employment of the Chairman of the Company, executive directors and senior management of the Group in accordance with a remuneration policy approved by the Board.
The Committee members are Martin Ngre Chairman, Sir Patrick Brown and Sir Derek Wanless, all considered by the Company to be independent non-executive directors.
The Committee met four times during the year with 100% attendance by all three members.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Companys website.
The Committee received advice during the year from its appointed remuneration consultants who, until May 2005, were The Remuneration Practice and, since May 2005, are New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC, and also from John Cuthbert Managing Director.
NBSC has carried out a full review exercise in respect of the remuneration packages offered to senior executives and will continue to assist the Committee in maintaining best practice in relation to remuneration.
Neither The Remuneration Practice nor NBSC provided any other services to the Company.
statement of remuneration policy The Committee has considered the principles and provisions of the Combined Code when setting its policy and believes it is fully compliant with the Code.
The policy of the Company, which was applied through 2005 06, is to provide remuneration that is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to run the Company successfully.
That being said, the Committees paramount principle is to pay fairly.
The Committee is aware of the risk of remuneration being ratcheted up as a result of benchmarking exercises and confirms that this has not happened.
The policy conclusions of the Committee following the review by NBSC were: the setting of base salaries should be influenced to a greater extent by individual contributions and internal relativities rather than external comparators: the annual bonus plan should recognise the interests of all of the Companys stakeholders shareholders, customers and employees rather than be focused solely on profits: and management should share in the longer term value created for the Companys investors, but equity incentive schemes should only reward if there is clear outperformance of the market and other quoted companies.
The implementation of this remuneration policy is described below.
The Committee is always available to engage with major stakeholders and their representatives to discuss remuneration matters.
During the year the Committee received no such approaches.
Consistent with its fair pay policy, when considering the remuneration packages of senior executives and directors, the Committee takes into account pay awards to other employees in the Group.
elements of remuneration executive directors: basic salary and benefits The basic salaries paid to each director during the year are set out on page 46.
Basic salary is the only pensionable element of the executive directors remuneration package.
The NBSC review revealed that the Managing Directors basic salary is less than the median paid to his counterparts at other quoted water companies.
Notwithstanding this, and at his own suggestion, the Managing Director has not been awarded a salary increase in 2006.
A salary increase was awarded to the Finance Director in order to bring his salary closer to 75% of the Managing Directors salary, which is considered to be an appropriate relativity.
Benefits provided to the executive directors include membership of a defined benefit pension scheme, car allowance and healthcare.
non-executive directors: fees and benefits The Chairman receives an annual fee of 125,000 and benefits in kind, which include the use of a company car and driver and work related accommodation.
The car, driver and accommodation are available to the company when not used by the Chairman.
All other non-executive directors are paid a fee of 30,000 per annum.
Additional fees of 5,000 and 7,500 per annum are paid to the Chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committees respectively.
The fees of non-executive directors are reviewed from time to time, with advice from the Companys remuneration advisers, to take account of time commitment, inflation and to ensure the level of fees remains fair and competitive.
Other than the Chairman, the non-executive directors do not receive benefits in kind.
Neither the Chairman nor the other non-executive directors participate in bonus, pension or share incentive schemes operated by the Company.
CliCk to return to Contents northumbrian Water Group plc 43 Annual report and financial statements 2005 06 Annual bonus For the 2005 06 and later financial years, the Committee has concluded that the annual bonus plan should reflect the interests of all of the Companys stakeholders.
Maximum annual bonuses for the executive directors in 2005 06 are 70% of salary, which are apportioned as follows: Maximum bonus available as a Stakeholder Bonus metric % of salary Shareholders PBT 40 Customers Overall Performance Assessment OPA rating 5 Employees Percentage lost time through sickness 5 Bespoke personal targets 20 total 70 John Cuthberts personal targets related principally to business strategy, investor relations, succession planning and remuneration strategy, as well as a range of financial matters.
Chris Greens personal targets were focused mainly on funding, the maintenance of key financial ratios and measures and the implementation of IFRS.
Taking account of performance against personal targets and the OPA, PBT and lost time performance, bonuses equal to 44.5% and 48.25% of basic salary were approved for payment to John Cuthbert and Chris Green, respectively.
long term incentive Plan ltiP Under the LTIP, executive directors and senior managers may receive, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, annual conditional awards of shares in the Company.
Details of the levels of award and performance conditions are shown in the table on page 44, and LTIP awards made to directors are shown in the table on page 47.
A conclusion of the review that took place during 2005 06 was that the LTIP remained the most appropriate equity incentive plan, particularly in light of the Companys dividend policy.
The Committee agreed that total shareholder return TSR performance conditions remained the best performance measure to ensure that executives are rewarded fairly for value created for the Companys investors.
However, changes were made to the structure of the TSR condition, which are more consistent with best practice.
CliCk to return to Contents northumbrian Water Group plc 44 Annual report and financial statements 2005 06 Directors remuneration report summary of ltiP LTIP awards made 27 January 2004 and 22 December 2004 Maximum award 75% of salary permitted.
Actual grants to executive directors were over shares worth 40% of salary.
Performance conditions Comparison of TSR with two comparator groups over three years: 1 70% of award depends on the Companys TSR performance against other listed water companies: AWG plc, Bristol Water plc, East Surrey Holdings plc, Kelda Group plc, Pennon Group plc, Severn Trent plc and United Utilities plc: and 2 30% of award depends on the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts.
Vesting schedules 1 30% vests at median performance with sliding scale based on ranking to 100% if the Company tops the group.
Where the Companys TSR performance is below the median performance of the comparator group, none of that element of the award will vest.
2 30% vests if the Companys TSR equals the FTSE 250 Index, increasing to 100% if the Companys TSR out-performs the Index by at least 6%.
Where the Companys TSR performance is less than that of the Index, none of that element of the award will vest.
LTIP award made 9 December 2005 and policy for future awards Maximum award 75% of salary permitted.
Actual grants to executive directors were over shares worth 70% of salary.
Vesting schedules 1 As above, but between median and upper quartile, the vesting will be calculated on a straight line basis comparing the Companys TSR to that of the median and upper quartile positions, rather than ranking.
2 30% vests at median performance with straight line pro-rating of TSR performance against the members of the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts, to 100% for upper quartile performance.
Where the Companys TSR performance is below the median, none of that element of the award will vest.
In addition, awards will only vest if the Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR performance is consistent with the underlying business performance of the Company.
In the event of a change of control, the Committee would determine the extent to which the performance conditions had been met and the proportion of the performance period that had elapsed in deciding whether or not any vesting of awards would take place.
The performance conditions described above were chosen to align the interests of participants in the LTIP with those of shareholders.
Rewards should only be earned over a number of years in circumstances where shareholders have benefited.
An independent firm will be engaged by the Committee to calculate the TSRs and to assess the extent to which the performance conditions have been met, so that the process is rigorous and transparent.
