49 Remuneration Committee report The following report by the Remuneration Committee has been approved by the Board for submission to shareholders at the 2007 AGM.
Part 1 Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee During the year, the Committee comprised Tim Barker as Chairman, Charles Berry, Jamie Dundas and Mike Grasby, all of whom are independent non-executive directors.
During 2005, matters affecting directors remuneration in the period ended 31 December 2006 were considered by the Remuneration Committee of Drax Group Limited the holding company of the group until the Company was listed on the London Stock Exchange on 15 December 2005 which comprised Tim Barker, Mike Grasby and Gordon Horsfield Chairman of the Board.
The Committee met on nine occasions during the year and members attendance record is set out on page 43.
Throughout the year, the Committee has had the support of John Readshaw, Head of Human Resources.
Since 22 May 2006, Peter Rothwell, Company Secretary, has attended meetings as Secretary to the Committee.
Dorothy Thompson, Chief Executive, and Gordon Horsfield, Chairman of the Board, are invited to attend meetings of the Remuneration Committee except when their own remuneration is being discussed.
In July 2006, the Committee appointed Kepler Associates LLP Kepler Associates as its adviser to take the place of Peter Newhouse & Co, who advised the Committee on remuneration-related topics.
Since their appointment, Kepler Associates have provided advice to the Committee on market practice, incentive plans and other remuneration-related topics.
Kepler Associates also advised the Group on the remuneration of senior managers whose remuneration is not determined by the Committee and advised on the remuneration of non-executive directors.
During the year, the Committee also received legal advice and other legal services from Norton Rose who were appointed by the Board to act as principal legal advisers to the Group.
The Committees principal responsibilities are: recommending to the Board the remuneration strategy and framework for the executive directors and senior managers: determining, within that framework, the individual remuneration packages for the executive directors and senior managers: approval of the design of annual and long-term incentive arrangements, for executive directors and senior managers including agreeing the annual targets and payments under such arrangements: determining and agreeing the general terms and conditions of service and the specific terms for any individual within the Committees remit, either on recruitment or on termination: determining the policy for, and scope of, executive pension arrangements: and to oversee any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Group and review remuneration trends across the Group.
The terms of reference for the Committee are reviewed annually by the Committee and then by the Board.
A copy of the terms of reference is available on the Groups website at www.
Remuneration policy The Committees remuneration policy applicable to executive directors and senior managers whose remuneration is determined by the Committee is to: link a significant proportion of remuneration to performance: manage salaries and benefits around market levels, taking into account both industry and cross-industry benchmarks: award annual cash bonuses which are linked to the delivery of the annual business plan targets and personal performance: and provide staff with long-term incentives linked to total shareholder returns.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 50 Remuneration Committee report continued When applying this policy to senior managers below director level, the Committee selects salary and benefit benchmarks appropriate to individual specialisms.
The objectives of the remuneration policy are to: motivate executive directors and staff to help ensure that Drax meets challenging performance goals: enable Drax to recruit and retain the expertise needed to manage and develop its business: strengthen teamwork at all levels: and ensure alignment of executive and shareholder interests.
During the year, the Committee conducted a detailed review of management incentive arrangements, in conjunction with its appointed adviser, Kepler Associates, to ensure that these arrangements are motivational, competitive and strongly linked to performance.
Following this review and consultation with the Companys major shareholders and institutional shareholder representative bodies, the Committee made some changes to the annual bonus arrangements for the 2007 financial year and to the performance condition used in the Companys Executive Share Incentive Plan ESIP.
For 2007, the remuneration of executive directors and senior managers will comprise five components, namely: base salary: annual performance bonus a mix of cash and deferred shares : conditional share awards under the ESIP: pension and benefits: and all-employee share plans.
Remuneration during 2006 comprised the same components except that the annual performance bonus was delivered wholly in cash.
For 2007, variable remuneration is targeted to account for approximately 50% of the fair value of executive director remuneration including pension.
The following paragraphs provide more detail in relation to each of the five components of remuneration.
Base salary Executive directors base salaries and benefits are reviewed each year with any changes taking effect from 1 April.
The review takes into account individual performance and market competitiveness.
Pensionable salary is derived from base salary only.
The Committee benchmarks executive director salaries against comparator groups of utilities, power generators and selected other industrial and commercial companies with comparable turnover or market value.
Annual performance bonus The Group operates an annual bonus scheme.
Bonuses are based on Group performance and individual performance against objectives.
The Committee sets Group performance measures based on the Groups business priorities for which the Board sets challenging performance targets.
In 2006, Group measures included financial, trading, plant operations, safety, environmental, and development objectives, and a discretionary element.
In exercising its discretion, the Committee has regard to managements performance in handling unforeseeable events which arise during the year.
In May 2006, the Committee, in conjunction with its adviser, undertook a review of executive director remuneration levels at comparator groups of utilities, power generators and selected other industrial and commercial companies with comparable turnover or market value.
The review indicated that remuneration levels at Drax were generally below market median.
The Committee therefore resolved to increase executive director bonus opportunities over the two financial years 2006 and 2007 to help bring total remuneration levels more in line with market.
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2006, the target bonus for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors was increased to 50% and 45% of base salary, respectively in each case from 40% of base salary.
The maximum bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors was increased to 100% and 90% of base salary, respectively in each case from 60% of salary.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 51 In 2006, achievement of Group-based performance conditions provided for a bonus of up to 75% of maximum bonus, which was then adjusted according to individual performance by a multiplier in the range 0.67 to 1.33.
The Committee reviewed 2006 actual performance against bonus targets and concluded that Group performance approximately mid-way between on-target and stretch-target was achieved overall.
Individual bonuses were paid in cash.
For 2007, bonus measures and targets have been set using a similar process to that used previously.
The weighting on business plan objectives has been increased from 20% to 30% because of the focus on getting the plant ready for new environmental controls taking effect in 2008, securing the availability of and ability to burn biomass and people development.
The weighting on financial performance has been reduced from 45% to 35%, an element of which is based on the performance of the trading function.
In 2007, the maximum bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors will be increased to 150% and 135% of salary, respectively with no change to target bonus opportunities.
Bonus awards in excess of 100% of salary or 90% for directors other than the Chief Executive will only be awarded in the event of exceptional Group and individual performance which has secured the delivery of very significant benefit to shareholders.
From 2007, 50% of any bonus earned above target will be deferred in the Companys shares for one year, and will be forfeited if the executive leaves Drax before the shares vest.
Benefits The Committees policy is to offer a car allowance to executive directors and to certain senior managers, according to their role.
The annual allowance has remained unchanged since July 2004 and is currently 17,500 per annum for the Chief Executive, 12,000 per annum for executive directors and 7,200 per annum for senior managers whose remuneration is determined by the Committee.
In addition, life assurance in a sum assured of four times base salary is provided for the directors and senior managers and private medical insurance is provided for them and their dependants.
Relocation expenses are paid where appropriate.
Pensions Executive directors and senior managers who joined the Group after 1 January 2002 are entitled to membership of the Groups defined contribution pension plan.
The employers contribution for executive directors is 20% of base salary and for senior managers who are not members of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS it is 11.5% of base salary.
For senior managers who are members of the ESPS the normal employers contribution is 13.3% of base salary but, in addition, the employer currently contributes 15.2% of base salary to discharge the schemes actuarial deficit.
In each case contributions were and are capped by the different statutory limits applicable before and after 6 April 2006, although there is no director or senior manager for whom contributions would mean they exceed either the lifetime or annual allowances.
Alternatively, at their option, executive directors may either have contributions of the same amounts made to their personal pension schemes or cash in lieu of pension at the stated rate and subject to normal statutory deductions.
Details of pension contributions for executive directors and of payments in lieu are included in the emoluments table in Part 2 of this report.
Drax Power Limited, a trading subsidiary, is the Principal Employer of the Drax Power Group of the ESPS, an occupational pension scheme providing defined benefits on death, ill-health, early retirement or normal retirement to eligible members and beneficiaries based on the members length of pensionable service, final salary and the applicable accrual rate.
The defined benefit pension scheme was closed to new entrants in 2002.
Although certain senior managers are members, none of the executive directors are eligible for membership.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 52 Remuneration Committee report continued Current annualised rates of pay The following table shows the current annualised rates of base salary, benefits, bonus at target level and pension contributions for each of the directors: Annual Annual Annual cash Annual Annual 1 2 3 4 salary fees bonus benefits pension 000 000 000 000 000 Tim Barker 57 Charles Berry 54 Gordon Boyd 220 99 12 44 Jamie Dundas 57 Peter Emery 205 92 12 41 Mike Grasby 57 Gordon Horsfield 195 Dorothy Thompson 368 184 18 74 Notes: 1 Includes Board Committee membership fees paid as separate amounts.
2 The annual cash bonus assumes an on target performance yielding a bonus of 50% of base salary for Dorothy Thompson and 45% of base salary for the other executive directors.
The cost of other benefits such as BUPA and additional life cover is not easily predicted because they are subject to price variation the amount of which depends on personal circumstances at the time during the year.
4 Annual contribution by the Company to the directors pension plan or cash in lieu.
Executive Share Incentive Plan At the time of listing of the Companys shares in December 2005, the Committee planned to make the first annual awards under the ESIP in March 2006, following announcement of full-year results.
No awards were made then as the Company was in a restricted period during negotiation of the terms of the long-term electricity supply contract with Centrica.
Subsequently, the Committee decided to review the ESIP, shareholders were consulted and the performance condition was revised.
Under the ESIP, annual awards of performance shares can be made to executive directors and other senior staff up to a normal maximum of 100% of salary 200% in exceptional circumstances.
Shares vest based on Draxs Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to an Index over three years.
The Committee considers relative TSR to be an objective, external measure of the Companys success.
For the 2006 ESIP awards, Index TSR is based 60% on the median TSR of FTSE350 electricity sector peers, 20% on the median TSR of selected UK-listed oil and gas companies and 20% on the TSR of the FTSE100 index, as shown below: Electricity sector peers Oil and gas comparators FTSE100 Weighting 60% 20% 20% Constituents British Energy BG Group FTSE100 index, as published International Power BP ScottishPower Gazprom Scottish and Southern Energy Royal Dutch Shell Viridian This group of companies will be reviewed by the Remuneration Committee if any of the constituent companies are affected by merger and acquisition activity.
The Committee believes the comparator Index achieves a good balance between relevance and robustness as it is most influenced by companies operating in the same sector and markets as Drax, yet also reflects the performance of companies trading in oil and gas the prices of which influence electricity generation margins and the performance of other general-market UK-listed companies.
The Committee will review the constituents and their weightings prior to the start of each ESIP cycle to ensure they remain appropriate.
No shares vest if the Companys TSR over the three year period is less than the Index TSR: 25% of shares vest if the Companys TSR equals that of the Index: shares vest in full if the Companys TSR outperforms that of the Index by 30% or more, and there is straight-line pro rata vesting in between.
The Committee intends to review the targets prior to the start of each ESIP cycle to ensure they remain relevant and stretching.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 53 For any award to vest, the Committee must additionally be satisfied that there has been a demonstrable improvement in the performance of the Company in terms of but not limited to finance, production, trading, ancillary activities and progress in delivering the Companys strategy.
The Committee has chosen these broader criteria rather than the more straightforward criterion of financial performance because of the extent to which financial performance is susceptible to the influence of movements in relevant commodity markets.
Awards under the ESIP will normally be pro-rated for time and performance in circumstances where they vest for good leavers and on a change of control.
The agenda for the 2007 Annual General Meeting includes a resolution proposing that dividends accrue on ESIP shares over the vesting period to ensure alignment with shareholders interests.
However, the Committee will not allow dividend accrual in respect of any special dividends which are directly linked to share consolidations where each share consolidation has the effect of automatically maintaining the value of the award following payment of the special dividend.
In the event that shareholders approve the proposal, the Committee intends to adjust the awards made in 2006 so that they have the benefit of the interim dividend of 4 pence per share paid in October 2006 as well as adjusting that and future awards for future dividends.
2006 ESIP award The first ESIP awards were made in September 2006 for nil consideration.
For executive directors, the value of each award was equal to 150% of the directors base salary at 31 December 2005.
As foreshadowed in the shareholder consultation prior to making the awards, the Committee departed from what will be its normal policy of limiting awards to 100% of base salary to help the Company retain and motivate talent during the transition to rolling annual ESIP cycles and in recognition of the facts that the first awards were delayed and that the Companys share price increased significantly during the period of delay.
Performance for the 2006 ESIP awards will be measured over the three years from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2009 with potential vesting in September 2009.
No long-term incentives vest before that date.
All-employee share plans The Committee operates a Savings-Related Share Option Plan SAYE and a Share Incentive Plan SIP, both of which are approved by HM Revenue & Customs and must be operated on an all-employee basis.
The executive directors may participate in each plan upon the same terms as other employees.
The SAYE provides for the grant of options which, at the Committees discretion, may be offered at a discount of up to 20% to the market price of a share determined in accordance with the rules of the plan linked to a savings contract which pays interest at a statutory rate.
In May 2006, the plan was operated so that subject to the statutory upper aggregate limit of 250 per month on an individuals savings under all SAYE plans a participating employee could choose to save for either or both periods of three or five years.
The options were granted at the permitted discount of 20% to the prevailing share price determined in accordance with the plan rules and may be exercised upon successful completion of the savings contract to which they are linked.
Details of the options granted to the executive directors at an option price of 6.36 per share are in the table in Part 2 of this report.
Under the SIP, in any one tax year, the Committee may do any combination of: i award Free Shares up to 3,000 in value : ii allow the purchase of Partnership Shares up to 1,500 in value : iii allocate free Matching Shares in a maximum ratio of two free shares for each Partnership Share : and iv allow the investment in shares of dividends received in respect of SIP shares.
In May 2006, each employee was offered shares worth approximately 2,000 under the SIP.
Details of the shares allocated to executive directors are shown in the table on page 58 of this report.
In accordance with the plan rules, shares taken up by an employee are allocated to a trustee which holds them on behalf of the employee.
Under normal circumstances, the employee will receive the shares from the trustee without incurring a tax liability once the shares have been held in trust for five years.
The employee is entitled to receive dividends paid in respect of the shares held in trust.
In January 2007, the Committee reviewed the use of the SIP.
In so doing, its aim was to establish clearer linkage between long-term incentive rewards for all employees and collective performance and to encourage wider share ownership amongst employees.
Wider employee share ownership aligns the interests of employees with those of shareholders by enabling employees to share in the benefits flowing from their contribution to the success of the Company.
As a result of the review the Committee decided in principle to: award Free Shares to each employee in 2007: allow employees to purchase Partnership Shares: and make an allocation of free Matching Shares in respect of Partnership Shares purchased.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 54 Remuneration Committee report continued The Committee is currently reviewing the implementation details before affording employees the opportunity to participate in the SIP on the above basis.
The SIP Trustee will be funded by the Group to purchase the required shares in order to avoid any dilution.
Provision of shares for share plans dilution The Committees current projection of maximum commitments to the issue of new shares inclusive of the new issue actually made in May 2006 to meet SIP allocations and projections of maximum new issue needed for share plan allocations planned or contemplated for 2007 amounts to less than 0.5% of the shares in issue at the date of this report.
Share ownership guidelines During the year, the Company introduced share ownership guidelines for executives participating in the ESIP.
They are 100% and 50% of base salary for executive directors and other senior manager ESIP participants, respectively.
Those who receive shares by virtue of ESIP awards or who receive deferred bonus shares must retain 50% of the net that is, after income tax and national insurance contributions shares received until the applicable guideline is reached.
Service contracts Executive directors service agreements are of indefinite duration, subject to a normal retirement age of 65, and, except in the case of Dorothy Thompson, terminable at any time by the Company giving 12 months prior notice and by the executive director giving six months prior notice.
Until 15 December 2007, Dorothy Thompsons service agreement is terminable by either party on not less than 12 months notice in writing.
Thereafter it is terminable by either party giving a period of six months notice in writing.
Under each of the executive directors service agreements, Drax has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice of termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued to the executive director during the contractual notice period.
The following table shows for each person who has served as a director of the Company at any time during the year ended 31 December 2006, the date of the service agreement or contract for services, the unexpired term and details of the notice periods.
No service agreement now includes any operative provision for the payment of compensation upon early termination.
Any compensation payable in those circumstances would need to be negotiated at the time and in the light of the circumstances.

That agreement was terminated, at no cost to the Group, upon Gordon Horsfield relinquishing his executive responsibilities on 7 March 2006.
With effect from 1 February 2006, Gordon Horsfield waived his entitlement to the payment of bonus and benefits pursuant to that service agreement and agreed the reduction of his salary to 185,000 per annum.
2 Until 15 December 2007, Dorothy Thompsons service agreement is terminable by either party on not less than 12 months notice in writing.
Directors service agreements and contracts for services are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal hours of business and will be available at the place of the Annual General Meeting from 10.00am until the close of the meeting.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 55 External appointments The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience to the benefit of the Company.
No executive director currently holds a directorship of any other company.
The policy is that an executive director who accepts an external appointment having had the prior approval of the Board should retain the fees payable in respect of the appointment.
Non-executive directors Chairmans remuneration and service agreement Until 7 March 2006, Gordon Horsfield, the Chairman of the Board, served in an executive capacity under a service agreement dated 19 December 2003 and terminable by either party on six months notice.
That service agreement was terminated on 7 March 2006 by mutual consent and without cost to the Group upon the relinquishment by Gordon Horsfield of his executive responsibilities.
As a non-executive director and Chairman of the Board he has a contract to provide services in substantially similar terms to the contract of each of the other non-executive directors, save as to the level of remuneration and the period of notice to terminate the contract.
On the basis of a review of remuneration data for Chairmen of other listed companies of a similar market value or turnover to Drax and having regard to his expected time commitment, the Committee determined that Gordon Horsfield should be paid a fee of 185,000 per annum for his services as non-executive Chairman of the Board and that his notice period should be six months on either side.
Like the other non-executive directors, he does not receive a pension or other benefits, nor is he eligible for an annual cash bonus or any of the share-based reward plans.
When the arrangements were made for Gordon Horsfield to relinquish his executive responsibilities he agreed that, in view of the progress made in the transfer of his executive responsibilities to Dorothy Thompson, his salary as an executive director should be reduced to 185,000 per annum with effect from 1 February 2006, he should forego his right to benefits under his service agreement from that date and that he should not be entitled to bonus from 1 January 2006.
Particulars of the remuneration paid to Gordon Horsfield in respect of his services as an executive director to 7 March 2006 are given under the heading Salary, Benefits and Pension and in note 3 to the table on page 56, in Part 2 of this report.
His remuneration as a non-executive director is shown under the heading Fees in that table.
In January 2007, the Committee reviewed the Chairmans remuneration using a similar approach to that used in 2006 when his remuneration as non-executive Chairman was originally determined.
It decided that, with effect from 1 February 2007, his remuneration should be at the annual rate of 195,000, which is reflected in the table of annualised rates of pay on page 52.
Other non-executive directors The remuneration for the other non-executive directors is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors and is designed to: recognise prevailing market rates for non-executive directors fees: reflect the responsibilities and time commitment of non-executive directors: and attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the future growth of the Company.
During 2006 and until the end of February 2007, the non-executive directors were paid a basic monthly fee of 3,000 with additional fees of 420 per month for each Board Committee membership.
These fees are neither performance-related nor pensionable.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Companys bonus schemes or share plans.
The fees for non-executive directors were originally set at the end of 2003 and have since been reviewed regularly although not changed until the review undertaken by the Board in the absence of the non-executive directors in February 2007.
In that review the Board took into account the fees payable by the same comparator companies as those used for the purposes of the review of the Chairmans remuneration by the Committee and decided to increase the basic fee from 36,000 to 39,000 per annum, leave the fee of 5,040 per annum for membership of a Committee unchanged and introduced a fee of 2,500 per annum to the Chairman of each of the Boards Committees, other than the Nominations Committee of which the Chairman of the Board is the Chairman.
The non-executive directors have contracts to provide services to the Company which may be terminated by either party at any time on giving one months notice.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006 56 Remuneration Committee report continued Value of 100 invested The following graph shows how the value of 100 invested in the Company on the listing of its shares on the London Stock Exchange on 15 December 2005 has changed and compares that performance with the changing value of the same amount invested at the same time in the FTSE100 and FTSE250 indices.
Those indices have been chosen as suitable broad comparators against which the Companys shareholders may judge their relative returns given that, during the year under review, the Company has been a member of both the FTSE250 and FTSE100 indices.
The graph reflects the total shareholder return determined according with usual market practice for the Company and each of the indexes referred to on a cumulative basis over the period from 15 December 2005 to 31 December 2006.

The reasons for the payments and their calculation by reference to additional time spent were reported in the Remuneration report in 2005.
3 The figure shown under the heading Fees is the fee paid in respect of the services of Gordon Horsfield as non-executive Chairman with effect from 7 March 2006.
Until that date, as reported in the Remuneration report for 2005, Gordon Horsfield served in an executive capacity and was paid a basic salary at the annual rate of 295,000 per annum until 1 February 2006 when, by agreement and without cost to the Group, his salary as an executive was reduced to 185,000 per annum.

Directors interests under the Drax Group Limited Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Drax Group Limited was the holding company for the Group until the Company became the holding company on 15 December 2005 on which date the Companys shares were first listed on the London Stock Exchange.
It was explained in last years Remuneration report that, upon the listing of those shares and by virtue of the terms of the LTIP: the executive directors which then included Gordon Horsfield and other employees became entitled to shares in the Company: and the executive directors and certain other employees also became entitled to cash payments and, in addition, conditional upon being in the service of the Group in December 2006, they would each become entitled to a further cash payment in that month.
The cash payment to which each person became entitled and which was paid in December 2005 was equal in amount to the cash payment to which he she then became conditionally entitled.
Accordingly, as at 1 January 2006, each of the directors named below had a scheme interest in the LTIP, being a conditional interest in the amount of cash shown against his or her name in the table, and that interest vested and the cash was paid in December 2006.
The liability to make the December 2006 payments was recognised in the 2005 accounts.
Gordon Horsfield 270,300 Gordon Boyd 178,500 Peter Emery 178,500 Dorothy Thompson 40,800 No director has any further right or interest in the LTIP.
