53 Directors remuneration report This report has been drawn up in accordance with the Code and with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985, and has been approved by both the remuneration committee and the board.
Shareholders will be invited to approve this report at the AGM.
The remuneration committees terms of reference are available for inspection on the companys website.
The Companies Act requires certain parts of the remuneration report to be audited.
The audited sections are highlighted.
Composition and function of the remuneration committee The remuneration committee was chaired by Christopher Roshier until 21st April 2006, when he was succeeded in that role by Mary Francis.
It comprises all of the non-executive directors of the company.
It is proposed that Christopher Roshier will stand down from the committee at the AGM.
The committee considers all aspects of the executive directors remuneration and administers the companys share option schemes.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is considered by the board following recommendations by the executive directors.
No director participates in setting their own remuneration.
The committee also reviews and notes annually the remuneration trends across the company and any major changes in employee benefits structures.
Remuneration policy and proposed changes The objective of St. Modwens remuneration policy is to attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior executives through competitive pay arrangements which are also in the best interests of shareholders.
These include performance-related elements to align the interests of directors and shareholders and to motivate the highest performance.
Remuneration levels are set by reference to performance against demanding targets, and by reference to pay levels in the external market.
Overall, the aim is that executive directors base salaries should be set at around the median of the range paid by comparable companies, and that superior performance should be rewarded through total remuneration in the upper quartile of the range.
These benchmarks gear rewards to high performance, and seek to ensure that the company can attract and retain executives of suitable calibre in the sectors very competitive labour market.
Deloitte & Touche LLP Deloitte has been appointed by the remuneration committee to provide advice on remuneration matters.
In 200506 Deloitte undertook a benchmarking exercise in relation to the company, its peers and relevant current market practice and assisted the committee in a review of executive directors future remuneration arrangements including the structure of long-term incentives.
Deloitte performed no other services for the company during the year.
This report sets out the remuneration arrangements in the year ended 30th November 2006.
It also summarises the conclusions of the review of remuneration arrangements referred to above.
Detailed proposals on a new Performance Share Plan, together with proposals for the renewal of the 1997 Executive Share Option Scheme, are contained in a separate letter to shareholders enclosed with this Annual Report, and will be put to the AGM for shareholders approval.
Service contracts All the executive directors have service contracts of no fixed term, with notice periods of twelve months.
Non-executive directors have notice periods of three months.
No director has any rights to compensation on loss of office apart from payment in lieu of notice, where appropriate.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts.
Unless specifically approved by the board, executive directors are not permitted to hold external non-executive directorships.
Anthony Glossop receives fees which he retains in respect of his service as a non-executive director of Robinson PLC 16,500.
He receives no fees in respect of his service as a non-executive director of Northern Racing PLC.
54 Directors remuneration report The dates of the directors service contracts are as follows: C. C. A. Glossop 1st December 1988 W. A. Oliver 24th January 2000 S. J. Burke 1st January 2006 T. P. Haywood 14th April 2003 Base salaries The remuneration committee carefully considered the base salary levels appropriate for the year to 30th November 2006, with advice from Deloitte, and concluded that a significant adjustment was needed to keep them in line with the market and with salary increases below board level.
This reflected the companys rapidly growing size and increasing complexity, the ambitious nature of the companys financial objectives and exceptionally strong recent performance.
A benchmarking exercise undertaken by Deloitte in relation to the company, its peers and relevant current market practice, confirmed that the 2006 base salaries paid to the executive directors excluding the Chairman were now within the market competitive range.
Base salaries for the executive directors other than the Chairman for the year to 30th November 2007 have been agreed as follows: W. A. Oliver 385,000 S. J. Burke 200,000 T. P. Haywood 225,000 Since 1st December 2005, the Chairman has been paid a base salary only.
He does not receive an annual bonus or options.
His salary was last reviewed on 1st December 2004 and since then the rapid growth in the companys size, and its continued outstanding performance, have created the same case for a substantive increase in basic salary as described above for the executive directors.
Following consultation with Deloitte, the remuneration committee agreed that the Chairmans salary should increase from 300,000 p. a. to 350,000 p. a. with effect from 1st December 2006.
References to executive directors in the paragraphs below exclude the Chairman.
Performance-related remuneration The remuneration committee approved all performance-related remuneration in respect of the year to 30th November 2006, and the targets for achievement of such remuneration which were set at the beginning of the financial year.
Bonus scheme In 2006 executive directors participated in a performance-linked cash bonus scheme which was payable in two equal instalments, one on the publication of the results and the second three years later.
As in previous years, the executive directors were eligible to receive a total bonus of up to 140% of base salary up to 80% allocated towards achievement of financial targets and up to 60% towards achievement of personal targets.
The second instalment will be paid provided the companys net assets per share growth over the relevant three year period exceeds RPI plus 5% per annum and the director concerned continues to be employed by the company.
The levels of bonus award were determined by the remuneration committee on the basis of performance against both financial and personal targets.
The financial targets set by the committee for the year to 30th November 2006 comprised growth in pre-tax profits between 10% and 15%, awards being pro-rated between these minimum and maximum points, and growth in net assets per share of 15%.
Both targets were based on IFRS figures but in the case of pre-tax profits, the target excluded revaluation surpluses and was adjusted to reflect the change in the way the company accounts for the valuation of land held for unspecified future use.
The introduction of a sliding scale for the pre-tax profits target and of a second financial target based on NAV growth were new elements compared to the previous year.
Directors remuneration report 55 Personal targets were set individually for each executive director, and focused on: a creation of a development programme for 2007 designed to generate pre-tax profits, ignoring revaluation surplus, at least 15% higher than in 2006, and b the acquisition for the hopper of at least 120% of property used in 2006.
The Chairman makes recommendations to the remuneration committee for the levels of bonus payable to executive directors against both the financial and personal targets, supported by audited figures in respect of the financial targets.
Decisions on the levels of bonus payable are taken by the remuneration committee.
Annual bonuses do not form part of pensionable pay.
For the year to 30th November 2006, the initial bonuses paid to directors as a percentage of annual salary were as follows: Bill Oliver 70%: Steve Burke 45% bonus level and award relating to the year before he became an executive director : Tim Haywood 70%.
These bonuses represented the maximum of 20% for achievement of the profit target 15% in the case of Steve Burke : and the maximum of 20% for achievement of the NAV growth target 15% in the case of Steve Burke.
The balance represents the bonus paid for the achievement of the personal targets set for each executive director.
Given the strong growth in profits and net assets in 2006 and the achievement of almost all the personal targets set for each executive director, the committee agreed that bonuses at this level were justified.
The second instalment of these bonuses will be paid on the publication of the results for the financial year to 30th November 2009, provided the performance and employment conditions are met.
Richard Froggatt, having left the company during the year, received no bonus, and his deferred entitlement in respect of previous years was cancelled.
The amounts potentially payable to directors in future years in respect of the second instalments of the bonuses earned in 2003 to 2006 are as follows: 2007 2008 2009 2010 Total 000 000 000 000 000 W. A. Oliver 175 217 252 644 S. J. Burke 43 50 60 74 227 T. P. Haywood 77 123 140 340 Share Options The remuneration committee is responsible for overseeing the companys Executive Share Option and Savings Related Share Option schemes in accordance with rules previously approved by shareholders.
In addition to the deferred element of the annual bonus, the main longer term incentive for executive directors as well as other senior employees has been the award of regular grants of options over the companys shares.
Options granted to executive directors in 2006 were equal to 100% of salary.
This has been the normal maximum annual award and the committee felt that awards at this level were justified by the companys strong performance.
For options granted in 2006 under the companys Executive Share Option Scheme as in other recent awards the performance target set was 5% per annum real growth in net asset value per share over the three year period from the date of grant.
This target was selected to incentivise executives to aim for the continued long-term growth of the company, whilst delivering the short and medium-term results which are the principal focus of the bonus scheme.
Performance against these targets is objectively assessed from the audited accounts of the company.
For options granted in 2005 and earlier years, the performance condition was subject to one retesting whereby if the condition was not met in the initial period of 3 years the options could still be exercised if the real growth in the net asset value per share of the company was at least 5% per annum over the four year period from the date of grant.
Options granted in 2006 and thereafter do not allow retesting if the performance condition is not met in the initial 3 year period if this is the case the options will lapse.
All performance conditions not yet met will be adjusted for the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards to the company in 2006.
Executive directors may also participate in the companys savings-related share schemes on the same terms as all other employees.

Directors remuneration report 57 Review of remuneration arrangements During the course of 2006, the committee conducted a comprehensive review of the companys remuneration arrangements for executive directors, with advice from Deloitte.
The purpose of the review was to consider whether the current arrangements continued to be the most appropriate for the delivery of the companys strategy.
The committee reviewed the structure of incentives, the performance conditions and their link to the companys business strategy, the balance between annual and longer term remuneration, and the market positioning of the package as a whole.
The key conclusions of the review were as follows: Base salaries should continue to be positioned at around the median of companies of a similar size and complexity: Despite the improvements made in base salaries in 2006, total remuneration for executive board members was currently below that of comparable companies at most levels of performance: Awards of performance shares rather than share options would now provide a better incentive to performance over the longer term, whilst continuing to align reward with the creation of long-term shareholder value and enabling the company to set stretching targets aligned with our stated strategy: A greater proportion of executive remuneration should be determined by reference to performance measured over the longer term.
There should be a rebalancing away from the annual bonus and towards the long-term incentive arrangements: The arrangements should be as clear and simple as possible.
Accordingly, as well as reducing the annual incentive opportunity, the deferred element should be removed.
The resulting combination of a single annual cash incentive and a longer-term share-based element would best meet the companys objectives for the executive directors.
It would also provide a strong foundation for extending the scheme to certain other senior executives below board level, as the company wishes to do after the board-level scheme has bedded down: and The delivery of long-term NAV growth performance was central to the companys strategy, and should form the focus of the incentive performance conditions, with very stretching targets.
Although many companies select different financial targets for their annual and long-term incentive schemes, the committee concluded after careful reflection that St. Modwens business model made NAV growth an appropriate though not the only target in both schemes.
Details of the specific changes planned as a result of the review, including proposals for a new Performance Share Plan, are set out in a letter issued with this Annual Report and will be the subject of a separate resolution at the AGM.
Non-executive directors fees The level of non-executive directors fees is recommended to the board by the Chairman and executive directors, having taken advice on market practice from Deloitte.
For 2006 the level of the basic fee paid was 33,000 per director with additional payments of 7,500 to the chairman of the audit committee and the chairman of the remuneration committee and of 5,000 to the senior independent director.
For the year commencing 1st December 2006, non-executive directors fees have been set at 35,000 per director, with additional payments of 8,000 to the chairman of the audit committee and the chairman of the remuneration committee and of 5,300 to the senior independent director.
