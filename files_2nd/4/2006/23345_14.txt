The law requires your Companys Auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited they are indicated as such.
The auditors opinion is included in their report on page 24.
Remuneration committee The Company has four non-executive Directors.
The Board as a whole fulfils the function of a Remuneration Committee.
The Board has appointed the company secretary, Edinburgh Fund Managers plc, to provide information when the Directors consider the level of Directors fees.
Remuneration Policy The Companys articles of association limit the aggregate fees payable to the Board of Directors to a total of 75,000 per annum.
Subject to the overall limit, the Boards policy is that the remuneration of non-executive Directors should reflect the experience of the Board as a whole and be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts that are similar in size, have a similar capital structure and have a similar investment objective.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year to 31 January 2007 and subsequent years.
The fees for the non-executive Directors are determined within the limits set out in the Companys articles of association, and they are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, long term incentive schemes or other benefits.
The Board carried out a review of the level of Directors fees during the year, and concluded that the fees payable to Directors should remain at 17,000 for the Chairman and 11,000 for each Director.
No Director has a service contract with the Company.
The terms of their appointment provide that a Director shall retire and be subject to election at the first Annual General Meeting after their appointment, and at least every three years after that.
The terms also provide that a Director may be removed without notice and that compensation will not be due on leaving office.
No Director was interested in contracts with the Company during the period or subsequently.
Directors and Officers liability insurance cover is maintained by the Company on behalf of the Directors.
A resolution to receive the Directors Remuneration Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
