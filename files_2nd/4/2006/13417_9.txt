32 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Remuneration Committee Report Prior to flotation, the Company undertook a full and independent review of its remuneration policy to ensure that it is appropriate both for shareholders and the Company.
The introduction of a new policy, immediately before flotation, followed discussions with shareholder bodies and was ratified by the Board.
RHM has a clear set of key principles which underpin the Remuneration Policy and which will guide the Committees decisions.
This policy aims to: support and reinforce RHMs business objectives: drive a high performance culture through encouraging superior business performance: attract and retain a high calibre senior team: align executive rewards with shareholder value: clearly differentiate according to performance and reward high levels of individual achievement.
A highly motivated, performance-driven leadership team is fundamental to the Companys continued growth and profitability.
The Company continues to focus on performance incentives and introduced, on flotation, a long-term incentive plan, the RHM Group Performance Share Plan the LTIP in addition to an annual incentive plan, based on annual targets.
The Company is pleased to be able to launch a new Sharesave Scheme in the coming year, open to all employees who have been with us since 4 January 2006.
We now have an excellent team of executives, directors and senior managers and I am confident that the Remuneration Policy will continue to align the remuneration of senior executives with the interests of shareholders, as well as engaging them in the pursuit of long-term shareholder value.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is a sub-committee of the Board and was established in February 2006, with clear terms of reference to guide its decisions.
The Committee consists of three independent non-executive directors, all of whom joined on formation of the Committee.
The Committee members are Erhard Schoewel Chairman, Michael Baulk and Roger Matthews.
In addition, the Chairman and Chief Executive are regularly invited to attend.
Neither the Chairman nor the Chief Executive attend when their own remuneration is being discussed.
Role The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the Companys policy on the remuneration of executive directors and senior managers.
This includes the implementation and operation of share incentive schemes, and the determination, within agreed terms of reference, of specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors and executive management detailed on pages 30 to 31 including pension rights, contracts of employment and any compensation payments.
It is committed to principles of accountability and transparency, and to ensuring that there is a clear link between performance and reward.
It is accountable to shareholders through the annual report and will give consideration to the outcome of the vote at the AGM on the Remuneration Report.
It is expected that the Remuneration Committee will meet three times during each full financial year.
The Committees first meeting following flotation took place in February 2006 and it met twice during the period under review.
Advice The Remuneration Committee received independent advice from Towers Perrin and Monks Partnership, who advised the Company prior to the establishment of the Remuneration Committee, on market data, best practice and governance.
Ashurst provided tax and legal advice on service contracts and share schemes, whilst Aon Consulting provided advice on retirement benefits.
Ashurst are on the Groups roster of legal advisers, and Aon Limited are the Companys insurance brokers.
The Remuneration Committee did not specifically appoint any advisers during the year.
33 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Remuneration Committee Report Remuneration Policy The key objectives of the Remuneration Policy are to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives and to provide a clear link between remuneration and business performance.
In developing its policy, the Company has taken into account its regulatory framework, including best practice in corporate governance and the views of shareholder bodies.
Total remuneration is benchmarked against the relevant markets to provide executive directors with competitive remuneration.
A high proportion of total remuneration is directly linked to business performance.
Directors remuneration packages consist of several components.
The fixed elements are basic salary and benefits in kind.
In addition, the Company has an annual incentive plan and the LTIP, under which payments are linked to the long-term value delivered to shareholders.
The proportion of variable pay to fixed pay was increased in the year under review with the introduction of the LTIP.
Approximately two-thirds of executive directors potential direct remuneration is now performance related.
As this policy is highly performance-driven, the Remuneration Committee selects performance measures which provide the greatest alignment with the Companys strategic goals.
These performance measures are linked to both operational performance and share price growth.
They are balanced between absolute financial measures and sector comparative measures.
Details of the performance measures are set out on page 34.
Basic salary Base salaries are targeted at a median level in relation to comparable companies.
Annual bonuses and LTIP awards are set to enable executives to earn total remuneration in the upper quartile range, providing the demanding targets and performance conditions have been met.
Base salaries are reviewed annually and any increase is usually effective from 1 July.
Base salary is the only pensionable element of remuneration although pensionable pay was frozen for a four year period from April 2005.
In reviewing the base salaries of the executive directors and executive management, the Remuneration Committee commissioned an independent survey of comparative packages in companies of similar size and across industry sectors.
Annual performance bonus Each executive director and member of the senior management team is eligible to participate in a discretionary annual cash bonus plan based on the achievement of stringent business targets.
The performance targets are determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of the financial year.
The target base award is set at 50% of base salary, rising to a maximum of 100% for exceptional business performance.
For the year under review, 90% of the maximum achievable bonus related to financial performance targets and 10% to personal performance.
For the coming year, these percentages will become 95% and 5% respectively.
LTIP On flotation, and as described in the flotation prospectus, the LTIP was adopted.
The plan is designed to provide an appropriate longterm incentive to directors and senior managers in the business, taking into account current best practice and institutional guidelines.
The Remuneration Committee approves the grant of awards offered to executive directors and senior managers.
The first awards were granted on flotation and thereafter the intention is for awards to be granted annually.
The maximum value of shares which may be awarded to executive directors in any financial year will be limited to 100% of base salary although in exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, awards may be granted in excess of the normal limit, up to a maximum of 200% of base salary.
On flotation, Ian McMahon was allocated an award to the value of 100% of base salary, with awards of 75% of salary being granted to Andrew Allner and members of the senior management team.
The maximum number of shares that could be transferred to each executive director upon satisfaction of the performance conditions appears in the disclosures relating to directors interests.
For the coming year, both executive directors will receive awards on the same basis as the previous year, with other senior management receiving awards of up to 75% of base salary.
34 RHM Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Remuneration Committee Report Performance measures The vesting of awards is subject to challenging performance conditions, as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Performance will be measured over a period of three years, starting with the beginning of the financial year in which the award is made.
There is no provision for re-testing of the performance conditions on or after the end of the performance period.
The awards granted on flotation will vest subject to the achievement of performance criteria based on earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR.
50% of the shares awarded are subject to each criterion, details of which are set out in the following table.
The EPS CAGR targets in the table below were determined on the basis of accounts prepared under UK GAAP, the standard adopted by the Company on flotation.
Since then, the Companys accounting basis has changed to IFRS and, at the vesting date, the Remuneration Committee will consider the impact of this change on the EPS CAGR targets.
Performance conditions for awards made during 2006 EPS Normalised EPS Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR If CAGR equals 15% pa, 20% of the total shares subject to the award will vest.
If CAGR equals 25% pa, 50% of the total shares subject to the award will vest.
Vesting for CAGR between 15% and 25% pa will be on a pro rata straight-line basis: no shares subject to the EPS condition will vest for performance below the 15% pa CAGR condition the minimum threshold.
TSR Comparator Group RHM plc Associated British Foods plc Median position: 20% of total shares subject to the award Cadbury Schweppes plc will vest.
Cranswick plc Upper quartile position: 50% of total shares subject to the Dairy Crest plc award will vest.
Greencore Group plc For positions between median and upper quartile, vesting Kerry Group plc will be on a pro rata straight-line basis: no shares subject Northern Foods plc to the TSR condition will vest for performance below the Premier Foods plc median position within the comparator group.
Robert Wiseman Dairies plc Tate & Lyle plc Uniq plc EPS will be calculated as basic EPS from continuing operations as defined in IAS33 and adjusted for one-off items.
For 2005, EPS will be calculated on a pro forma basis, adjusted to include interest costs, based on the financing structure following flotation.
TSR means the percentage change in the Average Share Price over the Original Share Price, plus the gross dividend per share.
For LTIP awards in the coming year, the TSR Comparator Group will remain unchanged.
The range set for payout under the EPS part of the award will be 6% to 12% CAGR per annum, calculated under IFRS.
Both of these targets are market competitive.
The maximum payouts under both the EPS and TSR parts of the award will each remain at 50% of the total shares subject to the award.
However, the payments for achieving the minimum payout thresholds under both the EPS and TSR parts of the award will each be reduced from 20% to 15% of the total shares subject to the award, in line with market trends.
The Remuneration Committee will monitor and determine the extent to which the EPS and TSR performance conditions are met.
It will also assess the continuing suitability of these conditions and may impose different conditions on future awards.
For example, it may amend the peer group if there has been significant consolidation in the industry.
In line with its policy on transparency, the Remuneration Committee will explain any adjustments made to the relative TSR ranking in the Remuneration Report following vesting, and may amend the performance conditions if events occur that would make the amended condition a fairer measure of performance and provided that any amended condition is not easier to satisfy.
