REMUNERATION REPORT For ease of reference the Remuneration Report is broken down into the following sections, of which Directors Emoluments and Pensions, SeniorManagement Remunerationand DirectorsInterests were subject to audit: RemunerationPolicy   Executive Remuneration Total Reward Composition  Initiatives Service Contracts External   DirectorsEmoluments and Pensions SeniorManagement Remuneration DirectorsInterests Total Shareholder Return Remuneration Policy The Group wide remuneration policy, as approved by the Remuneration Committee, for 2006 and future years, is summarised as follows: base pay and benefits are targeted at the market place median for fully acceptable performance: bonus schemes are targeted to deliver upper quartile pay for upper quartile performance: remuneration practice is based on robust competitive survey data in the context of the Companys ability to pay: and there are noautomaticpay adjustments unless required by law orlocalprotocol.
A share based incentive portfolio operates for executive directors, executive officers and the next level of senior executives.
The plan comprises a performance share plan, share option plan and co-investment plan and increases the proportion of executives variable reward that is dependent on the Groups performance.
Other levels of management are able to participate inthe 2001 share optionplans.
Major changes to the  discussed withthe .
The Remuneration Committee The Committee, which comprises Dr. Rolf Stomberg Chairman, Dr. Pamela Kirby, Warren Knowlton and Richard fide Schutter, determines the compensation of executive directors, executive officers and the broad policy for executive remuneration.
The Committee is assisted by Sir Christopher ODonnell, Chief Executive and Paul Williams, Group Human Resources Director, both of whom have advised on all aspects of the Groups reward structures and policiesbut neitheris present at any  ownremuneration.
TheCommittee reviews: on an annual basis the remuneration, including pension entitlements, of executive directors and executive officers: the relationshipbetween the remunerationof executive directors and that of other employees: the competitiveness of executive remuneration using data from independent consultants on companies of similarsize, technologiesand : the performance targets for the bonus plans and long-term incentive plans and the performance against the targets: and determines the operation of, and the participants, in the long-term incentive plans, share option schemes and the performancerelated bonusplan: the operation of all of the Companys share incentive schemes in respect of grant levels, performance criteriaand vesting schedules: and plans for management succession.
61 Remuneration Report The terms of reference, which are available on the companys website at www.
com, enable the Committee to obtain its own external advice on any matter, at the Companys expense.
During the year, the Committee received information from a number of independent consultants appointed by the Company: Watson Wyatt on a broad range of remuneration issues: Towers Perrin and Hay Group on salary data when considering base salaries of executive directors and executive officers:  LLP on long-term incentive plan comparative performance and Deloitte & Touche LLP on current US compensation market practice.
Watson Wyatt also acts as one of the retirement benefit consultants to the Group,  LLP provided consultancy services to the Group including due diligence for the Biomet bid, project and taxation advice and Deloitte & ToucheLLPprovided taxation advice.
The Principal Components of  a Basic Salary and Benefits Basic salary reflects the responsibility of the position and individual performance.
The Group also provides certain benefits such as private healthcare coverage and a company car or allowance in line with competitive practice.
The Remuneration Committee considers any pension consequences and costs to the  salary increases for executive directors and executive officers.
b Performance Related Bonus For executive directors, the Group operates an annual bonus scheme.
In 2006, 75% of the annual bonus was based on annual growth in EPSA and 25% was based on personal objectives underpinned by asset velocity measurements.
The scheme is designed to encourage outstanding performance.
Achievement of 12% target EPSA growth and the personal objectives would produce a bonus of 50% of annual salary.
The maximum bonus is 100% of annual salary.
Under the Co-investment Plan, part of the annual bonus may be taken inshares.
The actual bonus earned in 2006 by executive directors is shown in the table on page 67 and ranged from 44% to 69% of annualsalary.
For executive officers with corporate responsibilities, the 2006 annual bonus plan was linked to EPSA growth, sales growth and personal objectives.
For those executive officers with specific business unit responsibilities, targets were linked to EPSA growth, sales growth and trading profit of their respective business unit.
As with executive directors, part of the annualbonusmay be taken inshares.
c Long-Term Incentives i Performance Share Plan Annual awards over shares made under the 2004 Performance Share Plan vest if defined levels of total shareholder returns are attained over three years beginninginthe year of award.
The award shares are divided equally into two tranches, so as to measure Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to the FTSE 100 and the major companies in the medical devices industry respectively.
TSR performance of the Sterling priced ordinary shares against the FTSE 100 companies and the Dollar priced ADR TSR performance against major companies in the medical devices industry the majority of whichare US listed are the most suitable measures to encourage high levels of business performance and align the interests of the Group, its shareholders and seniorexecutives.
62 The medical devices companies for comparison for the 2006 award which the Committee considered appropriate to the Companywere: Arthrocare Johnson& Johnson Bard KCI Baxter Medtronic BectonDickinson Nobel Biocare Biomet Orthofix BostonScientific Stryker Coloplast Group St Jude Medical Conmed Synthes-Stratec DJO WrightMedical Edwards Life Sciences Corp Zimmer The shares of each tranche will vest if the Groups TSR is ranked at the median level in that tranche.
If, in relation to either tranche, the Group ranks at median, 25% of the award of that tranche will vest and if the Group is at the th th 75 centile, then all of the shares of that tranche will vest.
Between the median and 75 centiles, the shares will th vest on a straight-line basis.
If the Group is above the 75 centile, then the number of shares increases above the award on a straight-line basis up to a maximum of 150% of the award if the Group is ranked at or above the th 90 centile.
In relation to awards made to executive directors, the initial market value of the award shares is equivalent to their basic annual salary and in relation to awards made to executive officers, the initial market value of the awards was equivalent to 75% of their basic annual salary.
For 2007 and future years the initial market value of the award shares for executive directors willbe 150% of their basic annualsalary.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to reduce the number or percentage of shares which vest, if, notwithstanding the Group is ranked at or above the median level in respect of either tranche of award shares, the Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the growth in the Groups TSR achieved for either tranche is not a genuine reflection of the Groups underlying financial performance.
The Groups TSR performance and its performance relative to the comparator group is independently monitored and reported to the Remuneration Committee by  LLP.
For the awards made in 2004 no award vested as the Company was th ranked below median inthe FTSE 100 comparatorgroupand 11 inthe medical devices group.
ii ExecutiveShare Options In 2006, share options were granted under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan and 2001 UK Approved Plan for UK resident executive directors and senior executives.
Under the 2004 Plan, the maximum market value of options which may be granted each year is equivalent to the basic annual salary of the director or executive.
Options are exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant and are only exercisable if graduated target levels of growth in EPSA over the three-year performance period are achieved, beginningwiththat inwhichthe optionis granted.
Options were granted under the 2001 UK Approved Plan up to the value of 30,000 and formed part of the overall grant.
 these awards were the same as for the 2004 Plan.
The target levels of performance are set by the Remuneration Committee for each grant.
For 2006 they were: 25% of the option shares will vest if growth in EPSA over the three-year period ending 31 December 2008 is 26% i. e. 8% compounded annually with 50% vesting if such growth is 40% i. e. 12% compounded annually.
Only if growth in EPSA over that period exceeds 64% i. e. 18% compounded annually will all of the option shares vest.
Option shares will vest pro rata on a straight-line basis if growth in EPSA is between these levels.
There is no retesting of performance conditions.
For the awards made in 2004 77.4% vested as EPSA growth for the three year period was 61.7%.
iii Co-investment Plan The 2004 Co-investment Plan enables executive directors and senior executives to take part of their annual bonus in the form of shares.
The participant elects the level of bonus to be used for this purpose up to a maximum of one half of the annual gross bonus capped at 20% of basic annual salary for executive directors and executive officers.
Thenet amountof the gross amountelected is then used to purchase shares.
For the 2006 award, and provided such shares are held for three years and the participant remains employed within Smith & Nephew, the participant will be entitled to matching shares if the Company achieves a target level of growth in EPSA over that three-year period of 40% i. e. 12% compounded annually.
At this level, the participant is entitled to one matching share for every share acquired out of the gross equivalent amount of the 63 Remuneration Report net bonus used to acquire shares.
If growth in EPSA is 50% or more the participant is entitled to two matching shares for each share acquired out of the gross equivalent amount of the net bonus applied to shares.
There is no sliding scale nor pro rata vesting of matching awards between these performance levels, nor is there any retesting.
For the awards made in 2004, executives will receive two matching shares as EPSA growth for the three year period was 61.7%.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the Remuneration Committee will determine what proportion of the awards or options will vest and what proportionof the matchingshares willbe transferred to the executives taking into account both the proportion of the performance period and the performance of the Company over that period.
In the event that an executive resigns or if employment is terminated for cause, all the options lapse.
If an executive retires or leaves for other reasons, the award is prorated for the proportion of the performance period then elapsed.
Theprorated award is still subject to the attainment of the  vesting.
Senior executives are expected to build and maintaina personal equity stake inthe Company.
Executive directors are required to accumulate a personal holding equivalent to 100% of basic salary within five years and executive officers are required to accumulatea personal holdingequivalent to 75% of basic salary withinfive years.
iv Other Long-Term Incentive Plans Pre 2004 The Performance Share Plan adopted in 2004 replaced the long-term incentive plan LTIP established in 1997 for executive directors and executive officers.
The last award was 2003 and vested in 2006.
No further awards will be made under this LTIP.
However, as every encouragement is given to executive directors and senior managers to build up a significant shareholding in the Group, participants in the LTIP who have not left the Group will, at the fifth and seventh anniversaries of the date of the original award, be awarded one additional share for every five so retained.
The 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan and the 2001 US Share Plan are now, in the main, for the benefit of those executives not eligible for the 2004 share incentive plans.
Each year the Remuneration Committee determines the maximum value of options to be granted to executives by reference to multiples of salary.
With the exception of the 2001 US Share Plan, the exercise of these options is subject to EPSA growth of not less than RPI plus 3% per annum, on average, in a period of three consecutive years.
From 2005, there is no retesting of the performance conditions.
Performance conditions were selected to be in line with market practice at the time.
The awards made in 2004 will vest in 2007 as EPSA growth over the three year performance period exceeded the RPI 3% target.
Options granted under the 2001 US Share Plan, inlinewithUS market practice, are not subject to performance targets but are exercisable cumulatively up to a maximum of 10% after one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years.
Awards of restricted stock under the 2001 US Share Plan are not subject to performance targets but are subject to the executive remaining withthe Group for a specified period, normallytwo years.
Executive share options under all schemes are not offered at a discount to the market value at the time of grant and wouldvest ona changeincontrol.
UK executive directors and executive officers are eligible to participate in the Smith & Nephew Employee Share Option Scheme ShareSave and US executive directors and executive officers are eligible to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Both these plans are available to all UK or US employees with three months service.
d Pensions Pensions UK UK based executive directors and executive officers have a normal retirement age of 62.
Those in service pre-2003 participate in the defined benefit Smith & Nephew UK Pension Fund and UK Executive Pension Scheme, under which pension has been accrued in the year at an annual rate of one-thirtieth of final pensionable salary up to a limit based on service of two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to Inland Revenue constraints.
Pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase by 5% per annum or the rate of inflation in the UK, if lower.
Death in service cover of four times salary and spouses pension at the rate of two thirds of the members pension are provided on death.
A salary supplement partially compensates for the UK Inland Revenue earnings cap onfinal pensionable salary whichcontinuesto apply inthe defined benefit plans.
64 Those commencingemployment post 2002 either participate in the defined contributionplan to whicha company contribution of 30% of base salary is made or have a non-pensionable non-bonusable salary supplement of 30% of base salary.
Death in service cover of seven times salary of which four times is provided as a lump sum is provided on death.
The non-pensionable non-bonusable salary supplement is also available to any executive directororexecutive officer whowishes to opt out of the defined pensionplans for future service.
Pensions US US based executive directors and executive officers participate in either the defined benefit Smith & Nephew US Pension Plan or the defined contribution US Savings Plan 401 k Plus.
Any new executives would enter the US Savings Plan 401 k Plus.
Under the US Pension Plan, pensions accrue at an annual rate of approximately one-sixty second of final pensionable salary up to a limit based on service of 60% of final pensionable salary.
The plan also provides for a spouses pension at the rate of one half of the members pension on death.
Normal retirement age under the plan is 65.
For executives in the defined benefit US pension plan a supplementary plan is used to enable benefits to be payable from age 62 without reduction for early retirement.
A supplementary defined contribution plan is used to compensate for the earnings cap imposed by the US Internal Revenue Code and to provide additional retirement benefits.
Total Reward Composition In 2006, excluding pension entitlements, the composition of remuneration for Sir Christopher ODonnell was: base pay fixed 33%, annual bonus variable 16%, and long-term incentives variable 51%: for David J. Illingworth was: base pay fixed, 15% annual bonus variable, 8% and long-term incentives variable 77%: and for Adrian Hennah was: base pay fixed 29%, annual bonus variable 14%, and long-term incentives variable 57%.
The following table provides a comparison of variable remuneration of executive directors and executive officers and business unit management shown as a percentage of salary.
Except for the annual bonus, the components are measured over a three year period.

However, some changes were made to the annual bonus plan for the year and for future years.
For executive directors the budgeted improvement in ROCE which accounted for 25% of the bonus was replaced by personal objectives.
Achievement of the personal objectives would be underpinned by asset velocity.
For 2007 and onwards achievement of target performance will produce a bonus of 65% for executive directors.
To reflect current market practice, the bonus payable to UK executives was increased from 30% to 50% of salary on the achievement of the target performance conditions.
With the relative slowdown in 2006 of growth in the markets in which the Group operates, the EPSA growth rates for bonus purposes were reduced by 2% although target remained at 8%.
For Group Head Office executives sales growth replaced budgeted improvement inROCE.
Further amendments were made to the sales element of the bonusfor the business unitexecutives.
For 2006 only, the Committee approved amendments to EPSA for bonus, stock options and co-investment plan vesting, which were largely in line with guidance given to the market in Quarter 1 of 2006 and included the dilution resulting from the sale of BSN Medical and the loss of interest rate differentials with the change to US dollar reporting.
65 Remuneration Report In line with current good practice to minimise attrition risks, change-in-control measures were put in place at senior executive levels.
For the Chief Executive a 12 months change-in-control was inserted into his contract and for the Chief Financial Officer 24 months reducing to 12 months after the initial period.
For US business unit Presidents the change-in-control period is now 24 months.
The change-in-control arrangements do not enhance currentpay and benefit entitlements.
During the year executive attrition risks in the medical devices sector and particularly in the US have increased.
To mitigate this the Committee approved the issue of restricted stock to selected US executives considered to be most at risk.
This includes an award to David J. Illingworth of 96,710 shares in December 2006.
One half of this award will vest if he remains in continuous employment until 31 December 2007 and the remainder will vest if he remains  until31 December 2008.
To facilitate his recruitment to the Board in June 2006, the Committee approved an award of 57,603 restricted stock under Rule 9.4 of the Listing Rules of the FSA to Adrian Hennah.
This award will vest if he remains in continuousemployment until15 June 2009.
ServiceContracts All appointments of executive directors are intended to have twelve month notice periods, but it is recognised that for some new appointments a longer period may initially be necessary for competitive reasons, reducing to twelve months thereafter.
Accordingly the Committee approved that, for the appointments of Adrian Hennah and David J. Illingworth, their notice periods on appointment would effectively be 24 months, reducing to 12 months onthe expiry of the initialterm.
Sir Christopher ODonnell, appointed to the Board of Directors in September 1992, has a service agreement nd dated January 1992 which expires on his 62 birthday in October 2008.
David J. Illingworth, appointed to the nd Board of Directors in February 2006, has a service agreement dated February 2006 which expires on his 62 birthday in 2015.
Adrian Hennah, appointed to the Board of Directors in June 2006, has a service agreement nd dated June 2006 which expires on his 62 birthday in 2019.
The service agreement for David J. Illingworth is terminable by the Company on not more than 24 months notice reducing to 12 months after the initial term.
Adrian Hennahs service agreement is terminable by the company on 12 months notice.
Under his service agreement, the earliest that such notice may be given by the Company is June 2007.
The service agreement for Sir Christopher ODonnell is terminable by the Company on 12 months notice The agreements are terminable by the executive director on six months notice.
There is no enhancement of termination rights on a change of control of the Group.
During 2006 termination of the contract by the Group, except for cause, would effectively entitle the executive directors to up to 24 months basic salary for David J. Illingworth and Adrian Hennah reducing to 12 months after the initial term and 12 months for Sir Christopher ODonnell, bonus at target of 50%, a contribution to reflect the loss of pension benefits, an amount to cover other benefits and a time apportionment of the 2004 senior executive share plans entitlement.
The Committee has determined to include the requirement for mitigation in the contracts of the executive directors appointed during the year.
Peter Hooley, whose service agreement was due to expire inJune 2008, retired inJune 2006.
External  Currently, none of the executive directors is a non-executive director of another company.
Such appointments would be subject to the approval of the Nominations Committee and are restricted to one appointment for each executive director.
All fees receivable by a  paid to the Company.
 Non-executive directors do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment.
Non-executive directors are normally appointed for three terms of three years terminable at will, without notice by either the Group or the director and without compensation.
The Chairman has a three month notice period.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Nominations Committee who aim to set fees that are competitive with other companies of equivalent size and complexity.
Non-executive directors are expected to accumulatea personal holdinginthe Companyequivalent to the annualbasic fee, withinthree years.
The Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and the Senior Independent Director receive an extra 7,500 for their additional responsibilities.
In 2006, Dr. Rolf Stomberg waived his extra fee entitlement due to him as SeniorIndependent Director.

This isincluded in the table above.
Christopher ODonnells salaries and fees includes 163,000 relating to a salary supplement as in April 2006 he opted out of the defined benefit pension plan for future service and elected to receive a non-pensionable, non-bonusable salary supplement.
Adrian Hennahs salaries and fees include 74,000 as he elected to receive a non-pensionable, non-bonusable salary supplement rather than join the defined contribution salary pension scheme.

An amount of 110,000 was provided under the US defined contribution arrangements for David J. Illingworth bringing his total benefit under the plan to 446,000.
The increase in the transfer values are as a result of a change in the underlyingfactors to reflect current market conditions, particularly allowing for the impact of increased longevity and lower gilt rates, the unwinding of the previous years salary increase within the definition of final pensionable salary and the increase in pension as a result of the salary increase granted during the year.
No amounts have been paid to third parties in respect of directors services and no excess retirement benefits or compensationhave been paid to past directors.
