AUDITED SECTIONS OF THE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The following sections of the Report have been audited: the Directors remuneration table, the sections on the long-term incentive plan and pension contributions, and the executive Directors pension table.
REMUNERATION AND CONFLICTS COMMITTEE The remuneration packages of individual executive Directors are determined by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee which comprises Charles Bailey as Chairman, Andrew Knight, Baron Lambert and James Leigh-Pemberton all of whom are considered by the Board to be independent, non-executive Directors.
Lord Rothschild, Duncan Budge and David Haysey liaise closely with the Committee, although they do not take part in any discussions relating to decisions on their own terms and conditions of employment.
Determination of the remuneration of the non-executive Directors, within the limits imposed by the Articles of Association, is the responsibility of the Board as a whole.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee is also responsible for the operation of the long-term incentive plan for executive Directors.
Remuneration Policy The Company complied in the year under review with the provisions relating to Remuneration Committees incorporated in the Combined Code issued in July 2003 the Code.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee aims to set executive remuneration at an appropriate level to attract, retain and motivate Directors of requisite calibre.
Any arrangements made to provide longer term incentives will aim to encourage and reward performance and to benefit shareholders.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee aims to compare remuneration packages of similar financial institutions to the Company and models its decisions on the median position of those institutions.
In setting policy and making decisions, the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee gives full consideration to the provisions on the design of performance-related remuneration set out in Schedule A of the Code.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Directors Remuneration Report 29 Directors Remuneration Directors remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2006 is shown below, with comparative figures for the previous year where applicable.
Comparative figures for the individual Directors emoluments are shown in brackets if they differ from the emoluments for the year ended 31 March 2006.
Basic Salary, Salary Supplements and Bonus Basic salaries for the executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee and the last review was at 31 March 2006.
For the current year, to 31 March 2007, Lord Rothschilds salary is 369,495 per annum 2005 6: 357,000 per annum, Duncan Budges salary is 271,688 per annum 2005 6: 262,500 per annum and David Hayseys salary is 207,000 2005 6: 200,000 annualised.
Lord Rothschild received a salary supplement of 20% of his basic salary with effect from 1 January 2006, amounting to 17,850 in the year ended 31 March 2006.
This is included in the salary figure disclosed above.
The supplement is equivalent to the value of his pension contributions foregone from that date on his electing to opt out from the Companys pension scheme following advice received ahead of the pension tax reforms that came into force on 6 April 2006.
The salary supplement shall continue to be paid at the same rate in future.
For similar reasons, Mr Budge elected for the Group to cease making contributions on his behalf into the defined benefit section of the RITCP Pension RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 30 Directors Remuneration Report and Life Assurance Scheme, with effect from 6 April 2006.
From that date Mr Budge has received a salary supplement equivalent to 42% of his basic salary.
The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, has adopted an Executive Bonus Plan.
The Plan provides that each executive Director, and such other participants as may be determined by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, shall be entitled to an annual bonus.
The amount payable under the Executive Bonus Plan is calculated by reference to the Companys three-year moving average outperformance over the three most relevant total return indices.
The indices are currently the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index, the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return Index expressed in Sterling.
The percentage of salary payable as a bonus rises on a straight line basis from 0% to 100%, if the average annual outperformance is between 0% and 7%.
Thereafter, the percentage of salary payable as a bonus rises from 100% in a straight line to the maximum bonus payable under the Plan of 125%, if the average annual outperformance is between 7% and 10%.
The bonuses payable under the Plan to Lord Rothschild and Mr Budge in respect of the year ended 31 March 2006 amounted to 422,050 year ended 31 March 2005: 425,000 and 310,350 year ended 31 March 2005: 312,500 respectively.
The bonus payable under the Plan to Mr Haysey in respect of the year ended 31 March 2006 amounted to 137,950, reflecting the fact that Mr Haysey joined the Company on 30 August 2005.
In addition to the bonus entitlements under the Executive Bonus Plan, Lord Rothschild and Mr Budge both received a 1,000 bonus which was paid to the Groups employees in December 2005 year ended 31 March 2005: 900.
Mr Haysey, having been appointed during the year, received a bonus of 500 in December 2005.
Mr Haysey was also entitled to a bonus of 141,100 in respect of the performance in the period to 31 March 2006 of a portfolio of global equities managed by him for the Company.
His entitlement is calculated on the same basis as the Executive Bonus Plan outlined above, with the exception that it is calculated by reference to the performance of the portfolio against the three indices since the date on which he began managing the portfolio, rather than the three-year moving average.
This entitlement has also been adjusted to reflect the fact that Mr Haysey joined the Company on 30 August 2005.
In future, Mr Hayseys entitlement will be calculated by reference to the annual performance of these indices.
Long-term Incentive Plan The adoption of a Share Appreciation Rights plan the SAR Plan was approved by shareholders on 10 July 1996, as it constituted a related party transaction under Stock Exchange rules, given the participations of Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge.
Under the SAR Plan, participants are entitled to elect to receive a cash bonus.
The amount of the bonus will represent the increase, since the date of grant, in the Companys share price multiplied by the notional number of shares.
This is, however, conditional on any increase in the share price, plus dividends paid, exceeding the increase in the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum for any three year period between the date of grant and the tenth anniversary thereof.
The Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, resolved in March 2005 that the performance condition relating to any further grants after that date under the SAR Plan shall apply only to the fixed three year period from the date of grant.
As at 31 March 2006 the amount accrued in respect of the SAR Plan participations of the Companys executive Directors was 2,137,531 31 March 2005: 6,811,604.
The lowest closing price of the Companys shares during the year was 686.5p and the highest was 1035p.
Should a participant leave his employment involuntarily at any time, the bonus accrued to the relevant date will be payable, subject to there being no grounds for non-payment arising out of negligence or other misconduct.

RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 32 Directors Remuneration Report Performance Graph In accordance with the regulations made under the Companies Act 1985, it is necessary to include a performance graph which measures the Companys total shareholder return calculated by reference to the Companys share price, including dividend reinvestment against that of a broad equity market index.
For this purpose the Committee considers that the Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return Index in Sterling, the FTSE AllShare Total Return Index and the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index are the most suitable indices for comparative purposes.
The graph below therefore compares the Companys total shareholder return to that of these three indices over the last 5 years.

Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge are members of the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, the RITCP Scheme.
However, on their receiving advice ahead of the implementation of new pensions legislation in April 2006, contributions to the Scheme on their behalf ceased with effect from 31 December 2005 and 6 April 2006 respectively.
Within the RITCP Scheme, money purchase arrangements are in place for Lord Rothschild, to which the Company contributed at the rate of 20% of basic salary, until 31 December 2005.
Such contributions amounted to 53,550 during the year under review year ended 31 March 2005: 68,000.
