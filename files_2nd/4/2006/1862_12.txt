Dividend in specie 320.0 Net cash inflow arising on disposal: In the period since acquisition to 31 December 2006 or the point of disposal demerger where applicable, the revenue from acquisitions was Cash consideration received 36.1 million and profit for the year was 6.2 million.

The impact of Fiberweb on the Groups results and cash flows in the current and prior periods is disclosed in note 5.
If the acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2006, total revenue for the period from acquisitions would have been 44.5 million, Becorit and profit for the year would have been 7.9 million.
As referred to in note 5, on 1 December 2006 the Group disposed of its interest in Becorit GmbH.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability arising from the expansion of the Groups FBO network, The net assets of Becorit at the date of disposal and at 31 December 2005 were as follows: 1 December the integration of new products into our Component Repair and Overhaul portfolio, together with anticipated future operating synergies.
Contingent assets and liabilities Inventories 2.5 2.9 The Group is party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business, including specific product liability and Trade and other receivables 2.5 1.9 environmental claims in BBA Nonwovens North America and BBA Aviation respectively.
Any liabilities are likely to be mitigated by legal Cash and cash equivalents 1.0 0.4 defences, insurance, reserves and third party indemnities.
Deferred tax assets 2.2 2.2 Additionally, the Group has previously owned businesses that manufactured products containing asbestos.
No BBA company has Trade and other payables 1.7 1.6 manufactured or sold any products or materials containing asbestos for many years.
A small number of former BBA companies have been Retirement benefit obligations 4.3 4.1 named as defendants to asbestos related claims.
When these companies were sold, BBA retained certain obligations to indemnify the 10.0 10.1 purchasers against such claims.
Notwithstanding such indemnity arrangements, the costs incurred by BBA in dealing with claims made against these former BBA companies have been immaterial to BBA.
During the period 1989 to 31 December 2006, BBAs costs of defending Other effects 1 1.3 and disposing of all asbestos related claims, net of insurance coverage, were approximately 4.7 million.
BBA maintains a portfolio of insurance Gain on disposal 16.5 coverage in respect of the majority of such claims, including legal defence costs and liability cover.
State operated compensation programmes have also provided coverage.
On the basis of its past claims experience, BBA does not anticipate any material increase in the cost to it of Total consideration 27.8 resolving such claims.
Satisfied by: The directors do not currently anticipate that the outcome of the proceedings and claims set out above either individually, or in aggregate, Cash 27.8 will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
Deferred consideration Following the authorisation of the US Department of Transport to provide reimbursement of up to 8 million to fixed-based general aviation 27.8 operators and others at five metropolitan Washington DC area airports and the issue of the proposed rules of eligibility for reimbursement Net cash inflow arising on disposal: in October 2006, management consider that the receipt in 2007 of compensation following the closure of Washington Reagan National Cash consideration received 27.8 Airport in 2001 is probable.
Whilst we believe that a significant proportion of the 8 million compensation should be due to BBA as our base Cash and cash equivalents disposed of 1.0 at Washington Reagan took the majority of business aviation traffic in the Washington DC area, it is not practicable to estimate accurately a specific amount.
26.8 Note: 1 Other effects include costs of disposal, tax and the recycling of foreign currency translation on disposal.
