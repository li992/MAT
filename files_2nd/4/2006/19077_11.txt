Minerva plc Annual report and accounts 2006 27 Remuneration report The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee, as constituted by the Board, is responsible for the determination of the remuneration, including the grant of share-based incentives, of the executive Directors of Minerva plc.
The Committee comprises three non-executive Directors of the Company, Christopher Sheridan Chairman of the Committee, Clive Richards and Christopher Mackenzie.
Christopher Mackenzie was appointed to the Committee on 1 September 2005.
All three Committee members are independent Directors.
Members of the Committee have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the outcome of the decisions taken by the Committee.
The Committee met six times during the year.
During the year, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP were appointed by the Committee to provide advice in relation to the Companys 2005 Executive Incentive Plan.
The Company Secretary has provided administrative support to the Committee.
Remuneration policy The remuneration policy is designed to motivate, reward and retain executives of the highest calibre in a way which is consistent with their contribution to the success of the Company, whilst aligning their rewards and incentives directly with the performance and growth of the Company.
The Committee considers discretionary bonuses and equity based long-term incentives to be the most effective mechanism of aligning the interests of the executive Directors with shareholders.
The remuneration packages currently comprise: Basic salaries and benefits Basic salaries and benefits are reviewed by the Committee having regard to a number of factors, including the responsibility and performance of the individual and competitive market practice.
Benefits to each Director principally include the provision of a company car, medical insurance and life assurance cover.
In addition, contributions to a defined contribution pension scheme, based solely on basic salary, were made or have been accrued in respect of all executive Directors.
Performance-related bonus Bonuses are awarded by the Committee having regard to a number of factors, including the performance of the Company and the performance of the individual.
Individual performance is measured by the achievement of strategic and personal objectives, including, but not limited to: identification and investment in suitable new opportunities: preparation for and attainment of planning consent: delivery of development programmes: portfolio investment performance: and capital structure and funding.
Annual bonus awards are capped at 150% of base salary.
Share incentives Awards of share-based incentives are considered by the Committee annually.
Following advice from its advisers, the Committee decided that share based incentives for Directors and senior employees should take the form of share awards rather than options.
As a result, the Minerva plc 2005 Executive Incentive Plan the EIP was put to and approved by the Companys shareholders at last years Annual General Meeting.
Following the approval and adoption of the EIP no further options will be granted under the Companys Executive Share Option Schemes.
Awards continue to be based on the individuals performance, position and responsibilities.
The vesting of awards is subject to demanding performance conditions which include, where applicable, a comparison against a peer group of other comparable quoted companies in the FTSE Real Estate Sector excluding agents.
The Committee consults with the Chief Executive, as appropriate, with regard to its proposals for the remuneration of the executive Directors and other senior employees.

Minerva plc Annual report and accounts 2006 29 Employee share incentives The Group currently operates three types of share plans: the EIP, the Executive Share Option Schemes and the Sharesave Scheme.
During the year, conditional awards have been granted under the EIP and options were granted pursuant to the Sharesave Scheme.
No options were granted under the Executive Share Option Schemes.
The Company will not make any further grants of options under the Executive Share Option Schemes.
None of the terms of the EIP, the Executive Share Option Schemes or the Sharesave Scheme were varied during the year.
2005 Executive Incentive Plan Participation in the EIP is available to executive Directors and senior employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The EIP was adopted on 25 November 2005 and is comprised of two parts.
The first part provides for the Company to grant participants a conditional right or an option with a nominal value exercise price to acquire Matching Shares over a number of shares in the Company linked to the number of shares purchased by the participant from his annual bonus.
The second part allows the Company to grant participants a conditional right to acquire performance shares or an option with a nominal value exercise price which is not linked to the co-investment in Company shares by the participant.
The vesting of awards of Matching Shares or conditional rights to acquire shares will be subject to a three year condition which will compare the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance with the TSR of the companies in the comparator group as follows: Ranking of the Company within the Comparator Group Proportion of Matching Shares which vest Within the top 20% of companies 100% Between the median company and the top 20% of companies Pro-rata on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% Median company 25% Below the median company Nil The TSR measure was chosen as it is well understood by the business and is a transparent measure that acts to align the interests of the participants with the interests of the Companys shareholders.
The Comparator Group is such group of listed companies as the Committee may from time to time select at the time each award is made initially to comprise companies in the FTSE All Share Estate Index at the date of grant, excluding agents.
The Company considers that this index is the Companys closest and most appropriate comparator group.
The Committee will decide how to treat any companies that leave the Comparator Group based on the circumstances prevailing at the time.
In addition, the Committee will have the power to scale back the vesting of awards where, in its reasonable opinion, there has not been satisfactory financial performance of the Company over the performance period.
Executive Share Option Schemes The Executive Share Option Schemes have been operated for executive Directors and senior management.
Until November 2001, executive Directors and senior management were granted share options under the Companys 1996 Share Option Schemes.
The 1996 Share Option Schemes were adopted in November 1996 and comprise an Approved Scheme which was the subject of H. M. Revenue and Customs approval, and an Unapproved Scheme.
The performance criterion required under the 1996 Approved Scheme is that the increase in the share price of the Company is greater than or equal to the increase in the Retail Price Index at any time following the third anniversary of the grant of the option.
The performance criterion required under the 1996 Unapproved Scheme is that the growth in the share price of the Company at any time following the third anniversary of the grant of the option places the Company in the top quartile of a peer group of quoted property companies.
When these share price based performance conditions were set in 1996 the Committee believed that they best aligned the Companys business strategy at that time with shareholders interests.
The 2001 Discretionary Share Option Scheme, which was approved by shareholders in November 2001, has two parts, an H. M. Revenue and Customs approved part and an unapproved part.
Options under the Discretionary Scheme are subject to a performance condition which ranks the Companys total shareholder return share price growth and reinvested dividends over a period of three years against a periodically reviewed peer group of quoted property companies and the following targets apply: Proportion of options Ranking in peer group exercisable Upper quartile All Median One third Below median Nil Minerva plc Annual report and accounts 2006 30 Remuneration report continued For performance between median and upper quartile the number of shares under option will become exercisable on a pro-rated basis.
If the performance condition is not met in full after three years, it will be retested at the end of the fourth and fifth years and to the extent the condition has not been met by the end of the fifth year, the relevant options will lapse.
With the exception of the Sharesave Scheme, all share options are granted with an exercise price set at the prevailing market value.
The Committee believes that this performance condition is appropriate and demanding, as the measure is considered an effective way of aligning the interests of management and shareholders, with share options only being exercisable in full following upper quartile total shareholder return performance.
Under the rules, the performance conditions, including the comparable quoted companies in the FTSE Real Estate Sector, may be amended by the Committee to ensure they remain appropriate.
Since the peer group in respect of the 1996 Unapproved Scheme was established, a number of companies in the group have ceased to be quoted and have therefore been removed.
In respect of the original peer group for options granted under the 2001 Discretionary Share Option Scheme, Grantchester Holdings PLC, Benchmark Group PLC, Chelsfield PLC and Pillar Property PLC have been acquired and are no longer quoted companies.
To ensure that the peer group continues to comprise an appropriate number of comparable companies, the Committee has set up a reserve list of companies which can be substituted for companies in the original Group that are taken over and or cease to be quoted during the performance period.
All Employee Sharesave Scheme The Company has operated an H. M. Revenue and Customs approved Sharesave Scheme since 2002.
All eligible employees of participating group companies may participate in the Sharesave Scheme.
The Scheme offers employees the opportunity to save up to a maximum of 250 each month with a selected bank or building society over a three or five year period.
At the end of three or five years, employees may use their savings, plus a tax-free bonus to exercise an option to buy a certain number of shares in the Company at up to a 20 per cent discount to the share price shortly before they started saving.
Options granted to executive Directors and others under the Sharesave Scheme are not subject to performance conditions.
Total shareholder return performance The total shareholder return to the members of the Company, calculated by reference to share price growth plus reinvested dividends, relative to the FTSE All-Share Real Estate Index for each of the last five financial years, is illustrated graphically by the following chart: 240 Minerva 220 FTSE All-Share Real Estate 200 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 30 06 01 30 06 02 30 06 03 30 06 04 30 06 05 30 06 06 Source: Datastream The Company is a constituent of the FTSE All-Share Real Estate Index and, therefore, the Committee considers this to be the most appropriate broad market equity index for illustrating the Companys performance.
Scheme A: Approved 1996 Share Option Scheme.
Scheme B: Unapproved 1996 Share Option Scheme.
Scheme C: 2001 Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
The market value of a share in the Company on the date of the exercise of options by Ivan Ezekiel and Tim Garnham, as shown in the tables above, was 258 pence.
Awards under the EIP were granted on 1 December 2005.
The mid-market price of the Companys shares on the London Stock Exchange at 30 June 2006 was 255 pence per share.
During the year the share price ranged from 218.25 pence to 343 pence.
No consideration was paid for the grant of any option or award.
