Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 45 Governance Directors remuneration report continued Directors service agreements and letters of engagement A new model service contract was approved by the committee in 2004.
All current executive directors have signed the model contract and, accordingly, service agreements for all executive directors have notice periods of 12 months.
They also provide for a maximum damages payment in the case of redundancy or termination in breach of the agreement by the company of up to 175% of base salary which was calculated as a conservative pre-estimate of the value of salary, xed benets and on target bonus.
The reference to 175% is a cap and any damages payments will not be made automatically but will be subject to both phasing and mitigation unless, in the circumstances, the committee considers it appropriate to achieve a clean break through payment of a lump sum in which case it will require some discount for early payment.
Contracts also permit the committee to take into account a view of the extent of poor performance on the part of the executive director.
Any payment will not include amounts in respect of awards which have been made under the companys LTIPs over which the committee retains discretion.
There are no specic contractual payments or benets which would be triggered in the event of a change in control of the company.
The committee believes that the contracts provide as much scope as is feasible to protect the interests of shareholders when negotiating a termination, at which time it would address the duty of mitigation.
The service contract for Rachel Brydon Jannetta, who is based in the US and employed by a US subsidiary, is in the same format as for other executive directors but modied to reect prevailing US employment legislation.
The dates of the current executive directors agreements, the dates on which their appointments became effective and the current expiry dates of their agreements are as follows: Executive directors Date of agreement Effective date Expiry date Martin Bettington 10 June 2004 10 June 2004 Terminable on 12 months notice Rachel Brydon Jannetta 30 June 2004 1 September 2004 Terminable on 12 months notice Colin Matthews 3 June 2004 6 September 2004 Terminable on 12 months notice Michael McKeon 6 December 2005 13 December 2005 Terminable on 12 months notice Tony Wray 19 January 2005 7 March 2005 Terminable on 12 months notice Colin Matthews and Michael McKeon are the subject of reappointment as executive directors at the forthcoming AGM.
Details for the executive director who retired from the board during the year are as follows: Executive director Date of agreement Effective date Expiry date Mark Wilson 5 May 2004 1 September 2004 Terminated on 31 December 2005 Mark Wilson retired from the board on 13 December 2005 and his employment was terminated, by mutual consent, on 31 December 2005, with the original decision to terminate having been announced in July 2005.
Mark agreed to remain actively employed while a successor was found and he remained in full time employment until 31 December 2005 and received a bonus pro-rated for the period employed.
46 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Governance His termination package, therefore, reected loss of earnings under the contract for the balance of the notice period approximately five months.
In view of his continued commitment over this period, the committee agreed to pay his termination payment on a lump sum basis rather than on a phased monthly basis but reduced the payment by 10% to reect mitigation.
Further, given that Mark worked for a majority of his notice period, the committee concluded, in the circumstances, that it should treat him as a good leaver under the LTIP in respect of the 2003 and 2004 awards so the awards would continue to normal maturity with the performance conditions assessed at that time, although the committee may conclude that it is not necessary to then reduce the 2004 award on a pro-rata basis.
There will be no pro-rating of the 2003 award in any event.
However, given the period between his departure and the making of the 2005 award, the committee did not exercise its discretion and that award lapsed on his departure.
Payments to Mark, are detailed in the table of Directors emoluments on page 48.
He received a total termination payment of 299,095 as disclosed in that table.
No cash contribution to his pension scheme was required.
No further payments in terms of salary, pay in lieu of notice, bonus or benets in kind were or will be made.
He has no further contractual or consultancy arrangements with the company and has no personal interest in the company other than as a deferred pension scheme member and as a shareholder.
