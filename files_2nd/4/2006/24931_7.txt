2 Sir John Bond and A W Jebson retired as employees on 31 May 2006.
The accrued annual pension at 31 December 2006 is the same amount as was put into payment on 31 May 2006 following their retirement.
Sir John Bond elected to receive a lump sum payment on his retirement, as allowed under the rules of the HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme.
The accrued pension at 31 December 2006 for Sir John Bond is therefore lower than would have been the case had he not opted to receive a lump sum payment.
3 The increase in accrued pension during 2006 has been calculated as the difference between the accrued pension as at 31 December 2006 ignoring the reduction to the accrued pension due to the exchange of some pension for a lump sum payment on retirement and the accrued pension as at 31 December 2005.
The actual post commutation pension in payment at the year end is lower than the accrued pension at the start of the year due to the exchange of pension for a lump sum payment on retirement.
4 As noted above, on 31 March 2006 M F Geoghegan ceased membership of, and the accrual of benefits under, the HSBC International Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme.
As required by the rules of the HSBC International Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme, M F Geoghegan made personal contributions towards his pension of 4,308 in respect of 2006.
At 31 December 2005 M F Geoghegan was entitled to a pension of 557,000 per annum and at 31 March 2006 he was entitled to a pension of 571,000 per annum, an increase in accrued pension entitlement during the period of 14,000 per annum 10,000 per annum excluding any increase for inflation.
The increase in the transfer value of the accrued pension less personal contributions from 31 December 2005 to 31 March 2006 was 419,000.
The transfer value less personal contributions at 31 March 2006 relating to the increase in accrued pension during 2006, excluding any increase for inflation, was 216,000.
M F Geoghegan transferred all his benefits out of the HSBC International Staff Benefits Retirement Scheme on 31 March 2006 with a transfer payment from the Scheme of 12,918,000 into the HSBC Asia Holdings Pension Plan on a defined contribution basis.
There were no pension liabilities under the HSBC International Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme for M F Geoghegan at 31 December 2006.

A benchmark for HSBC Holdings TSR, weighted by market capitalisation, was established which takes account of the TSR performance of: 1 a peer group of nine banks weighted by market capitalisation which were considered most relevant to HSBC in terms of size and international scope.
For performance periods up to and including the one beginning in 2003, this group comprised ABN AMRO Holding N. V. The Bank of East Asia, Limited, Citigroup Inc. Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Lloyds TSB Group plc, Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group Inc. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited and Standard Chartered PLC.
To be more relevant to HSBC in terms of size and international scope, this peer group was amended for conditional awards made in 2004 by the replacement of Lloyds TSB Group plc, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd. Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group Inc. and The Bank of East Asia, Limited with Bank of America Corporation, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, Banco Santander Central Hispano S. A. and UBS AG: 2 the five largest banks from each of the US, the UK, continental Europe and the Far East, other than any within 1 above, weighted by market capitalisation: and 3 the banking sector of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index, excluding any within 1 or 2 above, weighted by market capitalisation.
By combining the weighted average TSR for each of the above three groups and weighting that average so that 50 per cent is applied to 1, 25 per cent is applied to 2 and 25 per cent is applied to 3, a single TSR benchmark for market comparison was determined.
The benchmark was chosen to reward the delivery of sustained financial growth of HSBC Holdings and to align the interests of participants with those of shareholders.
The extent to which each award will vest will be determined by reference to HSBC Holdings TSR measured against the TSR benchmark.
If HSBC Holdings TSR over the performance period exceeds the benchmark TSR, awards with a value, at the date of grant, of up to 100 per cent of the individuals earnings base salary and bonus in respect of the previous performance year, will vest.
For higher value awards, the greater of 50 per cent of the award or the number of shares equating at the date of grant to 100 per cent of the individuals earnings, will vest at this level of performance.
If HSBC Holdings TSR over the performance period places it within the upper quartile of the ranked list of the banks comprising the benchmark, these higher value awards will vest in full.
For performance between the median and the upper quartile, vesting will be on a straight-line basis.
If the upper quartile performance level is achieved at the third anniversary of the date of award then an additional award equal to 20 per cent of the initial Performance Share award will be made and will vest at the same time as the original award to which it relates.
1 Includes additional shares arising from scrip dividends.
2 The performance tests set out above were met in 2004 and the shares have vested.
At the date of vesting, 13 March 2006, the market value per share was 9.925.
The market value per share at the date of the award, 12 March 2001, was 8.62.
3 Retired as a Director on 26 May 2006.
The awards held at the date of retirement that had passed the performance condition set out above vested immediately.
Consequently, the 2002 awards were released to Sir John Bond on 14 June 2006 when the market value per share was 9.31 and to A W Jebson on 30 June 2006 when the market value per share was 9.515.
The market value per share at the date of the award, 8 March 2002, was 8.34.
4 In line with the previous practice for executives who had worked significantly beyond retirement age, and where the awards had passed the performance condition at the time of originally planned retirement, the Remuneration Committee agreed that the Performance Share awards held by Sir John Bond at retirement should vest in full without time prorating.
Consequently, the 2003 award vested on 14 June 2006 when the market value per share was 9.31.
The 2004 award vested in two tranches: the first on 16 June 2006 200,000 shares when the market value per share was 9.37: and the second on 31 July 2006 73,058 shares when the market value per share was 9.71.
The market values per share at the dates of the awards, 5 March 2003 and 4 March 2004, were 6.70 and 8.515 respectively.
5 Interests at date of retirement as a Director 26 May 2006.
On behalf of the Board 5 March 2007 Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, Chairman of Remuneration Committee 289
