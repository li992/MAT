Directors contributions were made in August and September 2005.
From October 2005, in common with other UK employees participating in the relevant pension schemes, these directors ceased making personal contributions.
Their salaries were reduced by an amount equal to their previous pension contributions and the Company commenced paying the same amount directly to the pension schemes.
The benefits provided under the relevant pension schemes were not affected by this change.
Separately, as described in note 2 on page 42, additional pension benefits were provided to Mr Thomson following his waiver of a further 176,461 of salary.
Transfer values of the accrued benefits have been calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance GN11, and represent the amount that the pension scheme would pay to another pension provider if the member elects to transfer all of his benefits out of the scheme.
The transfer values do not represent sums payable or due to the individual directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.

At the end of a three year period, if the Director is still in office, he can exercise an option granted to him over matching shares, in respect of any shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares awarded was determined by the Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus was earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
