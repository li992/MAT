93 ITV plc Report and accounts 2006 Remuneration report The Remuneration Committee is comprised entirely of independent non-executive directors.
The Committee is governed by formal terms of reference available at www.
com, and meets as required and at least twice during the year.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the remuneration policy for the Executive Chairman, executive directors and senior executives of the Company.
The Committee also has responsibility for the Companys performance related pay schemes and share incentive plans, and the levels of awards made under them as they apply to the senior executives.
During 2006, the Remuneration Committee comprised the following members: Sir George Russell Chairman until 15 January 2007 Sir Robert Phillis appointed Chairman on 15 January 2007 Sir Brian Pitman Sir James Crosby was appointed as a member of the Remuneration Committee on 19 February 2007.
During 2006, certain executives were invited to attend meetings of the Committee to provide support or to advise on policy for executive remuneration, except when matters relating to their own remuneration were discussed.
The Executive Chairman and Chief Operating Officer and Finance Director may attend by invitation.
External advisers to the Committee may be invited to attend where appropriate.
No individual is involved in decisions relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee has appointed Deloitte and Touche LLP Deloitte as external independent advisers.
In addition, Deloitte provided the Group with tax and corporate finance advice under separate engagement terms.
Advice on legal matters is provided by Lovells.
The Committees internal advisers are the Group Human Resources Director and the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy The Board is committed to building the most appropriate remuneration policy for the Company.
In doing this the Remuneration Committee has designed a remuneration policy which is intended to address the Companys operational requirements while taking into account prevailing best practice.
The remuneration policy is based on the following key principles: To provide competitive total remuneration opportunities which will attract, retain and reward the best executive talent necessary to drive the Companys future in the highly competitive media market.
This must respond to the pressures that the Company faces from other commercial and publicly owned broadcasters and producers.
The majority of total long term remuneration for all senior executives should be tied to the achievement of specific stretching performance conditions and objectives which align executive remuneration with shareholders interests.
The share incentive schemes encourage executives to adopt the attitude of owners and true entrepreneurs and build up meaningful and substantial shareholdings in the Company.
Performance should be measured over clearly specified, varying time horizons i. e. short, medium and long term.
Individuals should be rewarded for success, and steps should be taken, within contractual obligations, to minimise rewards for failure.
Payments to directors on termination will only reflect contractual obligations.
The Committee should take its decisions being fully aware of the wider context in the Group as a whole, and as part of this process, the Group Human Resources Director, as the Committees main internal adviser, provides updates on wider remuneration, employee relations and human resource issues in ITV.
Updates on the external remuneration environment are provided by Deloitte.
A remuneration policy needs to evolve over time to adapt to commercial demands, changing market practice and shareholder expectations.
Investors will be consulted about any key issues that arise and be provided with the opportunity to endorse the Companys remuneration policies on a regular basis through the vote on the Remuneration report.
Components of reward The reward package for senior members of staff consists of a combination of incentive schemes intended to provide motivation and reward for short, medium and long term performance and to retain the necessary talent over the longer term.
Each component is intended to fulfil a different function within the remuneration framework.
Salary and approach to competitive positioning Market positioning of salary and other elements of reward is approached on an individual by individual basis.
The aim is to identify the most appropriate competitive positioning for each role and for the individuals best capable of filling it.
Short term and deferral incentives Annual incentives are provided for the most senior executives and other key management talent through the Deferred Share Award Plan DSA.
50% of any pre-tax bonus entitlement will automatically be deferred into shares under the DSA and deferred awards to executive directors will vest after 12 and 24 months from the end of the financial year to which the bonus relates.
Participants may elect to take the balance of the bonus in cash or awards under the DSA.
Awards made under the DSA, as well as any cash bonus payments, will be based on the achievement of a combination of corporate, specific business and individual targets which are all measures closely related to shareholder value creation.
For 2007 the corporate element includes demanding targets based on profit, revenues and share of commercial impacts.
For the executive directors, the targets will be weighted towards corporate performance.
The total annual bonus opportunity including awards made under the DSA for executive directors will not normally exceed 150% of a participants annual salary.
Long term incentive plans The Committee keeps the Companys long term incentive plans under regular review to ensure they remain appropriate, are fulfilling their objectives and the performance conditions continue to represent the best way to drive the creation of value in line with shareholders interests.
Long term incentive arrangements for 2006 The Performance Share Plan PSP has been used as the main long term incentive.
The Total Shareholder Return TSR performance conditions applying to PSP awards are described below.
The maximum award that can be made under the PSP is 150% of salary in respect of any financial year.
Vesting of awards made during the year will be dependent on the TSR performance of the Company, against the customised FTSE 100 comparator group described below over a three-year period.
There is no vesting for performance below median.
35% of the award vests at median and 100% at upper quartile.
Vesting will occur on a straight line basis between these points.
94 ITV plc Report and accounts 2006 Governance Remuneration report Long term scheme requiring capital commitment The Commitment Scheme requires invitees to commit and retain a significant amount of capital in the form of ITV plc shares in essence, participants are encouraged to adopt the attitudes of owners and commit their own funds.
Under the Commitment Scheme, participants must commit and retain shares of up to a maximum value of 100% of salary at the date of commitment although an exceptional limit may apply in some circumstances.
A matching award will be granted, composed of an award of a nil cost option and a market value option to acquire an equal number of shares.
The maximum matching award can be over no more than three times the number of committed shares for each component part of the matching award.
For awards made in 2006 vesting of the matching award will be dependent on TSR performance of the Company, against the customised FTSE 100 comparator group described below.
25% of the award vests at median and 100% at upper quartile.
Awards will vest on a sliding scale between these points.
Up to 50% of the matching awards will vest at the third anniversary of the date of grant subject to performance and the remainder at the fourth anniversary.
Any portion of the award that has not vested at the end of the relevant performance period will lapse.
In the event of a change of control, awards may vest based on the extent to which the performance condition has been met in the period since the awards were made, unless it is determined that exceptional financial circumstances have occurred.
The level of performance related payout in the event of a change of control is capped at a multiple of the original financial amount a participant invests twice investment if a change of control occurs in the first year, three times if it occurs during the second year and four times if change of control occurs in the third or fourth year.
Turnaround Incentive Award for the Executive Chairman In order to facilitate the appointment of the Executive Chairman a one-off turnaround incentive award will be made to provide a long term incentive opportunity.
The award will operate over a five-year time horizon.
The award will be made over free shares with vesting conditional on meeting performance criteria.
Shares with a face value equal to 6 million will be awarded equivalent to an award of 150% of initial salary per annum over the five-year performance period.
The Executive Chairman will be required to commit and hold shares in ITV plc with a value of 100% of his salary as at the date of appointment.
Shares will vest subject to performance, 50% of awards being subject to relative TSR and 50% related to specific turnaround objectives and the creation of shareholder value during the transitional digital switch over period to 2012.
25% of the maximum award will vest for threshold performance and 100% for achieving the maximum target in each case.
The specific turnaround measures that will apply are as follows: ITV family SOCI target of 38.5% will trigger full vesting threshold vesting level at 36.6%.
Revenue Growth target of 5% per annum will trigger full vesting threshold vesting level at 2% per annum.
EPS target of 12p will trigger full vesting threshold vesting level at 8p.
Share Price target of 2.25 will trigger full vesting threshold vesting level at 1.35.
The TSR condition that will apply is consistent with that described below for other ITV schemes.
In respect of all these measures, vesting will operate on a sliding scale basis between threshold and maximum performance.
Up to 25% of the total award i. e. 50% of the TSR part may vest following the third anniversary of award if the TSR condition is satisfied at this time.
Turnaround Plan for other executives Following the appointment of the Executive Chairman, the Committee consider it is appropriate that other executive directors and a few key senior executives should be incentivised on a consistent basis aligned with the key indicators of shareholder value creation over the period to 2012 digital switchover.
A new long term incentive plan has therefore been proposed, consistent with the principles and performance measures to be established by the award made to the Executive Chairman.
Awards will be made under this plan in the 2007 financial year subject to shareholder approval of the plan at the Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2007.
Further details in relation to the plan are provided in the Notice of the 2007 Annual General Meeting.
Awards under the PSP and Commitment Scheme will not be made to an individual within two years of an award under the plan following shareholder approval.
TSR performance conditions for long term incentive plans All current long term incentive awards, i. e. those made under the PSP or under the Commitment Scheme are subject to a performance condition that measures the Companys relative TSR performance against a comparator group, which the Committee has considered to be the most appropriate measure of the creation and maintenance of shareholder value.
The effectiveness of this measure depends on the appropriateness of the comparator group.
The Committee has identified the following criteria for the selection of comparator companies: the performance of the companies should be driven by similar macro-economic factors as the Company and, particularly given the widespread participation in plans dependent on TSR within the Company, any comparator group must be meaningful, for both investors and participants: the group should be of a sufficient size to accommodate fide-listings and mergers that may occur within the comparator group and to ensure that the vesting schedule does not result in large increases in vesting for small changes in rank: and it should be easy to identify the appropriate comparators at any point in time on an objective basis.
Given these criteria, the comparator group for the Companys TSR based plans is a customised FTSE 100 group, excluding those sectors which do not provide a benchmark of performance that would be relevant to the Company.
For awards made in 2004 and 2005 the companies in the comparator group consist of the FTSE 100 constituents at the date of award from the following sectors: Media and Entertainment, Telecom Services, Support Services, General Retailers, Transport, Beverages and Leisure and Hotels.
Following the FTSE reclassification of the sector lists effective 1 January 2006 the Committee had to revise the sectors from which the comparator group is comprised.
Following the same principles, the comparator companies for awards made in 2006 are selected from the FTSE 100 constituents of the following sectors: Media, Fixed Line Telecommunications, Mobile Telecommunications, Support Services, General Industry, General Retailers, Travel and Leisure and Beverages.
95 ITV plc Report and accounts 2006 Details of the comparator companies for individual awards can be found on page 98.
Both the PSP and the Commitment Scheme provide for a reduction of the vesting result produced from the TSR calculation if the Committee consider that exceptional circumstances have prevailed, including failure to achieve real earnings per share growth over the performance period.
The performance condition applicable to awards made under the Granada Commitment Scheme is TSR relative to Granadas international media comparator group companies as set out on page 99 in relation to share option schemes.
25% of awards vest at median: full vesting occurs at upper decile.
Up to 50% of these awards were capable of vesting after two years, with the remainder subject to performance over a four-year period Performance graph The graphs below show the TSR performance of the Company against the FTSE 100 index.
The FTSE 100 has been selected for comparison as it represents a broad equity market index of which the Company was a member during the full financial year.

Prior to the listing of ITV plc the graph tracks the performance of a synthetic stock which shows the combined TSR performance of Granada and Carlton, weighted on the basis of their respective market capitalisation at 16 October 2002.
The Companys TSR performance over the financial year 2006 ranked the Company 32nd against the 35 companies in the peer group.
This is significantly below the median position required for any vesting under the long term incentive plans.

The graph therefore shows TSR performance over a five-year period to present, with the performance of Granada and Carlton shown separately prior to the listing of ITV plc.
The TSR holdings have been rebased to 100 at the date of listing to reflect the requirement to show performance from this date onwards.
In both graphs one-month averaging has been applied throughout, with the exception of the month following the merger.
To ensure that the portion of the graph from the date of listing reflects solely the performance of the Company, the data for the Company in this period has been averaged from 2 February 2004 to each date, with the effect that the averaging period lengthens until it reaches one month.
Service contracts The executive directors of ITV plc have service contracts which provide for 12 months notice on either side.
Michael Grade was appointed as Executive Chairman with effect from 8 January 2007.
As with other executive directors, his contract provides for 12 months notice on either side.
However, as a condition agreed on appointment, notice may not be served during the first 12 months of employment.
In the event that his employment is terminated during the first 24 months of employment, he would be entitled to receive payment in lieu of notice basic salary and pension and a guaranteed annual bonus of 75% of salary in respect of the balance of the period.
Unless the Remuneration Committee decides otherwise, any payment made in lieu of notice other than on a change of control will be phased over the balance of the applicable notice period that would otherwise have applied.
During the year John Cresswell was appointed acting Chief Executive from 1 October 2006, in addition to his role as Finance Director.
Following the appointment of the Executive Chairman, from 8 January 2007 John Cresswell has held the role of Chief Operating Officer and Finance Director.

Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
No directors were members of money purchase schemes operated by the Group.
Notes 1 Charles Allen resigned as a director on 1 October 2006, although he was an active member of the pension scheme throughout the year.
The accrued pension shown includes pensionable service to 31 December 2006.
Charles Allen ceased employment on 4 January 2007 and was contractually entitled to a two-year enhancement to his pensionable service at that date.
This enhancement is not included in the table for 2006.
2 John Cresswell became a director on 16 January 2006 and therefore the opening accrued pension is shown at this date rather than at 1 January 2006.
3 Henry Staunton resigned as a director on 29 March 2006 although he was an active member of the pension scheme up to 31 March 2006, therefore the pension shown at 31 December 2006 is the pension in payment.
4 Each executive director has a normal retirement age of 60.
5 In the event of the death of an executive director, a pension equal to one half of the directors pension will become payable to a surviving spouse.
A pension may become payable to any surviving dependant children.
6 In common with other members of the Defined Benefit Scheme, each of the directors may, with the consent of the Company, receive and draw a pension at any time after reaching the age of 50.
