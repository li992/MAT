JJB Sports plc Directors remuneration report For the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The Report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the Report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company.
The auditors are required to report on the audited information within the Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the Report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The Report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Constitution of the Committee The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Roger Lane-Smith and also consists of Andrew Thomas, David Beever and with effect from 12 October 2005, the date of his appointment as a Director, Roger Best.
David Whelan, attends as appropriate, to give advice.
Roger LaneSmith and David Whelan do not participate in the determination of their own remuneration package.
Remuneration of Executive Directors The remuneration of Executive Directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The remuneration policy aims to ensure that the Executive Directors are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Groups performance and that their remuneration packages are competitive with regards to those of comparable public companies and, through a performance related bonus and the award of share options, incentivise the Director concerned to improve the performance of the Group.
The elements of remuneration are a basic salary, a performance related bonus, certain taxable benefits, contributions made into Directors personal pension schemes and share options.
Basic salary The basic salaries of Executive Directors are set by the Remuneration Committee who take into consideration the levels of salaries of Directors in similar sized public companies within the FTSE 350 Index and which are then tailored to individual experience, responsibility and performance.
This policy will be continued during the current accounting period.
The basic salaries of Barry Dunn, David Greenwood and Tom Knight were reviewed in August 2005 with the increase backdated to 1 February 2005.
Prior to this review, the basic salaries of Barry Dunn and David Greenwood had last been reviewed as at 1 February 2003 and that of Tom Knight had last been reviewed as at 1 September 2003.
The basic salary of David Whelan had last been reviewed as at 1 August 2001: following his change of position from that of Chairman to Executive Director on 6 July 2005, his basic salary was reduced by approximately the amount of the increase in Directors fees given to Roger Lane-Smith on his change of position from Non-executive Director to that of Nonexecutive Chairman.
Performance related bonus The Executive Directors are entitled to a performance related bonus scheme to which members of the Associate Director Board of JJB are also entitled.
This bonus takes the form of an annual payment, calculated as a percentage of basic salary, based upon the annual pre-tax profits of the Group but dependent upon profit targets being achieved.
The first bonus scheme was set over 3 years which commenced from the accounting period to 25 January 2004 and ended with the accounting period to 29 January 2006 with a bonus being payable at the end of the fourth year, representing an amount equal to any bonus paid in the 3 previous years, provided the Executive Director or Associate Director is still in the Companys employment at the end of the fourth year.
Whilst an entitlement to bonus was achieved and paid in respect of the 52 weeks to 25 January 2004, no entitlement was earned in respect of the 53 weeks to 30 January 2005 or for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006.
The maximum amount payable in any one of the first 3 years of this scheme is limited to 40 per cent of the Directors basic salary.
A performance related bonus scheme has been adopted for the accounting period ending 28 January 2007 which is very similar in form to the scheme which applied during the last 3 accounting periods and which is referred to above.
Taxable benefits Executive Directors are eligible for taxable benefits, which include membership of a private medical scheme and the provision of a company car with payment of its operating expenses, including private mileage, or the payment of a monthly lump sum towards the costs incurred on business travel in their own car.
Pensions The Executive Directors make contributions to their own personal pension schemes and the Company contributes a similar amount into those schemes, limited to a fixed percentage of their basic salary.
30 JJB Sports plc Directors remuneration report continued Share option schemes Grants of share options to Executive Directors and senior executives are made only at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Options are not routinely granted but made on an individual basis to reflect either increased responsibility and promotion or as part of the remuneration package on being appointed an Executive Director.
For a number of years, JJB has operated 2 share option schemes that were created in 1999.
However, the Remuneration Committee have reviewed the share based incentive arrangements at present in operation and concluded that in order to ensure that there is a sufficient range of share based incentives available to the Committee, shareholder approval should be sought for the adoption of 2 new share plans.
Details of the 1999 Share option schemes and of the proposed new plans, are set out below.
1999 Share option schemes The maximum value of options to be granted to any employee under the 1999 Approved Share option scheme is restricted to 30,000.
In addition, options can be granted under the 1999 Unapproved Share option scheme, the maximum number being calculated by a formula which restricts the value of the options granted to any employee to 4 times their basic salary, less the value of any options granted under the 1999 Approved Share option scheme.
The exercise of share options is subject to performance conditions requiring various growths in earnings per ordinary share of the Group, over at least three consecutive financial periods.
In respect of the share options granted to D. Whelan and J. D. Greenwood, on which the expiry date is 2009, the performance condition attaching to the options was a growth in Group earnings per ordinary share of more than 10 per cent per annum plus the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index, for the option to be fully exercisable.
For all share options issued subsequently, the performance condition has been a growth in Group earnings per ordinary share of more than 4 per cent per annum plus the percentage increase in the Retail Price index.
For the options to be exercisable in relation to half the shares subject to any option, the increase in earnings per ordinary share was to be half the annual rates quoted above, plus the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index.
Details of share options held by the Executive Directors are set out in the table on page 33 of this Report.
Proposed new plans The first new plan is a Long term incentive plan LTIP.
Awards made under the LTIP will be made over a specified number of shares.
The shares will be acquired by the award holder at the beginning of the measurement period but the ownership of the shares will remain conditional until after the end of the measurement period.
This is because each award will be subject to performance conditions and it is only to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied that a participant will obtain absolute ownership of any shares.
The Remuneration Committee propose that the performance conditions to which any award is made under the LTIP will be split into 2 equal parts and each part will be subject to different performance measures.
An earnings per share and total shareholder return will determine the extent to which each part vests.
Different performance conditions may be selected by the Remuneration Committee for future awards made under the LTIP, but if the performance conditions for future awards are changed, shareholders will be informed through the Directors remuneration report in future Annual reports.
The second proposed new plan is a Share option plan Share Plan.
Under the Share Plan, options may be granted over a specified number of shares.
The extent to which an option will vest depends upon the satisfaction of performance conditions to which the option is subject.
The performance condition will be based on the achievement of growth in earnings per share over the measurement period.
Under the Share Plan, the option can be treated as a share appreciation right.
This means that on the exercise of the option, the number of shares acquired by the option holder will be equal in value to the in the money value of the option and not to the number of shares over which the option was originally granted.
This means that fewer shares will be issued on the exercise of the option.
Shareholder approval to the adoption of the LTIP and the Share Plan will be sought at the Annual general meeting of the Company to be held on 27 July 2006.
Further details as to the nature of the LTIP and Share Plan are to be found in Part VI of the Circular to the shareholders which gives notice of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Contracts of service The service contracts of all the Executive Directors have no fixed term and are terminable on 6 months notice by either party.
The service contracts also contain a change of control clause which provides for 12 months notice in the event of a change of control of the Group.
The service contracts of David Whelan and David Greenwood were dated 10 November 1994, Barry Dunns was dated 7 June 1996 and Tom Knights was dated 11 July 2003.
Remuneration of Non-executive Directors The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is in the form of Directors fees and is determined by David Whelan after consultation with the other Executive Directors and after taking into account the performance of the Non-executive Directors in the accounting period and the levels of remuneration paid by comparable public companies.
The Directors fees of the Non-executive Directors had been last reviewed as at 1 February 2003 and were again reviewed in August 2005 with the increase being backdated to 1 February 2005.
