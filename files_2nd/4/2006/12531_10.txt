Contracts of service Save for automatic termination when each executive director becomes 60 years of age, the executive directors have rolling service contracts and are subject to re-election by shareholders under the companys Articles of Association and the provisions of the Code.
The service contract of each executive director may be terminated on 2 months notice in writing by either side, in accordance with current market practice.
In such event, the compensation commitments in respect of their contracts could amount to one years remuneration based on base salary, annual bonus and long-term incentive scheme entitlement, benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period.
There are provisions for earlier termination by the company in certain circumstances.
If such circumstances were to arise, the executive director concerned would have no claim against the company for damages or any other remedy in respect of the termination.
There are no other provisions, such as liquidated damages clauses, which expressly provide for compensation in the event of early termination.
The Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment made to a departing executive director and would consider each case on an individual basis.

Professor D G Roberts was issued with a letter of appointment dated 30 June 2006 following his appointment to the Board on 28 June 2006.
External appointments Executive directors are entitled to accept non-executive appointments outside the company providing that the Boards approval is sought.
Mr A R C Durrant currently holds one external non-executive directorship with Clipper Windpower plc and is entitled to retain the fees earned connected therewith 2006: US$82,000.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Remuneration report continued 30 Remuneration structure The remuneration package for the executive directors comprises base salary, benefits, bonus, pension, and entitlement to participate in the companys all-employee share schemes and long-term executive share schemes.
Base salary Base salary is reviewed each year against other comparable companies in the oil and gas sector and general market data on the basis of companies in similar industries and those of a similar size.
The objective is to ensure that the base salary, when taken together with the rest of the package, provides a competitive but performance-driven remuneration package.
The policy of the Committee has been to position base salaries between the median and the upper quartile.
This is felt to be necessary and appropriate bearing in mind the fact that there is a shortage of executive talent in the industry and the current executive team is considered highly attractive for other companies.
The salaries of the executive directors as at January 2007 are as follows: Base salary Percentage increase from 2006 S C Lockett 374,000 24.6% R A Allan 269,000 4.4% A R C Durrant 270,000 4.9% N Hawkings 244,000 3.8% The percentage range of base salary increases for 2007 was between 4 and 25 per cent.
For Messrs R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings, the increases were determined after considering a range of factors such as company performance and the development of the executive, as well as taking account of the recommendations of New Bridge Street Consultants LLP that these levels represent salaries between median and upper quartile for executives in similar roles, in companies of similar size in the oil and gas sector and in general industry companies excluding financial services also of a similar size.
In the case of Mr S C Lockett the increase is in recognition of his development since his appointment as Chief Executive in 2005, when a decision was taken to position his initial salary at below market rates, with a view to progressing to a level between market median and upper quartile over time.
The Committee anticipates that future increases will be more in line with market rates generally.
While salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, the performance of the company and the performance of the individual, the Committee would not regard this element of remuneration as directly performance-related.
Annual bonus scheme The total annual bonus potential, which is non-pensionable, is 00 per cent of base salary.
Half of any bonus earned is payable immediately in cash and the remaining half is payable in shares and deferred for three years.
The deferred element of the bonus is contingent upon the relevant beneficiary remaining in employment for the three years from the date of the award, but is not dependent on any further performance-related measures.
Performance measures for 2006 are explained in the table below: Performance Maximum measures bonus potential Conditions Cash flow 0% Base target to achieve the operating cash flow number contained in the 2006 budget approved by the Board.
0% Stretch target to achieve the base target plus 5 per cent.

Pension schemes Audited Mr S C Lockett is a member of the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme, subject to the Earnings Cap.
The Scheme is a funded, registered final salary scheme, which provides a pension of up to two-thirds salary at the normal pension age of 60.
Benefits are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of inflation or 5 per cent per annum.
The company has decided to continue to operate its own cap on pensionable earnings beyond April 2006, when the external cap was removed.
For the year to 3 December 2006 this was set at 05,600, increasing to 08,600 for the year to 3 December 2007.
The company has agreed to provide Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings with a pension substantially as if they were contributing members of the Scheme and, in regard to service completed subsequent to their appointment as directors, not subject to the Earnings Cap.
The additional value of this target pension provision, relative to the standard terms applied to staff, is made available at the directors option in the form of either an enhanced scale of pension contributions or a non-pensionable salary supplement.
As at the year-end, Messrs R A Allan and N Hawkings had elected the former and Messrs S C Lockett and A R C Durrant had elected the latter.
For life insurance purposes, Messrs R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings are members of the Scheme.
Messrs R A Allan and N Hawkings are members of a money purchase pension arrangement to which, during 2006, the company contributed 47,004 and 36,404 respectively: these amounts include 25,884 and 20,05 respectively in regard to the enhanced pension contributions referred to above.
The accrued pension entitlements of the directors who were members or deemed members of the Scheme during 2006 are as follows: a b c d Increase from e f Transfer value Transfer value d to b less Increase in Accrued in respect Accrued in respect contributions Transfer value accrued pension as at of a as at pension as at of c as at by director of increase pension 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December during in accrued excluding 2006 2006 2005 2005 2006 benefit inflation 000 pa 000 000 pa 000 000 000 000 S C Lockett 32.3 2.
4 26.9 23.7 4.0 N Hawkings 3.3 27.3 7.5 7.5 3.3 Notes: The amounts of accrued pension under a and c represent the accrued pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
The transfer values under b, d and e have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the guidance note GN : Retirement Benefit Schemes Transfer Values issued by the Board for Actuarial Standards under the Financial Reporting Council.
The amounts under e represent the increase in value of the directors benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the year, of the excess of the end-year accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits as revalued by price inflation less contributions by the directors.
The values stated above correspond with the target level of final salary pension provision: in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are principally established through individual money purchase arrangements and salary supplements.
In addition to the current provision noted above, Mr R A Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of a prior service period with the company between September 986 and November 999.
Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: none of the directors have elected to do so.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Governance The following payments were made to a former director of the company in respect of unfunded pension liabilities: 33 Amount of unfunded Amount of unfunded pension paid during 2006 pension paid during 2005 J A Heath 29,956 29,3 2 Long-term incentive arrangements The company currently operates four share option schemes, the Asset and Equity Plan and the Share Incentive Plan.
The Scheme of Arrangement relating to the groups capital in 2003 affected two of the option schemes in operation at that time.
The company therefore adopted two new share option schemes to replace the Executive Share Option Scheme 995 and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme 999.
Asset and Equity Plan Audited This plan is designed to reward an improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period.
The plan therefore has two bonus pools an asset bonus pool and an equity bonus pool.
The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity value per share of the company over a three-year period.
In both cases, no bonus pool is created where the compound growth per annum in the relevant measure asset value or share price is below 0 per cent.
At 0 per cent compound growth per annum, per cent of the growth becomes the pool.
At 20 per cent compound growth per annum, 2.5 per cent of the growth becomes the pool.
There is proportionate vesting between these two points.
The maximum benefit that an individual may receive will normally be limited to twice his or her base salary per annum, except where the compound growth rate exceeds 20 per cent per annum in either the asset or equity bonus pool, in which case the Remuneration Committee may increase the limit on such a proportionate basis as it determines to be fair and reasonable.
Under this plan awards can be made annually and they will mature on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The AEP is a broadly based plan, with participation points being awarded to eligible employees, including executive directors, throughout the group.
In addition to the performance conditions set out above, vesting of awards is subject to the Remuneration Committee being satisfied that there has been satisfactory improvement in the performance of the company.
Awards are normally made in January in the first year of each three-year award period.
New employees who join the company part of the way through the duration of a three-year award are awarded participation points in that award on a time-apportioned basis.
In addition, employees who receive a significant promotion during an award period are eligible to receive an increased participation, also on a timeapportioned basis.
Messrs A R C Durrant and N Hawkings thus received participation points under the 2004 award, time-apportioned to their date of joining the company, and Mr S C Lockett received additional participation points in the 2004 and 2005 award, to reflect his promotion to Chief Executive in March 2005.
Matching award scheme At the AGM in 2006, shareholders approved an amendment to the plan which gave participants in the plan the option to increase the six-month deferral of the share element released under the plan to three years.
This extended deferral is mandatory for the executive directors and senior management but voluntary for other staff.
Where shares are deferred for three years, individuals will be able to participate in a matching award.
The release of this part of the award will therefore be six years following the initial grant of the award under the plan.
The number of shares awarded by way of matching will be subject to the achievement of a performance condition, which is comparative TSR over the three-year deferral period.
The comparator group consists of about thirty-five companies in the oil and gas sector derived from the Alternative Investment Market as well as the main Market.
Matching will be between one-half of a share for each deferred share where the comparative performance is at or above the median, and 2.5 shares for each deferred share where the performance is at or above the upper decile.
There will be proportionate vesting between these points.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Remuneration report continued 34 Release of 2004 awards The vesting performance condition for this award is as set out above.
Due to the requirement to wait until shareholder approval had been received for the plan before the first award could be made, the equity bonus pool of the 2004 award was calculated by comparing the market value calculated by reference to the average share price for the three months prior to the AGM which approved the introduction of the Asset and Equity Plan 7 May 2004, with the market value similarly calculated to 3 December 2006.
The share price for the three months prior to the AGM was used as the opening price rather than the three months prior to the effective date of the 2004 award January 2004, because using the earlier date would have given participants in the 2004 award an in-built gain at the time shareholders approved the plan.
It was thus decided, for the 2004 award only, that the opening share price should be the average price for the three months prior to 7 May 2004.
An independent external valuation of the equity pool was undertaken when the 2004 award matured and the Remuneration Committee determined the 2004 vesting level as set out in the table below.
50 per cent of the awards were released in cash and 50 per cent in deferred shares.
The benefits received by directors under the 2004 award were as follows: Share award held in Matching award scheme until Cash award 31 December 2009 S C Lockett 476,796 42,268 R A Allan 333,899 29,600 A R C Durrant 75,683 5,574 N Hawkings 48,964 3,206 The mid-market share price on the date the award vested 7 January 2007 was.
Outstanding awards As at 3 December 2006, a total of 928.60 participation points have been allocated under the 2005 award.
742.00 participation points were originally awarded in 2005 and 86.60 participation points have been awarded since then, as time-apportioned compensatory awards to employees who have either joined the company, or received significant promotion during the three-year performance period.
The directors have been allocated the following points: Number of participation points S C Lockett 6.
75 R A Allan 36.85 A R C Durrant 36.85 2 N Hawkings 32.62 Notes: Mr S C Lockett was originally awarded 36.85 participation points under the 2005 award.
A compensatory award of a further 24.90 points was made following his appointment to Chief Executive in March 2005.
2 Mr N Hawkings was originally awarded 25.95 participation points under the 2005 award.
A compensatory award of a further 6.67 points was made following his appointment to Operations Director in March 2006.
As at 3 December 2006, a total of, 292.50 participation points have been allocated under the 2006 award.
Of these, the directors have been allocated the following points: Number of participation points S C Lockett 62.00 R A Allan 45.00 A R C Durrant 45.00 N Hawkings 45.00 2007 awards Awards for the 2007 plan have not yet been granted as at the date of this report, but are expected to be issued in the second quarter of 2007.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Governance Share option schemes Audited 35 Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 Options granted under the 995 scheme are now normally exercisable not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse unless previously exercised on their tenth anniversary.
No payment is made for the grant of an option.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
For options granted prior to 2000 the performance requirement was that the share price plus the value of dividends paid must, as measured at the end of any consecutive three-year period, have grown at a rate equal to or greater than the Oil Exploration and Production Index over the same period.
Options granted during and after 2000 are dependent upon growth in the companys earnings per share of at least 3 per cent per annum compound above the Retail Price Index over a three-year period.
The Committee believes that this is a challenging performance measure that in the long-term should reflect a good shareholder return.
This scheme was affected by the Scheme of Arrangement.
The options could be exercised within six months of the Court approving the Scheme of Arrangement or the options could be rolled over into options over shares of the new company.
Where the option holder elected to rollover their options the performance criteria continued to apply.
The performance conditions relating to all options granted to directors under the 995 Scheme have been met.
Mr S C Lockett held options under this scheme during the financial year.
The options are listed in the table below: Acquisition Options held Mid-market Options held at price per at 1 January price on date 31 December Date of grant Exercisable dates share 2006 Event of exercise 2006 S C Lockett 26.04.96 26.04.0 26.04.06 3.
Options granted under the scheme are normally exercisable not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse unless previously exercised on their tenth anniversary.
In the case of certain employees the performance condition is growth in earnings per share of at least 3 per cent per annum compound above the Retail Price Index over a three-year period.
In other cases, including grants made to Mr A R C Durrant under the scheme in 2005, the performance condition is based on the companys TSR in comparison with a group of eight companies as follows: Burren Energy, Cairn Energy, Dana Petroleum, Paladin Resources, Tullow Oil, Venture Production, Soco International and JKX Oil & Gas, measured between January 2005 and 3 December 2007.
Options will vest as to 30 per cent in the event that median performance is achieved, with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis up to 00 per cent if upper quartile performance is achieved.
TSR was selected as the performance measure for this plan as it aligns the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior TSR compared to competitor companies.
Directors interests under this scheme are shown below: Options held at Acquisition 1 January 2006 Mid-market Options held at price per or date of price on date 31 December Date of grant Exercisable dates share appointment Event of exercise 2006 A R C Durrant 0.
5 5.35 20,000 20,000 Notes: The grant to Mr A R C Durrant was made as part of his recruitment terms, to compensate him for the value loss he suffered on leaving his previous employer.
This option was granted subject to a performance condition based on the companys total shareholder return relative to eight oil companies measured between 3 May 2005 and 3 May 2008.
Options will vest as to 30 per cent in the event that median performance is achieved with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis up to 00 per cent if upper quartile performance is achieved.
It should be noted that the Remuneration Report for 2005 indicated that the performance period was January 2005 to 3 December 2007 as that reflected the companys general policy for awards to incumbents although, in the case of Mr A R C Durrant, the performance period commenced on the date of grant.
2 The grant to Mr N Hawkings was made as part of his recruitment terms, where it was agreed that the grant would not be subject to any pre-vesting performance conditions.
This was felt appropriate by the Committee as the grant was negotiated to compensate for the lapsing of awards held from his previous employer.
The grant document was originally executed incorrectly in that it incorporated a TSR performance condition.
This position has been clarified to confirm the fact that no pre-vesting performance conditions apply, in line with the agreed position at the time Mr Hawkings joined.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Remuneration report continued 36 Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1999 Under this scheme, employees including executive directors with six months or more continuous service are invited, within a period of 42 days of the announcement of the annual results, to join the scheme.
Employees may save between 5 and 250 per month, through payroll deduction for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at a market value set at the time of invitation discounted by up to 20 per cent.
Where an employee elected to rollover their options, the original savings period continued to apply.

25 Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Governance Share Incentive Plan Audited 37 Under this plan, employees, including executive directors, may make contributions to acquire shares in the company Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares, the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.
Should an employee leave the plan before the end of the three-year period he she will lose the right to the Matching Shares, unless he she leaves due to injury, redundancy, TUPE transfer, retirement, death or the sale of the company.
The plan was amended following the Scheme of Arrangement to allow the use of shares in the new company.
The company made an award of 526 Free Shares per employee to all company employees on 8 February 2002.
Following the one-for-ten share consolidation, these were adjusted to 52 or 53 shares in a manner approved by HMRC.
The Free Shares are held in trust.
On the third anniversary of the award, employees were eligible to transfer the Free Shares into their own name, or sell them, provided they were still in the employment of the company.
In the case of the award of Free Shares and Matching Shares, the company has not required performance criteria to be fulfilled, as the purpose of the plan is to encourage all employees to become shareholders in the company.
