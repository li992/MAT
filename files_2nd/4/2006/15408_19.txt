62 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 Directors pension provision Iain Ferguson is not a member of the Tate & Lyle Group Pension Scheme Group Scheme and accordingly accrues no pension benefit.
Stanley Musesengwa is a member of the Group Scheme but for the year ended 31 March 2006 his pension benefit, as detailed in the table below, only relates to that part of his salary up to the UK statutory Earnings Cap 105,600 per annum for the 2005 06 tax year.
In accordance with the Companys policy, because Iain Ferguson and Stanley Musesengwa receive salary which is not pensionable on a tax approved basis, they are paid cash allowances in lieu of pension calculated as a percentage of base salary from which they make their own pension arrangements the amounts paid during the year are included in Allowances in the table on page 60.
In light of changes to the taxation of UK pension benefits effective from 6 April 2006, benefits accrued by Stanley Musesengwa in respect of service after that date are no longer subject to a cap on pensionable earnings.
As a consequence, from 6 April 2006 the cash allowance in lieu of pension previously paid to him ceased.
A cap will continue to apply to benefits accrued in respect of his service prior to 6 April 2006.
During the year, Simon Gifford elected to transfer his benefits out of the Group Scheme and, as a result, at 31 March 2006 he was no longer entitled to a benefit from the Group Scheme.
The cash equivalent transfer value paid in respect of his benefits excluding additional voluntary contributions amounted to 3,716,000.
For comparison purposes, the transfer value of his benefits in the Group Scheme at 1 April 2005 was 3,034,000.
