Remuneration report UNAUDITED INFORMATION Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee the Committee The Company complies with the relevant conditions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance relating to Directors remuneration as published by the London Stock Exchange and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Andrew Walker is the Chairman of the Committee and the other members are Christopher Bailey and Ian Griffiths.
All three members are non-executive Directors.
Julian Blogh and Douglas Caster also normally attend Remuneration Committee meetings, although they are not formally members of the Committee.
The task of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the framework of executive remuneration and to determine annually the individual salaries, annual bonuses payable if any and other terms and conditions of employment of the executive Directors and other senior executives.
The Committee also approves the terms of any discretionary share schemes in which executive Directors and senior executives may be invited to participate, and the terms of the Companys Savings Related Share Option Scheme and All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP.
The Committee consulted Douglas Caster, Chief Executive, with regard to the remuneration and benefits packages offered to executive Directors and senior executives during the year, except in relation to his own remuneration and benefits package which is determined by the Committee in his absence.
In addition, wholly independent advice on executive remuneration and share schemes was received from New Bridge Street Consultants who were appointed by the Company and who provided no other services to the Company during the year, save for ongoing advice in connection with the operation of the Companys share schemes.
Remuneration policy The policy of the Committee is to reward senior management competitively, enabling the Company to recruit, motivate and retain executives of high calibre, whilst avoiding paying excessive remuneration.
Further details of the remuneration policy followed by the Committee are set out below.
The remuneration practices adopted by a group of like companies that, in the opinion of the Committee, face similar remuneration issues to the Company, are considered with guidance from the remuneration consultants who advise the Committee.
The size and nature of each key element of the remuneration package of the executive Directors has been determined following this analysis.
It is the aim of the Committee to encourage and reward high performance.
It is the opinion of the Committee that shareholders interests are best served by setting a moderate level of fixed pay, while providing competitive potential levels of total remuneration through short and longer term incentive arrangements that require the satisfaction of challenging performance conditions.
Therefore, a significant proportion of the executive Directors remuneration is performance-linked.
Salaries Salaries of executive Directors are reviewed by the Committee annually.
In addition to an analysis presented by New Bridge Street Consultants, the Committee uses published salary surveys and information available in the annual reports of similar companies as sources of market information.
The Committee takes account of pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when determining annual salary increases.
Specific factors taken into account by the Committee when determining each executive Directors base salary are: the median level of base salary for a similar position within a like group of companies: the individual Directors performance: and the responsibilities of the respective Director.
The Chairmans remuneration is set by the Committee, which meets without him for this purpose.
The remaining non-executive Directors fees are set by a Committee comprising the executive Directors.
In all cases the remuneration awards are based upon published salary surveys, taking account of individual responsibilities.
Andrew Walker is Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and receives additional remuneration as a result.
Annual bonus scheme Bonus payments are based upon the achievement of operating profit and cash flow targets.
The maximum bonus for 2006 was 50% of base salary, of which 10% related to the achievement of a 54.1 million profit before tax and profit or loss on fair value movements on derivatives and amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition and 40% to achieving an operating cash flow of 52.3 million after capitalised development costs, capital expenditure and purchase of long-term incentive plan shares.
The actual results for the year led to a bonus pay-out of 31%.
The pay-out was below the maximum, despite the full-year results being above target, because of higher working capital levels during the year.
38 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Remuneration report continued Annual bonus scheme continued The Committee carried out a detailed review of the Executive Directors levels of compensation during the year.
This revealed that the existing maximum annual bonus potential of 50% of salary is well behind the market for companies of a similar size to Ultra.
The 50% maximum was set when Ultra was a smaller company and has not been increased for a number of years.
As a result of the Companys sustained strong performance, Ultra is now ranked close to the middle of the FTSE 250 index.
Accordingly, recognising the need to pay the Executive Directors competitively relative to other companies of a similar size and complexity, and to ensure that a significant portion of executive pay is directly linked to performance, from 2007 the maximum bonus potential for Executive Directors will be increased to 75% of salary.
The Committee notes that this level remains relatively modest compared to the maximum bonus potential for Executive Directors within other FTSE 250 companies of a similar size.
The Committee will continue to ensure that the targets set under the annual bonus plan remain sufficiently stretching to justify the payment of bonuses and will take account of the higher annual bonus opportunity when setting these targets.
The parameters used to assess payment will continue to be based on a combination of a profit target, which will account for up to 15% and a cash flow objective for the remaining 60%.
Directors Long-Term Incentive Plan and Employee Share Option Plans Due to the expiry of a number of the Companys existing share incentive plans, namely the 2002 to 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company Share Option Plan and the Executive Share Option Scheme, Ultra will seek shareholder approval for the establishment of the following new discretionary share plans at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting: a 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 LTIP : a 2007 Company Share Option Plan 2007 CSOP : and a 2007 Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS.
In addition, shareholder approval will be sought for the establishment renewal of certain all-employee share plans, so that every employee at Ultra will continue to be given the opportunity to participate in the Companys success.
The sole form of equity-based long-term incentive for Executive Directors has been the 2002-2007 LTIP.
It is proposed that this continues to be the case, namely that Executive Directors will only participate in the 2007 LTIP and will not receive awards under the new 2007 CSOP or ESOS.
These plans will still be used for more junior employees.
Key features of the new 2007 LTIP It is proposed that most of the key features of this existing plan should be reflected in the new 2007 LTIP.
In its review, the Committee found that the existing LTIP scheme has helped to motivate senior executives to drive sustained above-market long-term growth in Ultras profits and, therefore, to generate excellent returns for shareholders.
However, in designing the new 2007 LTIP, account has been taken of changes in best market practice since the current plan was approved by shareholders.
Accordingly, the main features of the new 2007 LTIP will be as follows: Conditional awards of shares will be made annually to Executive Directors and selected other senior executives which will normally vest three years after grant, subject to continued employment and the extent to which a performance condition has been met.
As with the 2002 LTIP, the performance condition will measure Ultras growth in adjusted Earnings per Share EPS relative to a group of comparator companies over the three financial years starting, in each case, with the most recently published EPS figure.
At the end of the performance period which cannot be extended and re-tested, each companys growth in EPS will be calculated over that period, with the companies ranked in descending order according to the growth in their EPS.
The percentage of the award that vests will be calculated as follows: Rank Percentage of award that vests Below median 0% Median 20% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 20% and 100% For future awards, different performance conditions may be set, although the Committee would intend to consult shareholders before any materially different performance conditions are applied.
It will continue to be the Committees policy to grant awards to Executive Directors in the form of shares worth 100% of salary annually, as with the existing 2002 LTIP.
However, in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment, the Committee may make awards of up to 150% of salary.
Awards will normally lapse upon a participant leaving the employment of Ultra.
However, in the case of death, and in such other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, awards may vest subject to performance and will ordinarily be reduced on a pro rata basis.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 39 Remuneration report continued Key features of the new 2007 LTIP contined In the event of a change of control of Ultra, awards will vest subject to performance measured up to the date of the change of control and will normally be reduced on a pro rata basis, again subject to the discretion of the Committee.
On vesting, participants will have the right to receive a payment equal to the value of dividends accruing on awards during the vesting period.
However, no dividends will be paid on shares which do not vest.
No benefits under the plan will be pensionable.
Calculation of Relative Earnings per Share Performance The Committee believes strongly that the use of a relative EPS growth measure continues to be the most appropriate performance condition for awards under the 2007 LTIP.
This condition ensures that participants are rewarded for the delivery of EPS growth above that of a group of broadly comparable other companies.
However, the Committee is conscious that the use of a relative EPS measure may require certain adjustments to be made in order to ensure that EPS growth is measured consistently from company to company.
In particular, it notes that many companies disclose a normalised or equivalent EPS figure, the definition of which may vary between comparator companies.
Therefore, in order to ensure that EPS growth is measured consistently, the Remuneration Committee has determined that the EPS figure to be used for the comparator group will be basic EPS as disclosed, adjusted for i. e. excluding charges relating to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IAS 19 Employee Benefits and amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
No adjustments will be made for goodwill impairment charges or for exceptional gains or losses.
The proposed comparator group for measuring EPS growth is: Alba plc Renishaw plc Amstrad plc Rolls-Royce plc BAE Systems plc Rotork plc Charter plc Senior plc Chemring Group plc Smiths Group plc Chloride Group plc Spectris plc Cobham plc Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Dialight plc Telent plc Domino Printing Sciences plc TT Electronics plc Filtronic plc UMECO plc Halma plc Vitec Group plc Hampson Industries plc Volex Group plc Laird Group plc VT Group plc Meggitt plc Whatman plc Oxford Instruments plc Zetex plc Psion plc For Ultra, the figure used in calculating EPS growth will be based upon the Companys adjusted EPS as above, with a further adjustment made to remove 50% of post-tax movements in Ultras product-related provisions and contract reserves taking place during the three year period.
However, the Remuneration Committee will retain discretion to make further adjustments to this figure should it believe it appropriate to do so.
The extent to which awards vest will be independently verified by a third party, typically JPMorgan Cazenove the Companys stockbrokers.
The executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys Inland Revenue approved All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
Under the AESOP, employees in the UK are offered the opportunity to buy shares up to the value of 1,500 per annum from pre-tax salary.
Shares are then held in trust on behalf of employees until the maturity date or until they leave the Company.
The Savings Related Share Option Scheme is no longer offered but it is planned to re-introduce it for all UK employees.
Senior Executive Share Ownership Guidelines To increase the alignment of interests between senior executives and shareholders, the Committee intends to introduce a share ownership guideline under which all Executive Directors will be encouraged to retain at least 50% of the post-tax shares they acquire on the vesting of LTIP awards until a holding equivalent to 100% of base salary is achieved.
Pre-existing shareholdings will be taken into account.

The graph shows the value at the end of 2006 of 100 invested at the end of 2001, in the Company and in the Index.
The Committee considers the FTSE Mid 250 index a relevant index for TSR comparison as the index members represent a broad range of UK quoted companies.

In the event of early termination, it is the Committees policy that the amount of compensation paid to executive Directors will be considered in the light of all the relevant circumstances, subject to the overriding conditions that: the Committees aim will be to avoid rewarding poor performance: the duty of the relevant executive Director to mitigate his loss will be taken into account: and no compensation payment can exceed one years salary.

Directors pension entitlements The Company operates a contributory pension scheme for current executive Directors.
A pension equal to two-thirds of salary at retirement is provided at the normal retirement age of 63 years.
Where pensionable service is less than 20 years, the pension is calculated at one-thirtieth of the retirement salary for each year of service.
With the Companys consent, executive Directors may retire from age 50.
After age 58, Company consent to early retirement is not required.
Pensions are reduced in the event of early retirement.
Death-in-service cover is a lump sum of four times pensionable earnings.
In addition, a spouses pension of 33% of pensionable earnings is payable, together with an allowance for dependent children up to a maximum of 33% of pensionable earnings where relevant.
On the death of a retired Director, a spouses pension of 50% of the Directors pension is payable.
Once the pension is in payment, the part of the Directors pension above the Guaranteed Minimum Pension will be increased each year in line with the increase in the retail price index, capped at 7.5%, above which increases are at the Trustees discretion.
