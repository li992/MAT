The details of the directors contracts of service as at 16 September 2006 are set out below: Effective Notice Notice date of period period Date of current from from appointment contract Company director Martin Adamson 11.10.99 11.12.02 6 months 6 months George Weston 19.04.99 01.06.05 12 months 12 months John Bason 04.05.99 16.03.99 12 months 12 months Lord MacGregor 09.12.94 16.11.99 6 months 6 months Mike Alexander 16.01.02 16.01.02 6 months 6 months Jeff Harris 21.05.03 21.05.03 6 months 6 months Tim Clarke 03.11.04 03.11.04 6 months 6 months The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter of appointment with Galen Weston in view of his relationship with the ultimate holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington Investments Limited.
He receives no fees for performing his role as a non-executive director and Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse him for any expenses incurred by him in that role.

The Remuneration committees aim is always to deal fairly with cases of termination whilst taking a robust line in minimising any compensation.
The Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained in the Combined Code regarding inclusion of explicit provisions in directors service contracts for compensation commitments in the event of early termination.
The committee will continue to keep under review its current practice, which is not to include such provisions in order to enable it to respond appropriately to particular circumstances.
