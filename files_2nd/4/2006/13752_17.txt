The tables below contain the aggregate expected values of each option grant or performance share award.
The expected values of grants and awards made prior to November 2002 are the values previously disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Reports up to 2003 and were calculated by Mercer.
The expected values for the grants and awards made in 2003, 2004 and 2005 have been calculated by Mercer using: A binomial valuation model for the options that uses daily share price data and takes account of the option grant date, exercise price and risk-free rate of return, with assumptions as to dividend yield, future volatility and forfeiture: and A Monte Carlo simulation model for the performance share awards using the same inputs and assumptions as for the binomial model, but which projects, many thousands of times, the share price of the company along with the share prices of the comparator group stocks to determine correlations between the companies.
This produces a distribution of share prices and TSR rankings thus allowing complex market-based hurdles to be modelled.

These are now beneficially held as represented in the beneficial schedule on page 53, but are retained in this table as they may rank for the 50% additional award after two years from 31 May 2005 and 9 July 2005 respectively, prices on vesting dates were 8.45 per share and 8.775 per share respectively.
SABMiller plc Executive Share Purchase Scheme Prior to adoption of new share schemes on listing in March 1999, each of the executive directors and the Chairman participated in the old SAB Executive Share Purchase Scheme.
Details of options granted and share purchases awarded prior to listing in respect of SAB Ltd shares under this scheme are set out below: No.
The characteristics for this scheme are such that gains on exercise of options were recognised in prior years in respect of all the share rights reflected in the table.
From 3 June 2000, the SAB Executive Share Purchase Scheme was closed for purposes of new awards, and replaced by the Mirror Scheme for the purposes of new awards to employees of South African employers in the group and certain categories of other employees of South African origin elsewhere in the group other than SABMiller plc directors, principally in Africa.
These are issued annually to employees on the basis of assessment of performance and potential.
The unconditional vesting period has been reduced from a five-year period to a three-year period for the May 2006 grants going forward, in line with local market practice.
Approval This report was approved by the board as recommended by the remuneration committee on 17 May 2006.
By order of the board Miles Morland, Director 5 June 2006 56
