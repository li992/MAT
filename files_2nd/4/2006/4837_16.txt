Governance Remuneration Report This report, approved by the Board, has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 the Act, as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Apart from the information specifically highlighted as audited information relating to individual remuneration, share options, share interests and pensions information, this report is not subject to audit.
The purposes of this report are to inform shareholders of the Companys policies on directors remuneration applicable to the two financial periods up to 29 April 2006 and thereafter, and to provide details of the remuneration of individual directors as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the report at the annual general meeting on 6 September 2006.
Remuneration Committee The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility for determining policy in relation to, and specific approval of, the remuneration packages and terms and conditions of employment of each of the executive directors of the Company and for other senior executives of the Group, and policy in relation to the operation of the Groups employee share schemes.
In setting the policy, the Committee has regard to the compensation and benefits arrangements which apply below senior management level.
The Committees full terms of reference are shown on the corporate website.
Throughout the period, the Remuneration Committee comprised three of the independent non-executive directors, John Whybrow who chairs the Committee, Andrew Lynch and Rita Clifton.
The Committees four meetings during the period were attended by all its members.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director attend meetings of the Committee by invitation in an advisory capacity.
Meetings are also attended by the Director of Employee Reward and the Company Secretary who acts as secretary to the Committee and occasionally by representatives of remuneration consultants.
Nobody attends any part of a meeting at which their own remuneration is discussed.
The remuneration policy, which was in place for both the current and the previous financial periods, was approved by shareholders at the annual general meetings held in 2004 and 2005.
No significant changes to the principal elements of the policy have been made for the financial period commencing on 30 April 2006.
KPMG LLP which assisted the Remuneration Committee in devising the current policy, provided occasional advice to the Committee during the year for which they received fees of 7,500.
Total fees received by KPMG LLP from the Group were 2,088,000 and included internal audit, tax advice, corporate finance work and other accounting advice provided throughout the year.
The Committee remains satisfied of their independence of view in relation to remuneration matters.
Remuneration policy Executive directors The objectives of the remuneration policy are to: ensure that remuneration fairly recognises and rewards the contribution of individual directors and senior executives to the attainment of the Groups short and longer term results and, where appropriate, the performance of individual trading divisions and business units: maintain, particularly through reward schemes based on performance, a competitive package of pay and other benefits which provides the motivation for future achievement: facilitate, in an increasingly competitive international environment, the building and retention of a high calibre and focused team which will work effectively to achieve the Groups longer term strategic objectives: align the directors interests with those of shareholders by offering participation in schemes which provide opportunities to build shareholdings in the Company: and facilitate effective succession planning.
In implementing this policy, the Remuneration Committee takes account of information and surveys from internal and independent sources and the remuneration paid for comparable positions in other companies, especially those operating internationally.
It reviews data and surveys provided by remuneration consultants and market research companies with particular reference to the scale and composition of the total remuneration packages payable to people with like responsibilities, qualifications, skills and experience in businesses of similar size and structure.
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 47 Remuneration Report continued The main components of the remuneration of the executive directors are as follows: a Basic salaries These reflect the Remuneration Committees assessment of the mid market rate for relevant positions and levels of responsibility and the individual directors experience, performance and value to the business.
The basic salaries of the two executive directors were increased at the start of both the 2005 06 and the 2006 07 financial periods, to coincide with the Group-wide pay reviews.
In addition, the Group Finance Directors salary was increased in January 2006 to reflect market conditions and his additional responsibilities as Managing Director of the Computing Division.
b Performance related remuneration The performance based elements of remuneration are designed to drive performance and to strengthen the alignment between the interests of the Companys shareholders and its senior management, whilst encouraging management retention.
Remuneration packages are constructed to deliver a ratio between fixed salary and performance related pay of 2:3 for on target performance.
The components of performance related remuneration are as follows: i Annual cash bonus For the years 2004 05 and 2005 06 performance based remuneration for the executive directors has comprised an annual cash bonus plan based on the achievement of the Groups targets.
In the case of other participating executives below Board level, divisional and business unit targets are applied.
For 2004 05 the bonus performance measure was growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS.
For 2005 06 the bonus performance measures were EPS growth and Free Cash Flow which is defined in the Directors Report on page 36.
The potential maximum cash bonuses were 100 per cent of basic salary for the Chief Executive, 85 per cent for the other executive directors and 80 per cent for other participating executives.
50 per cent of the maximum bonus would have been earned for achievement of targets, with additional bonuses payable for substantially exceeding targets calculated on a sliding scale.
Bonus payments were John Clare 223,776 and Kevin OByrne 106,551.
For 2006 07 the maximum bonus which may be paid to the Chief Executive remains at 100 per cent of base salary and is based solely on EPS growth and Free Cash Flow targets.
The maximum which may be earned by the Group Finance Director has been increased from 85 per cent to 100 per cent by the addition of an element based on the attainment of the controllable earnings targets of the Computing Division for which he is now responsible in addition to his duties as Group Finance Director.
In the case of both of the executive directors the other bonus elements will be based on the same year on year EPS growth rates as for 2005 06 and the achievement of Group Free Cash Flow targets.
Targets are set using benchmarks that reflect both internal and external expectations, along with earnings estimates for other retailers in the forthcoming year.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the targets are challenging.
Before approving bonus payments, the Remuneration Committee will confirm that awards reflect genuine improvement in the Groups underlying financial performance taking into account, for example, the impact on the Companys financial statements of the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
Further information on employee costs, including those relating to senior management is given in notes 6 and 32, respectively to the financial statements.
ii Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP, performance is measured in terms of the Total Shareholder Return TSR achieved by the Company over a three year period relative to the companies comprising the FTSE 100 Index at the start of the performance period.
The maximum award requires performance in the upper quartile and is equivalent to 50 per cent of basic salary at the date of the provisional award in the case of the executive directors, 45 per cent for the members of the Group Executive Committee and 40 per cent for other participating executives.
Prior to vesting, the Remuneration Committee will satisfy itself that the TSR performance achieved reasonably reflects the financial performance of the Group and reserves the right to vary awards accordingly.
48 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 Governance No awards are payable for performance below the median TSR achieved by the comparator group.
At the median performance, awards will be 40 per cent of the maximum, representing 20 per cent of basic salary for the executive directors, 18 per cent for the members of the GEC and 16 per cent of basic salary for other participating executives.
The numbers of shares which have been provisionally awarded under the LTIP are: 2006 07 2005 06 2004 05 Median Maximum Median Maximum Median Maximum performance performance performance performance performance performance award award award award award award John Clare 76,190 190,476 93,802 234,507 81,674 204,186 Kevin OByrne 50,448 126,122 49,295 123,239 36,714 91,787 Shares provisionally awarded under the LTIP are also shown in the table of directors restricted interests on page 54.
In respect of the provisional awards made in 2004 05, the Companys TSR is currently below the median TSR of the comparator group.
If the position is maintained at the end of the three year performance period, no shares would vest.
In relation to the provisional awards made in 2005 06, the Companys relative TSR would, if the current position were maintained over a three year performance period, result in approximately 50 per cent of the share awards vesting.
iii Share options and performance share plans The Remuneration Committee approves the bases on which options are granted to executive directors and other employees under the Companys discretionary share option schemes and other performance share plans.
Options are granted annually to executive directors and other senior executives over shares having a market value on the date of grant equal to twice their basic salary.
Executive directors and senior executives are also entitled to participate in the Sharesave Scheme SAYE on the same conditions as other employees.
Over 8,500 employees currently participate in SAYE.
The following table summarises the terms applicable to the grant of options outstanding as at 29 April 2006.
Share option terms audited information Performance conditions Retesting Lapse date Grants made The market price on the date of exercise is at During the life Ten years from the before 1 July least 20 per cent higher than the option price, of the option.
2003 assuming exercise takes place between three and four years after the date of grant.
For later exercises, the rate of share growth is adjusted in line with the Retail Prices Index RPI.
Exercise is also conditional upon adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS having increased by not less than 3 per cent above the RPI over any consecutive period of three years during the life of the option.

Where EPS growth is between RPI performance criterion plus 3 per cent and RPI plus 5 per cent, options has not been met.

Prior to 2005 06, options were granted to other employees in the UK and overseas on the basis of management grade and to employees with more than three years service.
Employees below executive level now participate in a cash settled performance share plan linked in most cases to the attainment of three year EPS targets.
The eligibility criteria and overall fair value of awards under this plan are similar to those under the previous share option plan.
Of the 123,744,984 shares currently under option, 10,299,414 relate to the executive directors and members of senior management.
Options granted since April 1996 and which may be satisfied by the issue of new shares upon exercise represented 8.16 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company as at 29 April 2006.
Further information on share-based payments is set out in note 25 to the financial statements.
iv Deferred Equity Participation Plan DEPP For years prior to and including 2003 04, the executive directors participated in the DEPP which provided a bonus based on the level of growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS payable partly in cash and partly in shares.
The share element was matched by the Company on a basis determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Shares awarded were allocated to a share bank, a proportion of which was released to participants annually after a retention period.
The DEPP ceased to operate for financial years beginning after 1 May 2004 and was replaced by the LTIP.
Half of the shares held in share banks on that date were released to participants on 29 April 2005 and the remainder on 28 April 2006.
One senior executive retains a share bank.
c Taxable benefits Each of the executive directors is entitled to the use of a company car with related benefits or cash payments in lieu and is a member of the non-contributory medical expenses plan which provides benefits similar to those applicable in similar companies.
d Pensions and related benefits The executive directors accrued benefits under the senior executive section of DSG Retirement & Employee Security Scheme DRESS.
This is a funded, HM Revenue and Customs registered contributory pension scheme which provides a pension at normal retirement age 60 of two-thirds of pensionable salary subject to a minimum period of 20 years membership.
Part of this pension may be commuted for cash at the date of retirement.
Membership of the scheme also confers dependants pensions, insured lump sums on death in service and benefits in the event of prolonged disability.
Details of pension benefits earned by directors during the financial period are shown on page 53.
Cash bonuses earned since 2004 05 are not included as part of pensionable salary.
Following the implementation of the Finance Act 2004, John Clare, whose accrued pension at 6 April 2006 was valued in excess of the Lifetime Allowance, has elected to continue to accrue pensionable service on existing terms, but subject to the new tax regime.
He has the option to withdraw from DRESS, in which case he will 50 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 Governance receive a taxable salary supplement of 30 per cent of his base pay, representing the contributions that the Company would otherwise have paid to DRESS.
Notwithstanding the abolition of the statutory earnings cap for pensions purposes on 6 April 2006, an equivalent cap, adjusted annually for inflation, has been introduced for the purposes of DRESS.
Kevin OByrne will continue to receive a salary supplement equivalent to the contributions which would otherwise have been paid by the Company to DRESS on that part of his pensionable salary which exceeds the earnings cap.
A similar arrangement applies to nine other senior executives.
The salary cap will apply to new externally recruited executive directors who will be offered membership of the money purchase section of DRESS with a salary supplement.
Any such directors will have the option to use the supplement to pay additional voluntary contributions within the annual allowance introduced by the Finance Act 2004. e Service agreements Each of the executive directors has a service agreement with DSG Retail Limited which may be terminated at any time by 12 months notice.
Service agreements contain neither a liquidated damages nor a change of control clause.
It is the Companys policy to ensure that any payments made to a director in the event of the early termination of a service agreement reflect the circumstances giving rise to termination and, where considered appropriate, the obligation of the outgoing director to mitigate his loss.
Accordingly, compensation payments are normally paid in instalments and are conditional on the leavers employment and earnings status.
