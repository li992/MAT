The Committee routinely analyses remuneration practices in two groups of comparable companies, the first being UK listed businesses of comparable size and scope to Lonmin, the second being direct international peers in the mining sector with whom we are in direct competition in the recruitment of experienced executive talent.
The aim of the Remuneration Committee is to ensure that our remuneration framework is competitive with the latter without being out of step with the former.
In this way, the Committee aims to avoid generating excessive reward for Lonmins Directors and senior executives.
Full details of each element of the Directors remuneration package are set out on page 18 together with an analysis on page 19 showing the various elements of remuneration as a percentage of base salary.

The Board commissions an independent review of non-executive Directors fees every two years, the most recent of which was conducted in August 2005.
No change was made to the non-executive Directors fees, which have not been increased since 2002.

Fixed pay for executive Directors and senior executives Basic pay Whilst the Remuneration Committee tends to have regard to total compensation, including performance-related elements, individuals inevitably focus on headline basic pay, especially at the point of recruitment.
For this reason, the Company needs to offer salaries at around median market levels so that it is able to attract and retain suitable directors and executives, but without paying more than is necessary.
Salaries are reviewed once annually, as at 1 October, taking into account annual performance review data and this together with the restructuring of the Directors remuneration and contracts resulted in year-on-year changes in their salaries of 10% in the case of Brad Mills, 16% in the case of Ian Farmer and an increase of 4% in respect of John Robinson.
Increases in salaries of the senior executives and individuals in the United Kingdom increased between 3% and 5%.
The salaries of our general workforce in South Africa increased by CPI 2% due under the New Era Labour Agreement.
In addition to the annual salary review, a more comprehensive review of remuneration strategy was carried out in South Africa following which the packages for senior executives and managers was restructured.
The remuneration policy in force previously was in line with common practice in South Africa, however, in order to simplify the package structure and to make consistent with international norms, certain historic fringe benefits were rolled into a clean basic salary figure without the need for additional compensation.

The defined benefit pension plan has a normal retirement age for all members in service at or after 1 April 1998 of 60 : members in service prior to that date can opt to retire at 65.
Members can request early retirement once they reach age 50 or at any time due to incapacity, with their accrued pension being subject to actuarial reduction for early payment.
Commutation of pension on retirement enables members to exchange part of their pension for a tax-free lump sum, subject to tax limits.

There were no changes to the basis on which benefits accrued during the period to 6 April 2006.
2 The pension entitlement shown above is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 60, but based on pensionable service to 6 April 2006.
The normal retirement date for Ian Farmer is 25 March 2022 and for John Robinson is 4 August 2014.
3 The increase in transfer value represents the increase over the year in the capital amount that the Director would be entitled to transfer to another pension scheme on leaving the Company.
Changes in this value arise from a number of sources including the increase in the executives accrued pension over the year, investment returns on the transfer value at the start of the year, and changes in actuarial assumptions.
The figure therefore reflects prevailing market conditions at the date on which it is evaluated.
For clarity, it is not a sum due to the Director nor can it meaningfully be added to the Directors remuneration for the year.
4 This adjusts the increase in transfer value to reflect both inflation and the fact that the Director has shared in the funding of the increased pension provision by contributing 5% of his pensionable pay to the scheme.
The pension entitlements shown exclude any benefits that might be attributable to additional voluntary contributions.
Pensions generally No element of any Directors remuneration other than basic salary is pensionable.
Except as disclosed above, the Company has given no undertakings to arrange or bear the cost of any other pension benefits for any Director.
No former Director enjoys pension benefits in excess of those provided, in accordance with the provisions of the trust deeds and rules, to all members of the relevant scheme.
Life assurance Ian Farmer and John Robinson remain members of the Companys defined benefit pension scheme for death in service benefits, and as such are entitled to life assurance of four times their base salary, and the level of spouses pension earned during their pensionable service in that Scheme.
Brad Mills is entitled to life assurance benefits of four times his annual salary under his contract of employment.
Until 6 April 2006, Brad Mills was a life assurance only member of the Lonmin Superannuation Scheme in respect of salary up to the Inland Revenue earnings cap, and was provided by the Company with unapproved life assurance on his salary in excess of the cap, the premium for which is a benefit in kind and included as such in the remuneration table.
From 6 April 2006, the Company provided all three Directors with life assurance benefits by way of excepted life arrangements.

The Company provides the opportunity to earn an annual cash bonus through a balanced scorecard approach, assessing performance under four broad headings, being as follows the weighting generally attaching to each component is quoted as a percentage of overall bonus opportunity : Executive Directors Percentage of bonus opportunity Actual payment on offer for the year for target % of bonus Component and constituent elements performance opportunity SHEC matters 15% Safety number of fatalities at Marikana 2.5% 1.9% Safety improvement in lost time injury frequency rate 2.5% 3.1% Environment notifiable events and fines 5.0% 0.0% Community score in annual baseline survey 5.0% 7.5% Shareholder alignment 40% Bonusable EBIT 20% 10.8% Free cash flow 20% 25.4% Production and growth 5% Primary mine production of platinum 2.0% 0.0% Capital projects on time and within budget 0.5% 0.5% Capital projects total spend measure 0.5% 0.5% C1 unit costs 2.0% 0.0% Personal objectives 40% 1 Delivery of key projects 40% 34.0% Total 100% 83.7% 1 Average for the three executive Directors.
The bonus elements and relative weightings detailed above were selected as these best captured the steps needing to be taken to improve the delivery of value to shareholders, and all were capable of objective measurement and independent verification.
For each individual element, three levels of attainment were set: Threshold the minimum level of attainment for which the committee felt payment could be warranted, with generally 75% of the target amount for that element being payable.
Target based on the Companys budget, at which 100% of the bonus for that element becomes payable.
Stretch representing a significant level of outperformance and also acting as a cap on the bonus due for that element, with 150% of the target amount for that element being payable.
The scheme design provides for payment of 80% of base salary to executive Directors 100% in the case of the Chief Executive for overall performance at the target level with the bonus therefore being capped at the stretch level of 120% of base salary 150% in the case of the Chief Executive.
All results have been independently reviewed including where appropriate scrutiny by the external auditors and the committee has subjected the scorecard to a detailed assessment before authorising payment.
Of the bonus resulting, two-thirds is settled in cash and a minimum of one-third on an after tax basis is invested in the Companys deferred annual bonus plan on behalf of the executive concerned.
Of necessity, the design of bonus plans will evolve from year to year, in line with the Companys strategic needs.
The Committee monitors the competitive environment and will devise amended or new plans in future years to ensure that the Company can continue to recruit, retain and motivate the most able senior executives, and that they are given the clearest possible incentive to deliver exceptional value to shareholders.
However, the plan for the year to 30 September 2007 is substantially similar in design to that of the prior year.

The purpose of these legacy schemes is to align Directors and employees interests with those of shareholders.
Since 1994, this has been achieved by making the exercise of options by all participants subject to stretching but realistic performance conditions relating to the delivery of value to shareholders, which must be met before the option can be exercised.
Details of these for the Companys various tranches of executive share options that remain outstanding are as follows: Options granted in or after 1998 but before 2002 exercise is subject to attainment of a performance condition that the total return to shareholders over a consecutive thirty-six month period must be greater than the total return on the Mining Sector of the FTSE Actuaries Share Indices.
The conditions attaching to the options granted in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 were attained in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2006 respectively and these options became exercisable.
Options granted in or after 2002 whilst exercise remains subject to achievement of total shareholder return greater than that on the Mining Sector of the FTSE Actuaries Share Indices, this must be achieved in one of the periods of three, four, five or six years following the date of grant, in each case relative to a fixed base year.
The test for the 2003 grant was satisfied during the year and these options are now exercisable.
The formal re-test of the 2002 grant was carried out on 1 July 2002 and was not met.
For indicative purposes only, a test carried out at the end of the year shows the Company would have met the performance condition but the next formal re-test will not occur until 1 July 2007.
Details of the results are provided below.

The Plan operates through options granted by the trustee of the Companys employee benefit trust at a price of 0.01 per share.
This is designed as an employee retention scheme, although there is an inherent incentive element since participants will benefit from any increase in the Lonmin share price.
Following the introduction of the new long-term incentive arrangements, no further awards are intended to be made under this scheme.
Sharesave The Company has historically offered an Inland Revenue approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme to all UK-remunerated employees, including the executive Directors.
Under this Scheme, the participant enters into a savings contract and in return is granted an option over the Companys shares to be funded by the balance on their savings account at the end of the contractual savings period.
The option price may, at the Committees discretion, be at a discount of up to 20% to the prevailing mid-market price at the date of invitation.
The Company has historically granted all such options with a 20% discount, including those held by John Robinson and Ian Farmer.
The award made during the year was not offered at a discount.

No options or awards of any kind have been granted to nonexecutive Directors.
Directors are strongly encouraged to hold the shares issued to them upon the exercise of options.
Dilution Options granted under ESOS and Sharesave described above are satisfied with newly issued shares, whilst the newer plans operated by the Company such as the LTIP, DABP or the Stay & Prosper Plan are either satisfied with market purchased shares via the Companys off-shore employee benefit trust or where appropriate newly issued shares or are cash settled.

Full details of all outstanding share awards are given in note 27 to the accounts.
Directors shareholding obligation Ultimately, the Committee believes that the most powerful way of ensuring that the actions of the Directors are best aligned with shareholders interests is for the Directors to build up and retain personally significant holdings of the Companys shares.
As a matter of policy, the Board expects all Directors to acquire a shareholding including vested but unexercised share incentives by 30 September 2008 equal in value to 100% of their basic pay or, in the case of non-executive Directors, fees, and 150% in the case of the Chief Executive.
In this way, shareholder value becomes a paramount principle underlying all Board decisions, since real personal wealth will be at stake.
Failure to achieve these targets may result in exclusion from participation in some or all of the incentive schemes that the Company operates.

It is both the Companys policy, and generally a requirement of the individuals contract of employment, that no executive Director may take up such an appointment without the approval of the Board.
The Board believes that in the right circumstances the holding of non-executive directorships and similar appointments by executive Directors can be useful and appropriate if they help those involved gain additional skills and experience, or promote the interests of the Group, and do not necessitate an excessive time commitment.
The Board would not normally agree to an executive Director taking on more than one non-executive directorship of a FTSE100 company, or the chairmanship of such a company.
Whilst it would be considered on a case-by-case basis, any individual holding such a role outside the Group would generally be permitted to retain any fees or other payments relating to that appointment.
Ian Farmer is a nonexecutive director of Incwala Resources Pty Limited, the International Platinum Association and, until 29 September 2006, of Furuya Metals Co. Ltd, a Japanese company undertaking significant research and development into uses for PGMs in which Lonmin has an equity investment.
Mr Farmer has not received and does not receive any remuneration in respect of his services to any of these organisations.
Service contracts The Company complies fully with the provisions of the Combined Code relating to service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee would be responsible for settling any payment to be made if an executive Directors employment ended, and would have full regard to the provisions of the Combined Code and other components of best practice in this area.
