As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the Financial Statements will be laid before the members.
The first part of the report provides details of Northgates remuneration policy.
The second part provides details of the remuneration and share interests of the Directors for the year ended 30 April 2006.
The Remuneration Committee comprises Mr Jack R Fryer Chairman, Mr Nick Starritt and Sir Stephen J Lander, who are all independent Non-Executive Directors.
To ensure compliance with the Code provisions on independence, Mr Nicholas J Irens, the Chairman stepped down from the Remuneration Committee during the course of the year.
The Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board as a whole, for determining the contract terms, remuneration and other benefits, including performance-related bonus schemes and share incentive plans, for the Chairman and the Executive Directors.
Mrs D Knight, Human Resources Director, provides advice and information to the Committee when required.
In addition, the law firm Pinsent Masons were appointed by the Board to advise on the introduction of the new Northgate 2006 Performance Share Plan and The Northgate 2006 Approved Executive Share Option Plan in particular on the performance criteria for awards under both schemes each of these is discussed in more detail below and service contract terms.
Pinsent Masons have also provided human resource and commercial advice to the Group.
Throughout the year the Committee also received advice from Kepler Associates, remuneration consultants to the Board, and Hoare Govett on these new share incentive plans.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is fixed by the Board.
Directors do not participate in decisions regarding their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee met six times during the year.
Remuneration Policy Objectives The objectives of the remuneration policy for Executive Directors are: the total remuneration package should be competitive to attract, motivate and retain Directors of a high calibre: remuneration should be a combination of performance driven cash and equity-based rewards in addition to base salary and benefits: and performance driven rewards should potentially form a significant portion of total rewards, to motivate the highest performance and align the interests of the Executives with those of the shareholders.
The graph below shows as a percentage the components of Directors remuneration for the year ended 30 April 2006.

The overall remuneration package can consist of a base salary, annual bonus, pension rights, share options and car, medical and life assurance benefits.
It is the policy of the Committee to review the remuneration package offered to the Directors on an ongoing basis and make recommendations for changes where it is considered appropriate.
Performance-related pay represents a significant proportion of the total remuneration package.
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are set in line with market rates.
Base Salary In setting the base salary for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee reviews relevant market data and considers the Directors experience, performance and responsibilities both internally and in comparison to similar companies in the IT sector.
Each Directors base salary is generally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change in responsibilities.
Annual Bonus Bonuses are determined by reference to base salary, the achievement of the annual operating plan agreed by the full Board each year, the successful completion of specific corporate objectives and the attainment of a number of personal stretch targets.
It is the policy of the Committee to keep under review the objectives set and the proportions of base salary payable.
The Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to a cash bonus.
Pension and Other Benefits The Executive Directors of Northgate Information Solutions plc are entitled to become members of the Groups pension scheme, details of which are set out in note 18, or to have comparable pension contributions made to a personal pension scheme on their behalf.
No pension contributions are made on behalf of the Non-Executive Directors.
Other benefits provided consist of a car or allowance towards vehicle running costs, and medical life assurance benefits.
Pension and other benefits provided are subject to regular review by the Company to ensure that they remain attractive and competitive.
Share Incentives At the Company's Extraordinary General Meeting on 12 January 2006, shareholders approved the establishment of two new share plans.
"These are:- The Northgate 2006 Performance Share Plan the ""Performance Share Plan"" which replaces the Northgate 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme: and The Northgate 2006 Approved Executive Share Option Plan the ""Approved Plan"" that allows tax-approved options to be granted up to the statutory limit currently 30,000."
Under the Performance Share Plan, an individual will be granted a right to receive shares for no cost, which will normally vest after three years subject to continued employment and the achievement of stretching performance targets.
The Approved Plan is a standard HMRC approved share option plan.
The new plans were introduced following an extensive review of the Company's share plans by the Remuneration Committee.
This review focused on the need to manage dilution from share plans and on the performance targets for future share awards.
Kepler Associates were engaged to carry out a benchmarking exercise and formulate proposals for a new share incentive scheme.
In conjunction with Hoare Govett consultative meetings were held with ABI and RREV on the proposed new plans to ensure that these reflected recommended market practice.
Following these meetings the Company discussed its draft proposals with its leading institutional investors and changes were introduced to accommodate specific comments.
The final plans were submitted to the Board by the Remuneration Committee before being recommended to shareholders for approval at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 12 January 2006.
"All of the Company's share plans operate within a 15% ""dilution limit""."
This limit was introduced when the 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme was introduced.
At that time the Group was in serious financial difficulties and needed to attract high quality management.
With the approval of shareholders at the time, the Group secured the services of Mr Christopher R Stone, the current Chief Executive.
Mr Stone was awarded approximately 17.0m options.
This issue in turn led the Company to acquire shareholder approval to issue options up to 15% of its share capital, thereby permitting a number of other senior managers to be incentivised over the medium term.
This is seen as being integral to the substantial growth in profitability and share price since 1999.
NORTHGATE INFORMATION SOLUTIONS PLC 29 The Company's continued use of the 15% dilution limit was endorsed by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting, when technical changes were made to the limit so that the limit reflected a percentage, rather than a fixed number of shares that required frequent adjustment.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the Performance Share Plan will be more efficient in share usage than the current 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme that it is replacing, as in order to generate an equivalent level of value, awards may be made over a smaller number of shares.
The new plans will continue to operate within the 15% dilution limit.
The Company will manage its remaining capacity within this limit carefully and will use both new issue shares and shares purchased in the market to satisfy awards.
The Company is committed to working towards the more usual 10% dilution limit for share plans over time and the introduction of the new Performance Share Plan will help facilitate this.
"The Performance Targets applied to initial awards made under the Performance Share Plan are a mix of challenging Earnings per Share ""EPS"" growth targets for half of the award and a relative Total Shareholder Return ""TSR"" target for the other half of the award."
These Performance Targets will apply separately to the shares to which they relate.
The Performance Targets are considered by the Committee to be demanding and have been chosen to reward executives for increasing shareholder return and improving financial performance.
The Performance Periods will be three years from the award date for the TSR performance target and three financial years for the EPS performance target, beginning with the financial year in which the award is granted.
Awards will vest on the following basis, with no subsequent retesting after the end of the respective performance periods:- Performance EPS Target TSR Target Potential level 50% of award 50% of award reward TSR performance of a Northgate Percentage of total award that Compound Annual Growth Rate of share compared to TSR will vest on achievement of the Relative Benchmark Northgate EPS in excess of inflation performance of the FTSE EPS Target or the TSR Target over 3 years techMARK 100 Index over 3 years Upper Quartile 12% pa or more Index performance plus 11% 50% pa compound or more Between Median and Upper Between 3% pa and 12% pa Between Index performance and Between 12.5% and 50% on a Quartile Index performance plus 11% pa straight line basis compound Median 3% pa At Index performance 12.5% Below Median Less than 3% pa Less than Index performance Nil In the event that a participant receives an award over shares worth more than 100% of basic salary in any financial year, the proportion of that award that will vest at the median performance level will be 10%.
For the purposes of the performance targets, EPS will be adjusted basic EPS as reported in the Group's statutory accounts.
The Company's TSR will be compared to the TSR performance of the FTSE techMARK 100 Index.
TSR will be averaged over the 3 months prior to the beginning and end of the performance period.
The Committee will review the continuing appropriateness of these Performance Targets in future years.
The Committee will endeavour to set the EPS and TSR targets at the relative benchmark performance levels shown in the above table with Upper Quartile performance being required over a three year period for all awards to vest.

The compounding takes as a base notional earnings of 6.54m for the year to December 1997. b As agreed with shareholders, the exercise of 40% of these options is not subject to specific performance conditions.
Dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares averaging between at least 35.0p and 55.0p over a six month period prior to exercise, proportions of the remaining options are exercisable up to a maximum of 60%.
c The exercise of these options is dependent on the average mid-market price of the Companys shares over a six month period prior to exercise exceeding 75.0p, and whether certain business unit growth targets for the 2001 2002 financial year compared to the preceding financial year were achieved.
d The exercise of these options is dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares averaging at least 75.0p over a six month period prior to exercise.
e Exercise of 40% of the options is dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares over a six month period prior to exercise exceeding 55.0p.
Exercise of 20% of the options is dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares over a six month period prior to exercise exceeding 65.0p.
Exercise of 40% of the options is dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares over a six month period prior to exercise exceeding 75.0p.
All exercises are further dependent on whether certain business unit profit targets for the 2001 2002 financial year were achieved.
f Exercise of 40% of the options is dependent on whether certain business unit contribution targets for 2002 2003 were achieved.
Exercise of proportions of the remaining 60% of the options is further dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares over a six month period prior to exercise averaging between at least 55.0p and 75.0p.
NORTHGATE INFORMATION SOLUTIONS PLC 35 Interests in Share Incentive Plans continued g Exercise of 40% of the options is dependent on the adjusted EPS of the Group as calculated in the 2001 02 accounts growing at a compound rate greater than 15% per annum by the date that the options become exercisable.
Exercise of proportions of the remaining options are further dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares averaging between at least 55.0p and 75.0p over a six month period prior to exercise.
h Exercise of 40% of the options is dependent on exceeding certain business unit performance measures compared to budget for 2003 04.

i As agreed with shareholders, the exercise of 40% of the options is not subject to specific performance conditions.
Dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares averaging between at least 40.0p and 60.0p over a six month period prior to exercise, proportions of the remaining options are exercisable up to a maximum of 60%.
j As agreed with shareholders, the exercise of these options is dependent on the Companys shares showing a Cumulative Total Shareholder Return of at least 8% plus Retail Price Index RPI per year within three years of the date of Grant, using the Option Price as the starting point.
For the purposes of this condition, Cumulative Total Shareholder Return can be the increase in Share Price, the value of the dividend s per share paid or a combination of the two.
Whether this condition is met will be determined by taking the highest consecutive 90 day average mid-market closing share price over the three years and adding any dividend per share paid in the same period.
k As agreed with shareholders, share awards under the Performance Share Plan are 50% dependent upon the Companys shares showing a Total Shareholder Return TSR of at least 11% per annum above the TSR performance of the FTSE techMARK 100 Index over a three year vesting period and 50% dependent upon a compound annual growth rate in adjusted basic EPS of the Group of more than 12% above RPI in respect of the same three year vesting period.
The interests in share options detailed above include those of the Director and his immediate family.
These performance conditions are considered appropriate because they provide challenging but achievable targets in order to incentivise the holder to work towards and achieve the expectations of the Company and its shareholders.
In assessing whether the performance conditions have been met, the Remuneration Committee considers whether the criteria for successful completion of each individual condition have been achieved or exceeded.
These methods of assessment were chosen because they provide a clearly defined process for the Remuneration Committee to determine successful completion of each condition and are consistent with other performance monitoring procedures used within the Company as a whole.
The market price of the Companys shares at 28 April 2006 was 78.00p and the range during the year ended 30 April 2006 was 67.00p to 92.50p.
The Register of Directors Interests contains full details of Directors shareholdings and options to subscribe for shares and is available for inspection at the Registered Office of the Company.
