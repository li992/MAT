The Morgan Crucible Company plc 45 Remuneration report The Directors remuneration report is presented to shareholders by the Board.
The report complies with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations and the Company complied with the provisions of the July 2003 edition of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance relating to Directors remuneration.
As noted on page 40 the Company has voluntarily adopted the June 2006 version of the Code for the year beginning 5 January 2007 and accordingly, as noted on page 43, the Chairman is a member of the Remuneration Committee.
Auditable part The schedule of Directors pay and benefits and accompanying notes on pages 48 and 49, the table of pension benefits and accompanying notes on page 50 and the table of executive Directors share options on page 49 comprise the auditable part of the Directors Remuneration report, being the information required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
A resolution inviting shareholders to approve this report will be put to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 20 April 2007.
The Remuneration Committee The members of the Committee are Simon Heale, Chairman: Tim Stevenson: Joe MacHale: and Martin Flower.
Each of these Directors is regarded by the Board as independent and served throughout the year, apart from Tim Stevenson who was appointed to the Board on 1 December 2006 as Chairman and joined the Committee from that date.
Tim Stevenson was independent at the time of his appointment to the Board.
No other Directors were members of the Committee during the year.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee and the Chief Executive Officer attends meetings of the Committee by invitation.
No executive Director or other attendee is present when his or her own remuneration is under consideration.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing Group policy on executive remuneration and for determining, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for the executive Directors and the Chairman.
The Committees terms of reference are available on our website.
The Remuneration Committee met eight times during the year and has the authority to obtain the advice of outside independent remuneration consultants.
During the year, in addition to receiving advice and assistance from the Chief Executive Officer, the Company Secretary, and the Director of Human Resources of the Carbon Division, the Committee referred to information compiled by Towers Perrin and Incomes Data Services.
During 2007 the Committee will undertake a full review of its terms of reference, its polices and processes, including its use of external advisors with re-tendering processes where appropriate.
Remuneration policy The remuneration policies adopted by the Committee and which will continue to apply during 2007 are: a Total level of remuneration The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior executives of the right calibre in order to run the Company successfully and to deliver value for shareholders.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Committee compares the packages offered by similar companies to ensure the remuneration packages for executive Directors are competitive against the market in which we compete for talent.
Comparator companies are chosen having regard to: i the size of the company its turnover, profits and number of people employed: ii the diversity and complexity of its businesses: iii the geographical spread of its businesses: and iv its restructuring and expansion profile.
The intention is to ensure rewards are linked to corporate and individual performance.
This policy takes account of the decentralised and differing nature of our businesses in addition to reflecting the technical challenges we face in a global market place.
Individual performance is assessed against personal objectives, and corporate performance of the relevant Division in respect of the remuneration of senior Divisional management and against the performance of the Group for the remainder of the Executive Committee.
b Main components of remuneration The policy of the Committee is to place greater emphasis on performance-related rewards with measurable targets.
These are designed to reduce the proportion of fixed remuneration and provide for a growing element of at risk pay, which is only available when good results are achieved.
In this way, there is a strong link between reward and performance which should be beneficial to shareholders, employees and the Company.
The targets are set on the basis of challenging performance criteria reflecting the objectives of the Company.
The main components of remuneration are: i Basic salary and benefits in kind Basic salary for each executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the performance of the individual and information taken from independent sources based on companies of comparable size and complexity in the FTSE 350.
Benefits include a company car or an allowance in lieu, health insurance and, where appropriate, relocation and other expenses.
Basic salaries for executive Directors and senior executive roles were reviewed during 2006.
The current basic salaries for the executive Directors are as follows: Mark Robertshaw 400,000 effective from 4 August 2006 Kevin Dangerfield 215,000 effective from 4 August 2006 Mark Lejman 270,000 effective from 1 July 2006 A salary review for executive Directors and senior executives will be carried out in July 2007.
46 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Remuneration report ii Annual bonus The targets for annual bonus are set by the Remuneration Committee, balancing shortand long-term requirements of the Company.
Challenging goals are set, which must be met before any bonus is paid.
This approach is intended to align executive reward with shareholder return by rewarding the achievement of stretch targets and fostering the continued development of inter-divisional cooperation and collaboration.
The annual bonus is not pensionable.
The bonus scheme provides the opportunity of earning a maximum bonus of 100% of basic salary if certain stretch targets are achieved.
Of this, 90% relates to financial targets and 10% relates to the achievement of personal objectives.
For 2006 the financial element for executive Directors and senior executives with Group responsibilities was based on the achievement of underlying operating profit targets up to 75% of salary and operating cash flow performance up to 15% of salary.
For executive Directors and senior executives with Divisional responsibilities the financial element was structured such that up to 65% of salary was payable on the achievement of operating profit targets and up to 25% of salary was payable for the achievement of working capital targets.
For 2007, the financial element for executive Directors and senior executives with Group responsibilities will be based on underlying operating profit performance up to 80% of salary and operating cash flow up to 10% of salary.
For executive Directors and senior executives with Divisional responsibilities the financial criteria are tailored to each Division and include both underlying profit performance and working capital criteria.
The 10% for the achievement of personal objectives applies to all participants.
Operating profit is defined as earnings before interest and tax EBIT.
For these purposes, operating profit excludes all special items e. g. certain restructuring costs, corporate disposals of businesses and property and significant one-off litigation costs relating to the prior year and any major one-off non-operating charges e. g. special one-off pension contributions.
Operating cash is defined as earnings before interest, tax and amortisation costs EBITA, adjusted for depreciation charge non-cash item, movements in working capital, provisions, capital expenditure, profit and loss on sale of plant and machinery, operating tax charges and net finance charges.
For these purposes operating cash flow excludes any one-off cash costs for special items defined above, plus major one-off tax claims, dividends or any corporate cash flow such as rights issues or the purchase of shares.
The Committee has the discretion to vary the awards made.
The average bonus awarded to executive Directors who served during the year in relation to their performance in 2006 was 96% of salary.
This was based on the Companys strong results for the year and on each Directors individual performance.
iii Share schemes We believe that share ownership by the executive Directors and senior executives helps align their interests with those of the shareholders.
Accordingly the Company operates a number of share schemes for the executive Directors and other senior employees, as follows: Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and offers executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity to receive shares as a reward for outstanding performance.
The scheme allows allocations of up to 150% of basic salary, although in exceptional circumstances the Committee is able to make share awards of up to 200% of basic salary.
The vesting of the share allocation is subject to the achievement of performance targets measured over the three year period from the start of the year in which the allocation is made.
The performance criteria compares the Companys total shareholder return TSR over the three-year period with that of a comparator group which comprises the FTSE 350 at the date of the grant.
If, over the three year period, the Companys total shareholder return performance places it at the median of the comparator group, 30% of an allocation will vest.
Allocations under the LTIP are released in full if the Companys TSR places it in the upper quartile of the FTSE 350 comparator group.
For performance between median and upper quartile, awards vest on a straight-line pro-rata basis.
In addition, awards will only vest if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that this is justified by the Companys underlying financial performance over the period.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS was also approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and offers executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity to receive options granted at the market price of the Companys shares at the time of the grant.
The maximum value of option awards that can be made to executive Directors and other senior executives is 150% of salary, although in exceptional circumstances the Committee is able to make option grants of up to 200% of basic salary.
The ability to exercise options is subject to the achievement of performance criteria based on the Companys TSR performance measured over the three-year period from the start of the year in which the option is granted.
TSR is measured against a comparator group comprising the FTSE 350 at the date of grant.
If the Companys TSR performance places it at the median of the comparator group, 30% of the option will be exercisable, with 100% of the option being exercisable for upper quartile performance.
For performance between median and upper quartile, options are exercisable on a straight-line pro-rata basis.
In addition, as with the LTIP awards, options will only become exercisable if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that this is justified by the Companys underlying financial performance over the period.
In 2006 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance criteria for the existing LTIP and ESOS and confirmed that the combination of the TSR performance measure, which takes into account long-term share price performance relative to the comparator group, and the confirmation by the Committee that vesting exercise is justified by the Companys underlying financial performance over the period, continues to be appropriate.
Awards under the LTIP and ESOS were made during the year to a very limited number of executive Directors and employees who were either promoted or appointed to key positions during 2006.
In 2006 awards were made to 14 executives around the world, including certain executive Directors, over 477,500 shares under the LTIP and 398,500 shares under the ESOS.
The details of Options and Awards held by all Directors are shown on page 49.
Award to CEO on appointment In February 2006 the Remuneration Committee resolved to grant a one-off performance related incentive award to Mark Robertshaw as part of the remuneration package made available on his appointment as Chief Executive Officer.
This award was considered to be appropriate in order to retain his services in the role of Chief Executive Officer, and to incentivise him to continue the strong performance achieved over the past three years.
The award is structured as a market value option over 1,000,000 shares subject to the achievement of performance conditions that also apply for awards under the ESOS.
No portion of the award will vest if the Companys TSR is below the median of the FTSE 350 over three years, with the award only vesting in full for upper quartile performance.
The Committee must also be satisfied that the Companys underlying financial performance justifies the level of vesting.
The structure of the award means that Mark Robertshaw will only be rewarded where there has been real value created for shareholders.
The terms on which the option was granted were, in all essential matters, the same as the terms on which options are granted under the ESOS.
Remuneration report The Morgan Crucible Company plc 47 Due to the unsolicited approach received by the Company in August 2006, which could have led to a cash offer for the Company, the grant of the award was effectively delayed from the time of Mark Robertshaws appointment as Chief Executive Officer in August until December 2006.
The option exercise price of 256 pence per share reflects the market value of the shares at the date of award which was higher than at the date of his appointment as Chief Executive Officer.
To the extent that the performance criteria are satisfied and the option is exercised, the exercise of the option will be satisfied by the transfer of the relevant number of shares to Mark Robertshaw from the Companys Employee Benefit Trust.
No new shares will be issued to satisfy this option, instead shares have been acquired in the market by the trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust.
At 4 January 2007, The Morgan Crucible General Employee Benefit Trust held a total of 10,182,157 shares.
As UK employees, the executive Directors may also participate in the Savings-related Share Option Scheme on the same basis as other eligible employees and subject to UK legislation.
Scheme members save a fixed amount per month over three years and options have been granted at 80% of the market price.
Those Directors who received options under this scheme are shown in the table on page 49.
No performance conditions apply to those options as they are a mechanism for all employees to acquire shares in the Company at their own cost.
c Company policy on contracts of service The Companys policy is that executive Directors are employed on contracts subject to one years notice at any time with, where appropriate, provision for the payment of predetermined damages in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances.
The Company will apply the principle of mitigation to any payment of compensation on termination.
Contracts may be terminated on 12 months notice given by the Company or on six months notice given by the Director concerned.
Contracts end on each Directors anticipated normal retirement date.
The following table shows the date of the contract and the notice period for each executive Director who served during the year.
Executive Director Date of contract Notice period Kevin Dangerfield 3 August 2006 12 months Warren Knowlton 9 December 2002 n a Mark Lejman 1 March 2004 12 months Mark Robertshaw 4 August 2006 12 months Mark Robertshaws service contract contains specific termination provisions such that the Company may terminate his contract by making a payment in lieu of notice to include basic salary, pension contribution, car allowance and, at our discretion, bonus for the period of the notice.
If a discretionary bonus is paid, this shall be the pro-rata value of the average bonus paid to him in the two years prior to termination or 35% of basic salary, which ever is the greater.
The service contracts for Kevin Dangerfield and Mark Lejman do not contain specific termination provisions.
In the event of early termination, the Company may be liable to pay an amount in damages having regard to salary, bonus and other benefits that would have been received had the Director served out his notice period.
Warren Knowlton served up until his retirement on 3 August 2006 at which time his service contract ended.
No compensation was paid on termination of his contract.
d Company pensions policy regarding executive Directors The executive Directors participate in The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which is a contributory, HMRC-registered, defined benefit, funded occupational pension scheme.
With effect from 6 April 2006 the basis of the scheme switched from final salary to career average and the normal pension age increased by five years.
Its main features are now: i a normal pension age of 65: ii pension at normal pension age of two-thirds career average pensionable salary, subject to completion of 20 years employment 26 years and eight months for new members : iii life assurance of four times basic salary: iv dependants pension on death.
Pensionable salary is the members basic salary restricted to an earnings cap 108,600 for the 2006 7 tax year.
In addition, an executive Director receives a pension allowance derived from employer contributions based notionally on the registered scheme pensionable salary in excess of the earnings cap as at 5 April 2006.
The value of the pension allowance for each executive Director is set out in the Schedule of Pay and Benefits table below.
The pension allowance was frozen in value at 5 April 2006 for members of the scheme at that date and will not apply to new members.
Warren Knowlton retired on 3 August 2006 and was not a member of the above scheme.
He received a pension allowance derived from employer contributions based notionally on basic salary.
e Total shareholder return The following graph shows the cumulative total shareholder return TSR for the Company for the five-year period to 4 January 2007 against the FTSE 350.
Both are rebased to 100 as at 5 January 2002.
The index selected was the FTSE 350 as it was considered to be a broad comparator group of companies and was also relevant to the performance of the Company in respect of its LTIP and ESOS.
