2 Stewart Miller also received a payment of 501,000 based on 12 months salary and benets for the early termination of his service agreement and 102,178 as compensation for his lost pension rights.
3 In addition to these fees Rod Kent received 18,750 as chairman of Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited.
4 As explained in the Annual Report and Accounts 2004 5, the annual incentive arrangements which were put in place for senior executives for the 2005 6 financial year included a cash element, a deferred equity element and an LTIP element.
The performance related payment gures in the table above are made up of the cash element only.
5 These gures include the performance related payments for 2004 5 which were made up of a cash element, a deferred equity element and an LTIP element.
The LTIP element is conditional on the achievement of the TSR targets described in the 2004 5 Annual Report and it assumes that it vests in full.
The LTIP award made to Stewart Miller lapsed when he left the Company.
6 The total emoluments for 2004 5 included two former directors not included in the table above.
Directors pension entitlements audited information None of the executive directors are accruing benets under any other Company pension arrangements.
No elements of executive directors pay packages are pensionable other than base salaries.
Neither the Chairman nor the non-executive directors are entitled to participate in any of these pension arrangements.
Dened benefit The dened benefit pension entitlements of the executive directors are as follows: Transfer value of Increase, before increase, before Accumulated Increase in accrued ination, in accrued ination, less accrued benets benets during benets during any directors 2 March 2006 the year the year contributions Alan Parker 115,390 171,415 179,159 3,361,296 Angie Risley 113,892 25,755 23,375 303,292 Former directors Stewart Miller 71,558 77,458 81,481 N A David Richardson 152,275 29,140 34,038 N A PAGE 12 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2005 6 The transfer value of each directors accrued benets at the end of the financial year is as follows: Movement, less directors 2 March 2006 3 March 2005 contributions 1 Alan Parker 2,159,659 4,701,707 2,542,048 Angie Risley 1,467,377 866,853 600,524 Former directors Stewart Miller 1,771,707 1,798,348 26,641 David Richardson 3,532,428 3,727,603 195,175 Transfer values represent a liability of the pension fund, not a sum paid or due to the individual.
1 The movement in the transfer values during the year reects both the changes in market conditions which define the assumptions to be used in calculating transfer values and the value of the change in the directors accrued benets during the year.
Pension policy was reviewed during the year in light of new legislation and details can be found on page 9.
David Richardson and Stewart Miller both left the Company and commenced drawing their pensions during the year.
As both directors commuted part of their pension for tax free cash sums in accordance with the scheme rules, their accrued benets fell during the year.
Alan Parker is entitled to a dened benefit pension under the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, as set out in the table on page 12.
He also has an entitlement to a cash sum at retirement in lieu of his benets from the Whitbread Group Unapproved Pension Scheme.
As at 2 March 2006, Alan had an accrued pension of 254,412 per annum from the Unapproved Scheme, equivalent to an accrued lump sum of 4,014,664.
Following his decision to opt out of the Fund on 31 May 2005, he also received a cash supplement of 155,142 during the year.
Dened contribution Christopher Rogers received employer pension contributions into the Companys money purchase scheme of 29,040.
In addition, he received salary supplements totalling 56,898 in respect of his salary in excess of the earnings cap.
Deferred Bonus Plan the Plan audited information At 2 March 2006 the directors held the following deferred shares under the Plan: Year of Balance Awarded Lapsed Vested Balance Market Date Market Gain 1 award at 4 3 05 at 2 3 06 Release price at award price at loss on date award vested vesting vesting Alan Parker 2004 6,831 6,831 6 5 07 768.5p 2005 17,731 17,731 1 3 08 904.3p 6,831 17,731 24,562 Angie Risley 2004 6,994 6,994 6 5 07 768.5p 2005 8,865 8,865 1 3 08 904.3p 6,994 8,865 15,859 2,114 2,114 956 Stewart Miller 2005 N A 904.3p 30 9 05 949.5p 2,114 2,114 956 David Richardson 2004 12,532 12,532 N A 768.5p 30 4 05 831.0p 7,833 2005 12,428 12,428 N A 904.3p 30 4 05 831.0p 9,110 12,532 12,428 24,960 1,277 1 The gain loss on vesting is calculated using the dierence between the full market value of the award at the date of the award this gure was disclosed in the directors remuneration table in the relevant years remuneration report and the market value of the award on the date of vesting.
The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to the director remaining an employee of Whitbread at that date.
If the director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee the awards will be released in full.
If the director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread for any other reason the proportion of award which vests depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date the director ceases to be an employee.
In the case of awards granted in 2004 the proportion that would lapse is 50%.
For awards granted in 2005, 75% would lapse if the director leaves between 1 March 2006 and 28 February 2007 and 50% would lapse if the director leaves between 1 March 2007 and 29 February 2008.
David Richardson and Stewart Miller left the Company during the year.
Their awards vested in full on their respective leaving dates.
The monetary values of their awards in the table above are based on the market price of Whitbread shares on their respective leaving dates.
As a result the awards did not vest.
David Richardson had not exercised his nil cost option at the date he stepped down from the Board.
The information below refers to any awards made up to the date of the 2004 AGM.
Please refer to pages 10 to 11 for details of the Plan after that date.
Participation in the Plan is available to executive directors and a small number of other senior executives.
The Plan aligns the long-term interests of participants with those of the Company and its shareholders and is designed to deliver superior performance from participants and to improve shareholder value.
The Plan rewards executives with shares rather than cash benets.
Awards are based on three-year performance periods and were calculated by taking half of the executives salary at the start of the period and dividing it by the Whitbread share price averaged over the five business days preceding the start of the performance period.
The measure of performance is TSR.
Awards made prior to the 2004 AGM vest in part if the Company performs at median, increasing to full vesting for top quartile performance relative to the comparator group of companies.
This means that at the 50th percentile, 50% of the award will be paid and at the 75th percentile, 100% of the award will be paid, with a straight line operating in between.
The comparator group for the 2003, 2004 and 2005 awards were the constituents of the FTSE All Share Hotels and Leisure index with a market capitalisation of over 150 million as at 1 March 2003, 1 March 2004 and 1 March 2005 respectively.
PAGE 14 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2005 6 Share options audited information The Remuneration Committee has no intention of granting any further executive options.
The last general grant of options was made on 17 May 2004.
The performance target for these options will require Whitbread to have an earnings per share growth of RPI plus 12% in 2006 7 compared to that for 2003 4.
To the extent that this performance condition is not met at this time, the options will lapse, i. e. there will be no opportunity to retest performance conditions.
The Committee considered that earnings per share was the appropriate financial test for market value options because the option has an inherent share price growth target.
A one-o grant of an option under the Companys executive share option schemes was made on 23 May 2005 as disclosed in the 2004 5 Annual Report and Accounts.
The performance target for this option will require Whitbread to have an earnings per share growth of RPI plus 12% in 2007 8 compared to that for 2004 5.
As is the case for the options granted in 2004, there will be no opportunity to retest performance conditions.
Options granted between 1996 and 2000 cannot be exercised unless either adjusted EPS growth exceeds RPI plus 2% per annum over any three consecutive years during the life of the option or TSR exceeds the average of the FTSE 100 Index over the same period.
For options granted between June 2000 and June 2003 the performance conditions require the Companys adjusted earnings per share to exceed RPI plus 4% per annum measured over any three consecutive years out of the ten year performance period.
Performance conditions have been satisfied in respect of all options granted between June 1996 and June 2002.
Executive directors may also participate in the Companys Savings-related Share Option Scheme which is open to all employees on the same terms.
The exercise periods shown below are the normal exercise periods at the date of grant.
Actual exercise periods are subject to change in accordance with the rules of the schemes when a director ceases to be employed by the Company.
At 2 March 2006 or date of resignation where applicable the directors held the following share options under the executive share option schemes and the Savings-related Share Option Scheme.
The earliest date on which any of the executive options could have been exercised was June 1999, with the latest being May 2015.
Savings-related share options have a six-month exercise period.

The gains on exercise shown above relate to exercises whilst directors were on the Board.
Since Stewart Miller and David Richardson stepped down from the Board, they made total gains of 766,101 and 292,181 respectively from the exercise of options.
1 The price on exercise is either the actual price attained, where the shares were sold on exercise, or the mid-market price on the day of exercise where the shares were retained.
The director retained some or all of the shares on exercise, but had all of the shares been sold this is the gain that would have been made.
