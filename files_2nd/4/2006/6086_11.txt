Remuneration report Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for formulating executive remuneration policy and for determining the remuneration of the executive directors and certain senior executives.
Its members are the non-executive directors as shown in Table 1 together with their attendance at meetings of the Remuneration Committee during 2005 06.

B. E. Attended 1 Mr C R N Clark resigned his post as non-executive director on 7 February 2006.
Sir Michael Hodgkinson chaired the Committee meeting in March 2006.
Mr R I Case became Chairman of the Committee from 1 April 2006.
2 Mr D J Pearl attended the Committee for the first occasion in November 2005 following his appointment as a non-executive director in September 2005.
3 Mr R I Case attended the Committee for the first occasion in March 2006 following his appointment as a non-executive director in February 2006.
The Company Chairman attended the Committee by invitation.
All of the above served on the Remuneration Committee throughout the year, or as indicated, in Table 1.
All of the non-executive directors including the Company Chairman are considered by the Company to be independent.
Mr Heiden is normally invited to attend meetings as an adviser to the Committee.
He was not present when his own remuneration was being determined.
During 2005 06 the Committee received information from Mercer Human Resources TSR monitoring, and Hewitt Associates remuneration policy and market data.
Hewitt also provided administration services to the Group pension scheme and plan.
Mr Heiden appointed Hewitt Associates as advisers in 2004 05.
Mercer Human Resources was appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 1998.
In accordance with the requirements of the revised Companies Act, an ordinary resolution seeking shareholders approval for the Remuneration report will be proposed at the annual general meeting.
Executive remuneration policy The Remuneration Committees objectives are to ensure that the Company is able to: attract, retain and motivate high calibre people: and align the interests of the executive directors and senior executives with those of shareholders by rewarding executive directors and certain senior executives according to the overall performance of the individual businesses and Group.
In July 2005 shareholders voted in favour of proposals arising from a review of executive remuneration.
The major changes to policy and practice are summarised below: a policy of setting base salaries at the appropriate market median: 50% of total remuneration to be variable, for on-target performance: a more appropriate balance between short and long-term variable remuneration: 1 one-third of annual incentives paid as restricted shares that can be matched if ROIC target is achieved: long-term incentives to be a combination of option grants and or performance shares.
Under the new policy, on-target performance is capable of delivering around 50% of total remuneration in the form of variable remuneration.
This is achieved through the annual performance related bonus scheme and long-term incentives.
1 ROIC is defined as operating profit adjusted for exceptional items divided by total capital invested in the business.
43 FKI plc IFRS and consistent measurement The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that following the introduction of international accounting standards the Company has introduced procedures to ensure consistent measurement of any aspect of business performance that may impact on executive remuneration.
United States Job Creation Act 2005 The Remuneration Committee has taken advice and has amended the rules of the 2005 LTIP and Deferred Bonus Plan to ensure compliance with the Act.
Basic salary and benefits Basic salary is reviewed annually having regard to market practices for similar executive positions in a comparable group of companies mainly in the engineering sector and supported by information and advice from independent external consultants.
Salaries are set around the median of the distribution from an appropriate peer group of comparators.
For most roles this peer group was the engineering and machinery sector.
However, for the roles of Chief Executive and Group Finance Director a broader range of comparators, including some outside of the engineering and machinery sector, are used to help determine competitive base salaries.
Comparative data and information was provided by Hewitt Associates.
Executive directors also receive additional taxable benefits, namely the provision of a fully expensed company car or an allowance in lieu thereof, medical insurance and disability insurance.
Performance appraisal The Company has a structured performance appraisal process for its executive directors and executive management.
The outcome from appraisal influences decisions on salary progression and helps to identify individual and collective training and development needs.
Annual performance related bonus scheme The Company operates an annual performance related bonus scheme for executive directors and other schemes for certain senior executives.
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director participate in a bonus scheme based upon budgeted pre-tax profits of the Group.
Mr Gott, Group Engineering Director MD FKI Logistex participates in a scheme based partly upon budgeted pre-tax profit of the Group and partly on the profit and operating cash flow of FKI Logistex.
Other senior executives participate in a bonus scheme based upon business unit profit, operating cash flow and achievement of personal objectives, or Group profit and personal objectives.
For executive directors a performance related bonus of 25% of salary is payable for achieving a trigger point of Target profit less 10% budgeted operating profit, after interest but before exceptional items, amortisation and tax.
The bonus increases on a straight-line pro rata basis from 25% to 50% for achieving between the trigger point and 100% of Target profit.
The bonus may increase further on a straight-line pro rata basis from 50% to 100% for achieving 100% of Target profit plus 10% of budgeted operating profit.
Subject to approval by the Board of reasonable adjustments to Target Profit, the Companys external auditors confirm that the calculation of bonuses for the Chief Executive Officer and Finance Director adheres to the scheme rules governing such calculations.
From 1 April 2006, one-third of any post-tax cash bonus for executive directors will be exchanged for deferred shares.
If the Companys level of ROIC reaches an average of 10% over the following three years the deferred shares will be matched one-for-one.
Dividends are paid on deferred shares.
This plan is designed to align executive directors interests more closely with the long-term interests of shareholders and provide a mechanism that encourages executive directors to grow their personal shareholding in the Company.
A similar scheme exists for a small number of senior executives but with reduced levels of matching.
Executive directors are now encouraged to accumulate a shareholding of one times basic salary over a four year period.
44 FKI plc Remuneration report The new long-term incentive plan In 2005, following shareholders approval, new long-term incentive arrangements were introduced.
In the first year of the new arrangements, long-term incentives were provided through a combination of executive share options and performance shares.
Each element of the long-term incentive may vest independently of the other.
Executive directors can be awarded up to two times annual salary in options and up to one times annual salary in performance shares, determined on an individual basis by the Remuneration Committee.
Details of actual grants can be found in tables on pages 51 and 52.
Share options The practice is to grant options within a period of six weeks following the announcement of the Companys preliminary and or interim results.
The share option element is granted at the average price of FKI plc ordinary shares over five dealing days before the grant date and are normally required to be held for a minimum of three years before they are capable of exercise.
If options fail to vest at the third anniversary they lapse.
Options that vest at the third anniversary remain live until the tenth anniversary of granting.
Options vest against the level of Earnings Per Share EPS.
No options vest for an EPS less than RPI 9% over the three-year measurement period.
For EPS at or greater than RPI 9%, options vest on a straight-line basis as illustrated in the table below: RPI EPS growth over a three year period Percentage of the option grant that vests Below RPI 9% Nil RPI 9% 25 RPI 12% 50 RPI 15% 75 RPI 18% 100 Earnings per share growth is considered to be an appropriate measure of the Companys underlying performance, as it requires that there should be a demanding improvement in the Companys performance before scheme participants can benefit from an increase in the share price.
The assessment as to whether performance conditions have been met is calculated by the Secretary to the Remuneration Committee and independently verified by the Remuneration Committee, and, where appropriate, advice is obtained from an external independent firm of Chartered Accountants.
Earnings per share is defined as the Companys headline earnings per share, as calculated in accordance with the principles set out in the Statement of Investment Practice No.
1 The Definition of IIMR Headline Earnings issued by the Institute of Investment Management and Research.
IIMR Headline earnings are calculated by excluding from the reported results any income statement items of a non-trading or capital nature.
Option grants made in 2006 07 onwards No options will vest for an EPS less than RPI 12% over the three-year measurement period.
For EPS at or greater than RPI 12%, options will vest on a straight-line basis as illustrated in the table below: RPI EPS growth over a three year period Percentage of the option grant that vests Below RPI 12% Nil RPI 12% 25 RPI 15% 50 RPI 18% 75 RPI 21% 100 45 FKI plc Remuneration report The new long-term incentives plan continued Performance shares Performance shares are held in trust for three years.
There are two performance conditions for each grant of performance shares.
Fifty per cent of a grant may vest against Total Shareholder Return TSR and the remaining 50% may vest against return on invested capital ROIC.
Performance shares that fail to vest at the third anniversary of grant automatically lapse.
Accrued dividends are paid on any performance shares that vest.
For performance shares linked to TSR, no shares vest for a TSR performance below the 50th percentile.
For a TSR performance above the 50th percentile performance shares vest on a straight-line basis as illustrated in the table below: FKI plc TSR performance Percentage of the TSR-related performance shares that vest Below median Nil Equal to the median 30 Equal to or above the 80th percentile 100 For performance shares linked to ROIC, no shares vest for a three-year average ROIC of less than 8%.
For a three-year average ROIC performance above 8%, performance shares vest on a straight-line basis as illustrated in the table below: Averaged ROIC over a three year performance period Percentage of the ROIC-related performance shares that vest Below 8% Nil At 8% 40 At 9% 60 At 10% 80 At 11% and above 100 Former long-term incentive plan All executive options granted from July 1996 onwards may only be exercised subject to a performance condition that the Groups growth in earnings per share, as defined above, must exceed the UK retail price index by 9% or more over a three year period, subject to retesting in subsequent years from a rolling base.
Retesting was removed from the former executive option scheme for options granted after April 2004.
The level of vesting of awards under the former LTIP is determined by the performance of the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR against a comparator group of all companies which on the date of grant are constituent companies of the former Engineering and Machinery sector as determined by the FTSE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee.
The graph opposite shows the Companys TSR performance compared with that of the comparator group.
No awards vest for below median performance and 50% of an award will vest for median performance.
Full vesting occurs only at upper quartile performance, and 75% of an award will vest for performance above the median but below upper quartile.
Accrued dividends on vested awards are paid to the executives pending transfer of the shares into the name of the respective participant.
The performance condition is based upon Total Shareholder Return, as illustrated in the graph opposite, as this was considered to be the best means of aligning the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior total shareholder return.
A table giving full details of the directors options, LTIP shares and performances shares granted under the new and former plans and exercised during the year under review is shown on pages 51 and 52.

The assessment of whether or not the performance conditions have been met is independently calculated by Mercer Human Resources consulting in conjunction with Datastream and is ratified by the Remuneration Committee.
Inland Revenue Approved Save-As-You-Earn share option scheme This scheme was approved by shareholders in 1997 and is open to all UK employees who have completed six months service and who enter into an approved savings contract for a term of three or five years.
The maximum amount that can be saved is 250 per month, and the total savings including interest at the end of the term are available to purchase shares at 80% of their market value shortly before the start of the savings contract.
Executive directors may participate in this scheme on the same terms as all other employees.
In 2005 06 the Company evaluated the feasibility of extending a similar offer of participation in savings-related share ownership schemes to its employees in mainland Europe and North America.
The study concluded that it would not be economic or administratively practical to introduce such schemes after taking account of the likely level of participation by eligible employees.
47 FKI plc Remuneration report Recruitment of new directors Executive directors The Nominations Committee review and approve a recruitment specification.
The Director of Group HR advises the Committee on availability of internal candidates.
If no internal candidate exists, a recruitment consultant or headhunter may be engaged depending on the nature of the assignment.

The recruitment process is concluded by the Chief Executive.
Non-executive directors The Nominations Committee agree a recruitment specification.
The Company Chairman leads the recruitment process that may involve an external search firm.
The Company Chairman selects a shortlist of candidates for interview with the Chief Executive and Nominations Committee.
The Nominations Committee then makes a recommendation for appointment to the Board.
Non-executive Chairman The Nominations Committee agrees a recruitment specification.
They appoint one of their members to lead the recruitment process.
A search firm may be engaged to assist with the recruitment process.
A shortlist of candidates is presented to the Chief Executive who interviews potential candidates, and refines the shortlist.
The Nominations Committee makes the final selection and recommendation to the Board.
Service contracts It is the Companys policy that all executive directors have one-year rolling service contracts with a one-year notice period.
However, in order to attract high calibre recruits, the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to offer newly recruited executive directors an initial two-year notice period which reduces to one year.
Save as listed below, there are no express provisions for compensation payable upon early termination of the executive directors contracts and at the date of termination, other than payments due during the notice period.
In the case of Mr Heiden, in the event of termination of his service contract by an acquiring company after a change of control, there is provision in his service contract for a payment of liquidated damages equivalent to one years pay and contractual benefits without deduction for mitigation and or accelerated receipt.
The contract dates and notice periods for the executive directors during the year were as follows: Name of director Date of contract Notice period P Heiden 16 December 2002 One year R L Gott 7 April 2005 One year N Bamford 2 June 2004 One year The non-executive directors do not have service contracts.
The dates of the current non-executive directors appointments are as follows: Non-executive director Appointment date Date of last re-election Date of next re-election Mr C R N Clark 1 January 2000 23 July 2003 Retired February 2006 Mr R P Edey 6 November 1996 23 July 2003 Retires August 2006 Sir Michael Hodgkinson 1 April 2000 23 July 2003 1 August 2006 Mr C L Matthews 11 September 2003 21 July 2004 July 2007 Mr G F Page CBE 1 August 2004 20 July 2005 July 2008 Mr D J Pearl 27 September 2005 n a 1 August 2006 Mr R I Case CBE 7 February 2006 n a 1 August 2006 48 FKI plc Remuneration report Succession planning During 2004, the Company introduced a succession planning process for its executive directors and senior executive management as part of its risk management process.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the 2004 executive succession plan at its meeting in November 2005 and recommended actions to address succession issues in a small number of Group businesses.
The Executive Committee has continued to manage the development of potential successors.
A new executive development programme was launched in 2005 with the help of Ashridge in the UK and Babson College, Boston MA, in the USA.
Pensions With the exception of Mr Heiden, executive directors are members of the FKI Group Pension Scheme, a defined benefit scheme with a normal retirement age for directors of 60 years.
Its main features, in respect of executive directors, are: a a cash benefit on death in service of four times annual rate of the highest average basic salary restricted to the earnings cap where it applies during any three consecutive years within the ten years before the members date of death.
Additional life assurance cover is purchased where necessary to provide death in service benefits relating to salary above the earnings cap: b pensions payable in the event of ill health: c pensions for dependants on a members death generally equal to half the members prospective retirement pension at 60 on death in service, or half the members pension entitlement on death in retirement: d member contributions are 7% of basic salary restricted to the earnings cap where it applies.
There are funded unapproved pension arrangements to increase the pension benefits where, because of Inland Revenue limitations including those resulting from the earnings cap, these cannot be paid in total from the FKI Group Pension Scheme.
Such arrangements apply to Mr Gott.
During 2005, the former unfunded pension arrangement for Mr Gott was terminated and replaced by an unapproved funded arrangement for future service.
The unfunded, unapproved arrangement for previous qualifying service up to 31 March 2004 will also be funded by the Company making payment by four annual instalments each of 45,000.
The first instalment was paid in November 2005.
Remaining instalments will be paid in April 2006, 2007 and 2008.
In lieu of participation in the FKI Group Pension Scheme, Mr Heiden received contributions into a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme equivalent to 50% of his basic salary.
Details of this are shown in the table headed Directors emoluments on page 50.
For the purpose of clarity the amounts paid to Mr Heiden in 2005 and 2006 have been shown under the column headed Pension contributions see note 2 below the table.
Details of the directors pension benefits during the year under review are shown on page 51.
In 2005 the Remuneration Committee adopted a policy which assured that any changes in individual pension arrangements for executives arising from the 2006 pension simplification legislation will be cost neutral for the Company.
Non-executive directorships The Company believes that there are significant benefits to the individual and the Company from executive directors accepting non-executive directorships in other organisations.
Each executive director may normally accept one non-executive directorship provided that it does not conflict with the Companys interests and is approved by the Board.
Fees from any external directorship may be retained by the director concerned.
For parts of 2005 06 Mr Heiden temporarily held two non-executive positions but shortly after the year-end this had reduced to one position with United Utilities plc.
Details of fees received by him in 2005 06 in respect of these positions are shown below: Bunzl plc April June 2005 8,643 Resigned 6 June 2005 Filtrona plc June 2005 March 2006 26,297 Resigned 26 April 2006 United Utilities plc October 2005 March 2006 23,117 Appointed 5 October 2005 49 FKI plc Remuneration report Directors emoluments Basic salary fees Taxable benefits a Bonus Total Pension contributions b Name of director 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 Executive directors 2 2 Mr P Heiden 502 483 48 47 479 169 1,029 699 251 242 Mr N Bamford 230 200 20 19 219 70 469 289 Mr R L Gott 260 250 24 20 157 441 270 96 93 Non-executive directors Mr G F Page CBE 135 90 135 90 1 Mr C R N Clark 32 37 32 37 Mr R P Edey 37 37 37 37 Sir Michael Hodgkinson 34 34 34 34 Mr C L Matthews 34 34 34 34 1 Mr D J Pearl 17 17 1 Mr R I Case CBE 5 5 Former directors Mr J A Biles 212 16 86 314 41 Mr S D Jones 78 9 12 99 Mr K Orrell-Jones 52 52 Aggregate emoluments 1,286 1,507 92 111 855 337 2,233 1,955 347 376 a Taxable benefits consist of permanent health insurance, company car or car allowances, life assurance and private medical insurance.
b Company contributions paid in respect of unapproved retirement benefit schemes.
1 Mr D J Pearl was appointed in September 2005 and Mr R I Case was appointed in February 2006.
Mr C R N Clark retired from his position as non-executive director in February 2006.
The table above shows fees for only the relevant part of the year for Mr D J Pearl, Mr R I Case and Mr C R N Clark.
2 In the previous year a payment equivalent to 50% basic salary made to Mr Heiden in respect of his retirement arrangements was shown in the emoluments table in a column headed Other.
For the purpose of clarity the relevant amount for 2006 has been shown in a column headed Pension contributions and for comparison the amount paid in 2005 has been placed under the same heading.
This has had the effect of reducing the amount shown under Total in 2005 by the same amount shown under Pension contributions for 2005.
Non-executive directors fees The fees paid to non-executive directors and the Chairman are determined by the Board after reviewing fee payments for comparable positions within similar organisations, and are normally reviewed every two years.
The last review was in March 2006 and increases implemented from 1 April 2006.
Fees for Mr R I Case are paid to Melchester Associates Ltd at his request.
Former executive director Mr John Biles A payment of 78,000 was made by the Company to Mr Biles in full and final settlement of an outstanding claim for guaranteed bonus for the period 2001 04.
50 FKI plc Remuneration report Directors pension benefits The under noted directors were members of a defined benefit scheme provided by the Group during the year.
Mr P Heiden is responsible for his own pension provision.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values were as follows during the year: Transfer value of increase decreased in accrued benefit Increase in Increase in excluding Transfer Transfer transfer accrued inflation less Accrued Accrued value of value of value less pension contributions pension at pension at pension at pension at contributions excluding made by 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March made by inflation directors 2006 2005 2006 2005 directors Name of director 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Mr R L Gott 3.1 45.5 21.4 23.8 249.3 209.7 32.2 Mr N Bamford 10.3 124.1 56.4 44.8 594.4 358.0 221.9 Note: In addition to the accrued pension shown in the table, Mr Gott will receive a fixed pension of 24,400 from age 65 in respect of a transfer value paid into the Scheme.
The value of this pension is excluded from the transfer values shown.
1 The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
2 The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase for inflation.
3 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, although no adjustment has been made for any under funding of the Scheme.
The calculation of each transfer value includes an allowance for the cost of death before retirement benefits.
4 The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year is impacted by the following elements: a. the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension net of inflation : b. the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension due to inflation : c. the increase in the transfer value of accrued pension at the beginning of the year due to ageing: d. the impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis: e. the effect of a. to d. less the directors own contributions over the year.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors, such as stock market movements that are reflected in d. above.
5 Directors have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions.
However, neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the table.
6 Mr Gotts UK pension scheme benefits are subject to the Inland Revenues earnings cap.
This includes the period of service prior to Mr Gott becoming a director.
For service prior to 1 April 2004 the Company had agreed to provide benefits in excess of the earnings cap and to augment pension benefits to 50% of his salary from normal retirement age but adjusted pro rata to reflect the ratio of his pre 1 April 2004 service to his total potential service.
Under this arrangement as much of his benefits as possible would be provided within the Scheme with the balance being paid through an Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme.
However, during the year Mr Gott waived this arrangement for his pre 1 April 2004 benefits in return for a series of pension contributions totalling 180,000 payable over the next four years.
This is the reason why his accrued pension shown in the table above has decreased.
For service from 1 April 2004, Mr Gott is being paid a supplement of 37% pa of salary to provide further pension benefits on a defined contribution basis.
All executive share options granted in 2005 were granted under the rules of the 2005 LTIP approved by shareholders in July 2005 and were at nil cost to the director concerned.
The market price of an ordinary share on 31 March 2006 was 126p 2005: 106.25p and the range during the year was 90.25p to 127.25p.
Executive share options granted prior to 1996 are not subject to a performance condition.
All executive share options granted in 1999 and subsequent years to 2004 are exercisable from the dates stated above, subject to them satisfying the performance condition stated in the policy section.
Executive Share Options granted in June 2004 under the former scheme were not subject to retesting.
Share options granted in 2005 vest on a different scale compared with options granted prior to 2005.
Details of the vesting scales for both new and former LTIPs are shown in the policy section.
The Companys Total Shareholder Return performance for the three-year performance period that ended in March 2006 ranked below median against its comparator group and under the terms of the rules applicable to the 2002 awards and those made in January 2003, 100% of the awards lapsed.
The price of an ordinary share on 26 August 2005, being the date that awards were made during the year was 105.00p.
The awards are subject to the performance conditions for LTIP awards, as outlined in the policy section.
The market value of shares as yet unvested is stated at 126p per share, being the closing mid-market price on 31 March 2006.
If the ranking position of the award made in 2003 were to be maintained until the end of the respective performance period, none of the awards granted in 2003 would vest.
Performance shares granted in 2005 vest on a different scale compared with shares granted in the former LTIP prior to 2005.
Details of vesting scales can be found on page 48.
