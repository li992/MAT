plc Low cost with care convenience Report on Directors remuneration This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the audited information within the Directors remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
As a result, the report has been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
This report sets out the Companys policy on Directors remuneration for the forthcoming year, and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years, as well as information on remuneration paid to Directors in the financial year.
Unaudited information Membership and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee Membership and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are disclosed in the corporate governance report.
The Remuneration Committee continues to use New Bridge Street Consultants LLP whom the Committee originally appointed as remuneration advisers.
Apart from advice regarding the design, establishment and operation of remuneration arrangements, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP provide no other services to the Company.
Policy The objective of the Remuneration Committees remuneration policy is to reward the Companys executives competitively having regard to the comparative market place in order to ensure that they are properly motivated to perform in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The Committee also oversees any significant changes to pay and conditions elsewhere in easyJet and sets Directors remuneration in the context of these pay and conditions.
The Company aims to provide competitive total pay for on target performance, with superior awards for exceptional performance.
The remuneration packages of the Executive Directors comprise a combination of basic salary, annual bonus, participation in share-based long-term incentive plans, and lean benefits provision.
easyJet has a no frills approach and does not include, for example, company cars or final salary pensions as part of the package.
Therefore, performance-related elements form a significant proportion of the packages of the Executive Directors.
The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the Companys Non-Executive Directors, with Non-Executive Directors exempting themselves from discussions and voting as appropriate.
When determining the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors, account is taken of practice adopted in other similar organisations and the time commitment of each Non-Executive Director.
Basic salary The basic salaries of Executive Directors are reviewed annually and are set taking account of a number of factors including i practice adopted in companies of a broadly similar size, ii a formal appraisal of their contribution to the business and iii the competitive environment, as senior easyJet executives are potential targets for other low-cost start-ups and other companies in the airline sector.
During the year Andrew Harrison started on a salary of 540,000 and there was no increase to Jeff Carrs salary which is 250,000.
Pension contributions Pension contributions for Executive Directors are set at 7% of their basic salaries.
While this is a non-contributory arrangement, easyJet operates a pension salary sacrifice arrangement where individuals can exchange their salary for Company paid pension contributions.
Where individuals exchange salary this reduces easyJets National Insurance contributions.
easyJet credits half of this saving to the individuals pension currently 6.4% of the amount exchanged.
Annual bonus scheme All Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity of the Chief Executive during the year was 200% of salary, with a 100% of salary maximum for other senior executives.
This policy will remain unchanged for the forthcoming year.
Bonus targets are aligned to easyJets visions and values.
For the financial year ending 30 September 2007, 70% of Executive Directors bonus opportunity is subject to achieving demanding profit before tax targets related to the expected rate of return on equity.
The remaining 30% is subject to the achievement of demanding quantifiable business targets related to customers, people and operational excellence.
If the profit before tax measure is not achieved, payment on all other measures will be halved.
Andrew Harrison will be paid a bonus of 900,000 200% of salary paid in the year ending 30 September 2007 to reflect performance in the year ended 30 September 2006.
Jeff Carr will be paid a bonus of 250,000 100% of salary in the year ending 30 September 2007 to reflect performance in the year ended 30 September 2006.
These bonuses reflect the years financial performance and the Directors contribution to this.
54 Annual report and accounts 2006 This was calculated according to the bonus targets for the year ended 30 September 2006, whereby 80% of the annual bonus opportunity is subject to achieving demanding financial targets, with the remaining 20% subject to the achievement of other demanding business targets.
The financial targets are based on profit before tax performance related to expected return on equity.
Long-term incentive plans Share-based long-term incentives were previously provided to Executive Directors and other staff under Inland Revenue approved and unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes the ESOS.
However, in 2005, the ESOS were replaced by a new Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP.
The Executive Share Option Schemes have been retained for flexibility, e. g. options were granted to the Chief Executive under the ESOS on his appointment described in the notes to Directors share options.
However there is no current intention to make regular grants of options under the ESOS.
In summary, the LTIP is structured to tie in directly with the Companys current circumstances and strategy.
It provides for regular annual awards of i performance shares worth up to 100% of salary each year and ii matching shares linked to the investment of up to 50% of annual bonus in easyJet shares, which are then matched on a 1:1 gross basis.
Performance shares and matching shares awards normally vest three years after grant, subject to continued employment.
It is currently intended that the vesting of all such regular annual LTIP awards will be subject to the satisfaction of return on equity ROE targets.
These are defined as post-tax profit divided by average shareholders funds.
The ROE targets will be measured by reference to a three-year performance period.
Awards granted in the forthcoming year will vest according to the achievement of the following ROE targets relating to the Groups ROE in the year ending 30 September 2009.
Threshold Target Maximum 25% vests 50% vests 100% vests Return on equity 12.5% 14% 16.5% It should, therefore, be noted that the performance conditions that will apply to awards granted under the LTIP in the forthcoming year will be structured in a more typical manner than were the performance conditions that were applied to the initial LTIP awards that are described in the notes to Directors share options.
ROE has been chosen as the performance measure for a number of reasons, such as: It is a fundamental measure of easyJets underlying performance and is directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders: and It is directly connected to the self-sustaining growth rate of the business and incentivises management to achieve the appropriate balance between growth and returns, to deliver the best shareholder value.
The Remuneration Committee will review the ROE targets prior to each grant date in order to ensure that they remain sufficiently challenging.
When determining the extent to which the ROE targets and, indeed, the earnings per share EPS targets that apply to awards made under other long-term incentive schemes operated by the Company are met.
In addition to the proposed regular annual LTIP grants, a one-off FTSE 100 award was granted shortly following the establishment of the LTIP to provide senior executives with a simple, transparent incentive to increase materially easyJets market capitalisation.
This FTSE 100 award was structured so that, if easyJet becomes a member of the FTSE 100 index for a period of at least six months before the end of the financial year ending 30 September 2008, participants will become entitled to receive an award over easyJet shares worth 100% of salary subject to the Remuneration Committee being satisfied that the Companys issued share capital has remained reasonably constant over the relevant period or any major acquisition has created shareholder value.
These shares will vest three and a half years after entry into the FTSE 100 index subject to continued employment.
Although these FTSE 100 awards that the Remuneration Committee views as a one-off grant form a smaller part of the overall incentive arrangements compared to the annual bonus opportunity and the regular annual LTIP awards, they are an important element of the incentive arrangements at easyJet for a number of reasons: They support the corporate goal of easyJet: They provide an important growth underpin to the ROE targets: and They are indicative of easyJets growth potential.
Annual report and accounts 2006 55 plc Low cost with care convenience Report on Directors remuneration continued Andrew Harrison matching award To facilitate Andrew Harrisons recruitment as CEO and to ensure that his interests were directly and immediately aligned with those of easyJet shareholders, a matching award was introduced.
This was covered in detail in last years report.
However in summary, Andrew acquired and will retain 1,000,000 worth of easyJet shares using his own funds.
In recognition of this, he was granted a further share-based incentive award.
The shares he acquires will be matched by the conditional award of an equal number of shares.
This matching share award will vest three years after grant subject to the satisfaction of challenging EPS and ROE performance conditions described more fully in the notes to Directors share options.
Andrew also received the one-off FTSE 100 award, together with the grant of options under the ESOS described above, but he did not receive a normal LTIP award in the last year.
Shareholding guideline Linked to the establishment of the new LTIP, the Remuneration Committee has introduced a share ownership guideline which will apply to all members of the Airline Management Board being those senior executives who report to the Chief Executive Officer which requires them to retain all the shares they receive on the vesting of LTIP awards on an after-tax basis until they have built up a shareholding equal to 100% of salary with pre-existing shareholdings taken into account.
For senior executives who report to the Airline Management Board and receive LTIP awards, a 50% share ownership guideline will apply.
All-employee share participation easyJet encourages share ownership throughout the Company by the use of a Share Incentive Plan and a Sharesave Plan.
At 30 September 2006, the Company had committed to grant free shares under its Share Incentive Plan to all employees.
Total shareholder return The following graphs show the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the FTSE Mid 250 and that of a group of European Airlines note 1.
The FTSE Mid 250 has been chosen as it consists of companies of similar size to easyJet.
The group of European Airlines comprises companies operating in a comparable sector.
