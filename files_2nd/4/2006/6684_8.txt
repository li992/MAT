The law requires the companys auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.

Remuneration committee procedures Meetings Details of the members, the number of meetings and attendees in the year are shown on page 19.
The board continues to believe that, in the circumstances of this group, the chairman of the board is the proper person to be chairman of the remuneration committee as he has more direct lines of communication with the business than the other non-executives.
Support to the committee At the meetings considering payments to the executive directors, the committee receives independent advice from Watson Wyatt Limited, a remuneration specialist.
In addition to the advice to the committee, Watson Wyatt Limited are consulting actuaries to the group and advise on various pension issues.
The committee receives recommendations from the chief executive on executive directors remuneration other than his own.
The committee considers the chief executives remuneration in his absence.
Information on the remuneration of senior managers in the group is available to the committee.
The committee also considers executive directors bonuses.
Bonuses are dependent on the achievement of financial and other targets in the relevant financial year.
Again, the committee is advised by Watson Wyatt Limited and again, the chief executive is absent while the committee considers his bonus.
Acceptance by the board of remuneration committee proposals Following the meetings, the committee recommends salary increases and bonus payments for the executive directors to the board.
During the relevant period, the board accepted the recommendations of the committee without amendment.
Policy on directors remuneration Policy The policies for the following financial year are detailed below.
In subsequent years the policies will be kept under review to ensure that they reect changing circumstances.
The overall policy adopted by the remuneration committee is to ensure that the group is paying sufficient to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the desired calibre.
The committee is informed of the pay, incentives and benets packages of senior executives in the group and its operating companies.
The remuneration committee recognises that, for this groups business, shareholder value is dependent on factors not all necessarily appearing within the published financial statements, although their effect on later financial statements can be dramatic.
Chief among these corporate governance issues are safety and the control of risk.
But there are other executive actions of a strategic nature that may take several accounting periods to show changes in shareholder value.
Executives in the group are encouraged to take corporate governance and strategy extremely seriously and always to consider the longterm implications of their decision-making.
The remuneration committee has regard to these factors, as well as the annual reported financial statements, in arriving at the directors overall remuneration and in considering the mix between xed and variable pay.
Executive directors salaries Salaries are reviewed annually in April.
Salaries may be increased beyond ination if justied by reference to the performance of the individual and if there is clear evidence that the existing salaries are not competitive.
A special review was undertaken in August 2006 following changes in executive responsibility as a consequence of the retirement of the former group chief executive.
Executive directors cash bonuses Executive directors are paid an annual discretionary bonus in addition to salary.
The bonus is paid in October November on the basis of achievement of financial and non-financial targets in the financial year ended in the previous June July.
The targets are normally notied to the executive directors before the start of the year in question.
The bonus is non-pensionable and is paid in cash.
Achievement of performance targets in the year ended 2 July 2005 resulted in the maximum bonus entitlements of 30% of basic salary being confirmed in October and paid in November 2005.
In respect of the year ended 1 July 2006, the remuneration committee has proposed, and the board has approved, maximum bonus entitlements of 30% of basic salary, as at 1 July 2006, to be paid in November 2006.
21 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 1 July 2006 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Following a review of executive directors remuneration, the level of potential bonus for executive directors will increase to a maximum bonus entitlement of 100% of basic salary.
The first year for eligibility will be in respect of the year ending 30 June 2007.
The award will continue to be based on safety and governance for the first 20%: the next 10% will be earned on achievement of 95% of budgeted profits.
Thereafter, the bonus earned will be on a straight line calculation up to a maximum of 100% on achievement of 115% of budget, designed to introduce stretch into the scheme.
Executive directors Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Following the approval of a new Long-Term Incentive Plan 2005 LTIP by shareholders at the October 2005 extraordinary general meeting, the first awards under the LTIP were granted to the executive directors and one senior executive in March 2006.
The LTIP was implemented as a result of a review in 2005.
With the assistance of Watson Wyatt Limited, the remuneration committee considered a number of alternative arrangements, concluding that the LTIP was the preferred choice for the following reasons: it rewards senior executives if they achieve substantial improvements in the groups underlying financial performance and perform well relative to other companies in the transport sector and with other companies in the FTSE 250: it aligns the rewards available to executives with the returns available to shareholders: and it will assist in the retention of the senior management team over the long term.
Under the rules of the plan, the market value of individual awards is limited to a maximum of 100% of basic salary at the date of the grant and awards will vest dependant upon the satisfaction of initial performance conditions that are measured over a period of three years.
The remuneration committee concluded that the performance conditions that will apply to the initial grant of awards will be based on a comparison of the groups total shareholder return TSR with the TSR of two peer groups and also an increase in the groups earnings per share EPS in excess of an agreed target.
The initial performance condition applicable to one-half of each award is based on a comparison of the groups TSR with the TSR of a peer group comprising quoted companies within the transport sector Arriva plc, FirstGroup plc, National Express Group plc and Stagecoach Group plc.
The initial performance condition applicable to the other half of the award is based on a comparison of the groups TSR with the TSR of the companies excluding investment trusts in the FTSE Mid-250 index of companies.
The extent to which awards will vest depends on the TSR of the group relative to the TSR of other companies within its peer group.
The position in relation to that part of the award based on a comparison of the groups TSR with the TSR of the companies in the transport sector peer group is as follows: if the groups TSR is midway between the TSR of the comparator companies with the highest and the lowest TSRs, the award will vest at 25%: if the groups TSR is higher than the TSR of the comparator companies with the highest TSR, or is less than that TSR by not more than 25% of the difference between the TSRs of the comparator companies with the highest and the lowest TSRs, the awards will vest in full: and if the groups TSR falls between those two positions, the proportion of the award that will vest will increase, on a straight-line basis, from 25% to 100% the higher the TSR of the group.
The remuneration committee recognise that if one company in the peer group performs very badly, an LTIP award could be payable for only marginally better performance.
The remuneration committee have confirmed that they will not seek to reward poor performance and LTIP awards will not be automatically made on this basis where performance does not justify such an award.
The position in relation to that part of the award based on a comparison of the groups TSR with the TSR of companies excluding investment trusts that comprise the FTSE Mid-250 index of companies is as follows: if the groups TSR would place it at the median position, the award will vest at 25% only: if the groups TSR would place it in the top quartile, the award will vest in full: and if the groups TSR would place it between those two positions, the proportion of the award that will vest will increase, on a straight-line basis, from 25% to 100% the higher the position of the group.
In all cases, no part of the awards will vest unless the EPS has increased, during the performance period, in excess of the increase in the Retail Prices Index for the same period plus 3% per year.
The remuneration committee considers that the initial performance conditions are relevant, challenging and designed to enhance shareholder value.
Awards will vest in full only if exceptional performance has been achieved.
22 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 1 July 2006 Executive directors share bonus plan The executive directors share bonus plan has previously been used to grant shares to executive directors and senior executives in the group.
This has now been replaced by the LTIP described above.
The last grant of shares under the executive directors share bonus plan was made to the executive directors and one senior executive in December 2005, in relation to the year ended 2 July 2005.
These awards will remain in the trust for a period of three years from the purchase date, when title will be transferred to them, provided they are still employed by the group.
If a participating executive director leaves employment before the expiry of the three years, transfer of title is subject to the discretion of the remuneration committee.
The remuneration committee has determined that title of the awards granted to the senior executive referred to above who participated in the LTIP and the executive directors share bonus scheme will not be transferred to the executive following his cessation from employment subsequent to the year-end.
Savings related share option scheme and share incentive plan The company operates a savings related share option scheme and a share incentive plan and the group finance director participates in both.
His eligibility and involvement in them is no different to the terms of any other participating group employee and is not separately regulated by the remuneration committee.
There are no other share option or long-term incentive schemes available to executive directors.
Other benets The group does not allocate motorcars to directors or other staff.
Instead, personnel who would have been allocated a motorcar as part of their benets, or to accomplish their work, are given a car replacement allowance.
Pension funds The executive directors, together with 5,377 other group employees, are members of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
The remuneration committee has reviewed the implications of the new pensions regime effective from April 2006 and no changes were made to the current arrangements.
Fixed and performance related pay at maximum performance levels Basic salary excluding pension contributions and benets Value of LTIP shares vesting Performance related cash bonus A substantial proportion of the executive directors pay is performance related.
The chart above shows the balance between xed and performance related pay at maximum performance levels.
Maximum performance assumes achievement of maximum bonus and full vesting of shares under the LTIP.
