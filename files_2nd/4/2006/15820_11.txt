Gains on exercise represent the difference between the closing MMQ on the date of exercise and the subscription price of the shares and are not included in the above table.
Chairmans remuneration Having taken into consideration comparative remuneration data, the contribution made by the Chairman to the Companys affairs, the time he devotes to the Companys business, and the extra responsibilities placed upon him arising from the changes in corporate governance requirements in the UK and the US, the Remuneration Committee recommended to the Board that his remuneration should be increased from 175,000 to 185,000 plus 2,000 Tomkins plc shares per annum, with effect from 1 January 2006.
These recommendations were approved by the Board.
Non-Executive Directors fees The executive members of the Board reviewed the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors and having taken into consideration comparative remuneration data, the contribution made by individual Non-Executive Directors to the Companys affairs, the time they devote to the Companys business, and the extra responsibilities placed upon them arising from the changes in corporate governance requirements in the UK and the US, approved an increase in the basic annual fee to 42,500 plus 2,000 Tomkins plc shares per annum with effect from 1 January 2006.
No changes to the level of Committee fees were made.
In recognition of his duties as Senior Independent Director, Sir Brian Pitmans fees were increased by 15,000 per annum with effect from 1 January 2006.
Current schemes Annual bonus incentive plan The Executive Directors and senior executives participate in the Companys Annual Bonus Incentive Plan the Plan.
Each participant in the Plan receives a percentage of bonusable profit of the business for which he or she has responsibility.
Bonusable profit is based on operating profit less a charge for tax, certain exceptional items, and a charge for invested capital, and is based upon IFRS.
The objective of the Plan is to reward the senior executives for increasing the overall value created in the business, based on the margin of the after-tax return on invested capital in excess of the weighted average cost of capital.
Accordingly, bonusable profit may increase Annual Report 2006 37 Directors report Governance Remuneration Committee report continued at a faster rate than operating profit where the margin of the return over the cost of capital increases.
This aligns the interests of management and shareholders.
In arriving at bonusable profit, adjustments may be made for restructuring charges relating to strategic manufacturing initiatives to match the costs of the strategic manufacturing initiatives to the benefits over a period of up to three years.
The charge for taxation reflects the ongoing charge for tax excluding any benefit from exceptional adjustments to tax provisions.
The charge for invested capital is based on applying the estimated weighted average cost of capital to the average invested capital in the Group.
The estimated weighted average cost of capital takes into account the capital structure of the Group and the costs associated with each element of capital.
The method of calculation has been agreed by the Remuneration Committee and is subject to review each year.
The invested capital is based on the book value of assets in the Group, excluding goodwill relating to acquisitions made prior to 30 December 1999.
The cost of capital used in the calculation of bonusable profit for the year under review was 7.95%.
The Remuneration Committee carries out a detailed review of the computations involved and ensures that the rules are applied consistently.
Furthermore, the independent auditors are asked to perform agreed-upon procedures on behalf of the Remuneration Committee on the calculations which underlie the computation of the bonusable profit.
The incentive bonus of the Executive Directors is based on a percentage of the bonusable profit of the Group which, for the year ended 30 December 2006, was 111.3 million 2005: 123.7 million.
Although there is no limit to the bonusable profit on which bonuses are calculated, inordinate growth in bonusable profit in any one year is unlikely to arise due to the nature of the Groups business.
The bonus awards are payable to senior participants, including Executive Directors, as to four-sevenths in cash, one-seventh in bonus shares and two-sevenths in deferred shares.
The bonus awards payable to the remaining participants are as to three-quarters in cash, one-twelfth in bonus shares and one-sixth in deferred shares.
The bonus is paid at the end of June, September and December based on 75% of the bonus earned to the end of the previous quarter, with the balance of the full entitlement to the bonus for the calendar year paid at the end of March following the calendar year-end.
Bonus shares are restricted and vest only after a period of three years from the initial bonus award.
Dividends are paid on the bonus shares.
Deferred shares are awarded at the time of the initial bonus award but the vesting of the shares is conditional on continued employment with the Group for three years after the award.
Dividends are not paid on the deferred shares until they have vested.
As a condition of continued participation in the Plan, senior participants, including Executive Directors, are required to hold shares with a purchase cost equivalent to one years total after-tax remuneration including bonus, based on an average of the previous three years.
Remaining participants are required to hold shares with a purchase cost equivalent to one-half of one years total after-tax remuneration including bonus, based on an average of the previous three years.
Increases in annual base salary of all participants, including Executive Directors, are restricted to the equivalent rate of increase in the Retail Prices Index in the UK or equivalent index in the country in which a participant works.
The restrictions on the increases in salary, together with the growth in bonus, assuming increases in bonusable profit, will result in the incentive pay element of remuneration increasing over time.
The share awards will increase the investment each of the participants, including Executive Directors, has in Tomkins plc shares.
The Tomkins 2006 Performance Share Plan The Tomkins 2006 Performance Share Plan the PSP is a long-term incentive plan.
The purpose of the PSP is two-fold.
First, to provide a share-based long-term incentive arrangement for senior executives that more closely aligns the interests of executives with shareholders.
Secondly, the PSP is in substitution of the Companys legal obligation to the Chief Executive to provide annual grants of options, which had previously been satisfied by the Executive Share Option Scheme that lapsed in May 2005.
The Remuneration Committee considered the alternatives and, with the agreement of the Chief Executive and the assistance of PA Consulting Group, devised a plan that achieves those aims.
The PSP will provide rewards in future years only if shareholders have seen value created over the preceding three years.
The Remuneration Committee and Board believe that this creates a better alignment between executive reward and the creation of shareholder value than a standard executive share option scheme.
The PSP has four key features: i the performance baseline is established which is equal to the cost of equity and if the total shareholder return comprising dividends and increase in the share price over three years does not exceed the cost of equity over the same three-year period, no award of shares will be made: ii the award of shares will be proportional to the degree of performance over the baseline: iii there is a cap on the quantum of share awards: and iv subject to performance, awards will be made at the end of each three-year performance period.
During the year, the following maximum awards of Tomkins shares were made to James Nicol and Ken Lever under the PSP: Tomkins share Maximum No.

C. Closed schemes The following schemes are now closed.
The Tomkins Executive Share Option Scheme No.
3 ESOS 3 and The Tomkins Executive Share Option Scheme No.
4 ESOS 4 ESOS 3 and ESOS 4 lapsed for grant purposes on 9 May 2005 and the Remuneration Committee and the Board decided not to continue with an executive share option scheme beyond that date.
ESOS 3 was an HM Revenue & Customs-approved scheme.
ESOS 4 was not approved by HM Revenue & Customs.
The options under both schemes mature after three years.
All outstanding ESOS 4 options were granted to participants within the limit of four times their annual earnings.
The performance condition for all outstanding options under ESOS 3 and ESOS 4 requires that the growth in Tomkins earnings per share must exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index by an average of 2% per annum over a three-year period before an option can be exercised, which was in accordance with contemporary practice when the schemes were introduced in 1995.
The Tomkins Savings Related Share Option Scheme No.
2 SAYE 2 This was a standard HM Revenue & Customs-approved savings related share option scheme, which lapsed for grant purposes, on 9 May 2005.
The Tomkins Share Matching Scheme SMS Awards which had been made under a now expired scheme known as The Tomkins Restricted Share Plan and which had vested, were eligible for matching awards for the same number of shares under the SMS.
Such awards could be for up to two conditional share matching awards vesting a further two years and four years respectively after the end of the original restricted period.
The final commitment to grant an SMS award was made during the year and the SMS is therefore now closed for grant purposes.
With shareholder approval, this share scheme was introduced in 1996 with no performance conditions attached and accordingly it does not comply with Schedule A of the Combined Code.
Tomkins Premium Priced Option This was an option specifically and solely granted to James Nicol as part of the incentive package on his joining Tomkins.
No performance conditions were attached to this option and it therefore does not comply with Schedule A of the Combined Code.
It consists of a nontransferable option to acquire 5,076,142 shares.
The exercise price was 197p per share in respect of 2,538,072 shares A option shares, 276p per share in respect of 1,522,842 shares B option shares and 345p per share in respect of 1,015,228 shares C option shares.
The options have all vested and will lapse on 11 February 2012 or earlier in certain circumstances.
Ongoing option This is an option specifically and solely granted to James Nicol on 11 February 2002 as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company.
It consists of a non-transferable option to acquire 1,522,842 shares at 197p per share, which can be exercised on or after 18 February 2005 provided the rate of increase of earnings per share over any three-year period is equal to or greater than the rate of increase of the Retail Prices Index plus 9%.
This performance condition has been met and the option has been exercised in respect of 972,842 shares.
The option will lapse on 11 February 2012 or earlier in certain circumstances.
If there is a variation in the share capital of the Company, the Remuneration Committee may adjust the number of shares in either the Tomkins Premium Priced Option or the Ongoing Option as it reasonably deems appropriate to take account of the variation.
