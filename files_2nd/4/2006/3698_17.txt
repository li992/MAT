The amount provided 182.6 174.2 is therefore the amount considered likely to be payable in the event of these conditions being met.
Arrangements of this nature vary, but may typically extend for up to five years and are discounted where payable after two years.
The provision at 31 December 2006 is 20b.
Non-current liabilities stated after a discount of 0.9m 2005: nil and the unwinding of the discount in the year resulted in a finance charge of 0.2m.

It is anticipated that most of these costs will be incurred in 7.8 7.8 the next two financial years.
Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The directors consider Contract loss provisions that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.
Contract loss provisions represent managements best estimate of the amount by which the expected benefits from certain specific contracts are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under those contracts.
The timeframe within which such provisions will unwind varies by contract, but is generally within one year.
Aircraft maintenance provisions Aircraft maintenance provisions are established in respect of significant periodic maintenance costs, where maintenance activity is required on leased operational aircraft or engines on a cycle greater than 12 months.
Costs are charged to the income statement on the basis of utilisation of the aircraft and are credited to the provision.
The provision is then utilised by absorbing the actual costs incurred in carrying out the maintenance activity.
Maintenance carried out on a cycle of 12 months or less is charged to the income statement as incurred.
When aircraft are leased, it is customary for the contract to contain specific conditions regarding the state of the aircraft on its return to the lessor at the end of the lease.
These conditions may relate to the number of operational hours to be available before a major maintenance check, the physical configuration of the aircraft or direct costs to be incurred by the lessee in the physical return of the aircraft to the lessor.
The estimated cost associated with fulfilling these requirements is charged to the income statement on an aircraft utilisation basis.
The provision is utilised on actual return of the aircraft or on incurring the expenditure required to return the aircraft to the state of maintenance required by the lease before return of the aircraft to the lessor.
Other provisions Other provisions include provisions recognised on warranties and indemnities given on the disposals of the Countermeasures operations and the Fluid and Air group.
All amounts have been determined based on the directors current estimates of likely outcomes.
Provisions relating to the Countermeasures and Fluid and Air disposals are likely to unwind over a period of more than one year but due to the uncertainty over the timing and amounts have not been discounted.
All other items are likely to be resolved within two years.

No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Groups share of the tax on temporary differences arising in connection with interests in joint ventures was 1.7m 2005: 1.8m.

Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade Financial instruments and other receivables and investments.
The Group finances its operations primarily through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments.
Where it does use financial instruments these are mainly put in place to manage the currency risks The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit arising from normal operations and to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Groups financial instruments, other than ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group further limits risk in this area by setting a maximum level for derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and various items such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its deposits or overdrafts with any one counterparty.
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to manage transactional currency risk arising from its operations and interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk.

Due to this, the directors believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for doubtful receivables.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
In the UK the Group has a master netting arrangement in respect of bank balances.
In the normal course of business these bank accounts are settled on a net basis within each currency and as such are presented in the financial statements as net.

of an automatic enforcement event the bank balances are automatically set off against each other to achieve a net position.
The Group is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The policies have remained unchanged throughout the year.
The Group has not pledged any assets in respect of any of its primary borrowing facilities, except as disclosed in notes 23 and 24.
Foreign currency risk Movement in fair values Interest rate swaps The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, with further Currency investments in other European countries, Australia, Canada, South Africa and Asia.

However, where this is impractical, the Group will seek to reduce its exposure through the use of forward contracts.

In addition to the longer term borrowing structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange position, such as forward contracts.
