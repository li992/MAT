Remuneration committee The current members of the Remuneration Committee the Committee are Malcolm Rifkind Chairman, Roger Cornick and Giles Weaver, all of whom are independent Non Executive Directors.
Their biographical details are shown on page 19.
The Committee, which operates on the basis of detailed written terms of reference, has been established by the Board to: a determine and recommend to the Board the Companys policy on remuneration of Executive Directors and senior employees: b determine the specic remuneration levels of the Chairman, the Executive Directors and other senior employees: c ensure that appropriate performance targets are set and that any payments made to Executive Directors and senior employees reect achievement against such targets: d consider individual awards to Executive Directors and senior employees under all incentive schemes: e consider any award which might result in an employee receiving a total remuneration package of 250,000 or more: f consider the recruitment of any employee on a basic salary of 125,000 or more: g consider any redundancy or severance payment which exceeds the terms of the Companys standard policy, subject to a fide minimis limit of 25,000: h ensure that the Company maintains contact with its principal shareholders on remuneration matters, and to demonstrate that decisions on executive remuneration are taken independently and are complementary to the financial and commercial well-being of the Company: i approve all substantial changes to the Groups pension scheme: j report to shareholders in accordance with appropriate legal requirements and associated codes of practice.
The terms of reference of the Committee, which are reviewed annually, are available on request and are published on the Companys website.
The Committee is authorised to take external advice in order to full its duties and appointed an external rm of consultants, DLA MCG Consulting, to advise on the levels of salaries and composition of benets packages of the Executive Directors and other senior employees.
Details of the remuneration of the Chairman and the Non Executive Directors are shown on page 30.
Remuneration policy The Groups remuneration policy is designed to reect the importance of recruiting, retaining and motivating senior executives of the calibre necessary to maintain and improve the Groups position in the asset management sector.
The policy seeks to reward performance in a manner which aligns the interests of clients, shareholders, executives and other employees.
The remuneration policy will support the Companys aim to maximise long-term shareholder value.
24 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 The remuneration policy, which applies to Executive Directors and senior employees, will remain unchanged for 2007 and subsequent years.
The aim, within the overall policy design of retention and motivation, is to pay basic salaries and award benefit packages which are reasonable and competitive within the asset management sector.
In addition, the policy is designed, and will remain designed, to deliver additional rewards through appropriate incentive schemes, both annual and long term.
These are directly linked to performance at both a corporate and an individual level.
The Committee recognises that any remuneration policy must be sufciently exible to take account of changes in the business environment.
In accordance with this need for exibility, the Committee takes into account the overall competitiveness of the total remuneration packages of all senior executives.
When justied by performance, the at risk performance elements will form the most significant element of total remuneration for Executive Directors and senior employees.
The Committee has considered the levels of remuneration paid throughout the Group, having regard to the advice of DLA MCG Consulting and having also consulted with Charles Irby and Martin Gilbert when considering the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and senior employees.
Outlined below are the details of the individual reward components of the remuneration policy.
In providing details, the Report identies those elements which are performance linked and the participation of the Executive Directors in them.
Executive remuneration Executive remuneration comprises a number of elements: i Basic salary The salaries of all employees, including Executive Directors, are reviewed annually and are determined by reference to external market research.
The Groups policy is to pay salaries which, when taken together with other benets, will provide a remuneration package that is reasonable and competitive in the asset management sector.
The Group participated in the McLagan Partners 2006 compensation survey which provided salary comparisons for a range of employees across the Aberdeen Group, including the Executive Directors.
In addition, DLA MCG Consulting provided data on the salaries and benets packages for the Executive Directors and other senior employees.
The Committee also considered information included in other publicly available research and survey results.
Following the annual review and having consulted external data, it was noted that Bill Rattrays salary had fallen signicantly behind the market rate and it was therefore agreed that his salary should increase from 200,000 to 250,000 per annum from January 2007. ii Annual bonus The policy is to recognise corporate and individual achievements each year through an appropriate annual bonus scheme.
The aggregate amount of cash bonus available in any year is dependent on the Groups overall performance and profitability.
Consideration will also be given to the levels of bonuses paid in the marketplace.
Individual awards, payable to all members of staff and which are non-pensionable, are determined by a rigorous assessment of achievement against dened objectives, are reviewed and approved by the Committee.
The bonus awarded in any year will be paid in cash, some of which may be deferred, with a further element to be settled by the award of the Companys shares.
Such shares, will only vest following completion of a three year retention period.
A significant proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration is expected to be paid by annual bonus, such awards to be based on the achievement of dened objectives.
Objectives may vary each year, but for 2006 the principal objectives for the Executive Directors included the successful integration of the ex DeAM business: management of costs and achievement of operating efficiencies: disposal of non-core assets: improvement of profitability and operating margins: and management of contingent liabilities and reputational issues.
Martin Gilbert has been awarded a bonus of 2,625,000 for meeting his dened objectives for the year which included overseeing the continued growth in the Groups business, profits and shareholder value, ensuring client and staff retention and the disposal of non-core assets.
656,250 of this award has been deferred and will be paid in cash in December 2007 and a further 1,312,500 will be used to acquire a number of the Companys shares which will vest in December 2009.
Andrew Laing has been awarded a bonus of 400,000 for meeting his dened objectives for the year which included the operational integration of the ex DeAM business, the management of outsourcing of certain administrative functions and overseeing the development of the property divisions.
87,500 of this award has been deferred and will be paid in cash in December 2007 and a further 137,500 will be used to acquire a number of the Companys shares which will vest in December 2009.
Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 25 Remuneration report continued Bill Rattray has been awarded a bonus of 400,000 for meeting his dened objectives for the year which included the integration of the ex DeAM businesses into the Groups financial reporting: overseeing the transition to IFRS, the reduction of bank debt nanced by a subordinated debt issue and the management of issues arising from the Capital Requirements Directive.
In line with the Groups remuneration policy of retaining exibility, and in common with practice in the asset management sector, it has been decided to continue with the policy of not imposing any maxima based on a relationship to basic salary.
iii Long Term Incentive Plan The Group operates a share based long term incentive plan LTIP which was approved and adopted by Shareholders on 24 March 2005.
The LTIP is administered by an independent professional trustee based in the Channel Islands the Trustee which, when exercising its discretion, will have regard to the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee.
After taking into account the recommendations of the Committee, the Trustee will make awards under the LTIP to selected Executive Directors and other senior executives.
Awards will be made over a specified number of shares and take the form of the acquisition of shares by a participant at the time the award is made on terms which mean that the ownership of the shares remains conditional during the relevant measurement period.
The participant will not obtain absolute ownership of any of the shares over which such an award has been made until the end of the relevant measurement period and then only to the extent that the performance targets have been satisfied.
Participants will be entitled to receive any dividends paid on the shares during the measurement period, even though the shares held will not have vested unconditionally.
However, any overpayment of dividends arising on shares which do not subsequently vest will be recovered by deduction from annual bonus awards.
Vesting of shares over which an award has been made will be dependent upon the extent to which the performance target has been satisfied.
The Committee has reviewed the appropriateness of the existing criteria and has decided that there should be no changes for awards to be made in 2006 and 2007.
The performance target which will determine the extent to which any LTIP award will vest requires the growth in earnings per share over the relevant measurement period to exceed the average movement in the stock markets in which the assets managed by the Group are invested.
This criterion has been chosen as being reective of success in the asset management sector as it compares the Groups performance to a dynamic and meaningful comparator.
The Committee will thereafter consider whether these targets remain appropriate and challenging and any amendments to these targets in respect of intended awards in later years will be disclosed in the Remuneration report for 2007. a if earnings per share have increased over the measurement period by a percentage that is at least 5 per cent.
per annum greater than the average movement in the stock markets over the same period then 30 per cent.
of the LTIP award will vest: b if earnings per share have increased over the measurement period by a percentage that is at least 10 per cent.
per annum greater than the average movement in the stock markets over the same period then 100 per cent.
of the LTIP award will vest: c growth in earnings per share that falls between these limits will result in a pro rated vesting of the LTIP award occurring between 30 per cent.
depending upon the actual growth in earnings per share: d if growth in earnings per share over the measurement period is less than the lower limit set out in paragraph a above no part of the award made under the LTIP will vest, the award will lapse and the participant will cease to have any entitlement to any of the shares over which the award was originally made.
The movement in the stock markets will be measured by indices appropriate to the assets managed by the Group and shall be determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The indices identied at the date of the first award included the FTSE All Share, the Russell 1000, the FTSE Europe ex UK, the FTSE Asia Pacic ex Japan, the FTSE Japan, the MSCI Emerging Markets and the FTSE A British Government All Stocks.
The Committee has subsequently agreed to include two additional indices, the Lehman US Aggregate Bond and the IPD Pan European Property Index, to ensure that the basket of indices remain fully representative of the assets managed by the Group.
26 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 For the purposes of calculating earnings per share for any period, adjustments will be made to the earnings per share gure disclosed in the audited financial accounts.
The earnings per share gure will be amended to exclude the effects of i amortisation and impairment of intangible assets: ii impairment of goodwill iii any charges arising from share options and LTIP awards: iv exceptional items, unless the Committee consider this to be inappropriate: and v any other adjustments deemed reasonable and appropriate by the Committee.
To the extent that an award has not vested, shares will be re-acquired from relevant participants by the Trustee for a nominal consideration of 1.
In addition to the performance condition summarised above, in accordance with the Plan rules no award will vest unless, in the opinion of the Committee, the underlying financial performance of the Company has been satisfactory over the relevant measurement period.
The length of the measurement period for any award will be three years.
The life of the LTIP will be ten years and no awards may therefore be made after 24 March 2015.
LTIP awards over ordinary shares are designed to incentivise senior executives in a manner which is consistent with the creation of value for shareholders.
As at the date of this Report, awards have been made in respect of 24,764,671 ordinary shares which have not yet vested.
This equates to approximately 4.0% of the current issued share capital.
Details of the awards which have been made to Directors of the Company under the LTIP are shown on page 31.
The Committee intends to recommend further LTIP awards over 1,127,139 shares, which equates to approximately 0.2% of the current issued share capital.
Incuded in this total, which comprises awards to 19 people, are the following proposed awards to the Executive Directors: Number of shares Martin Gilbert 73,271 Andrew Laing 58,617 Bill Rattray 58,617 It remains the Committees intention not to recommend awards to any one individual in excess of 100% of annual salary in any one year except in exceptional circumstances, for example to aid recruitment or retention of staff.
However, as reported above an element of annual bonus is also awarded in the form of shares with deferred vesting conditions.
iv Private medical cover Private health care is offered to all Executive Directors and employees who also have the option to cover their partners and unmarried dependent children.
v Pension Executives, including Executive Directors, are entitled to membership of the Groups dened contribution pension arrangements.
The employers contribution to this scheme on behalf of all employees, including Executive Directors, is 20% of basic salary.
With effect from 1 October 2006, the Group has removed the requirement for employees to make a compulsory contribution to encourage participation by all staff.
In addition, on becoming a member of the Group pension scheme, the Group will provide life insurance cover that provides death in service benets, currently amounting to four times basic salary.
The life insurance cover will also provide for a further three times basic salary to provide a dependants pension.
In light of changes to pensions legislation introduced in the UK from 6 April 2006, certain of the Groups UK employees have elected for employer contributions to the scheme to cease.
In these cases, the Committee has approved additional cash payments to be made as an addition to basic salary, such that the overall cost to the Group is no greater than the pension contribution which would otherwise have been made.
Any similar requests which may be made by employees in future will be treated in the same manner.
No such request will arise in respect of the Groups legacy dened benefit schemes, all of which which are closed to future accrual.
vi Executive share option scheme The Group has an Executive share option scheme which is approved by the Inland Revenue and was approved by shareholders prior to its introduction.
An unapproved schedule was added to this scheme in 1999 to permit options to be granted within institutional guidelines but in excess of the reduced limits on approved options imposed by the Government.
In March 2004 the scheme reached the end of the 10 year period during which the grant of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 27 Remuneration report continued options was permitted.
Options were granted at the discretion of the Committee and were based on assessments of the individuals expected contribution to future Company performance.
Options were granted for no consideration, and grants were based on the principle that, apart from the need to recruit new executives, or in other exceptional circumstances, awards would be restricted to no more than 100% of salary in any year.
Options outstanding may only be exercised if the Committee is satisfied that earnings per share, before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and exceptional items have increased over the period of 3 years from the date of grant, by 5% per annum in excess of the average growth in the stock markets in which the Groups assets under management are invested.
This is determined by reference to a number of industry standard indices appropriate to the relevant asset classes managed by the Group.
One of these indices is the FTSE All Share Index, within which the Companys ordinary shares represent a 0.06% weighting.
This criterion has been chosen as being reective of success in the asset management sector, as it compares the Groups performance to a dynamic and meaningful comparator.
Details of share options held by the Executive Directors are shown on page 31. vii Deferred bonus During 2003 the Group implemented a specic deferred bonus scheme, designed to encourage the retention of certain key employees identied as critical to the Groups achievement of its longer term goals.
An employee benefit trust was established and funded for the purpose of paying potential awards under this scheme.
Deferred payments made in the form of cash bonuses were recommended by the Committee and were paid to qualifying employees over a three year period with 15% having been paid in 2004, 35% paid in 2005 and the balance paid in 2006.
Andrew Laing is the only Executive Director who participated in this deferred bonus scheme, having been identied as a key employee prior to his joining the Board.
During the financial year, Andrew Laing received a payment of 52,500 from the employee benefit trust.
Share price performance The Regulations require the inclusion of a graph which illustrates the total shareholder return for a holding in the Companys shares against a broad equity market index.
The FTSE All Share Index has been used on the basis that it includes all UK listed stocks, including the Companys ordinary shares.
The graph below also shows the total shareholder return against the FTSE All Share General Financial Index for the five-year period to 30 September 2006.
The Board considers this to be an appropriate index against which to measure performance because it includes all other UK listed financial stocks and therefore represents the closest comparator for benchmark purposes.
Both of these indices are calculated on a total return basis, ie assuming reinvestment of dividends.
120 FTSE All Share 100 FTSE All Share General Financial Aberdeen Asset Management 80 60 40 20 0 -20 -40 -60 -80 -100 Sep-01 Sep-02 Sep-03 Sep-04 Sep-05 Sep-06 The Board has also decided to include an equivalent graph showing the performance of the Companys share price against the same indices over a three year period.
This time period has been chosen because it is consistent with the period over which the vesting of long-term incentives is measured.
