The first part of the report provides details of UK COALs Remuneration Policy.
The second part provides details of the remuneration, service contracts and share interests of all the directors for the year ended 31 December 2006.
The Remuneration Report is unaudited unless otherwise disclosed.
The directors confirm that this report has been drawn up in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance Combined Code.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Responsibility for reviewing Group remuneration strategy and policy, recommending any changes and approving individual remuneration packages for the Chairman, executive directors and members of the Executive Committee rests with the Remuneration Committee the Committee.
The Committee consists exclusively of non-executive directors and meets on at least two occasions each year.
The members in 2006 were: Mike Toms Committee member and Chairman from 3 May 2006, Graham Menzies Committee Chairman to 9 March 2006, James Murray and Peter Hazell who acted as Chairman prior to Mr Toms joining the Board.
David Jones was appointed a member of the Committee with effect from 12 December 2006.
The Committee may seek any information it requires from any employee or director, and all employees and directors are required to co-operate with any request made by the Committee.
Richard Cole Company Secretary and Norman Haslam HR and Communications Director provided information to the Committee during the year.
The Remuneration Committee also meets without management and receives information and independent executive remuneration advice from remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC, whose appointment was made by the Remuneration Committee during the year.
NBSC does not provide any other services to the Group.
Neither the Chairman nor the executive directors participate in discussions relating to their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee has terms of reference, approved by the Board, which are available from the Company Secretary and via the Companys website.
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY The policy of the Committee recognises that the Group requires high quality and committed executive directors and other senior executives in order to deliver appropriate levels of performance.
The Committee therefore conducts its work to determine the appropriate remuneration levels and structure consistent with the need to attract, motivate and retain executive directors of the high quality required to further the Groups interests.
The executive directors remuneration comprises a base salary, an annual performance bonus, participation in a Long Term Incentive Plan, a car or car allowance, pension contributions to a defined contribution pension scheme and health insurance.
Bonus payments and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
The Company is required to seek shareholder approval for this report, and to put forward any new incentive schemes for shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting.
There are no significant changes proposed to the remuneration policy for 2007, although a resolution to amend the rules of the Long Term Incentive Plan will be proposed at this years Annual General Meeting.
This will seek approval to allow a maximum grant of an award to a participant of 100% of basic salary per annum.
Currently the rules allow the Chief Executive to receive a grant of up to 75% and all other participants of up to 60%.
The Remuneration Committee has undergone consultation with the Association of British Insurers in framing the proposal and has received advice from NBSC that this maximum is consistent with current market practice.
Also, after taking account of the demanding nature of the performance conditions and considering the other elements of the package, the Remuneration Committee is comfortable that this will not result in the total remuneration of executives being any higher than market levels.
The following paragraphs explain the operation of the main constituents of the remuneration policy.
CHAIRMAN The Chairman receives fees commensurate with his duties, which include: managing the business of the Board and its Committees, maximising long-term shareholder value by reviewing short-term performance, risk management and long-term development of the Group, ensuring that corporate governance is in line with best practice, ensuring a management succession process is in place and working, making recommendations on the remuneration of all other non-executive directors and agreeing with the Chief Executive the most appropriate role of the Chairman vis--vis stakeholders including government, shareholders, the financial community, customers, competitors, potential and actual partners, trade unions, employees, the media and the wider community.
Following a review of the time commitment, duties associated with this role and current market fee levels, the Chairmans fee has been reviewed by the Committee and with effect from 1 January 2007 has been increased to 140,000 per annum.

In determining salary levels for executives, due regard is given to external market data in similarly sized companies across a range of sectors, personal and Group performance and pay and employment conditions within the Company.
Following a review of executive directors salary levels, Messrs Spindlers and Mawes base salaries have been increased from 344,115 to 357,535 and from 238,000 to 247,282 respectively, with effect from 1 January 2007.
The percentage increase was in line with that of the general workforce.
Jon Lloyds salary has been increased to 220,000 with effect from 1 January 2007.
ANNUAL BONUS The annual bonus provides an incentive opportunity in the range of 0% to 80% Chief Executive and 0% to 75% for other executive directors of base salary.
At the start of the incentive year 1 January, the Remuneration Committee sets both the performance measures and targets based on the Groups business priorities.
These targets ensure that incentives at the higher end of the range are payable only for demonstrably superior Group and individual performance.
In respect of 2006, Garold Spindler received a bonus of 40,000, Christopher Mawe received a bonus of 44,625 and Jon Lloyd received a bonus of 67,500.
The bonus for the period represented 11.6% of basic pay for Garold Spindler, 18.75% of basic pay for Christopher Mawe and 37.5% of basic pay for Jon Lloyd.
In 2007 the following measures will be applied for each director in the proportions shown: CASH GROWTH IN PROPERTY FLOW PROFIT NET ASSET VALUE PERSONAL % % % % Jon Lloyd 15 25 30 30 Garold Spindler 25 25 20 30 Christopher Mawe 25 25 20 30 In setting the targets for each executive director, the Committee has determined the relevance of each of the criteria to the individuals role and the degree of effect the individual can bring to bear.
A Bonus Share Matching Plan was introduced in 2000, and permitted executive directors and senior executives to invest their own funds from their annual bonus in the Company.
The plan was not operated in 2006 and the Committee has resolved that it will not be used in future.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN Under the terms of the current Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, an award of shares up to a maximum value of 75% of the Chief Executives base salary and 60% for other executive directors per annum is conditionally allocated to each director.
Subject to shareholders approving the proposal to increase the individual limit in the LTIP, the value of shares comprising future awards at the date of grant may be up to 100% of a participants base salary per annum.
These shares are released to the executive three years from the date of grant of award, contingent upon the Group achieving the predetermined levels of performance set out in the table below, with performance being measured as the percentage growth in the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR over a three year period.
The director must remain in post throughout the three-year period subject to exceptions as set out in the plan in order to be entitled to this award.
For all awards granted in 2005 and 2006, in order for any part of an award to vest, the Group must have achieved earnings per share growth at least equal to the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum.
If this test is not met than the award will lapse.
If the test is met then the proportion of the award vesting will be determined in accordance with the Companys TSR performance over the period, as set out below.
GROWTH IN TSR % OF AWARD VESTING Below 75% Nil 75% or above 30 100% or above 50 150% or above 100 For TSR increases within these bands, shares are allocated on a straight-line basis.
13397 14 03 2007 Proof 9 133 13397UKCOALFRT:UK COAL Quark Template 14 3 07 11:37 Page 57 Following a review of the operation of the LTIP to ensure that the arrangement continues to be aligned with market practice and is appropriately linked to improved financial performance and increases in shareholder value, the Company is proposing to amend the performance conditions for 2007 and for future awards under the LTIP.
The performance condition attached to 2007 and future awards will require absolute TSR growth of between 25% and 75% for between 30% and 100% of an award to vest, with straight-line vesting in between.
Whilst the future TSR percentage growth targets are lower than those applying to previous years awards in absolute terms, the current share price which is significantly higher than when LTIP awards were granted in 2005 and 2006 means that these targets represent a clear progression on previous years targets and are considered by the Committee to be equivalently demanding.
The earnings per share growth underpin, where the Company must achieve earnings per share growth at least equal to the increase in RPI plus 3% per annum in order for any part of an award to vest, will continue to operate for future awards.
In the event of a change of control, vesting of shares under the LTIP is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which the performance conditions had been satisfied within the period six months prior to that date.

OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE The executive directors service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Remuneration Committee and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to manage the Group.
The Remuneration Committee considers that a notice period of no more than one year is appropriate.
It is the Companys policy not to enter into service contracts that provide written notice of more than one year.
In respect of Garold Spindler and Jon Lloyd, employment will continue until terminated by the Company giving the executive not less than twelve months written notice, or by the executive giving the Company not less than six months written notice.
Christopher Mawes contract shall continue until either party terminates it by not less than 12 months notice in writing.
There is a termination clause in the Chief Executives contract which states that the Company, at its sole discretion, may terminate his employment at any time by paying a sum in lieu of notice equal to the basic salary which he would have been entitled to receive under the notice period as earlier stated.
Other executive directors service contracts do not contain provisions for compensation in the event of early termination.
When calculating termination payments, the Remuneration Committee takes into account a variety of factors including individual and Group performance, the obligation of the director to mitigate his own loss for example by gaining new employment, the directors age and his length of service.
Although there is no specific provision for liquidated damages should the Company terminate the contract of a director, compensation for loss of office is limited to the amounts payable under these notice periods.
There are no special provisions for payments to directors on a change of control.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The Board aims to recruit non-executive directors of a high calibre with broad commercial and other relevant experience.
Nonexecutive directors are appointed for an initial three-year period.
The terms of their engagement are set out in a letter of appointment.
The initial appointment and any subsequent reappointment is subject to election or re-election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The letters of appointment contain three-month notice periods.
Compensation for loss of office is limited to the amounts payable under these notice periods.
The Board considers these notice periods appropriate given the skills and expertise of the directors.
Non-executive directors are paid a basic fee.
Additional fees are payable for chairing a committee.
Following a review of time commitments, responsibility levels and current market fee levels, with effect from 1 January 2007, the base fee for non-executive directors was increased from 30,000 to 34,000 per annum.
The additional fee for chairing a committee remained at 5,000 per annum.
Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes.
