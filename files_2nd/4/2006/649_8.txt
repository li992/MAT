ALFRED McALPINE PLC 30 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 REMUNERATION REPORT The auditable part of the Remuneration Report is set out on pages 36 to 38.
INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT Membership and constitution of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee comprises the independent Non-executive Directors all of whom served throughout the year apart from Dr R J Urwin who served from 1 September 2006, the date of his appointment to the Board and is chaired by Mr R E Hough.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the Companys overall framework for the remuneration of Executive Directors and certain key senior executives, and determines the individual remuneration packages of the Executive Directors including pension rights and compensation payments.
The Committee also reviews and sets the fee payable to the Chairman of the Company.
The Committee consults the Group Chief Executive on the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior executives, and is assisted by the Group Company Secretary.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Companys website.
The Committee met three times in the year.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC advised the Committee during the year on all aspects of the Groups reward policies and structures.
NBSC also provided services to the Company during the year in respect of the implementation of the Alfred McAlpine plc Buy As You Earn Share Scheme and in relation to pension matters.
Hewitt Associates also advised the Committee on pension matters.
The terms of reference of the independent consultants are available on request from the Group Company Secretary.
Neither the Committee nor the Company is aware of any conict of interest arising from these appointments.
The Committee also received advice from the Group Chief Executive and the Group Company Secretary.
Compliance The Committee is constituted and operates in accordance with the provisions of Section B of The Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
In preparing this Report, the Board has complied with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Code.
Remuneration policy The Groups aim is to provide remuneration packages that are sufficient to attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors and senior executives of high calibre.
The Committee believes that the base salary and benets for Executive Directors should represent a fair return for employment, but that total reward for Executive Directors should be derived materially from the performance-related elements of the remuneration package annual bonus and awards under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan 2005.
The policy adopted by the Committee is that Executive Directors base pay should be around median to ensure that the Company can attract and retain executives of the highest quality and that performancerelated incentives may bring total remuneration to the upper quartile.
Performance-related elements are therefore designed to form a material part of the total remuneration of Executive Directors, aligning their interests with those of shareholders and providing incentives for performance.
In designing schemes for performance-related remuneration, the Committee follows the provisions of the Code.
During the year, the Committee reviewed its policy on bonus payments and the operation of the LTIP 2005 with NBSC to ensure that these continue to be appropriately linked to Group performance and increase in shareholder value and that attract, incentivise and retain key executives.
This review concluded that the Annual Bonus Scheme and the LTIP 2005 should be rened to enhance the linkage between performance and reward, to ensure that the Scheme and the Plan remain competitive and therefore act as a powerful retention tool, and to assist executives to build meaningful shareholdings in the Group.
Details are set out below.
ALFRED McALPINE PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 200631 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Performance chart The chart below, which has been prepared by NBSC, compares the growth in value assuming that dividends were re-invested of 100 invested in ordinary shares in Alfred McAlpine plc over the five years commencing 31 December 2001 with the performance of a similar investment in the shares of the constituents of the FTSE All Share Construction and Building Materials and the FTSE All Share Support Services Sector Indices.
The Directors are of the view that these constitute relevant broad equity market indices.
The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year-ends.
300 Alfred McAlpine plc 250 FTSE All Share Construction and Building Materials Index FTSE All Share Support Services Index 200 150 100 50 0 31 Dec 2001 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2004 31 Dec 2005 31 Dec 2006 Base salary The salary of each Executive Director is determined by the Committee, taking into account his personal performance and the prevailing rates in the employment market for executives of comparable status, responsibility, skill and position in other relevant companies.
When determining Directors salaries the Committee is always sensitive to pay and employment conditions throughout the Group.
NBSC provided an analysis of salary levels in the Companys peer group and in the FTSE 250 in general for Executive Directors and senior executives during the year.
Annual bonus scheme For 2006, Executive Directors bonuses were based on year-on-year growth in Group profit before tax before the effect of non-recurring items PBT and, if an Executive Director was responsible for a Business Stream, the PBT delivered by the relevant Business Stream compared with target.
In the light of the discovery of fraud in the slate business and its impact on PBT, the Committee did not approve any bonus payments for the Executive Directors in respect of Group performance.
The Committee considered, however, that to base bonus in 2006 for Executive Directors responsible for a Business Stream on Group PBT would be unfair and demotivational since they had no direct responsibility for the slate business.
It was therefore agreed for these particular Executive Directors that, for 2006, their entire bonus should be based on Business Stream performance.
The level of bonus earned in relation to Business Stream performance varied in accordance with the performance of each Business Stream.
For 2007, the Committee has amended the Annual Bonus Scheme to enhance its retention capacity and help executives to develop meaningful shareholdings in the Group.
To these ends, for 2007: Executive Directors will be able to earn a bonus of up to 125% of base salary 2006: 100% of base salary.
The targets will be stretching and designed to enhance the business.
For Executive Directors, bonus will be based on growth in Group PBT and, if an Executive Director is responsible for a Business Stream, the PBT delivered by the relevant Business Stream compared with budget.
Full bonus in respect of Group performance will require targets to be substantially exceeded.
Bonus earned will be scaled back by up to 20% if targets based on business critical Key Performance Indicators KPIs are not met at Group or at appropriate Business Stream level.
The KPIs will be a reduction in the Accident Frequency Rate: achievement of budgeted cash ow: and improvement in employee satisfaction levels as measured by the annual employee survey.
20% of any bonus earned will be deferred into Alfred McAlpine plc shares with a two-year vesting period.
As the holder of the shares during this period, the Executive Director will receive dividends payable on the shares.
If the Executive Director leaves the Group during the deferral period, the shares will normally be forfeited.
ALFRED McALPINE PLC 32 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Share schemes The Company operates a number of share schemes.
During 2006, awards were made under the Alfred McAlpine LTIP 2005, which was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2005 and replaced the Alfred McAlpine plc Restricted Share Plan.
Entitlements under the Restricted Share Plan continue to vest in accordance with its rules, but no further awards will be made.
Participants in the LTIP 2005 will not normally receive executive share options in the same year.
Although a new executive share option scheme, the Alfred McAlpine Share Option Scheme 2005 ESOS 2005 was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2005, no options have been granted under this scheme to date.
The Company also operates two all-employee share schemes, the Alfred McAlpine Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1998, further details of which may be found in note 22 to the Accounts on page 63, and the Alfred McAlpine plc Buy As You Earn Share Scheme BAYE.
The BAYE is an HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan which was implemented in Autumn 2006.
The first purchase of shares took place in March 2007.
The BAYE formerly known as the Alfred McAlpine Partnership Share Scheme 2000 was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2000.
Awards were granted under the LTIP 2005 over a maximum of assuming full vesting at the end of the performance period 752,189 ordinary shares 0.75% of the Companys issued share capital as at 1 January 2006 during 2006.
No awards or options were granted under any other share plan during the year.
In settlement of rights under share plans or bonus arrangements, a total of 299,496 ordinary shares representing 0.30% of shares in issue at 1 January 2006 were issued during the year to participants under discretionary plans and a further 685,767 ordinary shares representing 0.68% of shares in issue at 1 January 2006 were issued during the year to participants of the Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
A further 990,230 shares representing 0.98% of shares in issue at 1 January 2006 were transferred from the Employee benefit Trust EBT to participants of both discretionary plans and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
The shares held in the EBT are not voted on in general meetings.
Long-term incentives Long-term incentives are provided through the Groups LTIP 2005.
An award made under the LTIP 2005 represents a conditional right to receive ordinary shares in the Company at the end of a three-year period, subject to the satisfaction of pre-set performance criteria and the individual remaining in the Groups employment.
The value of an award at the date of grant may not exceed 100% of the recipients base salary in that year.
Vesting of the 2005 and 2006 awards is based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR compared with a peer group of companies.
If the Companys TSR performance over the three-year period places it below median, the award lapses.
Potential vesting rises on a straight-line basis from 30% at the median to 100% for performance at or above the upper quartile.
Irrespective of the TSR outcome, an award is then only able to vest if the Earnings Per Share EPS of the Group has also increased over the period by at least 3% compound per annum in excess of the Retail Prices Index RPI.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the performance condition for the LTIP and, in particular, the use of TSR as a performance measure.
Whilst the Committee considers that TSR remains an important indicator of the Groups success, it considers that the link between management performance and the reward received is not always strong, particularly where there is a relatively small group of comparators.
Accordingly, and subject to prior consultation with the Companys largest investors and the major UK shareholder representative bodies, it is proposed that for awards granted in and after 2007, two performance criteria will apply: 50% of an award will vest on the basis of the Groups comparative TSR performance as previously against a peer group as follows: Performance below the peer group median 0% Performance at the median 30% Performance between the median and the upper quartile pro rata vesting between 30% and 100% Performance above the upper quartile 100% always subject to the Group delivering real growth in EPS of at least 3% compound per annum over the three-year performance period.
ALFRED McALPINE PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 200633 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 50% of an award will vest if the Group achieves targets relating to compound real growth in underlying EPS.
The exact targets for the 2007 awards will be determined by the Committee, which must consider that such EPS targets will be no less challenging in the circumstances than the established TSR performance targets.
Such EPS targets will be the subject of prior consultation with investors.
By adopting this dual approach, participants will be incentivised on the basis of the Companys absolute and comparative performance.
Going forward, and assuming that an EPS target is adopted as above, the Committee will continue to review the appropriateness of EPS targets when it is proposed that an LTIP award is granted and may revise these targets from time to time subject to any revised EPS targets then adopted being no less challenging than the established TSR targets above.
TSR calculations for the LTIP 2005 are independently calculated by NBSC and veried by the Committee, as are those for the Restricted Share Plan.
Awards are expected to be satisfied from newly issued shares.
The Restricted Share Plan The Restricted Share Plan was approved by shareholders on 22 May 1996, and the final initial awards were made on 22 April 2004.
Awards made under the terms of the Restricted Share Plan represent a conditional right to receive ordinary shares in the Company, provided that the Company satisfies specic performance conditions and the participant remains in the Groups employment.
The maximum value based on market value at date of award of shares over which an initial award was made to a participant in any year did not normally exceed 50% of salary, awards of a higher value requiring shareholder approval.
Typically, initial awards were made each year following the preliminary announcement of the full-year results, but they have been made at other times when the Committee believed this to be justied.
The performance condition used to determine the vesting of initial awards is the comparative TSR performance against the peer group as shown below, which was revised following the sale of the Homes business on 1 October 2001.
Original comparator group to 2001 : AMEC plc Costain Group plc Montpellier Group plc Taylor Woodrow plc Beazer Group plc Interserve plc Morrison Construction Group plc Wainhomes Birse Group plc Kier Group plc Persimmon plc Westbury plc Bryant Group plc John Laing plc Speedy Hire plc George Wimpey plc Beazer Group plc, Birse Group plc, Bryant Group plc, John Laing plc, Morrison Construction Group plc and Wainhomes were all taken over after the start of the performance periods for the Restricted Share Plan awards.
Wainhomes is not included as a comparator company for awards made after 1999.
Montpellier Group plc changed its name to Renew Holdings plc in 2006.
Amended comparator group 2002 onwards : Amey plc Birse Group plc Interserve plc MITIE Group plc W S Atkins plc Costain Group plc Jarvis plc Morgan Sindall plc Balfour Beatty plc Galliford Try plc Kier Group plc Serco Group plc Amey plc ceased to be listed on the London Stock Exchange on 26 June 2003, following its acquisition by Ferrovial Servicios SA.
Birse Group plc ceased to be listed on the London Stock Exchange on 21 July 2006 following its acquisition by Balfour Beatty plc.
Vesting may take place from the third anniversary of the initial award date.
No awards vest if the Companys performance is below the 50th percentile.
Vesting may start at the 50th percentile, increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% of the initial award at the 40th percentile.
If the Companys performance exceeds the 40th percentile, the number of shares represented by the award increases on a proportionate basis, so that at 0 percentile when the Company ranks first in the comparator group it is equal to 150% of the initial award.
These additional rights are known as exceptional performance awards.
The rules allow for re-testing between the third and seventh anniversaries of the initial award date.
If initial awards and exceptional performance awards that have satisfied the performance condition remain in the Alfred McAlpine Employee benefit Trust the Employee benefit Trust for a further three years as deferred awards, then they may be matched on a one-for-one basis, provided that the growth in EPS of the Company exceeds the growth in the RPI by 9% or more over the three year deferral period.
Where initial awards and exceptional performance awards remain in the Plan as deferred awards, the trustee of the Employee benefit Trust has waived its entitlement to dividends on the shares represented by these awards, but the Company may elect to make a discretionary payment equivalent to the dividend payment to the participant.
ALFRED McALPINE PLC 34 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED ESOS 2005 The ESOS 2005 was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2005.
No options have yet been granted under this scheme.
The ESOS 2005 provides for discretionary options with a maximum value of 100% of base salary per annum to be granted over ordinary shares in the Company, at the market price prevailing at the date of grant.
The performance condition attaching to these options requires the Companys EPS, measured over a three-year period, to grow by at least 3% compound per annum in excess of ination.
At this level, only 30% of an option would be exercisable.
For options to be exercisable in full, the Companys EPS measured over the same period would have to grow by at least 5% compound per annum in excess of ination.
For EPS between these thresholds the exercisable proportion of an option would be calculated on a straight-line basis.
Any option, or part of an option, failing to satisfy the performance condition at the end of the three-year period lapses.
All Employee Share Schemes It is not envisaged that any further invitations will be issued under the Alfred McAlpine Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1998.
The Alfred McAlpine plc Buy As You Earn Share Scheme, which was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2000, was brought into operation in early 2007 with an invitation to all eligible employees to build a shareholding in the Company by purchasing partnership shares out of pre-tax income.
Pension arrangements During 2006, the Executive Directors participated in the McAlpine 2003 Pension Plan the 2003 Pension Plan, which is a contracted-in dened contribution pension arrangement.
The 2003 Pension Plan is operated on behalf of the Company by Zurich Corporate Pensions and is subject to the Stakeholder Pensions regulations.
The Company contribution in respect of the Executive Directors was 21% of base salary, limited by the annual contribution cap of 215k per annum.
Until 6 April 2006 the date on which various changes took effect, sometimes referred to as A-day, pension benets were subject to the HMRC earnings cap and the Group maintained a policy of providing those executives who joined the Company after May 1989 and who were subject to this cap, with appropriate pension benets outside the pension arrangements outlined above in relation to that part of their salary which exceeded the earnings cap.
This was achieved by establishing a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme FURBS for each individual or, more recently, by paying a pension supplement for the executive to invest as he considered appropriate.
In respect of Messrs Grice and Swan, the Company agreed in 1995 and 2002 respectively to target a pension of two thirds of final salary at normal retirement age.
Such commitments, which were common at the time, will not be repeated.
Details of the pension benets provided for individual Directors may be found on pages 36 and 37.
Under the provisions of the Finance Act 2004 with effect from A-day, the earnings cap was replaced by a lifetime limit on the size of the fund that can be used to pay pension benets to any individual, and an annual cap on the contributions that may be made into registered pension arrangements for the benefit of any individual.
With effect from A-day, the Group has sought to use one or more registered pension arrangements, such as the 2003 Pension Plan, and or salary supplements.
Longer-serving Executive Directors and senior executives also have final salary pension benets under the Alfred McAlpine Pension Plan the Final Salary Pension Plan, which was closed to future accrual on 31 July 2003.
Members of the Final Salary Pension Plan as at that date retain the link to pensionable salary at their eventual date of leaving in respect of service up to 31 July 2003, but have ceased to accrue benets within the Pension Plan in respect of service after 31 July 2003.
Life assurance cover of four times basic salary is provided to members of the 2003 Pension Plan whilst in service with the Group.
Dependants pensions are provided on a members death in service or in retirement.
In addition, former members of the Final Salary Pension Plan are currently provided with a further life assurance cover of two times basic salary, on death in service, which must be used to provide a dependants pension.
The Companys policy is that the cost of operating pension arrangements for Executive Directors and senior executives should not increase as a result of any changes in pension legislation, nor will Executive Directors be compensated for any adverse effect of these changes upon their existing pension arrangements.
The Remuneration Committee also takes into consideration the impact of base salary increases upon pension and associated employment costs.
Executive Directors retire at age 62.

iii Mr Robertsons salary includes arrears of 13,226 from 2005. iv Dr Urwins emoluments are shown as at the date of his appointment on 1 September 2006 and as at 31 December 2006. v Mr Hume resigned as a Director on 30 October 2003.
In mitigation of Mr Humes contractual entitlement to two years notice under the terms of his service agreement dated 1 October 1998, the Committee agreed it was appropriate to continue payment of salary and benets to Mr Hume on a month by month basis.
In the event of Mr Hume commencing prior to 30 October 2005 alternative employment that was comparable with his former position with the Company, the Company undertook to make a lump sum payment to Mr Hume equivalent after an adjustment to offset remuneration earned by Mr Hume since 1 November 2003 to 50% of the salary and benets then outstanding under his notice period.
Mr Hume commenced comparable alternative employment on 6 June 2005.
A lump sum payment of 135,328 was paid in respect of Mr Humes salary and benets in kind outstanding as at 6 June 2005 under his contractual notice period, as mitigated by the Committee.
This amount was disclosed as payable in the Directors Remuneration Report contained in the Alfred McAlpine plc Annual Report & Accounts 2005 and was included in the emoluments table for 2005.
A payment of 137,076 was paid to Mr Hume in 2006 which includes an amount equivalent to the dividends accrued on shares released under the Restricted Share Plan as well as an amount in lieu of Mr Humes rights to additional shares under the Restricted Share Plan, the payment of Mr Humes legal fees and 20,000 in respect of the foregone investment return on pension contributions from 1 August 2003 to 30 October 2005.
