At the start of the year ended 28 January 2006 only the award to Gerry Murphy included a TSR Multiplier, of 88,579 shares.
2 Once the contingent award is made in respect of the bonus earned, the only qualifying condition to receive the award before the application of the TSR Multiplier is to be in the employment of the Company at the vesting date.
To receive further shares under the application of the TSR Multiplier the TSR over the three year period following the year for which the bonus was earned must be above the median for the comparator group FTSE 100 index.
Further details of the TSR Multiplier, are described on page 38.
Unlike the other Executive Directors, Gerry Murphy did not receive the normal and final grant of options in April 2003.
Consequently his contingent share award under the KIS made in April 2004 is subject to the TSR Multiplier, details of which are described on page 38.
3 We disclosed in last years Remuneration report that these share awards under the KIS Shares scheme would be made in early 2005, in respect of the financial year ended 29 January 2005.
These share awards are structured as nominal cost options on payment in aggregate of a maximum of 1.

561,039 is the maximum number of Matching Shares which may vest for upper quartile TSR performance over the three-year performance period reducing to one-third for median performance.
Since the year end the TSR performance has been calculated and, as median performance has not been reached, no Matching Shares will vest.
