208983 St James RA Txt 20 3 07 08:03 Page 43 Remuneration Report The Directors have pleasure in presenting their Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2006.
The Report will be put to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming AGM.
It also contains additional information required by the FSA Listing Rules and the Combined Code on corporate governance.
The sections marked with an asterisk have been audited by KPMG Audit Plc.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the remuneration packages of the Chairman and executive Directors of the Company.
The Committee also monitors the remuneration of the senior management team and supervises the operation of the executive long term incentive schemes.
The members of the Committee are Michael Sorkin as Chairman, Derek Netherton and Simon Gulliford, all of whom are independent non-executive Directors.
The membership and terms of reference of the Committee are reviewed at least annually and the terms of reference are available on request and on the Companys website.
Details of the number of meetings of the Committee during the year can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 32.
The Company Secretary, Hugh Gladman, acts as Secretary to the Committee, providing advice on corporate governance, legal and regulatory issues and the design and operation of the long term incentive schemes.
At the Committees request, Committee meetings are also attended by other executives, in particular Mike Wilson, the Chairman, who may make recommendations to the Committee regarding changes to the remuneration packages of individual Directors or policy generally.
Such recommendations are discussed by the Committee and adopted or amended as the Committee sees t. No Director is present at any part of a meeting of the Committee when his own remuneration or contractual terms are being discussed.
The Committee also has access, as required, to professional advice and market data and this was provided by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC in 2006.
NBSC was appointed by the Committee to provide advice and data on executive remuneration, long term incentives and other remuneration issues and has not provided any other services to the Company.
Remuneration Policy The Committee applies the principles set out in the Combined Code when setting remuneration policy.
The remuneration policy for 2006 and future years, as approved by the Committee, is designed to ensure that remuneration is sufciently competitive to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors of sufficient calibre to enable the Group to achieve its business objectives.
The Committee aims to set xed benets salary, pension and fringe benets at slightly below the median position for companies of a similar size in the UK financial services market although a cross check is also made against companies of a similar size in other sectors, with significant annual bonus and long term incentive awards enhancing an executives potential total remuneration to on or slightly above the median, but only if stretching short term and long term performance targets are achieved.
In this way, the Committee aims to incentivise the Directors to achieve above average 42 St. Jamess Place plc Report & Accounts 2006 208983 St James RA Txt 20 3 07 08:03 Page 44 Remuneration Report continued results compared with competitor organisations.
The incentive schemes are designed to be retentive in nature as well as linking the value of an award to movements in the share price, in line with shareholder interests.
Based on data provided by NBSC, approximately 50-55% of the total remuneration of the executive Directors is performance related, except for Mike Wilson, the Chairman, where approximately 45% of his total remuneration is performance related.
The full-time Executive Chairman, Mike Wilson, does not participate in the annual bonus scheme.
He does however, participate in the long term incentive scheme the Performance Share Plan, as this plan focuses on long term value creation rather than the more  annual bonus plan.
Any shares in the Company which vest to Mike Wilson will be retained by him until he ceases to be a Director of the Company, less any shares required to meet a tax liability on vesting.
The Committee also operates shareholding guidelines for the executive Directors, whereby as and when awards vest under the PSP or other long term incentive schemes, the executive Directors are required to retain no fewer than 50% of the vested shares, less any shares required to pay any tax liability which arises on vesting, until such time as a shareholding equivalent to 100% of base salary has been achieved.
The Committee has followed the provisions of Schedule A to the Combined Code in designing schemes of performance-related remuneration.
Further details of all of the above elements of remuneration are set out below.
Salaries Salaries are reviewed annually in January, using comparative company data provided by NBSC.
As stated above, the Committee aims to set xed benets salary, pension and fringe benets slightly below the median position for companies of a similar size in the UK financial services market with a cross check with other sectors, with adjustments then being made to take into account the responsibility and accountabilities of each role, the experience of the relevant individual and any other relevant factors.
On this basis, the Committee approved the following salary increases for the executive Directors with effect from 1 January 2007: these salaries when taken together with pension and other fringe benets represent around 95% of the median, based on the comparator data provided by NBSC.
No change was made to the salary of Mike Wilson.
New Salary Previous Salary David Bellamy 300,000 280,000 Ian Gascoigne 300,000 280,000 Andrew Croft 300,000 258,000 The Committee considered that David Bellamy should also receive a temporary salary supplement for 2007 in light of his current role as acting chief executive following the resignation of Mark Lund from the Board in January 2007.
Accordingly, David Bellamy has been awarded a salary supplement of 100,000 thus increasing his salary to 400,000 for 2007.
The Committee decided that the salary supplement should be pensionable and taken into account when awarding any annual discretionary bonus for 2007.
However, his other fringe benets will be calculated by reference to his xed salary of 300,000 per annum, as will any long term incentive award under the performance share plan.
This supplemental arrangement will be reviewed at the end of 2007, if still applicable.
The salary increases have been determined after recognising the need to increase salary levels so as to provide broadly competitive xed benets.
The salary for Andrew Croft has been moved closer to but still below the market median and has been equalised with the other executive Directors in recognition of his performance and development over 2006 and the fact that he has now successfully carried out the role of Group Finance Director for more than two years.
43 St. Jamess Place plc Report & Accounts 2006 208983 St James RA Txt 20 3 07 08:03 Page 45 Remuneration Report continued Annual Bonus For 2007, as in previous years, the Committee has determined that the maximum annual bonus will be 120% of salary, with half of any bonus award payable in cash, the remainder being invested in the Companys shares and deferred for 3 years.
The operating profit target set by the Committee is based on a sliding scale, to progressively reward incremental performance.
The range of operating profit before tax for the 2007 bonus represents a significant increase from the actual level of operating profit before tax in 2006.
The committee also set out other strategic objectives for 2007, based on the business plan, and the maximum bonus has been calibrated to ensure that it will only be payable if the Committee considers that outstanding performance has been achieved by the Group and also by the executive Directors.
Taking the cash and shares element of the bonus together, up to 80% of salary will be awarded by reference to the performance of the Group, largely based on growth in European Embedded Value operating profit before tax, although the Committee retains the discretion to amend the bonus, up or down, to take into account other relevant factors such as the Groups performance compared with competitor organisations, regulatory issues and completion of other business plan objectives.
Up to a further 40% of salary will be awarded by reference to the personal performance of the executive Directors both individually and collectively as a unit.
In order to maintain a team ethic, the Committee intends to award the personal performance element of the bonus on a team basis in 2007 by applying an average of the performance gradings for the executive Directors, although the Committee intends to review this policy for 2008.
The Committee is able to take into account the performance of the Group on environmental, social and governance ESG matters when assessing the bonus to be paid to the executive Directors.
The Committee believes that the Groups remuneration structure helps to alleviate ESG risks affecting the Group.
No executive Director has a contractual right to receive an annual bonus award.
The satisfaction of the targets is assessed by reference to the Companys internal management information systems veried by the Committee, which the Committee believes is the most appropriate method, given the internal nature of the performance targets.
Mike Wilson does not participate in the annual bonus scheme.
The Committee believes that the annual bonus scheme is an effective incentive for the executive Directors, whilst at the same time offering strong retentive characteristics through the deferred element which normally lapses if an executive leaves the Group, as well as being aligned with shareholder interests due to the value of the deferred element of the award on vesting being dependent on share price performance.
Long Term Incentive Schemes All UK employees of the Group, including the executive Directors, are eligible to enter into a Save As You Earn SAYE contract, under which they are able to save up to 250 per month, and at the end of the 3 or 5 year savings period acquire shares in the Company at a price not less than 80 per cent of the market price at the date of the invitation to participate.
The sole long-term incentive plan operated by the Company is the Performance Share Plan PSP.
Under this Plan, the Committee may make awards of performance shares to the executive Directors, which vest after three years, subject to the achievement of challenging performance conditions.
The PSP is also used to make awards to other senior managers within the Group.
44 St. Jamess Place plc Report & Accounts 2006 208983 St James RA Txt 20 3 07 08:03 Page 46 Remuneration Report continued The Committee reviewed the grant levels and the performance conditions in January 2007 and decided to continue with the existing policy of making annual PSP awards to the executive Directors, subject to the same mix of EPS and TSR performance conditions as in 2006.
For 2007 awards under the PSP, two-thirds of the shares are subject to an earnings growth condition and one-third of the shares are subject to a comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR condition, both measured over a single three-year period.
Awards vest after three years subject to the achievement of the performance conditions and continued employment.
The Committee believes that this provides an appropriate balance of targets that both incentivise the executives to achieve stretching long term financial performance targets, whilst also keeping their interests aligned with those of shareholders.
Earnings per share is calculated by reference to adjusted consolidated profit after tax on the European Embedded Value EEV basis of accounting for both the life and unit trust businesses on a fully diluted per share basis.
The adjustment to the consolidated after tax gures will be to strip out any earnings from Life Assurance Holding Corporation an investment that has been sold, the EEV investment variance and any economic assumption change.
Shareholders will appreciate that these factors are not within the control of management, with the latter two factors combined producing wide variations in reported earnings due to stock market uctuations.
For the awards made in 2007, the two-thirds of the shares based on earnings will as in 2006 vest if the following growth targets are achieved: Average annual earnings growth Proportion exercisable Below RPI 8% Zero RPI 8% 25% RPI 18% or more 100% Between the above points Pro rata between 25% and 100% The Committee assessed these thresholds and believe them to be suitably demanding in the context of the prospects of the Company and the current operating environment.
For the one-third of shares based on TSR, these will vest as for awards made in 2006 as follows: Companys ranking compared to comparator group # Proportion exercisable at end of performance period Below median Zero Median 25% Upper quartile 100% Between the above points Pro rata Details of the awards made under the PSP are set out on page 50.
# The comparator group comprises:Aberdeen Asset Management, AMVESCAP, Aviva, Bradford & Bingley, Close Brothers, F&C Asset Management, Friends Provident, Henderson Group, Investec, Legal & General, New Star Asset Management, Old Mutual, Prudential, Rathbone Brothers, Resolution, Royal & SunAlliance, Schroders and Standard Life.
These companies were selected by the Committee as a result of having business interests comparable with those of the St. Jamess Place Group.
45 St. Jamess Place plc Report & Accounts 2006 208983 St James RA Txt 20 3 07 08:03 Page 47 Remuneration Report continued In considering the grant levels for awards in 2007, the Committee concluded that a modest increase in the annual grant level from 150% to 175% of salary would be appropriate for 2007 in recognition of the additional burden being placed on the executive team until such time as the Board appoints a new Chief Executive.
It is currently intended that this higher grant will be for 2007 only, before reverting to a grant level of 150% of salary in 2008.
Pension and Death in Service Benets In 2006 employer contributions of 20% of base salary were made to the money purchase section of the Groups occupational pension scheme or to a Group personal pension for the executive Directors, except for Mike Wilson who received part of the relevant amount as additional salary due to the pensions cap.
The costs of the pension and death in service arrangements for the executive Directors during the year ended 31 December 2006 are shown on page 49 and 50.
Service Agreements It is the Committees policy that service agreements should generally terminate on the executives 65th birthday and should not contain notice periods in excess of one year.
The terms and conditions of the Directors service agreements are reviewed regularly and all service agreements contain an express obligation on the executive to mitigate his loss in the event the agreement is terminated.
In addition, the Company reserves the right to pay an amount representing the value of salary and benets in lieu of any outstanding period of notice on a monthly basis so that, should the executive obtain alternative employment during the notice period, the monthly payments can be reduced to take into account any earnings received under the new employment.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, for example illness.
The Committee adopted the above principles when determining the compensation payable to Mark Lund when he left the Group on 5 January 2007.
All of the executive Directors have entered into a service agreement with the Company.
Each service agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
The agreements automatically terminate on the 65th birthday of the executive increased from age 60 due to recent age discrimination legislation.
All the service agreements provide for benets in kind, including life assurance, pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
Mike Wilson is also entitled to a chauffeur.

Non-executive Directors The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole, within the limits set by the provisions of the Articles of Association.
A basic annual fee of 20,000 per annum was paid to the non-executive Directors in 2006, with additional fees being paid in respect of Board Committee and other responsibilities.
The Board reviewed the fees paid to the non-executive Directors in January 2007, in light of increased responsibilities due to the new Combined Code and other corporate governance changes.
The Board decided to increase the basic annual fee to 25,000 per annum and the fees paid for membership of certain committees were also increased where felt appropriate due to increased time commitments.

No other Directors had any such contributions made on their behalf.
75,000 of Mike Wilsons contributions were paid as additional salary due to the pensions cap.
iv For the annual discretionary bonus in 2006, executive Directors could earn up to 80% of salary by reference to Group performance based on growth in pre-tax operating profit and other business plan targets set at the start of the year, including growth in the Groups sales force the St. Jamess Place Partnership, growth in the productivity of the Partnership and the successful launch of various initiatives such as new products and additional funds to further develop the Groups unique approach to investment management.
A further payment of up to 40% of salary could be earned by reference to individual performance, based on personal objectives set at the start of the year and the executives performance generally in 2006.
The Remuneration Committee met in January 2007 to review the performance of the Group and the executives against the objectives set at the start of the year.
In light of the exceptional performance of the Group in 2006, including the 54% growth in pre-tax operating profits compared to 2005, the Committee awarded the maximum bonus of 120% of salary to each of the current executive Directors, 50% of which was payable in cash and the remaining 50% used to purchase deferred shares which vest in 3 years, subject to continued employment.
Further details of the annual bonus scheme can be found on page 44.
