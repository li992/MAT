The benefits in kind for each executive director comprise the provision of a company car and fuel or equivalent cash-for-car allowance, private health insurance and the value of matching shares provided by the Company under the SIP.
Other emoluments principally comprise a discretionary bonus in respect of the benefit in kind tax liability arising from contributions to the CPP.
The increase in other emoluments in 2005 06 reflects a special contribution made to the CPP to fund a deficiency in respect of pre 6 April 2006 benefits and to cover the cost of insuring death in service benefits in order to deal with the change in the tax regime for pension schemes under the Finance Act 2004.
Contingent share awards were based on the market value of the Companys shares at the date of award, with a maximum value of 100% of basic salary.
The shares will not normally be released to the participant until the completion of the three year performance period.
Vesting of awards depends on the performance of the Companys TSR compared to that of a group of utility and industrial and service sector companies the Comparator Group over a three year performance period.
If during the three year performance period a Comparator Group company is no longer appropriate e. g. due to fide-listing or takeover to be included in the Comparator Group, the Committee has discretion to adjust the Comparator Group.
At the end of the performance period actual awards will be determined as follows.
No award will vest if TSR performance is below that of the median ranking company in the Comparator Group.
If TSR performance is equal to that of the median ranking company in the Comparator Group, the participant will receive 50% of the award.
If TSR performance is equal to or greater than that of the upper quartile ranking company in the Comparator Group, the participant will receive 100% of the award.
The proportion of the award which the participant may receive for TSR ranking between the median and upper quartile of the Comparator Group will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
The Committee will satisfy itself that the recorded TSR, which is calculated by independent remuneration consultants, is consistent with the achievement of commensurate underlying financial performance before any shares are received by participants.
The Committee reviewed TSR performance for the three year performance period ended 31 December 2005 in relation to contingent share awards made in 2003.
The Companys TSR was higher than the median ranking TSR performance in the Comparator Group.
In accordance with the terms of the contingent share award the Committee also considered the Companys underlying financial performance over the performance period and was satisfied that no material discrepancy existed.
As a result, 53.2% of the 2003 contingent share awards were awarded to participants on 8 February 2006.
The Comparator Group companies for these contingent share awards were: ARRIVA Kelda Associated British Ports Mersey Docks AWG National Express BAA National Grid Transco Bristol Water Pennon Centrica Scottish and Southern Energy East Surrey Scottish Power FirstGroup Severn Trent Forth Ports South Staffordshire Go Ahead Group Stagecoach International Power United Utilities Directors Remuneration Report 35 2 For conditional awards granted under the PSP in 2005 06, 50% of an award is based on the ROCE achieved by the Group, and 50% is based on the Companys TSR performance, both over a three year performance period.
Contingent share awards are based on the market value of the Companys shares at the date of award, with a maximum value of 100% of basic salary.
For achieving the threshold level of performance, under both the ROCE and the TSR elements, 25% of the maximum award will vest.
At the minimum level of ROCE, 13.5%, the minimum number of shares will vest: all of the shares will vest if the maximum ROCE, 14.3%, is achieved over the performance period: there will be a sliding scale of vesting for performance between the minimum and maximum.
For the other 50% of the award, based on the Companys TSR relative to the constituents of the FTSE mid-250 Index excluding investment trusts, the minimum level of award will vest if the Companys performance is at the median level, all of the shares will vest if the upper quartile is achieved and there will be a sliding scale of vesting if the Companys TSR performance is between the median and the upper quartile of companies within that Index.
In order to ensure that the assessment of performance is independent, remuneration consultants will report to the Committee as to whether the TSR performance criteria have been met.
The Committee will determine whether the ROCE performance criteria have been met based on the Companys audited accounts for the three year performance period.
3 For the conditional awards granted under the CIP in 2005 06 executive directors and participating senior managers invest in the Companys shares investment shares up to a maximum value equal to the greater of 20% of gross annual salary or 100% of gross performance bonus received.
Provided that investment shares are retained for a further three years, and provided also that participants remain in employment, they are eligible for a matching share award as disclosed in the table.
The minimum award is one share for every two investment shares i. e. a 50% match.
The level of match can increase by up to one further share for every one investment share subject to the same performance conditions as those applying under the PSP.
Therefore, if the maximum level of ROCE was achieved and the Companys relative TSR was at or above the upper quartile, there would be a maximum award of three shares for every two investment shares i. e. a 150% match: there will be a sliding scale of matching awards to the extent that actual ROCE and TSR performance are between the minimum and maximum levels.

Following the 1997 and 2000 actuarial valuations of VGPS, part of the designated surplus was set aside for distribution to Focus members.
On retirement these funds would be used to provide benefits in addition to those ordinarily provided by VGPS.
The final payment into these funds was made in May 2003.
As Focus members, three of the executive directors have designated funds allocated to them by the VGPS trustees for their benefit.
The values of these amounts as at 31 March 2006 were: Patrick Bourke 23,711, Patrick Haren 33,769 and Harry McCracken 59,866.
These amounts are not included in the accrued benefits and transfer values quoted above.
For Patrick Bourke, Patrick Haren and Harry McCracken target pension benefits are based on 1 30 of final salary for each year of pensionable service after 1 April 1998, 1 45 of final salary for service between 1 April 1994 31 March 1992 for Patrick Haren and 1 April 1998 and 1 60 of final salary for service prior to 1 April 1994, with aggregate benefits subject to a maximum pension of 2 3 of final salary less retained benefits from previous UK employments.
Harry McCracken reached this maximum limit in August 2003 and pensionable service accrual and member contributions ceased from that date.
His benefits have been registered with HMRC for enhanced protection under the Finance Act 2004.
Pension increases are in line with inflation, with increases above 5% at the Companys discretion.
If a director takes early retirement without Board consent a pension with actuarial reduction would be payable from age 50.
A pension on ill-health retirement would be based on potential service to normal pension age.
In the event of a change in control of the Company resulting in early retirement, there would be no actuarial reduction for early payment of pension over the age of 50.
If the executive dies whilst in service, a lump sum of four times final salary and a contingent spouses pension of 2 3 of the directors pension based on service to normal pension age would be payable.
In respect of Laurence MacKenzie, a member of Options, the Company pays contributions of 25% of basic salary 2005 06: 3,831 from 2 March 2006 on his appointment as an executive director.
The Company also provides for death in service benefits lump sum of four times salary and a spouses pension of 1 3 of salary and an ill health retirement pension 50% of salary through Options.
