Report on Directors remuneration Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors Report Regulations 2002, the Regulations.
The auditors are required to report on the audited part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report is therefore divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
The Board have reviewed the Groups compliance with the Combined Code the Code on remuneration related matters.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages that will retain talented people in the business, enable the recruitment of appropriately skilled and experienced newcomers and be seen as competitive in the markets in which the Group operates.
The Remuneration Committee believes that shareholders interests are best served by remuneration packages having a large emphasis on performance-related pay.
It is therefore the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior performance by Executives.
The Remuneration Committees policy is to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in comparison to the Groups Comparator Group: Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in kind Share incentives Lower quartile Upper quartile Lower quartile to median Market practice Upper quartile Unaudited information Remuneration Committee Your Board believes that a properly constituted Remuneration Committee is key to ensuring that the Groups policy on Executive Directors remuneration supports the creation of enhanced shareholder value.
The Board has therefore delegated to the Boards Remuneration Committee the assessment and recommendation of a broad policy on executive remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee of the Board comprises Fritz Ternofsky Chairman, Mike Foster and Martin Glenn all of whom are independent Non-executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee determines the remuneration and benefits packages for Executive Directors and any changes to their service contracts, as well as the remuneration of Senior Group Executives.
The Committee also approves any share incentive and performance bonus arrangements.
The Remuneration Committee has formal written terms of reference, a copy of which is available from the Company Secretary or from the Companys website.
The Remuneration Committee appointed and received wholly independent advice on executive compensation and associated share scheme administration, from Halliwell Consulting.
No other services were provided to the Group by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
In determining Executive Directors and Senior Group Executives remuneration for the year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with the Chief Executive, Giles Thorley.
No Executive played a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The Company Secretary, Neil Preston, was available to provide advice to the members of the Remuneration Committee when required.
The Remuneration Committee met formally four times during the year.
Review of Executive Remuneration Policy for 2006 2007 The Remuneration Committee annually reviews its policy for executive compensation with its retained consultants, Halliwell Consulting, in line with its commitment to shareholders to continually review on an annual basis the appropriateness of its policy.
The main results of the review of Executive Remuneration Policy are: The Remuneration Committee has determined to retain the Comparator Group used for benchmarking the Groups executive compensation agreed with shareholders during the 2005 shareholder consultation rather than apply the criteria set out in the 2005 Annual Report and Financial Statements which provides that the Comparator Group used shall consist of companies that are members of the FTSE 350 Leisure and Hotels Index and which are one of the 250 largest as measured by market capitalisation companies listed on the Stock Exchange.
The main reason why the Remuneration Committee has made this determination is the change in the designation of FTSE Sectors which now means that the Group is a constituent of the FTSE Travel and Leisure Index.
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the travel companies in the Index are inappropriate for benchmarking the Groups remuneration and, therefore, the current Comparator Group remains the most appropriate see below for the constituents of the Comparator Group.
The Remuneration Committee believes that its current policy of paying below median levels of fixed compensation salary, benefits and pension and having upper quartile levels of potential performance-based compensation bonus potential and share incentives is appropriate to the entrepreneurial culture of the Group and is in the best interests of shareholders.
The Committee is principally focused on ensuring that the total compensation value is competitive compared to the constituents of the Comparator Group.
It is the opinion of both the Committee and its adviser that this is a more robust approach than looking at each element of the compensation package in isolation which does not allow for a full reflection of the different remuneration policies operated by the constituents of the Comparator Group.
Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 31 Report on Directors remuneration continued The Committee, however, as a result of the review has identified two main problems with the actual compensation paid by the Group to its Executives compared to its shareholder approved policy which is resulting in the total compensation value failing to reach the policy level.
The two issues are interlinked and compound one another, they are: the current levels of salary are in fact generally below the lower quartile compared to the Comparator Group see salary section on page 33 for more information.
This below lower quartile salary position is magnified when looking at the total compensation value because bonus potential and levels of share incentive, while appearing competitive as a percentage of salary, were not in terms of absolute value.
The Committee accepts that the flexibility of higher levels of performance compensation agreed by shareholders was conditional on its below median fixed compensation policy.
However, without increasing salaries to the lower quartile position there is insufficient leveraging in the bonus and share incentives to provide a competitive total compensation value.
It should be noted that this total compensation value is significantly weighted towards the performance elements of the package and the majority of this value will not actually be earned unless bonus and share incentive targets are consistently achieved: the current policy level of the annual share incentive grant provided as a combination of share options and LTIP awards, while again appearing to be competitive as a percentage of salary, is not providing a competitive level of fair value because: market practice has moved towards LTIP only awards which have a higher unit value than an option which means that a 200% of salary combined award is worth significantly less than a 200% of salary LTIP only award: and the knock-on effect of basing the level of grant on a salary level significantly below the stated policy.
The Remuneration Committee therefore explored two potential solutions to the current uncompetitive level of total compensation: increase salaries to a level which, with the current bonus and share incentive policy, would result in a competitive total compensation value if full bonus and share entitlements were earned: or increase the levels of salary to around the lower quartile position and maximise the long-term performance-based compensation.
The Remuneration Committee felt that the second alternative was in the best interests of both the Group and shareholders because it maximised the element of the compensation value that was performance-based.
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee, in line with best practice, reviewed the operation of its current share incentives with a particular focus on how discretion has been exercised, grant levels under the plans, performance criteria and vesting schedules which have been previously approved by shareholders to take into account the current situation and to ensure going forward they remain appropriate to the Groups circumstances and prospects.
The result of this review has been a decision by the Remuneration Committee to make no future grants to the Executives of the Company under the Punch Taverns plc Discretionary Share Plan DSP.
It is the Remuneration Committees current intention for 2006 2007 and future financial years that share incentives granted to the Executives of the Company will be provided entirely as awards under the Punch Taverns plc Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The reasons for this change in summary are: to ensure that the Group remains competitive with its peers when providing share incentives to its Executives: to reflect the change in accounting treatment which results in the LTIP providing a better cost vs. benefit ratio for the Group: and the rules of the LTIP are in line with todays best practice whereas elements of the option programme reflect the different corporate governance environment at the time of their adoption.
Comparator Group The Comparator Group used for benchmarking the Groups remuneration in 2005 2006 consisted of the following companies: fide Vere Group plc Mitchells & Butlers plc Enterprise Inns plc MyTravel plc First Choice Holidays plc Rank Group plc Greene King plc Stanley Leisure plc Hilton Group plc Whitbread plc Intercontinental Hotels Group plc William Hill plc J. D. Wetherspoon plc Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries plc Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc The basis of the selection of the Comparator Group was: companies with related businesses to the Group: companies of a comparable size to the Group: companies with the similar types of operation to the Group: and companies competing for the same pool of executive talent.
com Elements of Executive Directors remuneration Basic salary Policy: Lower quartile The full rationale behind the Committees decision to raise salaries has been set out earlier in the report.
The Committee recognises the concern that shareholders have when executive salaries are seen to rise materially.
However, the Committee feels that the rises are justified taking into account the following: the actual salaries are below the Groups policy position which is already set at a level below the median market rate.
This can be fide-motivational to a highly successful management team which cannot be in the long-term interests of the Group and its shareholders: the Groups policy is to look to the performance elements of the compensation package to provide substantial levels of reward.
However, without a reasonable level of base salary this is not possible without substantially increasing the bonus potential or levels of share incentive awards.
The Committee has already made full use of the shareholder approved performance elements of the compensation package by granting LTIP awards only and increasing the maximum level of grant see later section on the LTIP.
The following table sets out the base salary paid in 2005 2006 and the salaries which will apply for 2006 2007: Lower quartile Median quartile salary in salary in Salary Salary Percentage Comparator Comparator Name 2005 2006 2006 2007 rise Group Group Giles Thorley 410,000 450,000 9.8% 408,000 557,000 Robert McDonald 240,000 257,000 7.1% 250,000 341,000 Adrian Fawcett 215,000 247,500 15.1% 263,000 338,000 Jonathan Paveley 190,000 220,000 15.8% 263,000 338,000 When determining the salary of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, with particular focus on the lower quartile salary levels of those companies within the Comparator Group: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the performance of the Group and the level of shareholder returns: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and pay and conditions throughout the Group.
Other than the Chief Executive, the Executive Directors do not have any external appointments as directors of other companies.
The Chief Executive is a Non-executive Director of First Choice Holidays plc and Esporta Group Limited for which he receives 30,000 per annum from each company, which he retains.
Annual performance related bonus Policy: Upper quartile bonus potential Bonus payments are not pensionable.
Executive Directors and Senior Group Executives participate in the Punch Taverns plc Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The objectives of the Plan are: to ensure the satisfaction of stretching performance targets before bonuses are earned: to provide an element of bonus earned in shares: to provide a retention mechanism for Executives by rewarding the retention of the share element of their bonus, subject to certain performance conditions being satisfied: and to provide a Plan which assists Executives in meeting their minimum shareholding requirements.
Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 33 Report on Directors remuneration continued The following table summarises the main features of the Plan all percentages in the table are percentages of basic salary : All Executive Bonus Performance condition Directors Maximum annual bonus potential 100% Cash element Annual performance targets see table below 75% paid net of tax through payroll at the end of the financial year Bonus Shares Annual performance targets see table below 25% acquired net of tax and held in the Plan Deferred Bonus Shares Will only be released if the following conditions 25% calculated on the pre-tax amount of bonus are satisfied over the three year holding period used to acquire the Bonus Shares from the date of award: continued employment by the Executive: 1 Group average EPS growth RPI 5% p. a. retention by the Executive of the associated Bonus Shares.
The bonus earned by the Executive Directors in respect of 2005 2006 is set out in the following table: Giles Robert Adrian Jonathan Bonus Thorley McDonald Fawcett Paveley 2006 bonus paid 307,500 129,600 116,100 100,700 and as % of base salary 75% 54% 54% 53% 2 Fair market value of the Deferred Bonus Shares granted 47,479 29,101 24,840 21,307 The bonuses for 2005 2006 have been paid on the basis of the level of the satisfaction of the performance targets.

It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the current types of performance targets remain appropriate for 2006 2007.
1 Earnings per share EPS is the total profits of the Group divided by the number of shares in issue which gives the profit generated per share.
2 Fair market value FMV for an award under the Plan is based on the value of the shares at the date of award as calculated under IFRS 2.
com Share incentives Policy: Upper quartile The Remuneration Committees policy is to provide annual share grants to Executives at the upper quartile level compared to the Comparator Group.
However, the Committee has determined in this years review that while the percentage of salary granted under the combined DSP LTIP grant is consistent with its policy the absolute value of the awards granted is not at the upper quartile.
It is key to the Committees policy that the potential value of share incentives granted is at the upper quartile to ensure that, where the Executive team perform, there is a competitive total compensation value.
This is particularly important in the case of the Group where salary has been set below the median.
The Executive team support the performance focus of the compensation package and therefore accept that where the performance has not been delivered the total compensation value will be below the median.
However, the Remuneration Committee believes that it is essential that where the performance is delivered the total compensation value is at least at the median of Executives peers in the Comparator Group.
Therefore, the Remuneration Committee has: changed its policy for 2006 2007 and for following years by determining to only grant awards under the Punch Taverns plc LTIP to the Groups Executives: and increased the level of grant under the LTIP to 200% of salary for all Executive Directors.
3 The Remuneration Committee believes that the LTIP with its Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition most effectively aligns the interests of Executives with those of shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee will also ensure the underlying financial performance of the Group is consistent with its TSR performance and will at the time of the release of the relevant award provide a full explanation of why this was the case.
In addition, the earnings per share growth measure used in conjunction with the deferred bonus shares ensures that Executives are also focused on the absolute financial performance of the Group.
This structure demonstrates the Remuneration Committees desire to correlate incentive arrangements with the achievement of superior performance.
The EPS figures used by the Group to calculate the vesting of options or the release of deferred bonus shares will be the audited EPS figures before non-recurring and exceptional items tax normalised disclosed in the Group financial statements.
2005 2006 The following table summarises the main features of the discretionary share arrangements operated by the Group for its Executive Directors and Senior Group Executives and the grants made to the Executive Directors during the year: Maximum annual grant Giles Robert Adrian Jonathan 4 face value Thorley McDonald Fawcett Paveley as percentage percentage of percentage of percentage of percentage of of salary Performance condition salary & FMV salary & FMV salary & FMV salary & FMV Combined limit 300% LTIP 200% TSR performance of the Group over the three 133% 100% 100% 100% Details of year performance period compared to the 272,976 119,845 107,359 94,877 5 awards are Comparator Group.

It is normally used comparatively and the company which achieves the best return is ranked number one.
4 Face value for an option is the number of shares multiplied by the exercise price.
For awards under the LTIP face value is the aggregate market value of the shares subject to the award at the date of grant.
5 The Remuneration Committee will satisfy itself that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
Due to the performance condition on awards of deferred bonus shares made under the current share incentive policy one of the corporate performance measures that the Remuneration Committee will be considering in determining whether the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance of the Group is its EPS performance over the measurement period.
Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 35 Report on Directors remuneration continued 2005 2006 Basis of performance condition selection and measurement The Remuneration Committee took the following factors into account when deciding the appropriate earnings per share performance measure for grants of options during 2005 2006: the median and upper quartile historic levels of year on year growth in earnings per share for the Comparator Group companies: and the projected EPS growth for the Company provided by external analysts.
Earnings per share was selected as the performance condition for options by the Remuneration Committee as in combination with options it ensures that both the Companys share price and its underlying financial value increases before any benefit is provided to Executives.
Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for LTIP awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that the Executives have outperformed their peers in the Comparator Group over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards or options are satisfied.
Where the performance requirements are based on EPS the Committee will use the principles behind the audited figures disclosed in the Groups financial statements, and may take advice from independent advisers as to whether any adjustments are required to ensure consistency in accordance with the terms of the performance conditions.
Where the performance measure is TSR, Halliwell Consulting, the Remuneration Committees advisers shall calculate the TSR in accordance with the principles behind the Regulations and sign off these figures prior to the release of any award.
2006 2007 The following table sets out the proposed grants to be made to the Executive Directors under the new policy of LTIP only awards: Maximum annual grant Giles Robert Adrian Jonathan 6 face value Thorley McDonald Fawcett Paveley as percentage percentage of percentage of percentage of percentage of of salary Performance condition salary & FMV salary & FMV salary & FMV salary & FMV LTIP 200% TSR performance of the Group over the 200% 200% 200% 200% three year performance period compared to 450,000 257,000 247,500 220,000 7 the Comparator Group.

Dilution The following table sets out the current level of dilution against the ABI limits for all share plans and discretionary plans principally Executive Plans and sets out the commitments to issue shares made during the financial year reported: Additional dilution Current during the year Maximum dilution in question 10% dilution in ten years 1.47% 0.27% 5% dilution in ten years 1.19% 0.25% In accordance with the ABI guidelines the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all its share plans.
In addition, of this 10% the Company can only issue 5% to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive plans.
The additional dilution considers the commitments the Company has made under its share plans during the financial year.
It should be noted that the above figures exclude 3.21% of dilution relating to options granted prior to the Companys flotation in May 2002 and therefore not subject to the ABI guidelines.
6 Face value for awards under the LTIP is the aggregate market value of the shares subject to the award at the date of grant.
7 The Remuneration Committee will satisfy itself that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
com Shareholding requirement As part of the introduction of the Groups share incentive policy Executive Directors and Senior Group Executives who have been selected to participate in the LTIP are required to satisfy a minimum shareholding requirement.
The following table shows the minimum shareholding requirement for Executive Directors as a percentage of salary and their current shareholding: Giles Robert Adrian Jonathan Thorley McDonald Fawcett Paveley Executive shareholding requirement as a percentage of salary to be 200% 150% 150% 150% 8 built up by end of 2008 2009 current shareholding in bold 343% 265% 38% 15% Pension Policy: Lower quartile to median Giles Thorley, Robert McDonald, Adrian Fawcett and Jonathan Paveley are entitled to receive a contribution to their personal pension arrangements representing 12% of their salary.
Benefits in kind Policy: Market practice In line with market practice, the Groups policy is to provide Executive Directors with standard benefits in kind appropriate for executive directors, such as a car or car allowance, medical insurance and life assurance.
The chart below demonstrates the balance between fixed and variable performance-based compensation for each Executive Director for 2005 2006: Balance between fixed & performance-based compensation 000s Key Fixed compensation is: salary paid 861.7 pension contribution benefits Performance-based compensation is: 453.3 bonus available 406.1 358.9 fair value of LTIP on grant fair value of option on grant 487.0 284.8 257.0 235.0 Thorley McDonald Fawcett Paveley Varible compensation Fixed compensation Total compensation Policy: Median to upper quartile depending on performance The following table shows: the total compensation value for each of the Executive Directors for 2005 2006: the total compensation value for each of the Executive Directors for 2006 2007 incorporating the increased level of salaries and the new LTIP only policy grant of 200% of salary: and the total compensation values for the Executives peers in the Comparator Group for 2005 2006.
The total compensation value includes base salary, maximum bonus potential, benefits, defined contribution pension contributions and the fair market value of share grants.
It should be noted that the FMV of LTIP and option awards are not the value that will be 9 received by the Executives but represent the accounting cost to the Group of providing these share incentives under IFRS 2.
The FMV calculation is based on a series of assumptions and may not equate to the actual value received by the Executive Directors on release.
In addition, no benefit under the LTIP award or option will be provided unless the attached performance conditions are satisfied and will also depend on the share price on release.

Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 37 Report on Directors remuneration continued It should be noted that even with the changes to the compensation package made by the Remuneration Committee for 2006 2007, the total compensation value is at the median for the Chief Executive and below the median of the Comparator Group in respect of the other Executive Directors.
In addition, the largest proportion of this total compensation value will only be provided to Executive Directors if the performance conditions on the annual bonus and LTIP are satisfied.
It would be the intention of the Group, subject to ongoing high levels of performance, to ensure that total compensation is above the median level of the Comparator Group within two years.

Non-executive Directors fees Policy: Median level fees All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the Chairman and Chief Executive or, in the case of the Chairman, is determined by the Remuneration Committee based on recommendations from the Senior Independent Director and the Chief Executive within the limits set by the Articles of Association and based on the median level of fees payable to peers in the same Comparator Group as that used for Executive Directors remuneration.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share incentive schemes or performance based plans and are not eligible to join any of the Groups pension schemes.
It is the Boards policy to take into account the following factors in determining the fees of the Non-executive Directors: the median level of fees for similar positions in the Comparator Group: and the time commitment each Non-executive Director makes to the Group through membership of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
The following table sets out the Non-executive fees for 2005 2006 and the fees for 2006 2007: 2005 2006 2006 2007 per annum per annum Basic fee 37,000 39,000 Senior Independent Director 40,000 42,000 Fees for chairing the Audit or Remuneration Committee 7,000 10,000 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 39 Report on Directors remuneration continued Total shareholder return performance graph The graph shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return TSR, compared with the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Index and the Comparator Group.
