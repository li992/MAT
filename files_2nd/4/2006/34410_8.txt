The performance conditions determining the vesting of LTIP awards from 2006 were amended so that they are the same as those applying to the SMP as set out above.
Although the maximum award level under the LTIP is 200% of base salary per annum, initial awards for Executive directors in 2006 were 150% of base salary.

For awards made over shares worth more than 150% of basic salary, awards will vest on a sliding scale ranging between 0% of the award if the aggregate percentage outperformance is 7.5% and 100% of the award if the aggregate outperformance is 10% over the relevant period.
There is no opportunity for re-testing of performance.
b For LTIP awards made in 2006, the performance conditions are the same as those for the SMP as detailed above.
All options granted under the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme above were not exercisable unless the TSR of the Company over any three-year period from the date of grant was at least equal to the 50th percentile median of TSR for companies in a comparator group consisting of other property investment companies.
If the return was equal to the median then the option could exercised at any time over 50% of the shares in respect of which it was granted.
If the return was at least equal to the 40th percentile of TSR of the comparator group, the option could be exercised over all the shares in respect of which it was granted.
b Options granted under 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme.
All outstanding options granted under the 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme will not be exercisable unless the TSR of the Company over any three-year period from the date of grant is at least equal to the 50th percentile median of TSR for companies in a comparator group consisting of the FTSE 350 Actuaries Real Estate sector.
If the return is equal to the median then the option may be exercised at any time over 50% of the shares in respect of which it was granted.
If the return is at least equal to the 25th percentile upper quartile of TSR of the comparator group, the option may be exercised over all the shares in respect of which it was granted.
If the return is between the median and upper quartile then the option may be exercised over 50%-100% of the shares on a sliding scale.
If the options have not become exercisable in full at the end of the initial three-year period, performance may be re-tested on two further occasions, on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
Re-testing will not apply for options granted in 2004 and beyond.

The middle market price of an Ordinary share at the close of business on 31 December 2006 was 576p.
The low and high middle prices of an Ordinary share during the year were 415.75p and 577p respectively.
The aggregate gain before tax made by the Directors on the exercise of share options during the year was 1,999,485 2005: 4,128 of which 1,031,256 was the gain on the exercise of share options by Steven Owen and 968,229 was the gain on the exercise of shares options by Tim Wheeler.
The Register of Directors Interests in Shares, which is open to inspection at the Companys registered office, contains full details of the Directors shareholdings and options to acquire shares.
Shareholding guidelines At the same time as the introduction of the SMP and the amendments to the LTIP, the Company introduced shareholding guidelines under which Executive directors agree to build a holding of shares in the Company equal in value to 200% of salary within five years of the introduction of the SMP and amendments to the LTIP or if later, five years from the executives appointment.
Pension Executive directors are entitled to participate in the Companys Pension Plan which is non-contributory for members.
Up until 5 April 2006, Executive directors were entitled to a pension based on 1 30 of basic salary for each year of service up to a maximum of two thirds of salary based on a retirement age of 63.
This was reduced to 60 years with effect from 1 January 2006.
The scheme provided a lump sum in the event of the death of a member in service of three times basic salary and a dependants pension on the death of a member in service or after retirement of two thirds of the members prospective pension.
Executive directors pension provision was reviewed in the light of the changes to the taxation of pensions introduced from April 2006.
Following this review, both Executive directors agreed to cease to accrue future service benefits under the Companys Pension Plan and now receive a cash supplement of 35% of base salary which is appropriate in relation to benefits foregone and market practice.
They became deferred members of the Plan with effect from 5 April 2006.
Also in line with market practice, the lump sum provided in the event of an Executive directors death in service was increased from three to four times salary.
20 Other benefits Executive directors are provided with a car allowance and are entitled to private medical health cover.
They are also entitled to participate in the Companys Share Incentive Plan and SAYE Share Option Scheme on the same basis as other employees.
Service agreements Service agreements for the Executive directors are on a one-year rolling basis and, therefore, may normally be terminated by either party on giving one years notice.
The Company applies the principle of mitigation to any payment of compensation on termination as a result of unsatisfactory performance.
Current service agreements for the two Executive directors were executed on 19 October 2000 and varied by an agreement dated 23 March 2004 to reflect a reduction in entitlement to 12 months remuneration in the event of termination following a takeover.
Appointments outside the Group In appropriate circumstances, the Committee will allow the Executive directors to accept an outside appointment.
No Executive director currently holds any outside appointment.
Non-executive directors fees The fees of the Non-executive directors are determined by the Board as a whole, which takes into account the level of fees paid by similar companies and also the involvement of the Non-executive directors in the various Board Committees.
No Non-executive director currently serving is entitled to participate in the Companys Pension Plan.
Non-executive directors do not participate in bonus or long-term incentive plans and are not entitled to compensation upon termination of their involvement with the Company.
In the light of the increased involvement of Non-executive directors anticipated by the revised Combined Code, Non-executive directors fees are now reviewed annually, in accordance with the advice of NBSC.
The current fees were reviewed in March 2007 and are now an annual base fee of 37,500 with additional annual fees of 4,500 for the role of Senior Independent Director and 7,000 for the role of Chairman of the Audit or Remuneration Committees.
The Chairmans annual fee is now 140,000.
Non-executive directors are not appointed for specified terms but are subject to election or re-election by shareholders at least every three years.
The initial appointment dates and next date of re-election for the current Non-executive directors are as follows: Date next subject to Appointment date re-election 1 Nicholas Fry 18 March 2003 2009 2 Stephen Harris 1 September 2006 2007 3 Louise Patten 1 June 2001 2007 4 David Scotland 1 January 2003 2009 Current fee levels: 1.

Note 2: Based on the exceptional performance of the Company and the two Executive directors in the year, the Committee determined that a bonus in excess of the normal 100% of salary maximum would be appropriate.
Supporting this decision was the increase in shareholders funds of 276 million and the portfolio rental value growth of 3.8% which far exceeded the 1.7% for the IPD UK Industrial Index comparator for Brixtons areas of operation.
The additional bonuses of 50% of salary for Tim Wheeler and 25% of salary for Steven Owen will be awarded in Company shares, deferred for three years.

The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the Companys Pension Plan.
The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The disclosure of two different transfer value figures in the table relating to increases in the year is to ensure compliance with both Companies Act and Listing Rules disclosure requirements.
The increase in the transfer values at the end of the year reflect the changes made to Executive directors pension entitlements as described in the note on Pensions above, the adoption of revised assumptions for the calculation of transfer values that account for a lower risk investment strategy and increased life expectancy and also the increase in members benefits accrued during the year.
