Remuneration Report The Directors confirm that the Company has complied with the Principles and underlying Provisions relating to Directors remuneration of The Combined Code of Corporate Governance the Code published in July 2003 and revised in June 2006 and that this Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Details of each individual Directors remuneration for 2006 are set out on page 62.
Information on Directors share and share option interests may be found on pages 65 and 66.
Remuneration Committee the Committee : Composition, Responsibilities and Operation The names of the members of the Committee who served during the year ended 31 December 2006 are as follows: Mr N H Northridge Chairman Mr A C Salvesen Mr R V McGlone The Committee is entirely composed of Non-executive Directors.
They have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided, no potential conicts of interest arising from crossdirectorships and no day-to-day operational responsibility within the Group.
The Committees principal function is to determine the policy on remuneration for the most senior executives and to approve the specic remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary, including their service contracts.
The Committee also has responsibility for making a recommendation to the Board in respect of the remuneration of the Chairman.
The Committees remit therefore includes, but is not restricted to, basic salary, benets in kind, performance related awards, share options and share awards, long-term incentive schemes, pension rights, and any compensation or termination payments.
In exercising its responsibilities the Committee has access to professional advice, both inside and outside the Company, and consults with the Chairman and Group Chief Executive.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on our website at www.
com investors under the heading Corporate Governance.
There are a number of external advisors appointed by the Company who advise on remuneration matters for the wider workforce and also provide advice to the Committee from time to time.
Principal advisors in the year were as follows: Towers Perrin provided remuneration consultancy with respect to basic salary, bonus plans and executive long-term incentive plans.
New Bridge Street Consultants provided advice on the implementation and administration of share plans.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting provided advice on retirement benets in the UK and overseas and administers the UK dened benefit pension scheme.
Remuneration Policy The Committee has adopted the following policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors throughout 2006.
It is intended that this policy will apply in 2007 and future years.
Annual Salaries Salaries are determined by a combination of the individuals contribution to the business and the market rate for the job.
The Company typically pays the market median, for standard performance in the job, and pays up to the market upper quartile for upper quartile performance.
On occasions it may be necessary to pay above the market median to attract people of the right calibre to meet the needs of the business.
The appropriate market rate is the rate in the market place from which the individual is most likely to be recruited.
The Company operates in a number of market places throughout the world where remuneration practice and levels differ.
This can result in pay and benefit differentials between the Executive Directors.
In arriving at an appropriate market rate, reference is made to a number of well-established salary surveys covering similar jobs of the same size in a large sample of companies in the manufacturing and service sectors in the UK.
The same consistent approach is taken for expatriate and overseas salaries where reference is made to the appropriate surveys for the geographical location.
The Companys pay systems are designed to allow progression that reects an individuals contribution to the business and to control overall cost.
Pay and benefit structures are designed to be cost effective to achieve the right level of attraction and retention at the best value.
The Company is always mindful of the need for good corporate governance in respect of pay and benets for all its employees including Directors.
Aggreko plc Annual Repor Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 t and Accounts 2006 57 57 Remuneration Report continued Performance related elements of Remuneration A significant proportion of Executive Directors remuneration is performance related through an annual bonus plan as further explained below.
Annual Cash Bonuses The Company pays competitive bonuses that are intended to place the total cash earnings of executives at around the upper quartile for the market place in high performance years.
The factors to be measured for bonus purposes and the corresponding levels of bonus are pre-determined at the start of the year.
Bonuses are paid as close to the end of the performance period as practicable so that they reect current performance.
All Executive Directors participate in a scheme which allows them to earn bonuses on a graduated scale if a targeted level of earnings per share is exceeded.
The performance criteria are designed to enhance shareholder value and the Committee approves all financial targets and personal goals: no bonus will be paid if targets and goals are not achieved.
For the Group Chief Executive and the Finance Director, all of their bonus is based upon earnings per share.
50% of the bonus of Regional Directors is based upon the same measure with 50% based upon profit achieved in their own region.
The Group Chief Executive and the Director responsible for North America have a maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of basic salary and the maximum for other Executive Directors is 75%.
The Committee does, however, also have discretion to reward outstanding individual achievement.
Long-Term Incentive Arrangements Long-Term Incentive Arrangements were introduced in 2004 consisting of a performance share plan and a co-investment plan which cover about 120 executives in the business worldwide and operate as follows: Performance Share Plan Under this plan, executives are granted a conditional award of shares, some, all or none of which will vest three years later, depending upon the Companys performance over the deferral period.
The measurement of performance commences in the year in which the award is made and awards are subject to the executive remaining in service at the end of the period.
Two performance measures are utilised: 75% of plan awards is measured against earnings per share EPS and 25% against Return on Average Capital Employed ROCE.
The first performance measure is real i. e. excluding ination compound growth in aggregate EPS over a three-year period.
The denition of EPS is the fully diluted EPS published in the Annual Report, although the Committee has the discretion to make adjustments to ensure the measure is consistent from year to year and represents a fair measure.
The Committee selected this measure because it believes that it is well aligned with shareholder interests as well as being readily understood by executives.
The Consumer Price Index has been selected by the Committee as the most appropriate measure of ination.
Having considered the businesss future plans and prospects, the Committee decided that an appropriate range for real compound annual growth in EPS over the next few years is 3% 8%, if ination averages 2% per year, this would be 5% 10% growth in nominal terms.
There is no award for aggregate real compound EPS growth of 3% per annum or less.
The maximum award is made if aggregate EPS is equivalent to real compound annual growth of 8% or more.
For performance between these levels, awards would be made on a straight line, pro-rata, basis between zero and the maximum level.
The second performance measure is average ROCE over a three-year period.
The Committee selected this measure because it believes that an adequate level of ROCE is essential for the maintenance of shareholder value and this measure is already in use throughout the business.
The Committee will review the appropriate ROCE performance range for each annual grant of awards to be made under the plan, taking account of the businesss future plans and prospects.
Having considered these factors in respect of awards made in 2006, the Committee decided that an appropriate range for the three-year performance period 2006 2008 is ROCE of between 18.5% and 20.5% per annum.
There would be no award for average ROCE of 18.5% or less.
The maximum award would be made if average ROCE is 20.5% or more.
For performance between these levels, awards would be made on a straight line, pro-rata, basis between zero and the maximum award.
The Committee has increased this range for awards to be made in 2007 and the range for the three-year performance period 2007 2009 will be ROCE of between 20% and 23% per annum.
The Committees intention is that the maximum award would be for shares with a value equal to one years salary at date of grant and that, in practice, only Executive Directors would receive awards at this level.
Whilst the rules of the plan permit a maximum award of shares up to a value equal to two years salary, the Committees intention is that in most circumstances the maximum award would be a value equal to one years salary, and that, in practice, the number of people receiving awards at this level would be very restricted.
During 2006 Executive Directors were granted awards equivalent to between 70% and 100% of their basic salary.
58 58 Aggreko plc Annual Repor Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 t and Accounts 2006 Co-investment Plan Under this plan executives are allowed to invest up to a maximum of 20% of their base salary in Aggreko shares.
The offer will be made to them each year shortly after bonuses are declared.
This means that executives can use their net bonus to acquire shares at market price but there is no direct link to the bonus paid.
Provided that the executive continues to hold these shares for three years the Company will make a matching award.
There will be an automatic match of three shares for every four the executive holds i. e. a 75% match.
Higher levels of matching award will be dependent upon performance up to a maximum total matching award of six shares for every four the executive holds, i. e. a 150% match, if the maximum level of performance is achieved.
The performance measures and performance targets under this Co-investment Plan are exactly the same measures as those which will apply under the Performance Share Plan, i. e. real compound growth in aggregate EPS in a range from 3% to 8% per annum on a straight line, pro-rata, basis and average ROCE of between 18.5% and 20.5% per annum.
20% and 23% per annum for awards made in 2007.
Sharesave Plans The Company believes that savings-related share schemes generally encourage the matching of interests between employees and shareholders.
The Aggreko Sharesave Plans are normally offered annually to all employees and Executive Directors who have at least six months service.
Executive Share Option Schemes Prior to 2004 senior executives were invited to participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme at the discretion of the Committee.
Following the implementation of the Performance Share and the Co-investment Plans, it is anticipated that further grants under the existing Executive Share Option Schemes will only be made in exceptional circumstances where the new plans are not appropriate.
The allocation of Executive Share Options was based on multiples of remuneration dependent upon the 1 seniority and job size of the individuals appointment, with the maximum multiple of 1 3 times remuneration in any one year being available to Executive Directors.
All executive options that have been granted are subject to performance conditions based on both total shareholder return TSR and growth in Earnings Per Share EPS.
TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the Companys share price plus dividends paid.
EPS is Basic Earnings Per Share as disclosed in the Group Income Statement.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option which can only normally occur after three years have elapsed since grant, the growth in the Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a specified period.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.
Retesting of performance conditions is limited to six monthly intervals between 3 and 5 years after the date of grant.
If further grants are made under the existing schemes it is the Committees intention that performance testing will only occur once, immediately after the three-year period following the date of grant.
Mr F A B Shepherd was eligible for an award under the Phantom Option Scheme on 25 September 2002.
This award was approved by the Committee in order to continue to incentivise Mr Shepherd at a time when he was no longer eligible to participate in Aggrekos Approved and Non-approved Executive Share Option Schemes.
The intention was that, where possible, the terms and conditions described under Executive Share Option Schemes should also apply to Mr Shepherds award under the Phantom Option Scheme.
Aggreko plc Annual Repor Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 t and Accounts 2006 59 59 Remuneration Report continued Retention of Shares by Executive Directors The Committee has adopted a policy that encourages Executive Directors to use the Long Term Incentive Plans and Executive Share Option Schemes to acquire and retain a material number of shares in the Company with the objective of further aligning their long-term interests with those of other shareholders.
Under this policy, on vesting of share grants, Executive Directors, who are not within five years of their normal retirement age, should hold at least 50% of the net proceeds in shares until their aggregate holding is equivalent to at least 100% of their salary.
Other Benets Other benets, including pensions, are based on current market practice and take into account long-term trends in provision.
Further details on pension provision are set out on pages 63 and 64.
Service Contracts and Notice Periods All of the Executive Directors have service agreements that require one years notice from the individual and one years notice from the Company.
Mr F A B Shepherd has a service contract that expires on 1 May 2009 while other Directors have a normal retirement age of 60.
On early termination, Executive Directors are entitled to basic salary and benets for the notice period at the rate current at the date of termination.
External Appointments Mr R C Soames served as a Non-executive Director of Baggeridge Brick PLC until February 2006.
He was also permitted to retain his earnings from that position and these earnings amounted to 3,045 for the year ended 31 December 2006 2005 25,000.
The Company has allowed Mr A G Cockburn to serve as a Non-executive Director of Galiform Plc with effect from October 2006.
He is also permitted to retain his earnings from that position and these earnings amounted to 8,484 for the year ended 31 December 2006.
Remuneration of Chairman and Non-executive Directors The Board, within the limits set out in the Articles of Association, determines the remuneration policy and level of fees for the Non-executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee recommends remuneration policy and level of fees for the Chairman to the Board.
Remuneration comprises an annual fee for acting as a Chairman or Non-executive Director of the Company.
Additional fees are paid to Non-executive Directors in respect of service as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and as Senior Independent Director.
When setting these fees, reference is made to information provided by a number of remuneration surveys, the extent of the duties performed and the size of the Company.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, retirement benets or to participate in any share scheme operated by the Company.

The other points plotted are the values at the intervening financial year-ends.
The FTSE Mid 250 was selected as a comparator as this index is used as one of the performance measures for the Executive Share Option Schemes.
A general index is considered more appropriate than sector and peer group comparators given the unique nature of the Companys business.

62 62 Aggreko plc Annual Repor Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 t and Accounts 2006 With respect to 2006, performance targets were set for the bonus scheme at the start of the year and at that time the Company described 2006 to investors as a year in which progress was expected to be made against 2005.
In the event, strong trading results, particularly in North America and International, led to better than expected results.
Aggrekos diluted Earnings per Share pre Exceptional items rose by 44.8% from 13.72 pence to 19.87 pence, exceeding market expectations and the stretch performance targets set at the start of the year for the bonus plan.
This has resulted in both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director earning maximum bonus levels of 100% and 75% of salary respectively.
For the regional Executive Directors, 50% of their bonus was linked to profits generated by their region.
All three of the regions exceeded their profit targets by margins ranging from 20% to 44% and as a result the three Regional Executive Directors earned the maximum bonus for 2006.
