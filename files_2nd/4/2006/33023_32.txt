TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN GRAPHS The UK Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the inclusion in the Directors Remuneration Report of a graph showing total shareholder return TSR over a five year period in respect of a holding of the Companys shares, plotted against TSR in respect of a hypothetical holding of shares of a similar kind and number by reference to which a broad equity market index is calculated.
The Company is a member of the FTSE 100 Index and consequently, for the purposes of this graph which is set out below, we have selected the FTSE 100 Index as the appropriate index.
This graph is re-based to 100 at the start of the rolling five-year period.
We have also included a Pharma Peers Average, which reflects the TSR of the same comparator group used for the Performance Share Plan graphs below.

The first graph below shows how the Companys TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the companies in the comparator group from 1 January 2005 the first day of the current three-year performance period for the 2005 Award to 31 December 2006 and how the Company ranks against those other companies on this basis.
The second graph below shows how the Companys TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the companies in the comparator group from 1 January 2006 the first day of the current three-year performance period for the 2006 Award to 31 December 2006 and how the Company ranks against those other companies on this basis.

Unitised stock plans David Brennan, in common with other participating executives in the US, has interests in the following: the AstraZeneca Executive Deferral Plan, the AstraZeneca Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the AstraZeneca Savings and Security Plan.
These are unitised stock plans and participants hold units in each plan.
A unit comprises part cash and part ADSs.
The overall unit price is determined daily by taking the market value of the underlying ADSs and adding the cash position.
The ADSs held within these units carry both voting and dividend rights.
Mr Brennan is deemed to have a notional interest in these ADSs, calculated by reference to the fund value and the closing price of ADSs.
As the value of the unit varies, the number of ADSs attached to each unit varies.
Therefore, the number of ADSs held within each unit varies daily.
