All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC limits.
Where these limits would restrict the pension promise due the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme CUPS provides benefits on the salary in excess of the Scheme earnings cap to the level that would otherwise have been paid by the registered scheme.
The benefits that arise under this are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect of the registered portion of members benefits.
No individual will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained benefits elsewhere, exceed two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings.
CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over certain Centrica assets.
An appropriate provision in respect of their accrued value has been made in the Companys balance sheet.
Finance Act 2004 As a result of the changes brought about by the Finance Act 2004, Centrica transferred a portion of the unregistered element of Executive Directors pension benefits in CUPS to the registered Centrica Management Pension Scheme, thereby delivering some of the benefits previously provided via CUPS through the registered arrangement, up to the new Lifetime Allowance LTA.
Centrica did not however transfer any CUPS liabilities in excess of the LTA, which would have resulted in a higher tax rate being paid on the value of the benefits at 5 April 2006.
With effect from 6 April 2006, the contributions made by the Executive Directors are not restricted to the rate of 15% of the earnings cap and are based on the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings.

ii The increase in accrued pension has been adjusted to exclude inflation by revaluing the accrued pension as at 31 December 2005 by the rate of inflation 3.6% and deducting this from the accrued pension as at 31 December 2006.
The rate of inflation used was 3.6%, the annual rate to 30 September 2006, the date used for pension increases under the scheme.
iii Sir Roy Gardner retired on 30 June 2006.
The transfer value as at 31 December 2006 includes an uplift of 1,062,100 as a result of a change in the method of calculation of the transfer value for pensioners which did not apply at 31 December 2005 when he was still in service.
iv Member contributions paid in the year were restricted to the maximum rate of 15% of the earnings cap up to 5 April 2006.
This restriction was removed from 6 April 2006 so that contributions were deducted against total uncapped pensionable salary.
