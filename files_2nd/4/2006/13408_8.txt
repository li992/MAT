The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the following restatements have been made to the comparative amounts: i The consolidated income statement presentation and exceptional items have been restated to comply with the revised accounting policy on exceptional items set out below.
ii The consolidated balance sheet has been restated for the final fair value adjustments applied to the Precise Technology acquisition.
iii The segment analysis has been restated for the disposal of the non barrier thin wall plastic packaging business and the proposed disposal of the Petainer refillable bottle business which have been moved from Plastic Packaging to Disposals and businesses for sale.
iv Auditors remuneration has been restated to comply with Statutory Instrument 2005 2417 which became effective in 2006.
"New accounting standards and amendments to existing standards that have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted, are as follows: i IFRS7 ""Financial Instruments: Disclosures"", and amendment to IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements ""Capital Disclosures""."
IFRS7 introduces new disclosures about financial instruments.
It requires the disclosure of information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including specified minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including sensitivity analysis to market risk.
It replaces the disclosure requirements in IAS32.
The amendment to IAS1 introduces disclosures about the level of an entitys capital and how it manages capital.
The Group has assessed the impact of IFRS7 and the amendment to IAS1 and concluded that the main additional disclosures will be the sensitivity analysis and the capital disclosures.
"Due to the onerous nature of these disclosures the Group has chosen not to adopt IFRS7 and the amendment to IAS1 until annual periods beginning on 1 January 2007. ii IFRS8 ""Operating Segments"" requires identification and reporting of operating segments on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the Board in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance."
The Group assessed the impact of IFRS8 and concluded that it will not be material.
The Group intends to adopt IFRS8 not later than accounting periods beginning on 1 January 2009.
"The following mandatory amendments to published accounting standards had no impact on the consolidated financial statements in 2006. i IAS39 Amendment, ""Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Forecast Intragroup Transactions""."
"ii IAS39 Amendment, ""The Fair Value Option""."
"iii IAS39 and IFRS4 Amendments, ""Financial Guarantee Contracts""."
Key estimates and assumptions The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, ultimately actual results may differ from those estimates.
The key estimates and assumptions used in these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the accounting policy for goodwill set out below and in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
The recoverable amounts of cash generating units are determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates which include cash flow projections for each cash generating unit and discount rates based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with particular cash generating units.
Retirement benefit obligations The consolidated financial statements include costs in relation to, and provision for, retirement benefit obligations.
There are two principal funded defined benefit pension plans in the UK and US and an unfunded retiree medical plan in the US.
The costs and the present value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on such factors as life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of current employees, the returns that plan assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liabilities.
The Group uses estimates based on previous experience and third party actuarial advice in determining these future cash flows and in determining the discount rate.
If the discount rate was to fall by 0.5%, the net liabilities of the plans at 31 December 2006 would rise by approximately 160m.
If equity returns were to fall by 10% then the plan assets at 31 December 2006 would fall by approximately 110m.
The accounting policy for retirement benefit obligations is set out below and details of the assumptions used for the two principal pension plans and the retiree medical plan are set out in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
76 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued Income taxes Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations whose ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes are likely to be due.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on estimates of future taxable income and recoverability.
Where a change in circumstance occurs, or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax balances in the year in which that change or outcome is known.
The accounting policy for income taxes is set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise Rexam PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the results of its associates and joint ventures.
The financial statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are prepared as of the same reporting date using consistent accounting policies.
Intercompany balances and transactions, including any unrealised profits arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are entities where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanied by a share of more than 50% of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
Associates and joint ventures are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanied by a share of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
If the Groups share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
All acquisitions are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group, together with any costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Foreign currencies The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
The presentation currency of the Group is sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
Exceptions to this are where the monetary items form part of the net investment in a foreign operation or are designated as hedges of a net investment, or designated as cash flow hedges.
Such exchange differences are initially recognised in equity.
The balance sheets of foreign operations are translated into sterling using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statements are translated into sterling using the average exchange rate for the period.
Where this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, the exchange rate on the transaction date is used.
Exchange differences on translation into sterling arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement.
The principal exchange rates against sterling used in these consolidated financial statements are as follows: Average Average Closing Closing 2006 2005 2006 2005 US dollar 1.84 1.82 1.96 1.74 Euro 1.47 1.46 1.49 1.46 Revenue recognition Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration, net of rebates and trade discounts.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods to the buyer, when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
77 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued Exceptional items Items which are exceptional, being material in terms of size and or nature are presented separately from underlying business performance in the consolidated income statement.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide an indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
The principal events which may give rise to exceptional items include significant changes to retirement benefit obligations, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, the restructuring and integration of businesses, major asset impairments, the subsequent recognition of acquired deferred tax assets, significant litigation claims, the amortisation of certain acquired intangible assets and non hedge accounted fair value movements and hedge ineffectiveness on financing derivative financial instruments.
The above accounting policy on exceptional items is a change in accounting policy from that used in 2005.
The change resulted from a reassessment of which transactions comprise exceptional items and from a change to the presentation of the consolidated income statement, from a columnar format to a single column format using boxes.
The directors consider the change in accounting policy provides relevant information by more closely reflecting current accounting practice.
The change had no impact on profit for the 2005 financial year or on net assets at 31 December 2005.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution pension plans.
A defined benefit pension plan is one that specifies the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement.
The Group operates both funded defined benefit pension plans, where actuarially determined payments are made to trustee administered funds, and unfunded defined benefit pension plans, where no such payments are made.
The liability recognised in the consolidated balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the balance sheet date.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated, at least triennially, by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included in operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Past service costs are similarly included where the benefits have vested, otherwise they are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The expected return on assets of funded defined benefits pension plans, less administration expenses of pension plans, and the interest on pension plan liabilities comprise the pension element of the net finance cost in the consolidated income statement.
Differences between the actual and expected return on assets, experience gains and losses and changes in actuarial assumptions are included in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
A defined contribution plan is one under which fixed contributions are paid to a third party.
The Group has no further payment obligations once these contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised in the consolidated income statement when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is likely.
The Group also provides post retirement healthcare benefits retiree medical to certain of its current and former employees.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on an employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period.
The consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet treatment with respect to retiree medical is similar to that for defined benefit pension plans.
These obligations are valued by independent actuaries, usually on an annual basis.
Share based payment The Group operates various equity settled and cash settled share option schemes.
For equity settled share options, the services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options.
The fair value is calculated at grant date and recognised in the consolidated income statement, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest.
Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
For cash settled share options, the services received from employees are measured at the fair value of the liability and recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The fair value of the liability is measured at each balance sheet date and at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement.
IFRS2 Share-based Payment has been applied to equity settled share options granted after 7 November 2002 and to all cash settled share options.
The Rexam Employee Share Trust holds ordinary shares in Rexam PLC which are presented in the consolidated financial statements as a deduction from equity.
Interest Interest on cash and cash equivalents and borrowings held at amortised cost is recognised in the consolidated income statement using the effective interest method.
Interest includes exchange differences arising on cash and cash equivalents and borrowings, where such exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Interest includes all fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, and corresponding adjustments to hedged items under designated fair value hedging relationships, where they relate to financing activities and are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Prior to their redemption, interest included dividends paid on convertible preference shares.
78 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued Segment reporting The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographic segments.
A business segment is a component of the Group that is engaged in providing a group of related products and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographic segment is a component of the Group that operates within a particular economic environment and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments.
Non specific central costs are allocated on the basis of net assets excluding investments in associates and joint ventures, net borrowings, deferred tax, current tax and non current tax.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
At the date of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions on or before 31 December 1997 has been deducted from equity.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business sold except for any goodwill deducted from equity.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented in goodwill and goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and joint ventures is presented in investments in associates and joint ventures.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation begins when an asset is available for use and is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Acquired computer software 2 to 3 years Computer software development Up to 7 years Acquired patents, licences and customer contracts Up to 20 years Development projects Up to 5 years The cost of intangible assets acquired in an acquisition is the fair value at acquisition date.
The cost of separately acquired intangible assets, including computer software, comprises the purchase price and any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for use.
Computer software development costs that are directly associated with the implementation of major business systems are capitalised as intangible assets.
Expenditure on research is recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement as incurred.
Expenditure incurred on development projects is capitalised as an intangible asset if it is probable that the expenditure will generate future economic benefits and can be measured reliably.
The accounting policy for emission rights is set out below.
Emission rights Emission rights are initially recognised as intangible assets at fair value.
Where they are acquired at less than fair value the difference between the amount paid and fair value is recognised as a government grant.
Emission rights are not revalued or amortised but are tested for impairment at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment.
Any government grant element is amortised in the consolidated income statement over the period to which the corresponding emission rights relate.
A provision is made for the liability to deliver emission allowances equal to the emissions that have been made.
Emission rights and associated provisions are derecognised when these rights are delivered, sold or lapsed.
Any profit or loss on disposal is taken to the consolidated income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
For all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost less residual value of the assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings Up to 50 years Leasehold buildings Shorter of 50 years or lease term Manufacturing machinery 7 to 17 years Glass furnaces Up to 12 years Computer hardware Up to 8 years Fixtures, fittings and vehicles 4 to 10 years Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
79 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued Impairment of assets At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is written down to its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use and is determined for an individual asset.
If the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined.
Discount rates reflecting the asset specific risks and the time value of money are used for the value in use calculation.
Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first in first out or a weighted average cost basis.
Cost comprises directly attributable purchase and conversion costs and an allocation of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and selling costs.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement comprise cash at bank and in hand, money market deposits and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are presented in borrowings within current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
Assets and liabilities classied as held for sale The assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are available for immediate sale in their present condition and a sale is highly probably within one year.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Non current assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortised and any future write down to fair value less costs to sell will be recognised as an impairment loss.
Grants Grants received in respect of property, plant and equipment are capitalised and released to the consolidated income statement in equal instalments over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the liability and finance charge to produce a constant rate of interest on the finance lease balance outstanding.
Assets capitalised under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases other than finance leases are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Any incentives to enter into operating leases are recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight line basis.
Income taxes The tax expense represents the sum of current tax, non current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax and non current tax are based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax arising from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than an acquisition, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, unless the tax relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the tax is recognised directly in equity through the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
80 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when a present obligation exists in respect of a past event and where the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised for direct expenditure on business reorganisations where plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced, and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken on or before the balance sheet date.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is considered material.
Dividends Final equity dividends to the shareholders of Rexam PLC are recognised in the period that they are approved by the shareholders.
Interim equity dividends are recognised in the period that they are paid.
Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments utilised by the Group include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and forward aluminium and energy commodity contracts.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Hedges are classified as follows: a Fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
b Cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
c Net investment hedges where they hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and similarly recognised in the consolidated income statement.
For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement.
When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a non financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the consolidated income statement.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments related to operating activities are included in operating profit when recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments related to financing activities are included in interest when recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Borrowings are measured at amortised cost except where they are hedged by an effective fair value hedge, in which case the carrying value is adjusted to reflect the fair value movements associated with the hedged risk.
Where borrowings are used to hedge the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations, the portion of the exchange gain or loss on the borrowings that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity.
On 16 October 2006 the convertible preference shares were redeemed as described in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
Prior to redemption, they were split into a liability component and an equity component.
On issue, the fair value of the liability component was determined using a market rate for an equivalent non convertible bond and recognised in borrowings on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or redemption.
The remainder of the proceeds of the issue was allocated to the conversion option that was recognised in equity.
The change in value of the conversion option, other than on conversion or redemption, in subsequent accounting periods was not recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
Dividends on convertible preference shares were charged as interest in the consolidated income statement.
Available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value.
Unrealised gains and losses are recognised in equity except for impairment losses, interest and dividends arising from these assets which are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Trade and other payables are measured at cost.

This change resulted in a gain of 38m, net of associated legal fees of 1m.
In December 2006, certain changes were implemented to the US defined benefit pension plans giving rise to a gain of 15m.
The gain of 45m net of associated legal costs of 1m in 2005 related to changes implemented to the Groups obligations in respect of US retiree medical benefits.
A cost of 21m arises from the restructuring of existing businesses, principally in the Plastic Packaging sector.
The decision to exit from the non barrier thin wall plastic packaging business resulted in the rationalisation of a plant.
In response to slower demand within part of the Make Up division, action was taken to reduce the cost base in France and Asia.
In addition, a major restructuring of the administration support function within the European beverage can operation has been completed.
A cost of 8m arises from the integration of new businesses initiated following the Plastic Packaging acquisitions of Precise Technology that resulted in the closure of four facilities in the US and of FangXin.
The restructuring in 2005 arose in the European Beverage Can operation following conversion of two of its plants from steel to aluminium can production.
Intangible assets, such as technology, patents and customer contracts, are required to be recognised on the acquisition of businesses and amortised over their useful life.
The directors consider that separate disclosure of the amortisation of such acquired intangibles aids comparison of organic growth in underlying profit and therefore this cost of 11m 2005: nil is separately disclosed within exceptional items.
Following a recent appeal ruling, a provision of 8m has been made in respect of a legacy litigation claim relating to an acquired business.
The claim had been initiated before Rexam assumed control of that business.
Losses on the disposal of businesses amounted to 3m.
In keeping with the strategy to concentrate the food plastics operations on high margin and faster growing markets, three non barrier thin wall plastic packaging businesses were sold and the Petainer refillable bottle business was made available for sale.
The loss on disposal in 2005 of 25m related to the sale of the UK Glass business.
A charge of 3m 2005: 7m arises from the recognition of deferred tax assets on prior year acquisitions relating to the utilisation of tax losses not recorded at the date of acquisition.
This charge is treated as exceptional due to size and because it arises out of the transition to IFRS.
A gain on the sale of land and property of 8m, following the relocation of a manufacturing facility, by the associate in Korea has been included in exceptional items in view of its size and one off nature.
The gain on disposal of an associate of 4m in 2005 related to the sale of Rexams interest in a non core printing business.
In October 2006, Rexam shareholders approved the early redemption into ordinary shares of the convertible preference shares.
Following the adoption of IFRS, the convertible preference shares had become financially inefficient: the debt element was reclassified from equity to borrowings, the dividend thereon included within interest and no tax deduction was available on that dividend.
The enhanced conversion premium of 10m, including associated costs, has been included in exceptional items due to its size and one off nature.
The fair value of the derivatives arising on financing activities directly relates to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The fair value will change as the transactions to which they relate mature, as new derivatives are transacted and due to the passage of time.
The fair value change on financing derivatives for the year gave rise to a net gain of 7m 2005: 9m.

Net foreign exchange losses in 2006 comprise losses of 39m 2005: gains 33m on borrowings and cash and cash equivalents, gains of 23m 2005: losses 20m on derivatives designated as hedging instruments and gains of 15m 2005: losses 17m on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments.
Derivative foreign exchange losses arise on translation of cross currency swap principal amounts and on the settlement of forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge net borrowings.
Derivative financial instrument value changes in 2006 comprise a loss of 12m 2005: gain 2m on hedging instruments and a corresponding gain of 12m 2005: loss 2m to the value of medium term notes under a designated fair value hedging relationship, losses of nil 2005: 2m on other derivatives designated as hedging instruments and gains of 7m 2005: 11m on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments.

Of the total deferred tax assets, 36m 2005: 64m are recoverable within one year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balance net.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised where it is probable that they will be recovered.
In recognising deferred tax assets, the Group has considered if it is more likely than not that sufficient future profits will be available to absorb tax losses and other timing differences.
Deferred tax assets of 30m 2005: 37m have not been recognised in respect of losses, tax credits on dividends and other timing differences due to the uncertainty of the availability of suitable profits in the foreseeable future.
The principal items on which no deferred tax assets have been recognised are tax losses of 30m 2005: 30m and UK tax credits on foreign dividends of 18m 2005: 15m.
There is no expiry date on either of these items.
No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates.
If the earnings were remitted in full, tax of 175m 2005: 165m would be payable.

Cash ows beyond the three year period have been extrapolated using a zero real growth rate.
Key assumptions used in the recoverable amount calculation include: i Sales and margins.
Forecasts are based on sector level analyses of sales, markets, costs and competitors for the budget period.
Consideration was given to past experience, knowledge of future contracts and the expected improvements following capital expenditure projects.
ii Raw materials and energy price ination.
Forecasts for aluminium are based on forward prices at the time the budget period projections were prepared and take into account pass through of costs and hedging.
Forecasts for other raw materials and energy are based on ination forecasts and supply and demand factors.
The forecast is based on analysis by management of factors likely to affect exchange rates during the budget period including interest rates and economic growth rates.
The pre tax discount rates used for the cash generating units for which the carrying amount of goodwill is significant in comparison with the total Group were as set out below.

95 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 24 Financial instruments i Financial risk management Rexam bases its financial risk management on sound economic objectives and good corporate practice.
Group treasury operations are carried out under strict policies and parameters defined by the Rexam Board of Directors and supervised by its Finance Committee.
Rexam treasury is not run as a profit centre nor does it enter into any transactions for speculative purposes.
All derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The Groups major operational hedges comply with IAS39 and hedge accounting treatment is applied.
Some smaller trading exposures are hedged on an economic basis and hedge accounting treatment is not applied where the compliance burden is deemed to be unduly onerous and the income statement volatility arising is not expected to be significant.
In addition, some interest rate swaps used to manage Rexams fixed floating debt mix, while economically effective, are ineligible for hedge accounting treatment.
Fair value gains and losses on these hedges are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
In 2006, there was a net gain of 7m 2005: 9m on financing derivatives on which hedge accounting was not applied, recorded within exceptional interest in the consolidated income statement.
Interest rate risk The objective of Rexams interest rate risk management is to reduce the Groups exposure to the impact of changes in interest rates in the currencies in which debt is borrowed.
The detailed interest rate risk profile is shown in section iv below.
Interest rate risk is managed through the issue of long term fixed rate bonds in both euros and sterling under Rexams medium term note programme and through the use of interest rate derivatives that are used to manage the overall fixed floating mix of bank and bond debt.
Refinancing risk Rexam treasury mitigates refinancing risk by raising its debt requirements from a range of different sources and with a range of maturity dates.
As at 31 December 2006, debt maturities ranged from less than one year 19% of drawn debt to 2013 33% of drawn debt.
No more than 33% of drawn debt at 31 December 2006 expires in any one financial year.
Foreign exchange translation risk The Group seeks to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange movements between overseas currencies and sterling arising on the translation of the value of non UK operations into sterling for reporting purposes.
This is achieved by borrowing a proportion of debt, either directly or through the use of cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, in currencies which match or are closely linked to the currencies of the overseas businesses.
This approach also provides some protection against the foreign exchange translation of overseas earnings as it matches the currency of earnings to the currency of the interest expense.
These amounts are included in the consolidated financial statements by translation into sterling at the balance sheet date and, where hedge accounted, offset in equity against the translation movement in net assets.
Foreign exchange transaction risk The Group looks to mitigate currency risk arising on cross border trading transactions using a range of derivative instruments.
Generally, the Group will hedge a higher proportion of shorter term, contractually committed transactions, but does also hedge some longer term contracts into the medium term.
None of the foreign exchange derivative instruments at 31 December 2006 related to derivative trading activity, although some fair value gains and losses were taken to the consolidated income statement because IFRS hedge accounting treatment was not applied.
Foreign exchange derivative instruments are used for hedging general business exposures in foreign currencies such as the purchase and sale of goods, capital expenditure and dividend flows.
Where IFRS hedge accounting treatment is obtained, gains or losses on the derivative hedges are held in equity and recognised in the consolidated income statement when the losses or gains on the hedged transactions are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Commodity risk The objective of commodity risk management is to identify those businesses that have exposures to commodities traded on commodity markets and to then determine which, if any, commodity market instruments are appropriate for hedging those exposures.
To manage such exposures, the Group uses mainly over the counter instruments transacted with banks, which are themselves priced through a recognised commodity exchange, such as the London Metal Exchange.
In addition, the Group makes use of physical supply contracts which effectively pass commodity risks through to customers.
Rexam manages the purchase of certain raw materials, including aluminium and energy costs through physical supply contracts which, in the main, relate directly to commodity price indices.
The supply contracts may be hedged with appropriate derivative contracts to fix and manage costs.
The derivative hedge contracts may extend over several years.
Usually a higher proportion of short term exposures are hedged than those further forward.
The extent of the forward cover taken is judged according to market conditions and prices of futures prevailing at the time.
None of the commodity derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2006 related to derivative trading activity, although some fair value gains and losses were taken to the consolidated income statement because IFRS hedge accounting was not applied.
The commodity hedges relate to contracted and expected future purchases of aluminium and energy.
Embedded derivatives Certain supply contracts entered into by Group companies include embedded derivatives, normally used as part of the pricing mechanisms agreed with customers or suppliers.
Under IFRS these embedded derivatives cannot be reported as being part of a hedging relationship, so fair value gains and losses are taken to the consolidated income statement.
The effect of fair valuing these embedded derivatives is generally to recognise at the reporting date the impact, at prevailing market prices, of the pricing mechanisms embedded derivative on the expected future supplies to be made under the contracts, even where a contract is in profit or would not otherwise require its future financial effects to be recognised.

The fair value of the medium term notes has been determined by reference to their quoted market prices at the close of business on 31 December.
The fair value of the liability component of the convertible preference shares was determined using a market rate for an equivalent non convertible bond.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, xed rate loans and finance leases have been determined by discounting their cash ows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts has been determined by marking those contracts to market against prevailing forward foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of forward aluminium commodity contracts has been determined by marking those contracts to market at prevailing forward aluminium prices.
The fair value of embedded derivatives has been calculated using valuation models incorporating market commodity prices and foreign exchange rates.

These swaps hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of medium term notes which mature in 2009 and 2013.
The cross currency swap element of swaps referred to above hedge changes in the fair value of US dollar intercompany loans which mature in 2009.
Cash ow hedges The Group has designated forward foreign exchange, aluminium commodity and energy contracts as cash ow hedges.
The aluminium commodity and energy contracts hedge anticipated future purchases of aluminium and energy respectively and mature between 2007 and 2008.
Forward foreign exchange contracts hedge foreign currency transaction risk and mature between 2007 and 2009.
The associated fair value gains and losses on cash ow hedges are transferred to inventory in the period in which the underlying hedged transactions occur.
Net investment hedges The Group has designated foreign currency borrowings as hedges of net investments in its subsidiaries in the Eurozone and the USA.

Other oating rate financial instruments are at the appropriate LIBOR interest rates as adjusted by variable margins.
Interest on oating rate financial instruments is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on xed rate financial instruments is xed until maturity of the instrument.
The effect of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, including principal amounts only, is to modify the amounts and interest rates of medium term notes as set out below.

The resulting rates for equities, bonds and cash are then reduced to allow for administration expenses.
The mortality assumptions used in valuing the liabilities of the UK pension plan in 2006 and 2005 are based on the standard tables PA92 as published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
These tables are adjusted to reect the circumstances of the plan membership.
The life expectancy assumed for male pensioners aged 65 is 19.6 years 2005: 19.6 years and for female pensioners aged 65 is 22.4 years 2005: 22.4 years.
The mortality assumptions used in valuing the liabilities of the US pension plans are based on the RP2000 combined active and retiree mortality table projected to 2006 weighted 70% blue collar and 30% white collar 2005: UP1994 mortality table.

The holders of convertible preference shares had a right to convert their holdings on 28 February in any year until 2015 into fully paid ordinary shares on the basis of 0.3508 new ordinary shares for each convertible preference share.
Following a proposal from the Board, shareholders approved the compulsory conversion of all of the issued convertible preference shares into new ordinary shares at an enhanced conversion rate of 0.3742 new ordinary shares for each convertible preference share held on the record date of 13 October 2006.
On 16 October 2006, the 69,331,279 issued convertible preference shares were converted into 25,943,764 new ordinary shares.
As part of the conversion process the difference in value between the aggregate nominal value of the convertible preference shares prior to conversion and the aggregate nominal value of the new ordinary shares was redesignated into 72,462,081,857,143 deferred shares of 0.0001 pence each.
The deferred shares were redeemed for 1p per holding on 31 December 2006 and their authorised share capital was redesignated as unclassified share capital.
28 Share based payment Rexams equity settled share based payment schemes comprise the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE.
Rexams cash settled share based payment scheme is the Phantom Stock Plan Phantoms.
LTIS Annual grants of options over ordinary shares are made to executive directors and certain senior executives.
The Total Shareholder Return TSR of Rexam is measured and compared to a comparator group of listed companies.
The percentage of share options that actually vest is dependent upon Rexams comparative TSR over a three year measurement period, commencing on 1 January of the year in which the option is granted.
If performance targets are met, share options vest on 1 January, three years after the start of the measurement period and can be exercised at a nominal cost to the employee.
The expiry date is six years and eleven months after the grant date.
ESOS Annual grants of options over ordinary shares are made to certain executives.
All shares will vest if the performance target annual growth rate of pre determined economic profit is met over the three year measurement period.
Share options are exercisable three years after grant date and expire ten years after grant date.
The exercise price is set at market value using the average of the mid market price of a Rexam ordinary share over a three day period preceding the grant date.
SAYE All employee SAYE schemes are open to eligible employees resident in the UK and Ireland.
Annual grants of options over ordinary shares are currently made at an exercise price of 80% of the market value of Rexam shares at grant date.
Share options vest three, five or seven years after grant date, depending on the scheme selected by the employee at grant and expire six months after vesting.
Phantoms This scheme operates in the same way as the ESOS with the same terms and conditions, but is made to certain executives located outside the UK and is settled in cash.

Historical volatilities are arrived at using a period comparable with the expected life of the option.
The correlation coefcient for the LTIS is calculated using the correlation matrix for the TSR simulation using three year daily historical stock price series for each company in the comparator group, including Rexam, from the beginning of the measurement date.
A ten year life is initially assumed to calculate the fair value of phantoms.
As the fair value is updated at each subsequent valuation the expected life is reduced for each year until exercise.
