19 directors remuneration report INTRODUCTION This report has been prepared so as to meet the requirements of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations as well as the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
It deals with the remuneration of both executive and non-executive directors.
The report has been divided into separate sections for audited and un-audited information.
A resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee operates under written terms of reference approved by the Board, meets as and when required but at least twice a year and was, throughout the period under review, comprised exclusively of Non-Executive Directors whom the Company considers are independent, being: R J Taylor committee chairman, A H Mathers and R C M Burrell.
No Committee member has any personal financial interest save in respect of interests in shares, conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships see note in Corporate Governance section on Board Balance re R C M Burrell or any day-to-day involvement in the running of the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No Director plays a part in any discussion about his remuneration.
In determining the directors remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted Mark Jackson Chief Executive about its proposals.
The Committee also took advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP who have been appointed by the Committee on the structure of the directors remuneration packages.
New Bridge Street Consultants also advise the Company in relation to the operation of the Companys share incentive schemes generally.
Remuneration Policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain the high calibre directors from what is a small pool of candidates with relevant experience at this level needed to maintain the Companys position as a leading non-fault accident service provider and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance evaluation of the Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages is undertaken by the Committee.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors except the Chairman is set by the Board.
When setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors the Committee takes account of pay practices elsewhere in the Group.
As announced last year, with effect from April 2006, the Committee has been responsible for reviewing the remuneration of the layer of management immediately below Board level.
The Committee is in the process of reviewing senior executive long-term incentive provision.
When this review process is completed, the Group will seek the necessary shareholder approvals so as to allow any new long-term incentive policy to be established.
The main elements of the Executive Directors remuneration packages for the period under review which are set out in more detail below were: 1. basic salary and benefits: 2. annual bonus payments not to exceed 95% of basic salary: and 3. pension arrangements.
The Committee currently intends that the same will be true of the 2006 7 financial year save that long-term incentive provisions if approved by shareholders may be operational, with the maximum bonus being 100% of base salary.
The Companys policy is, and therefore will continue to be, that a significant element of an Executive Directors remuneration is to be performance related.
Whilst the Committee has, as required, stated its remuneration policy for future years it is conscious that any remuneration policy needs to be flexible.
Any changes to this policy will be disclosed in subsequent reports.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company so long as the Companys permission is sought.
Any fees payable are shared with the Company.
M B Jackson holds an outside appointment: he retains 55,000 being half of the fees paid.
Basic Salary Executive Directors salaries are generally determined by the Committee prior to the start of each financial year, although they may be reviewed during the relevant financial year for example if an individual changes position or responsibility.
Before setting these basic salaries the Committee considers pay conditions in the Group as a whole, individual performance and relies on objective, independent advice and research which gives up to date information on remuneration policies adopted by like companies.
The most recent increases in the basic salary of all Executive Directors were made after considering advice from New Bridge Street Consultants with regard to the levels of salaries in comparator businesses, the Companys continued success and the Executive Directors specialist, industry knowledge.
Due to the change of financial year end the most recent salary review took place in June 2006 but as with all employees was backdated for this year only to 1 April 2006.
In future years the pay reviews will be effective from 1 July each year.
As a consequence the new salaries CEO 380,000, other Executive Directors 266,000 were applied to the last three months of the period under review.
Executive Directors contracts of service which include details of their remuneration will be available for inspection at the AGM.
In addition to their basic salary, Executive Directors receive certain benefits, comprising a car or cash allowance in lieu, fuel card, private medical, life, loss of income and permanent health insurances and pension contributions or cash in lieu of such contributions.
20 directors remuneration report continued UNAUDITED INFORMATION CONTINUED Annual Bonus Payments The four Executive Directors Michael Symons did not participate in view of his retirement are entitled to participate in the annual bonus scheme which for the period under review provided for a bonus of up to a maximum of 95% of basic salary to be paid upon achieving earnings targets which were set by the Committee.
When setting the earnings target for the year under review, the Committee took account of the fact that annual bonus opportunity was increased from 75% which had applied in the previous year, believing that any incentive payments awarded should be tied to the meeting of challenging and stretching performance targets.
Due to the Companys excellent performance during the year under review, the annual bonus targets were met in full, resulting in the payment of maximum bonuses.
The Committee has set appropriately challenging bonus targets to be applied in the forthcoming financial year, taking account of the increased annual bonus opportunity of 100% of salary that is to apply going forward.
Share-Based Incentives The Companys current share-based incentive arrangements comprise the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 2002 Scheme, the Equity Partnership Plan 2002 EPP and the SAYE Scheme.
The Committee has responsibility for supervising the 2002 Scheme and the grant of options under its terms.
The 2002 Scheme permits the annual grant to any individual of options over shares worth up to 200% of their basic salary.
However, during the year under review no options were granted under its terms due to the Company being in a close period for a substantial portion of the year.
No awards were made under the EPP in the period under review, again due to the Company being in a close period for a substantial portion of that period nor have any prior awards been made under the EPP.
During the period under review the Company made grants under its SAYE Scheme in which the Executive Directors participated and under which options were granted at a discount of 20% to the market value of the Companys shares at the time when the options were granted.
The Company does not currently operate any long-term incentive schemes other than those described above.
However, as stated above, the Committee is currently reviewing long-term incentive provision.
As part of its responsibilities in respect of the Companys share-based incentive arrangements, the Committee will assess the extent to which the relevant performance conditions that apply to awards are met, seeking advice from third parties where necessary.
Details of share options granted in the past to Executive Directors appear in the audited section of this report.
Pension Arrangements All Executive Directors save the Chief Executive and Michael Symons who were permitted to take the same contributions as salary supplements in lieu of a contribution to a pension scheme received a contribution of 20% of basic salary to be used for personal money purchase schemes.
The Committee will continue to keep the Executive Directors pension provision under review.
Directors Contracts In accordance with general practice it is the Companys policy that all Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum one year notice period.
All Executive Directors, including David Robertson who is proposed for re-election at the next AGM, have contracts which are subject to one years notice.
Details of the Executive Directors contracts are summarised below: Name Contract date Notice period M J Symons 23 January 2002 N A retired M B Jackson 28 February 1997 One Year D E Lindsay 28 February 1997 One Year D A Robertson 10 February 1998 One Year P F Holding 28 January 1998 One Year The Executive Directors contracts have no express provision for the payment of compensation in the event of early termination.
In the event of termination of an Executive Directors service contract, when determining the compensation payable to the Executive Director, it is the policy of the Committee to take account of the principles of mitigation of loss.
21 directors remuneration report continued UNAUDITED INFORMATION CONTINUED All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and are appointed for periods of three years.
Their fees are disclosed in the audited section of this report and are set by the Board as a whole after taking account of independent surveys of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of similar companies and of the time commitment of the Non-Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys incentive schemes.
Dates of the Non-Executive Directors original letters of appointment and the current unexpired period of their appointments are set out below: Name Date of letter Unexpired term R P Baker-Bates 2 December 2005 Two years subject to election at 2006 AGM R J Taylor 11 September 2002 One year A H Mathers 11 September 2002 One year R C M Burrell 11 September 2002 Two years M OLeary N A Three years subject to election at 2006 AGM Performance Graph The Regulations require this report to contain a graph showing the performance of the Company and a broad equity market index over the past five years.
As the Company was a constituent of the FTSE SmallCap Index for the substantial part of the last five years, this index is at present considered an appropriate form of broad equity market index against which the Companys performance should be compared although this approach will be kept under review.
Performance, as required by the Regulations, is measured by Total Shareholder Return share price growth plus dividends reinvested.
This graph shows the value by the end of June 2006, of 100 invested in Helphire on 1 July 2001 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE SmallCap Index.

The exercise of the options granted under the Companys previous Executive Share Option Scheme is subject to an average growth rate of 7.5% plus inflation in the Companys earnings per share in the three years prior to the date of exercise.
The exercise of the options granted under the 2002 Scheme which are exercisable between 19 July 2005 and 13 December 2012 was dependent on the achievement of a sliding scale of absolute EPS targets which were met in full.
24 directors remuneration report continued The exercise of the options granted under the 2002 Scheme which are exercisable between 8 July 2006 and 8 July 2013 is dependent on the achievement of a sliding scale of absolute EPS targets as follows: EPS for financial year ending 31 March 2006 Proportion of option exercisable Less than 6p 0 6p One third 9p Two thirds 14p All N. B.
Although there was no financial year ending on 31 March 2006, the target was set before any change in the year end was known and as EPS was measured to this date and on the most diluted calculation exceeded the highest target, the Committee has assessed these targets as having been met in full.
EPS for the last financial year of the Company ending before the third anniversary of the grant date Proportion of option exercisable Less than 15.5p 0 15.5p One third 17.0p Two thirds 18.7p All This wording, in respect of grants made in December 2004, reflects the then proposed change of financial period end date in the 2005 6 financial period.
The targets in respect of the grants made in December 2004 are not capable of re-testing so to the extent that these targets are not met the options will lapse.
The exercise price of options granted under the 2002 Scheme is equal to the market value of the Companys shares at the time when the options were granted.
All share options are in respect of ordinary shares.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 30 June 2006 was 384p and the range during the 15-month period was 195.6p to 446.25p.
There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance conditions for share options during the financial period.
Directors Pension Entitlements All Executive Directors are members of personal money purchase schemes.
Contributions paid by the Group in respect of such Directors were as follows: 2006 2005 Name of Director 000 000 D E Lindsay 60 42 D A Robertson 60 42 P F Holding 60 42 Total 180 126 Pension entitlements of Messrs Symons and Jackson are dealt with by way of salary supplement as described above.
