Bill Coley indicated that he wished to decline an invitation to participate in the Lt plan and as indicated in the Chairmans Letter to shareholders of 12 August 2005 the Committee decided to agree separate and demanding remuneration arrangements for him.
part of these arrangements is the Annual performance incentive plan disclosed above.
Chief Executives Option Grant the Committee also decided to make a grant of market priced options to Bill Coley under the British Energy group plc Executive share option plan.
share options over shares worth two times salary were granted to Bill Coley on 20 December 2005.
Details of the options granted are shown in the table on page 37. the options are subject to a performance condition based on nuclear output during the 2007 08 financial year.
75% of the options will vest if Adjusted group target output consistent with the target used in the Lt plan for 2007 08 is achieved and 100% will vest if group target output again as used in the Lt plan is achieved.
if Adjusted group target output is not met no options will vest, i. e. this is more demanding than the Lt plan for which there is a threshold target.
the precise calibration of the targets will be determined by the Committee early in the financial year 2007 08. it is intended to make further option grants to Bill Coley early in the financial year 2006 07 and in subsequent financial years while the Lt plan remains in operation.

the transfer value does not represent a sum due or paid to the individual and cannot meaningfully be added to the annual remuneration.
the accrual rate for both roy Anderson and stephen Billingham is 1 30 per annum subject to total pension from all sources not exceeding two thirds of final salary.
roy Anderson and stephen Billingham are required to make contributions of 5% of base salary.
this is achieved by sacrificing salary equivalent to the contribution.
the salaries shown in the Directors Emoluments tables on page 35 are net of the salary sacrifice on earnings above the pensions cap.
