Report 28-47 7 8 06 14:18 Page 31 Remuneration Committee report Background This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the regulations.
The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the regulations.
The report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
The Board has reviewed the Groups compliance with the Combined Code the Code on remuneration related matters.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year.
Part 2 of the regulations unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee of the Board comprises Mrs Victoria Mitchell Chairman, Mr David Howell and Mr Tony Palmer all of whom are Non-executive Directors and independent.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Remuneration Committee has formal written terms of reference with the full remit of the Committee role described.
A copy of the terms of reference can be downloaded from the Companys website.
During the year in question the Remuneration Committee formally met three times.
The Remuneration Committee was advised during the year and continues to be advised by Halliwell Consulting, an independent executive compensation and share scheme consultancy.
No other services were provided to the Company by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration for the year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with the Group Managing Director, Mr A W Pidgley and the Group Finance Director, Mr R C Perrins.
No Director played a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy overview The objective of the remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives.
The Remuneration Committee believes that shareholders interests are best served by remuneration packages having a large emphasis on performance-related pay.
Emphasis on performance should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy.
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the policy provides meaningful incentives to Executives and ensures that the appropriate balance between fixed and performance-related compensation is maintained.
The policy is to set the main elements of the Executive Directors remuneration package against the following quartiles in the Companys comparator group: Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in kind Share incentives Upper decile Upper decile Lower quartile to median Market practice Upper decile For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration the Remuneration Committee uses the following comparator group of companies: Company Name Amec plc Carillion Plc McCarthy & Stone Plc Ultraframe plc Balfour Beatty Plc Crest Nicholson Plc Persimmon Plc Westbury Plc Barratt Developments Plc George Wimpey Plc Redrow Plc Wilson Bowden Plc Bellway Plc Marshalls Plc Taylor Woodrow Plc Bovis Homes Group Plc McAlpine Alfred Plc Travis Perkins Plc The Remuneration Committee reviews the policy on an annual basis to ensure that it is in line with the Companys objectives and shareholders interests.
Report 28-47 7 8 06 14:18 Page 32 Remuneration Committee report continued Balance between fixed and variable performance based pay The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable performance based pay for each Executive Director for the year ended 30 April 2006: The Executive Directors hold no external appointments.
The main elements of these packages and the performance conditions are described below.
Elements of Executive Directors remuneration Basic salary Policy: Upper decile Salary Freeze 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2006 Year ended 30 April 2006 In accordance with the three year salary freeze no rises were made during the year.
Policy It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee that the salaries of the Executive Directors should be set at the upper decile in line with the Committees view that the Company has one of the most experienced Executive teams within the sector.
When determining the salaries of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular those companies within the comparator group: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and the pay and conditions throughout the Company.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors in May 2006 at the end of the three year salary freeze period in light of the factors set out above.
As a result of the review the Remuneration Committee felt that it was appropriate to increase the salary of the Group Finance Director of the Company.
No rises were made for the other Executive Directors.

Bonus payments are not pensionable.
Report 28-47 7 8 06 14:18 Page 33 General The theoretical maximum bonus available is 300% of salary.
However, the Remuneration Committee will only in very exceptional circumstances, outside the normal operation of the bonus plan for the year in question, consider a bonus payment greater than 200% of salary.
On the occurrence of very exceptional circumstances and prior to any commitment to make a bonus payment, the Remuneration Committee would consult shareholders to obtain their agreement that the circumstances gave rise to the level of bonus payment proposed.
Therefore, the effective maximum annual bonus potential is 200% of salary.
The maximum bonus potential and the effective maximum bonus potential remain the same for the financial year ending 30 April 2007 i. e. 200%.
Bonus targets are reviewed each year and agreed by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance measures for the Executive Directors bonus plan are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging.
The structure of bonus payments is as follows: Position Percentage cash Percentage Units Executive Bonus will be paid in cash up to Any bonus payment above 100% of salary a maximum of 100% of salary.
will be invested, net of tax, in Units.
These Units will be retained by the Executives for 18 months.
Year ended 30 April 2006 The targets for the year ended 30 April 2006, their level of achievement and the corresponding bonus earned for the Executive Directors are set out in the following tables: Bonus potential and targets for the years ended 30 April 2006 and 30 April 2007 The following table shows the maximum bonus potential for each of the Executive Directors for the years ended 30 April 2006 and 30 April 2007.
In addition, the table shows the percentage of that maximum bonus potential subject to each performance target for the financial year ending 30 April 2006 and for the future financial year ending 30 April 2007: Bonus targets Executive Maximum annual Cash redemption Annual divisional bonus potential bonus criteria PBT targets %age of salary see below for see below for full description full description R St J H Lewis 200% 100% A W Pidgley 200% 100% R C Perrins 200% 100% A Carey 200% 25% 75% G J Fry 200% 25% 75% The following table shows the maximum potential bonus for each Executive and the bonus earned for the year ended 30 April 2006: Name R St J H Lewis A W Pidgley R C Perrins A Carey G J Fry Effective maximum bonus potential % of salary 200% 200% 200% 200% 200% 2006 bonus paid 220,000 1,500,000 650,000 590,000 295,000 2006 bonus paid % of salary 100% 200% 200% 146% 102% Bonus performance criteria Cash redemption condition This performance condition applies to 100% of the maximum bonus potential for the Group Executive Directors and 25% of the maximum bonus potential for the Divisional Executive Directors.
For years ending 30 April 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011, the cash redemption condition requires the returns of capital of 5, 2, 2 and 3 per Unit respectively.
Report 28-47 7 8 06 14:18 Page 34 Remuneration Committee report continued 1 For years ending 30 April 2006, 2008 and 2010, the cash redemption condition will be met if the dividend lock up tests are satisfied at the end of the relevant financial year six months earlier than required.
If these tests are satisfied it means that the Company is on target to be able to make the redemption payments on the due dates.
If the dividend lock up tests are not achieved at the end of the relevant financial year but the Board is of the view that they will be satisfied in time to make the next redemption payment on the relevant date, this element of the bonus will be accrued and not declared until the redemption payment has been made.
In the highly unlikely event that a bonus is paid but the due redemption payment is not made the share element of the bonus paid shall be forfeited and the cash element paid shall be offset against future bonus entitlements.
The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the dividend lock up tests have been satisfied as at 30 April 2006.
In forming this opinion the Committee has in part relied on the fact that the satisfaction of the dividend lock up tests has been independently verified.
Therefore, the Remuneration Committee has agreed the bonus payments set out above which are subject to the satisfaction of this performance condition.
Divisional PBT performance condition The divisional PBT targets are set at the beginning of the financial year at a level which is challenging taking into account the potential level of bonus payments, the market, development availability and other relevant issues.
The Remuneration Committee confirms that the annual bonus payments set out within this report for the Divisional Executive Directors are appropriate taking into account the level of profit achieved and the targets set at the beginning of the year ending 30 April 2006.
Share incentives Policy: Upper decile Overview Executive Directors The only Executive share incentive plan operated by the Company is The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-term Incentive Plan the 2004 b LTIP approved by shareholders at the AGM on 17 September 2004.
The Executive Directors, excluding the Executive Chairman, in accordance with the rules of the 2004 b LTIP were granted one award on the adoption of the Plan.
Therefore, no awards have been granted to the Executive Directors during the financial year ended 30 April 2006 under the 2004 b LTIP or any other share based arrangement.
Further, no awards will be made under the 2004 b LTIP or any other share based arrangement during the financial year ending 30 April 2007.
Other senior employees of the Company The Companys business is broken down into a number of operating Divisions.
The Remuneration Committee considered the annual and longer term cash based compensation arrangements for other senior employees of the Company linked to the performance of the relevant Division for which they work that are implemented by the Board.
Some elements of the cash bonus plans are annual whilst other elements are deferred to ensure long-term consistent delivery by each Division.
It is the view of the Board that these arrangements are much more targeted at ensuring the delivery of Divisional performance, for which these senior employees are responsible, than a share based plan which by its very nature would be subject to Group performance.
It is the view of the Board that ensuring that senior employees are focused on the delivery of Divisional results is the most effective way of driving shareholder value.
2004 b LTIP main features The Plan provides for Executive Directors, excluding the Executive Chairman, with rights to receive, at no cost, the shares set out in the table below.
The number of shares awarded under the Plan was determined on 26 October 2004, the date of the Scheme of Arrangement, as 15% of the fully diluted share capital of the Company on adoption of the 2004 b LTIP.
The shares will only be released to the Executive Directors if the Company has returned to shareholders 12 per share by 31 January 2011, i. e. the end of the holding period.
Fifty percent of the shares subject to awards will be retained by the Executive Directors for a period of at least 12 months after the date of release, with the balance retained for a period of at least 24 months following release.
1 The dividend lock up tests are the additional financial ratio tests set out in the Groups banking facilities that must be satisfied for the Company to make a redemption payment.
These tests are more stringent than the ongoing financial covenant tests applicable to the Companys bank facilities.
Report 28-47 7 8 06 14:18 Page 35 The following table sets out the awards made under the 2004 b LTIP to the Executive Directors: Name Ordinary Shares A W Pidgley 11,371,393 R C Perrins 4,264,272 A Carey 3,553,560 G J Fry 2,132,136 The Remuneration Committees policy is designed to incentivise the Executive Directors to maximise the total return to shareholders.
In the Remuneration Committees opinion this will be achieved by incentivising the Executive Directors to not only ensure that 12 per share is returned to shareholders but also by providing them with a direct share in the residual value of the Company.
As a result, the value of the awards is directly linked to the value of the residual Company following the return and as such there is a close alignment between the interests of the Executive Directors and shareholders, both of whom benefit from a maximum value for the residual part of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee will determine whether the performance condition has been satisfied by ensuring the redemption payments have been made in the allotted time frame.
Shareholding requirement The Company has a shareholding requirement for both Executive and Non-executive Directors.
The following table sets out the shareholding requirement and the actual shareholdings of the Executive Directors as at 30 April 2006: Current shareholding as a % of salary Shareholder requirement as a % of salary Name based on 30 April 2006 share price by the end of the year ended 30 April 2009 Group Executive Chairman R St J H Lewis 214% 200% Group Managing Director A W Pidgley 2,406% 400% Group Finance Director R C Perrins 150% 200% Divisional Director A Carey 801% 200% Divisional Director G J Fry 500% 200% The following table sets out the shareholding requirement and the actual shareholdings of the Non-executive Directors as at 30 April 2006: Shareholding requirement to be built up Current shareholding as a % of net fees within three years of appointment Name based on 30 April 2006 share price as a % of net fees H A Palmer 180% 100% D Howell 156% 100% V M Mitchell 283% 100% M B Tanner 100% Dilution The only share plan operated by the Company is the 2004 b LTIP.
It is not currently intended to operate any other Executive or all employee share incentive arrangements.
The Company has historically operated all its share schemes within the ABI dilution limits excluding the 2004 b LTIP which was a unique arrangement arising from the change in corporate strategy.
There has been no dilution for the purposes of the ABI dilution limits in the year ended 30 April 2006. www.
Report 28-47 7 8 06 14:18 Page 36 Remuneration Committee report continued Closed share plans The following table sets out those share plans closed on the reconstruction of the Company in relation to which there are still unpaid benefits held by the Executive Directors: Plan Position The Berkeley Group plc In accordance with the rules of the Plan the performance conditions were measured on 2000 Long-term Incentive Plan the reconstruction of the Company and were found to have been satisfied.
Therefore, Executives were entitled to the immediate release of their awards.
The Executives, however, agreed to defer the release of these awards until their original release dates and for the awards to remain subject to the cessation of employment provisions in the rules.
No further conditions apply to the awards as the original performance conditions were satisfied in accordance with the rules of the Plan on the reconstruction.
The Berkeley Group plc 2000 The Group Managing Director was the only Executive Director to have unvested options Share Option Plan on the date of the reconstruction.
On the reconstruction his options vested and the 2 Group Managing Director chose to take the conditional compensation payment alternative offered to all holders of unvested options under the Plan.
2 The conditional compensation payment is equal to the difference between the share price of the Company over the ten business days prior to the reconstruction becoming effective and the exercise price of the relevant option multiplied by the number of shares under such option.
Pension Policy: Lower quartile to median The Executive Directors are all members of one or more of the following pensions schemes in operation within the Group, namely The Berkeley Group Staff Benefits Plan, The Berkeley Homes Executive Pension Plan and The St George PLC Group Personal Pension Plan which replaced The St George PLC Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme with effect from 1 March 2006.
No element of remuneration other than basic salary is pensionable.
Three Executive Directors have benefits accruing to them under a defined contribution scheme and three have benefits accruing to them under a defined benefits scheme.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in these schemes.
The Company is currently in the process of reviewing all its pension arrangements including those for Executive Directors.
However, it should be noted that the Company is not providing any compensation to Executives for loss of tax relief as a result of the change in legislation on 6 April 2006 ADay.
Details of pension costs for Executive Directors are set out in the audited section of the report on page 39.
Benefits in kind Policy: Market practice In line with market practice, the Companys policy is to provide Executive Directors with the following additional benefits: a fully expensed company car: and medical insurance.
Other remuneration matters All employee share schemes The Board of the Company has consulted widely with the management and individuals in its operating Divisions.
The consensus view was that employees preferred the opportunity of receiving annual cash bonuses based on the performance of their respective Divisions rather than participate in a Group based all employee share scheme.
The Board, therefore, did not believe it was in shareholders interests to incur the income statement and dilutive cost of share arrangements which would not have the desired effect on employees.
Accordingly, the Company has introduced appropriate annual bonus arrangements in all of its Divisions and is not intending to implement any employee share schemes.
Report 28-47 7 8 06 14:18 Page 37 Non-executive Directors fees Policy: Upper decile fees All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the articles of association.
The 2006 fee levels are based on a specific survey of the fees paid to Non-executive Directors in the comparator group by Halliwell Consulting.
The following table sets out the fee rates for the Non-executive Directors in the year ended 30 April 2006: H A Palmer Senior Independent 3 Element Director D Howell V M Mitchell M B Tanner Total fee rates 2006 54,400 52,500 52,500 50,000 Total fee rates 2005 54,400 50,000 50,000 % Increase 0% 5% 5% Breakdown of 2006 fee Basic fee 54,400 44,000 44,000 50,000 Chair of Committee fee 8,500 8,500 3 M Tanner was appointed on 1 September 2005.
Therefore his fees for the year ended 30 April 2006 have been annualised for comparison purposes.
The Board decided to increase the fees of the Non-executive Directors for the year ended 30 April 2006 in light of the following factors: the increasing workload and level of responsibility of the Non-executive Directors under the changing corporate governance expectations of shareholders and their representative bodies: and the current market rate for fees for Non-executive Directors.
The Board has been made aware of the market rates for Non-executive Directors during its recent recruitment exercise resulting in the appointment of M Tanner.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share incentive schemes or performance based plans and are not eligible to join the Companys pension scheme.
Executive Directors contracts The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations.
The only event on the occurrence of which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on cessation of employment: with the maximum payment being 12 months salary.
No payment is due on either a Company takeover or in the event of liquidation.
In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
Further, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
None of the Executive Directors contracts provides for liquidated damages.
There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company.
Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Directors cessation of employment with the Company.
Non-executive Directors agreements All non-executive appointments are subject to a notice period of one month and subject to successful re-election upon retirement by rotation as required by the Companys articles of association.
All letters of appointment for Non-executive Directors are renewable annually on 1 May.

Report 28-47 7 8 06 14:19 Page 38 Remuneration Committee report continued Performance graph 4 The graph shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE250, the FTSE All Share and the Companys remuneration comparator group as set out on page 31.
The Company considers these the most relevant indices for total shareholder return disclosure required under the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
4 Total Shareholder Return TSR is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the measurement period the return is the value of the capital gain and reinvested dividends.
This calculation is then carried out for the relevant Indices and constituents of the Comparator Group.
Audited information The following tables and accompanying notes constitute the auditable part of the Remuneration Committee Report, as defined in Part 3, Schedule 7a of the Companies Act 1985.
2 In 2005, 60,000 of Mrs Mitchells remuneration was paid in shares.
The Board of Berkeley believed that it was appropriate to pay Mrs Mitchell this additional remuneration to recognise the very significant time she spent during 2004 discharging her duties as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
This was far in excess of that normally associated with the position and required Mrs Mitchell to forego other work and consulting opportunities during this period.
The Board of Berkeley consulted with major shareholders over this payment and thought it appropriate to make the payment in shares.
3 Appointed as a Director on 1 September 2005.
4 Benefits in kind for all Executive Directors with the exception of the Chairman relate principally to the provision of a fully expensed motor vehicle and private healthcare.
The chairman receives only private healthcare benefits.
Where Directors were appointed, or resigned, during the year, the figures in the table relate only to the time when the relevant Director was a Main Board Director.

4 All the Directors, other than Mr Pidgley, joined the Group after the Inland Revenue introduced an Earnings Cap for calculating pension benefits in 1989, and this is reflected in the calculation of accumulated accrued pension entitlements above.
The above Directors are non-contributory members of the Plan.
A W Pidgley was a contributory member of the Plan until February 2006.
The change in transfer value during the year for Mr Pidgley, excluding contributions paid by him, is 237,595.

The transfer values disclosed above represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the liability in respect of qualifying services.
As such they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
These transfer values do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
Members of the fund have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: neither these contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the transfer values in the table above.
In addition to the above, the Company made the following contributions to defined contribution plans: Defined Contribution Plan Company Company contributions contributions 2006 2005 Age A W Pidgley 58 28,125 37,500 A Carey 58 60,750 60,750 G J Fry 49 43,500 43,500 132,375 141,750 www.
Following the Group reconstruction, share elements of the awards were converted into awards over Units in The Berkeley Group Holdings plc.
On the release of the share element of these awards, the participants received Units in respect of the share awards granted as well as the 5 repayment attached to those Units, which had been held in trust until their release on 7 August 2005.
The participants received the cash element of these awards during FY2005.
2 As explained on page 36, on approval of the Group reconstruction on 25 October 2004, the Remuneration Committee determined that the performance conditions relating to the 2002 and 2003 awards had been satisfied.
The participants received the cash element of the 2002 award during the year, and will receive the share element of the 2002 award during FY2007.
They will receive the cash element of the 2003 award during FY2007, and the share element of the 2003 award during FY2008.
All the share elements of the awards were converted into awards over Units in The Berkeley Group Holdings plc.
On the release of the share element of these awards participants will receive Units as well as any redemption payments attached to those Units, which will be held in trust until the relevant release dates.
The mid-market share price of the Company on 7 August 2001 was 725.5p, on 19 August 2002 was 665.0p, on 22 July 2003 was 762.5p, and on 7 August 2005 was 886.0p.
The mid-market share price of the Company was 770.0p as at 1 May 2005 and the mid-market share price of the Company was 1,151p as at 30 April 2006.
The mid-market high and low share prices of the Company were 766.0p and 1,211.0p respectively in the year.

Under The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Share Option Plan the 2000 Plan, Court approval of the Scheme of Arrangement, in accordance with the Plans rules, resulted in immediate vesting of options under the Plan without reference to satisfaction of the performance conditions unless the Remuneration Committee deemed otherwise.
