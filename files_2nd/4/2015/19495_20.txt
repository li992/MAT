ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 74 DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT STATEMENT FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Directors Remuneration Report is split into two parts: The Policy Report, which sets out the Companys policy on Directors remuneration.
The policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM for a period of three years: and The Annual Report on Remuneration which discloses the payments and awards made to the Directors under the policy and shows the link between remuneration and the Groups performance.
The Policy Report is not subject to a shareholder vote this year.
The Annual Report on Remuneration, together with this introductory statement, is subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM.
During 2015, the Remuneration Committee Committee continued to monitor developments relating to remuneration.
Throughout the year, the Committee has considered updates on best practice from relevant providers of corporate governance guidance.
The Group supports the continued drive for improvement of best practice and for greater focus on transparency, moderation, simplicity and a closer alignment of the interests of the Directors with those of the shareholders.
Gary Bullard Remuneration Committee Chairman Remuneration for 2015 Members: John Nicholas, Sally James As set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration, following and Lucinda Bell a challenging year, the Companys performance against 2015 incentive targets resulted in an annual cash bonus payout of 18.8% of the maximum bonus opportunity available and a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP vesting rate of nil for the 2013 award which was based on earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR performance over the three years to 31 December 2015.
The cash bonus payment reflected the achievement of cash flow and accident frequency targets.
Remuneration for 2016 The Committee continues to be mindful of employee remuneration conditions around the Group and salary increases for executive Directors in 2016 will be 1%, which is broadly in line with the typical increase for other UK employees.
During the year, the Committee approved revised and simplified cash bonus criteria for the executive Directors for 2016, within the parameters of the existing Policy Report.
In response to the challenging conditions facing the Group, the revised criteria reflect an increased emphasis on annual profit performance, with the balance based on the strategic and personal performance, cash generation performance, and accident frequency rate.
Further details of the revised criteria are set out on page 88.
The maximum cash bonus potential remains 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for other executive Directors.
The LTIP awards will continue to be based on EPS and TSR performance each accounting for 50% of the award.
The TSR performance condition will be the same as set for previous awards.
The EPS performance target for the 2016 awards will require 9% to 35% EPS growth over the three year performance period for 15% to 100% vesting for this 1 part of the award.
The LTIP award levels for 2016 will be 150% of salary for the Chief Executive, 125% of salary for the Group Finance Director and 100% of salary for the President Strategic Report Directors Governance Financial Statements Company Information ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 75 of Rotork Controls Inc. increased from 125% for the Chief Executive and 100% for the Group Finance Director in 2015.
These increased award levels are within the Policy Report maximum of 150% of salary and are designed to increase the competitiveness of the long term incentive opportunity.
The Committee is satisfied that the performance targets are appropriately challenging taking into account expected performance and the proposed award levels.
Planning ahead for the 2017 AGM During 2016, the Committee intends to review the Policy Report to ensure that it continues to support the business strategy, appropriately incentivises and rewards the Directors for their role in the long term success of the Group and is aligned to the interests of shareholders.
This review will coincide with the requirement for the Company to submit the Policy Report to shareholders for approval at the 2017 AGM, and the outcome of the review and the Policy Report itself will be communicated in next years remuneration report.
Any significant changes will be subject to prior consultation with major shareholders.
Activities of the Committee during the year The Remuneration Committee maintains a rolling programme of activities which forms the basis of its scheduled meetings throughout the year.
This rolling programme is supplemented by consideration of specific issues as and when they arise.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 76 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company The Committee is sensitive to employee remuneration conditions in the Group and in determining remuneration takes account of remuneration conditions throughout the Group.
While the Committee does not consult with employees on remuneration, it does invite the Group Human Resources Director to its meetings to provide, amongst other things, details of employee remuneration conditions and metrics such as pay rises awarded to employees.
Consideration of shareholder views In formulating the Policy Report, the Committee takes into account guidance issued by shareholder representative bodies, including the Investment Association, the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association formerly the NAPF and the Institutional Shareholders' Service.
The Committee also takes into consideration any views expressed by shareholders during the year including at the AGM and encourages an open dialogue with its largest shareholders.
Major shareholders would be consulted in advance about changes to the approved Policy Report or any significant proposed changes to the way in which it is implemented.

For each measure, normally a sliding scale of stretching targets is set by the Committee, which apply from the beginning of each financial year.
The threshold level of bonus under each financial measure varies but accounts for no more than one third of the maximum bonus opportunity under any single measure.
Under the terms of the bonus plan, the Committee has the discretion, in exceptional circumstances, to amend previously set targets or to adjust the proposed payout to ensure a fair and appropriate outcome.
Policy update: as noted on page 74, and as permitted under the Policy Report, the Committee has approved revised bonus measures for 2016.
Bonuses for 2016 will be based on annual profit, cash generation, strategic and personal targets and the accident frequency rate.

Directors fees Directors of the right calibre.
Non-executive Director fees are determined by the Chairman and Chief Executive.
The fees for the Chairman are determined by the Committee taking into account views of the Chief Executive.
The Chairman excludes himself from such discussions.
The fees for the non-executive Directors which are paid quarterly in cash normally comprise a basic Board fee, with additional fees paid to the Senior Independent Director and for chairing a Committee.
The fee levels set are set by reference to rates in companies of comparable size and complexity.
The fee levels are reviewed periodically taking into account the responsibilities of the role and the time commitment of the individual.
The maximum aggregate fee level is 500,000.
Performance measures Performance measures are used to determine the extent of any awards made under the variable elements of the executive Directors remuneration mix, being the annual cash bonus and the LTIP.
The performance measures used are set out in the Directors future policy table above.
The performance measures were selected because of their use as key performance indicators KPIs to assess Company performance and to align the interests of the Directors to those of the shareholders.
Non-financial KPIs constitute part of the annual cash bonus award and these are selected to ensure that performance measured by financial KPIs is not delivered at the expense of important non-financial considerations, in this case the safety of Rotorks people and Rotorks impact on the environment.
Clawback and malus The payment of any bonus is at the ultimate discretion of the Committee and the Committee also retains an absolute discretion to reclaim some, or all, of any annual bonus paid in exceptional circumstances, such as misstatement of results, an error in the calculation of the performance targets and or award size and gross misconduct.
In terms of the LTIP, the Committee has the discretion to reclaim some, or all, of a vested LTIP award in exceptional circumstances the categories for clawback being the same as for the annual bonus plan.
In addition, the Committee may lapse or reduce an award prior to vesting where the participant is found to be guilty of serious misconduct.
Pension policy PI France and JM Davis are active members of the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme.
If they remain active members of the Pension Scheme until their normal retirement age of 60 and 65 respectively, PI France will be entitled to a pension of 66.7% of the earnings cap and JM Davis will be entitled to a pension of 47.5% of the earnings cap which is set at 149,400 per annum for 2016 but may increase in line with inflation.
These figures ignore any benefits transferred from another pension arrangement and the tax implications of remaining in the Pension Scheme until normal retirement age.
In addition, they receive a cash allowance on salary above the cap 22.5% for PI France and 18% for JM Davis.
GM Ogden was a preserved member of the Pension Scheme and received a cash allowance of 44% of salary in lieu of pension until his retirement on 31 March 2015 when he became a pensioner.
RH Arnold is a member of the Rotork Controls Inc. pension scheme and a supplementary executive retirement plan, which in aggregate are targeted to provide a pension of 60% of uncapped basic salary at age 65.
The Companys defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and the USA are closed to new entrants.
The pension arrangement that would be offered to a new executive Director would be limited to a maximum 25% of salary cash allowance or contribution to one of the Companys defined contribution schemes and or continued participation in a defined benefit scheme if the executive is an existing member of one of the schemes.

Strategic Report Directors Governance Financial Statements Company Information ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 83 LTIP The LTIP rewards the creation of shareholder value which is a strategic priority.
Performance is measured over a three year period using a combination of EPS, growth and TSR compared to a comparator group.
The performance measures and weightings are summarised in the table below.
i The 2012 awards were based on TSR and EPS performance to 31 December 2014 each condition accounting for 50% of the award.
TSR was measured relative to the FTSE 250 index excluding all financial services, insurance companies and investment trusts.
For the EPS condition, EPS growth must be at least RPI 10% for 25% vesting, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for EPS growth of RPI 25% and above.
Rotorks actual TSR performance was 48% resulting in 0% of the TSR element of the award vesting.
Rotorks actual EPS growth was 28% resulting in 73.9% of the EPS element of the award vesting.
The overall vesting of the awards was 37% and the total number of shares vesting in respect of 1 1 all executives was therefore 193,940.
The shares vested on 5 March 2015 and the share price on the date of vesting was 2.50. ii The performance conditions for the 2013 awards are based on performance to 31 December 2015.
The targets are the same as for the 2012 awards.
Rotorks actual TSR performance was 0% and the EPS growth was -16.4% resulting in the minimum performance criteria not being achieved.
The awards will lapse in March 2016. iii The 2014 awards were granted on 7 March 2014 and are subject to the same performance targets as the 2013 awards albeit based on performance to 31 December 2016. iv The 2015 awards were granted on 6 March 2015 and are subject to the same performance targets as the 2012, 2013 and 2014 awards albeit based on performance to 31 December 2017.
Further details on the awards are set out in the table below.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 86 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Total pension entitlements audited Total accrued Value of pension-related benefits accrued during Company financial year to: pension in the defined benefit 31 December 2014 31 December 2015 scheme as at 31 December Defined Defined Normal 2015 per benefit Cash in lieu benefit Cash in lieu Director retirement age annum scheme of pension Total scheme of pension Total RH Arnold 65 150,934 83,250 83,250 412,800 412,800 JM Davis 65 31,226 53,900 25,920 79,820 61,960 26,339 88,299 PI France 60 66,185 67,360 63,293 130,653 82,880 63,945 146,825 GM Ogden 60 101,198 90,332 90,332 22,990 22,990 Please refer to note 2 below.
The amounts above have been calculated in accordance with Statutory Instrument 2013 No 1981 The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Account and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
The total accrued pension in the defined benefit scheme as at 31 December 2015 is that which would be paid annually on retirement from normal pension age, based on service to 31 December 2015, except for GM Ogden who became a preserved member of the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme on 5 April 2012 and began drawing his benefits from 5 April 2015.
The figure shown for GM Ogdens total benefit as at 31 December 2015 includes deferred revaluation applied to the date he began drawing benefits and deduction for annual allowance tax charges, but does not include any reduction applied for early retirement or exchanging pension for a cash sum, or any subsequent pension increases applied before 31 December 2015.
The value of benefits in the defined benefit pension scheme is based on the increase in accrued pension over the year incorporating an increase for Consumer Prices Index CPI inflation.
GM Ogden became a preserved member of the scheme as at 5 April 2012 and so did not accrue any additional pension during 2015.
He receives a cash allowance of 44% of basic salary in lieu of this pension benefit, which amounted to 22,990 in 2015 up to the date of his retirement.
The pensionable salary used to calculate benefits in the defined benefit scheme for PI France and JM Davis is restricted to a scheme specific earnings cap which was 145,800 for 2015.
In lieu of this limitation on their benefits under the scheme they receive a monthly cash sum equal to 22.5% and 18% respectively of their basic salary above the schemes specific cap.
During 2015, this resulted in additional cash allowances of 63,945 and 26,339 respectively.
The figures shown for RH Arnold are in respect of his membership of the Rotork Controls Inc. pension scheme and a supplemental executive retirement plan so that, in aggregate, the pension arrangements for RH Arnold are targeted to provide a pension of at least 60% of uncapped basic salary at age 65.
The valuations of the benefits are affected by movements in the US dollar relative to sterling which is the cause of the large increase in value over 2015 and are therefore not directly comparable with the directors in the UK scheme.
If exchange rates had been unchanged from those used for 2014, then the increase in the value of RH Arnolds benefit over 2015 would have been 94,060.
We have assumed that RH Arnold does not contribute to this arrangement.
The accrued pension figures for PI France include a fixed transfer-in pension amount of 5,123 which is payable from his normal retirement date at age 60.

The remuneration breakdown varies from country-to-country so the best comparison should be provided by looking at total remuneration.
Total remuneration per employee has reduced year on year by 2%.
However, this comparison is distorted by currency movements as the average salary increase between 2014 and 2015 for overseas employees was 2.8% and for the UK workforce was 1.9%.

Retirement of GM Ogden GM Ogden retired from the Company on 31 March 2015.
He did not receive any compensation for loss of office.
He received a prorated annual cash bonus for 2015 as set out in the single figure of remuneration table on page 82.
The Committee has exercised its discretion in relation to his outstanding LTIP awards for 2013 and 2014 for them not to lapse on his retirement in line with the relevant scheme rules applicable for each award.
The Committee considered that the use of its discretion in this way was justified given GM Ogdens length of service as an employee and overall contribution to the Group.
The awards remained eligible for vesting subject to performance and a time pro rata reduction to reflect the proportion of the performance period served.
For the 2013 award, under the plan rules, performance was measured to the date of cessation of employment.
This resulted in 13,600 of shares vesting to GM Ogden with respect to the 2013 award.
For the 2014 award performance is measured until the end of the outstanding performance period being 31 December 2016 and there will be a pro rata vesting in the event that the performance criteria are achieved.
Any outstanding Sharesave or SIP awards will vest in accordance with their terms.
Retirement of RH Arnold As announced in March 2016, RH Arnold will retire from Rotork in August 2016, following 38 years' of service with the Group, including 28 years as President of Rotork Controls Inc..
He will not receive any compensation for loss of office.
He will be eligible to receive a prorated annual cash bonus for 2016 based on the period worked.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 88 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Statement of implementation of the remuneration policy in 2016 The base salaries for the executive Directors were reviewed in December 2015 and the percentage increases shown below effective from 1 January 2016 were agreed by the Committee.
This is consistent with the typical increase for the UK workforce which was 1%.
The salaries from 1 January 2016 are therefore as follows: RH Arnold US$393,657 1% : JM Davis 295,046 1% : and PI France 434,300 1%.
Following a review, the Committee decided to make certain changes to the annual cash bonus for 2016.
The three year profit growth and EPS target will be removed, and strategic and personal targets are being introduced to more appropriately reflect the business strategy.
The annual cash bonus for 2016 will therefore be based on annual profit target 60%, cash generation 15%, accident frequency rate 5%, and strategic and personal target objectives 20%.
As was the case in 2015, the maximum cash bonus potential is 100% of basic salary for executive Directors, except for the Chief Executive where the bonus potential is 125% of basic salary.
The specific targets relating to the cash bonus have not been disclosed as they are considered by the Committee to be commercially sensitive, but full details will be given on a retrospective basis in next years report.
The LTIP award levels for 2016 will be 150% of salary for the Chief Executive, 125% of salary for the Group Finance Director and 100% of salary for the President of Rotork Controls Inc. increased from 125% for the Chief Executive and 100% for the Group Finance Director in 2015.
These increased award levels are within the Policy Report maximum of 150% of salary and are designed to increase the competiveness of the long term incentive opportunity.
Consistent with the approach used in previous years, the LTIP performance conditions will be subject to TSR and EPS performance conditions each accounting for 50% of the award.
TSR will be measured relative to the FTSE 250 Index excluding all financial services, insurance companies and investment trusts with 25% vesting at median increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance or above.
For the EPS condition, EPS growth must be at least 9% for 15% vesting, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for EPS growth of 35% and above.
The revised target range, which is no longer referenced to the UK RPI, reflects the increasingly international nature of the Company and the expected future outlook for the business given the uncertain macro-economic environment.
The Committee is satisfied that the EPS targets remain appropriately challenging given the current outlook for the Group and the proposed award levels.
The fees for the non-executive Directors were reviewed in December 2015.
The fee for the Chairman was reviewed in March 2015 as part of the search process for a successor Chairman.
The current fee policy is: Chairman: 180,000: Base Board fee: 47,000: Additional fee for chairing the Audit Committee 10,000: Additional fee for chairing the Remuneration Committee 8,000: and Additional fee for the role of Senior Independent Director 8,000.
Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors remuneration The members of the Committee are: GB Bullard Chairman, LM Bell, SA James and JE Nicholas.
MJ Lamb ceased to be a member when he became Chairman of the Board.
The Committee invites the Group Human Resources Director to inform the Committee of pay awards throughout the Group when setting executive Director remuneration.
The Chairman and Chief Executive are also invited to attend meetings except when their own remuneration is considered.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
New Bridge Street is remuneration advisor to the Committee and was appointed by the Committee in September 2013 following a retendering process.
New Bridge Street is a trading name of Aon plc and a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct.
A subsidiary of Aon plc is also the scheme actuary for the Groups USA pension plan.
The Committee is satisfied that New Bridge Street is sufficiently independent to act as remuneration adviser to the Committee.
In 2015, the Company paid 54,926 2014: 52,068 to New Bridge Street for services to the Committee.
Statement of voting at general meeting At the 2015 AGM of the Company, the percentages of votes cast for, against and withheld in respect of the Directors Remuneration Report were as follows: Votes cast Votes cast Votes Resolution for against withheld To approve the Directors Remuneration Report 99.6 0.40% 0% Against votes cast at the AGM were a very small proportion of the overall votes and accordingly the Directors did not deem it necessary to take any remedial action regarding these votes.
