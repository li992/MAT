Operation Base salaries are normally reviewed annually.
When determining and reviewing base salaries, theCommittee considers: corporate and individual performance: the skills, experience and responsibilities of the Executive Director and their market value: the scope and size of the role: base salary increases for colleagues throughout the Group: and external market factors.
Base salaries from 1 January 2016 are detailed in the Implementation Report on page 124.
Maximum potential Whilst there is no maximum base salary, any salary increases in percentage terms will normally be in line with increases awarded to other colleagues, but may be higher in certain circumstances.
The circumstances may include but are not limited to: where anew Executive Director has been appointed at alower salary, higher increases may be awarded over an initial period as the Executive Director gains experience in the role: where there has been an increase in the scope or responsibility of an Executive Directors role: or where a salary has fallen significantly below market positioning given current size and scale of theGroup.
Base salary levels may be amended to take into account any regulatory changes.
Performance measures N A Fixed Allowance Purpose and link to strategy To ensure that total fixed remuneration is commensurate with the role and to provide acompetitive reward package for Executive Directors with an appropriate balance of fixed and variable remuneration.
Also to facilitate recruitment of an Executive Director if required.

Operation Virgin Money provides arange of benefits which may include private medical insurance, permanent health insurance and life assurance.
The Committee retains the discretion to provide additional benefits as may be reasonably required.
These may include national and international relocation benefits such as but not limited to accommodation, family relocation support and travel.
The Executive Directors are entitled to amaximum of 30 days holiday and any unused holiday may be bought back at the standard daily salary rate.
Maximum potential The maximum value of benefits is based on the cost to the Group of providing each of the benefits in the Operation section immediately above.
Performance measures N A Annual Bonus and Deferred Bonus Share Plan Purpose and link to strategy The annual bonus is designed to reward performance, scored against annual weighted financial and non-financial measures.
Operation Annual bonuses are discretionary and are based on Group and individual performance within the year.
The determination of measures and their weighting are set annually and awards are determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the financial year.
The Committee has discretion, in exceptional circumstances, to amend targets, measures, or number of shares under award if an event happens for example amajor transaction or capital raising that in the opinion of the Committee, causes the annual targets or measures to no longer be appropriate or such adjustment to be reasonable.
The Committee also has the discretion to reduce the vesting level of any award if it deems that the outcome is not consistent with performance delivered.
The annual bonus may be delivered partly in cash and partly deferred into cash, shares or other instruments.
The mechanism for making the bonus deferral is the Deferred Bonus Share Plan DBSP.
Deferral levels are set at the time of award and in line with regulatory requirements.
At present this means that at least 60% of total variable pay is deferred, at least 50% of variable pay is paid in shares or other instruments, and vested shares post taxation are subject to aretention period.
The deferral and holding periods may be amended to take into account any regulatory changes over the life of the policy.
The Remuneration Committee may adjust awards or amend the terms of the awards in accordance with the DBSP rules.
At the time of the shares being released and as long as this remains permissible under the regulatory rules, Executive Directors may receive an amount in cash or in shares equal to the dividends paid or payable between the date of grant and the vesting of the award on the number of shares which have vested.
All awards will be subject to malus and clawback provisions see page 120.
Maximum potential The normal maximum bonus for Executive Directors is 100% of fixed pay.
Under the DBSP rules, there is scope to award abonus up to 300% of total fixed remuneration in exceptional circumstances, normally linked with recruitment.
Any such Award would however remain subject to the overall regulatory rules.
Performance measures Performance measures are determined by the Remuneration Committee each year.
For 2016 these are set out in the Implementation Report on page 124.
At least 50% of the annual bonus opportunity is based on performance against key financial measures determined at the beginning of each financial year.
The remainder of the annual bonus is based on performance against non-financial measures, which will normally include ascorecard of brand, culture, control measures and personal strategic objectives.

Operation Awards are granted in the form of nil cost options or conditional shares, subject to performance conditions aligned to long term strategy.
The Committee has discretion, in exceptional circumstances, to amend targets, measures, or number of shares under award if an event happens for example amajor transaction or capital raising that in the opinion of the Committee, causes the targets or measures to no longer be appropriate or such adjustment to be reasonable.
Performance conditions will normally be tested over aperiod of three financial years.
Deferral terms are set at the time of award and in line with regulatory requirements.
Vested shares post taxation will be subject to aholding period.
The performance, vesting and holding periods may be amended to take into account any regulatory changes over the life of the policy.
At the time of the shares being released and as long as this remains permissible under regulatory rules, Executive Directors may receive an amount in cash or in shares equal to the dividends paid or payable between the date of grant and the vesting of the award on the number of shares which have vested.
Maximum potential The normal maximum award for Executive Directors is 100% of fixed pay.

Any such award would remain subject to the overall regulatory rules.
For 2016 these are set out in the Implementation Report on page 125.
Note: A change from the previously approved policy is to have a balanced ratio of annual bonus and LTIP rather than the previous 80:120 ratio.
The Committee considers both components tobe equally important having regard to longer deferral terms applying to annual bonus.
All-colleague plans Purpose and link to strategy If operated in the future, Executive Directors will be eligible to participate in HMRC approved all-colleague schemes which encourage share ownership, as approved by shareholders.
Operation Executive Directors may participate in these plans if operated in the future in line with the prevailing HMRC guidelines where relevant, on the same basis as other eligible employees.

Illustration of application of RemunerationPolicy The chart on the following page illustrates the potential remuneration outcomes for the Chief Executive in 2016 in the following three scenarios: the minimum remuneration receivable, where only the fixed element is paid salary, fixed allowance and pension : the target outcome is based on 60% of maximum annual bonus and 80% of maximum vesting under the 2016 LTIP award: and the maximum that may be paid, assuming maximum annual bonus opportunity is realised and full vesting of the 2016 LTIP award.
The amounts do not allow for share price appreciation and do not include any dividends or any payments in lieu of dividends.

Specifically, the level of any Group-wide pay review is akey determinant when setting the level of any increase to Executive Directors salaries.
Colleague engagement is ameasure within the scorecards for both the annual bonus and the LTIP.
There is no colleague representative on the Remuneration Committee.
Instead, time is taken to meet and listen to the views of many colleagues.
One of the duties of the HR Director is to brief the Board on colleague views and, as aregular invitee to Remuneration Committee meetings, he ensures that decisions are made with appropriate insight to colleagues views.
The structure of the Executive Directors remuneration packages cascades down to other colleagues.
Particular points to note are: LTIP awards are granted to the wider Virgin Money Executive Team, with the same variable pay structure and performance conditions: all colleagues are eligible to participate in an annual bonus arrangement, with no product-focused sales incentives.
Instead, all bonuses are subject to abalanced scorecard of measures with particular emphasis on customer experience: and colleagues in certain roles may receive afixed allowance where this is considered appropriate taking into account pre-determined criteria.
On listing, the Board granted all eligible colleagues an award over 1,000 worth of Virgin Money shares 353 shares each.
These shares vested on 18 November 2015, the first anniversary of listing.
As at 31 December 2015 over 70% of colleagues are shareholders in the Company.
