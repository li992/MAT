No Executive Director receives any final salary pension benefits.
How was the amount of the annual bonus determined for 2014 15?
For the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Finance Officer, 60% of the maximum bonus opportunity is payable on achieving defined levels of operating profit OP, with the remaining 40% payable by reference to other objectives linked to key elements of the strategy SOs.
The following table sets out the percentages available for each measure at threshold and stretch performance and compares this potential with the actual payouts achieved.
Actual payout for this measure in Percentage of total bonus Percentage of total bonus respect of 2014 15, as a opportunity payable at threshold opportunity payable at stretch percentage of total bonus Measure and weighting performance for this measure performance for this measure opportunity Operating profit 12% 60% 16.1% 60% of total bonus opportunity Strategic objectives 1 1 40% of total bonus opportunity 8% made up as follows: 40% made up as follows: 5% achieved as follows: Related to achieving budgeted: cash flow 3% 15% 5% growth in customer base 2% 10% 0% gross margin 3% 15% 0% 1 Provided OP is met.
If OP is not met, the Committee has the discretion to award a total bonus of up to 10% of the maximum opportunity based on performance against the SOs.
1 The Company exceeded its threshold targets for operating profit achieving 91.08m against a plan target of 94.97m and cashflow achieving 66.60m against a plan target of 68.81m but did not hit its threshold metric for customer growth and margin where the targets at plan were 2.9% and 37.7% respectively.
Based on this performance, the amounts paid or awarded were: Face value of In respect of OP In respect of SOs DSBP award at grant achieved achieved Total annual bonus Cash award number of shares Laurence Bain 134,662 41,821 176,483 110,302 66,181 2 or 34,649 shares Mark Whiteling 90,730 28,177 118,907 76,440 42,467 2 or 22,233 shares 1 The actual operating profit figure used for the purposes of the annual bonus is that at the budget exchange rates in effect at the time the operating profit target was set in order to remove the effect of exchange rate movements from the outcome and therefore differs from the reported operating profit figure for 2014 15 which is arrived at using the average exchange rates for the year.
2 At a share price on grant of 191.0p.
78 Premier Farnell Annual Report on Remuneration continued How will the amount of the annual bonus be determined for 2015 16?
The Committee will operate a simplified annual bonus plan in 2015 16, under which the same maximum available opportunity, operating profit underpin and maximum 10% discretionary payment in the event that operating profit is not met will apply as for 2014 15 but of the total bonus opportunity in 2015 16: 70% will be payable based on Group operating profit: and 30% will be payable based on the achievement of personal objectives linked to the strategy.
A summary of the composition of the 2015 16 Bonus scheme can be seen in the table below.

What happened in relation to the LTIPs in 2014 15?
Awards maturing in 2014 15 The following awards were made to Laurence Bain in 2011, subject to the following performance targets, and were scheduled to vest in July 2014: Performance Performance Performance Performance Number of shares target for the PSP achieved in Number of shares target for the achieved in under the PSP pence 2013 14 pence under the ESOP ESOP 2013 14 EPS of 21.9 for Adjusted RoS of threshold vesting 12% for threshold Adjusted RoS of 1 Chief Executive 140,937 EPS of 14.3 157,765 and 25.8 for full vesting and 15% 9.6% vesting for full vesting 1 Awarded to Laurence Bain in July 2011 in his former role as Chief Operating Officer.
Awards made to Mark Whiteling in July 2011 lapsed when Mark left the Company in August 2011.
These awards therefore lapsed in full without vesting.
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 79 Awards granted in 2014 15 The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance conditions that apply to long-term incentives each year to ensure that they remain relevant and stretching.
Awards made in 2014 15 under the PSP and the ESOP are subject to the same two performance conditions, with one half of the award under each scheme subject to an EPS target expressed as a compound growth rate and the other half subject to an adjusted RoS performance measure.
The targets for awards made in 2014 15 are: CAGR in EPS EPS required in 2016 17 1 2014 15 2016 17 for vesting pence Vesting percentage 12% or more 20.1 or more 100% Between 20% and 100% Between 5% and 12% 16.6 to 20.1 on a straight-line basis Less than 5% Under 16.6 0% 1 The baseline against which growth in EPS over the three year performance period to 2016 17 is measured is EPS performance in 2013 14.
Adjusted return on sales in 2016 17 Vesting percentage 11.5% or more 100% Between 20% and 100% Between 9.5% and 11.5% on a straight-line basis Less than 9.5% 0% Details of the awards made to Laurence and Mark during the year are set out in the table below.
The Committee exercised its discretion to allow dividend equivalents to accrue on PSP awards granted to Executive Directors in the year, to the extent that such awards vest.
If they do, dividend equivalents will accrue at the rate that dividends would have been paid on a number of shares equal to the vested shares during the period from grant to vesting and will be awarded as shares.
What long-term incentive awards were made to the Directors during 2014 15?
In 2014 15, awards were made to the Executives under the ESOP and PSP as follows audited : Percentage 1 Face value vesting at 2 percentage of Exercise price threshold Performance 3 4 Type of award No of shares Date of grant salary on grant pence performance period PSP 24 September 313,653 2014 15 to Laurence Bain Nil cost option 165,080 0 10% 2014 60% 2016 17 24 September 241,516 2014 15 to Mark Whiteling Nil cost option 127,113 0 10% 2014 60% 2016 17 ESOP Market value 24 September 522,756 2014 15 to Laurence Bain 275,134 190.00 10% option 2014 100% 2016 17 Market value 24 September 402,528 2014 15 to Mark Whiteling 211,856 190.00 10% option 2014 100% 2016 17 1 Face value is the maximum number of shares which will vest if all performance targets are achieved in full multiplied by the share price at grant being 190.0p per share for the PSP and ESOP.
Awards under the PSP and ESOP are made on the basis of the maximum percentage of salary specified.
2 This is the price to exercise the award.
This is different from the price at grant used to calculate face value for the PSP as this is a nil cost option.
3 Assuming that either the adjusted RoS or the EPS performance condition is met in respect of one half of an award and that the performance condition for the other half lapses.
4 Performance conditions for the PSP and ESOP awards are above.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to receive share awards.
80 Premier Farnell Annual Report on Remuneration continued What share awards were held by the Executive Directors at the end of the financial year?
The Executive Directors have share awards outstanding under the DSBP, ESOP, PSP and SAYE schemes as detailed below.
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 81 1 The market price of the Companys ordinary shares at 2 February 2014 was 217.5p.
The market price at 1 February 2015 was 169.0p both priced on the immediately preceding trading day, as the last day of each financial year fell on a Sunday.
The range during the year was 160.9p to 240.5p.
2 Save in the case of SAYE awards, this is the market price on the day prior to grant, being the price used to determine the number of shares under award.
For SAYE awards, this is the market price used to determine the discounted price at which the awards were offered to all eligible employees.
3 Awards under the ESOP and the PSP have performance conditions.
Awards under the DSBP and SAYE are dependent on the participant remaining employed by the Company for two and three years respectively from grant unless a good leaver and on the participant making the necessary contributions to the savings plan, in the case of the SAYE.
4 Outstanding awards under the ESOP are subject to the following performance conditions: Financial year awarded Performance period ends Performance condition and vesting scale % of award 2012 13 January 2015 Adjusted RoS: range from 12.0% to 15.0% 2013 14 January 2016 50% on Adjusted RoS: range from 10% to 12% 50% on CAGR in EPS: range from 5% to 12% 2014 15 January 2017 50% on Adjusted RoS: range from 9.5% to 11.5% 50% on CAGR in EPS: range from 5% to 12% 5 Outstanding awards under the PSP are subject to the following performance conditions: Financial year awarded Performance period ends Performance condition and vesting scale % of award 2012 13 January 2015 CAGR in EPS: range from 5% to 12% 2013 14 January 2016 50% on Adjusted RoS: range from 10% to 12% 50% on CAGR in EPS: range from 5% to 12% 2014 15 January 2017 50% on Adjusted RoS: range from 9.5% to 11.5% 50% on CAGR in EPS: range from 5% to 12% What is intended in relation to the LTIPs for 2015 16?
In 2015 16, awards will be made to Executive Directors under the PSP only at a value of 85% of base salary face value.
There will be two performance measures for each award.
To provide a clearer focus on growing profits, 70% of each award will be subject to a growth in EPS performance metric, measured over the three financial years to FY18.
The EPS range for the 2015 awards will require Compound Annual Growth Rate of 7% at threshold for 20% of maximum vesting and 14% at stretch performance for 100% vesting, with a straight-line interpolation between these two points.
The remaining 30% of each award will be subject to a second performance measure, aligned to the Groups strategic imperatives, which the Committee will determine prior to the grant of awards in September 2015.
Does the Company have a policy or issue guidelines on Directors shareholdings?
The Companys executive shareholding policy requires Executive Directors and the rest of the RemCo population to retain a number of shares equal to a percentage of the individuals annual base salary.
Only shares beneficially owned are taken into account for these purposes: vested but unexercised share awards are not included in calculating a holding.
Once achieved, the minimum level of shareholding is then to be maintained until the Executive leaves office.
Non-Executive Directors are not subject to the shareholding policy or other requirements to build up a holding of shares.
Laurence and Mark are each required to reach a shareholding with a value equal to their annual base salary.
The table below includes their current shareholdings and shows that, as at 1 February 2015, both Laurence and Mark have achieved the minimum level of holding.
It also shows the holdings of our Non-Executive Directors at the end of the year.
There were no changes to these holdings in the period from the year end to 24 April 2015 the nearest practical day prior to the publication of this report.

3 Shown at the year end only, as Dennis Millard retired from the Board on this date.
As employees and potential beneficiaries of the Trust, the Executive Directors are also deemed to be interested in 3,862,021 ordinary shares held by the Premier Farnell Executive Trust.
Neither they nor any other employee is expected to receive from the Trust a greater number of shares than he or she is entitled to on exercise of his or her awards under the Companys share plans.
How dilutive are the Companys share-based incentive schemes?
As at 1 February 2015, based on the number of awards outstanding under employee share plans to be satisfied using new issueshares: the number of new shares issued or to be issued under all share option plans over the last 10 years, including both executive and all-employee plans, totalled an amount equal to 3.87% of the Companys issued ordinary capital: the number of new shares issued or to be issued under all executive share option plans over the last 10 years totalled an amount equal to 3.25% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
These totals are well within the dilution limits of 10% and 5% respectively set by the Association of British Insurers and reflected in the rules of the Companys share plans.
Do the Executive Directors have other directorships?
Mark Whiteling stood down from his role as Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee of Future plc on 30 November 2014 and was appointed a Non-Executive Director at Hogg Robinson Group plc on 1 December 2014.
In line with the Companys Policy, Mark is entitled to retain the fees he receives from these appointments.

How much does the Company spend on pay compared with dividends?
The following table sets out the amounts spent in each of 2013 14 and 2014 15 on pay for all employees across the Group and on dividends in respect of the same period, together with the difference in spend between those years.

How much did your Chief Executive Officers pay change compared with pay for your other employees?
The table below shows the percentage change from 2013 14 to 2014 15 in the salary, benefits and annual bonus paid to the CEO and in those of the average comparable UK employee.
Comparable here means other employees who have been employed on a full-time basis in the UK throughout this two year period and who have not been on sick, maternity, paternity or other extended leave in that period: it excludes the CEOs salary, benefits and annual bonus.
This comparator group has been chosen because it provides a stable comparison and because the Company has not to date collated this information to this level of detail on its employees in other parts of the Group.
