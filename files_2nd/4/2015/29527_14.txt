The Group has set out a clear strategy with a comprehensive set of actions to improve returns.
We want to incentivise the new executive director team to deliver the new strategy.
It is also impractical to meet the new PRA regulatory requirements within theexisting policy.
As a consequence, we have reviewed our directors remuneration policy and intend to propose a new policy at our AGM in May2016.
The policy will increase simplicity, transparency and long-term focus in the structure of directors remuneration.
How does the new policy support the strategy?
The targets for both the annual incentive and the LTIP will be a combination of financial and strategic measures, linked to the new strategy.
This approach will ensure executive directors are incentivised to deliver the strategy both in the short-term and over the longer term.

Incentivises executive directors to deliver the new strategy and improve shareholder returns Overall variable remuneration opportunity remains unchanged at 200 per cent of fixed remuneration Increases long-term focus at least 60 per cent of variable remuneration subject to long-term performance measures Ensures the policy is in line with changing regulatory requirements Provides transparency to key decisions made by the Committee, including how annual incentives are determined using an annual scorecard and the vesting of LTIP awards based on three-year performance measures Performance assessed on both shortand long-term basis How will the policy be implemented?
Reflecting the Groups circumstances, the Committee will focus incentives on the LTIP over a multi-year period during the early years of the turnaround.
The LTIP opportunity will be higher in the early years of the policy and always higher than the annual incentive opportunity, i. e. 200 per cent of fixed remuneration in 2015, 160 per cent in 2016 and 120 per cent for 2017 onwards.
This approach ensures executive directors are incentivised to deliver the strategy and are aligned with long-term returns for shareholders, while allowing for the reintroduction of annual performance measures to ensure short-term performance is also robustly managed.
Annual incentive maximum LTIP LTIP maximum as percentage performance aspercentage Performance year of fixed period of fixed Comments 2015 2016-18 200% Creates strong initial incentive to align with timeframe of turnaround and reflects poor 2015 performance 2016 40% 2017-19 160% Reintroduces element of annual incentive but retains focus on long-term reward given stage in turnaround 2017 onwards 80% 2018-20 120% Revert to standard combination of annual and long-term financial and strategic goals What awards are being made now?
Given the Groups financial performance, the Committee decided that there would be no payment of annual incentives for 2015.
To incentivise the new executive director team and align them with the turnaround, the Committee recommended a 2016-18 LTIP award of 200 per cent of fixed remuneration under the proposed policy.
The LTIP will be a share award subject to forward-looking performance measures, measured over three years i. e. for May 2016 awards, performance will be measured over 2016-18 inclusive.
The vesting will be over seven years, 50 per cent after three years and the balance evenly over four to seven years.
Shares will be subject to a six-month holding period after vesting.

To support in-year incentivisation for the execution of the strategy, for 2016 the annual incentive will be reintroduced at a maximum of 40 per cent of fixed remuneration.
The LTIP opportunity will be a maximum of 160 per cent of fixed remuneration, granted in March 2017.
Following this, the normal implementation of the policy is expected to take effect from 2017 onwards, with the annual incentive opportunity a maximum of 80 per cent of fixed remuneration and the LTIP opportunity a maximum of 120 per cent of fixed remuneration.
Details of the annual incentive scorecard are set out on page 126.
For 2016, the annual incentive will be paid up front with 50 per cent paid in shares subject to a one-year holding period, and will be subject to claw-back for 10 years.

In light of the outcome of the vote on the directors remuneration policy at the AGM in May 2014, the Committee sought to address shareholders concerns in relation to that policy.
Their feedback was reflected in the Committees decisions in relation to how variable remuneration was delivered in 2014 and how the policy was operated in 2015.
For example, by introducing a new scorecard and increasing the proportion of variable remuneration subject to performance measures.
Since the AGM in May 2015, the Committee has continued to consult with shareholders representing over half of the share register, and meeting representative bodies and proxy voting bodies, with a view to introducing a new directors remuneration policy once the regulatory position was clearer.
Shareholders feedback has been reflected in the new remuneration policy, in particular by ensuring the variable remuneration structure is simpler and reflects long-term performance.
The Committee did not consult with employees when determining the directors remuneration policy.
The Committee reviews annually the remuneration trends across the Group, including the relationship between executive directors remuneration and the remuneration of other Group employees.
The Committee oversees the remuneration structures for material risk-takers and works with the Human Resources team to ensure consistency of approach throughout the Group and compliance with relevant legislation and regulation.

Determining whether a leaver is an eligible leaver under the Groups share plans ii.
Amending LTIP performance measures following a corporate event to ensure a fair and consistent assessment of performance iii.
Deciding whether to apply malus or claw-back to an award Where such discretion is applied this will, where appropriate, be explained in the next directors remuneration report.
Ability for Committee to amend the policy for emerging and future regulatory requirements The Committee also retains the discretion to make reasonable and proportionate changes to the remuneration policy if the Committee considers this appropriate in order to respond to changing legal or regulatory requirements or guidelines including but not limited to any PRA revisions to its remuneration rules and the EBAs remuneration guidelines.
This includes the ability to make administrative changes to benefit the operation of the remuneration policy and or to implement such changes ahead of any formal effective date, ensuring timely compliance.
Where proposed changes are considered by the Committee to be material, the Group will consult its major shareholders.
Any changes would be formally incorporated into the policy when it is next put to shareholders for approval.
110 Standard Chartered Annual Report 2015 Directors report Illustration of the application of the remuneration policy in respect of 2016 The charts below provide an illustration of the potential outcomes under the Groups proposed remuneration policy being put to shareholders for approval at the AGM in May 2016.
The charts show the outcomes that could result for each of the executive directors in three performance scenarios: minimum, target and maximum.
Benefits assumed as 2015 annualised figures.
Any actual fixed pay numbers in 2016 will be dependent on exchange rates, the cost of benefits and final pension valuation 2.
Minimum performance assumes no annual incentive is awarded or LTIP award is granted 3.
Target performance assumes annual incentive at 20 per cent of fixed pay and an LTIP award of 160 per cent of fixed pay is granted, of which 62.5 per cent vests other than to Mike Rees whose annual incentive is on a pro rata basis reflecting time due to be served as an executive director during 2016 and who will not be granted an LTIP award 4.
Maximum performance assumes annual incentive at 40 per cent of fixed pay and an LTIP award of 160 per cent of fixed pay is granted and vests in full other than to Mike Rees whose annual incentive is on a pro rata basis reflecting time due to be served as an executive director during 2016 and who will not be granted an LTIP award 5.
No share price growth has been assumed Remuneration approach on recruitment of an executive director The Groups approach to remuneration reflects the fact that many of its employees bring international experience and expertise and that the Group recruits from a global marketplace.
The Committees approach to recruitment is to pay competitive remuneration that reflects the Groups international nature and enables it to attract and retain candidates.
Any new executive directors remuneration package would include the same elements and be subject to the same maximums asthose of the existing executive directors, as summarised below.
Policy Details Salary Set to reflect the role and the skills and experience of the candidate Fixed pay allowance Up to 100 per cent of salary Benefits Dependent on circumstances but typically includes benefits allowance, car and driver orother car-related service, private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, lifeinsurance, financial advice and, for international hires, expatriate benefits Pension Up to 40 per cent of salary and subject to a review of market practice and the appropriate level for any new executive directors Variable remuneration Dependent on circumstances but no more than 200 per cent of fixed remuneration Buy-out awards The Committee may consider buying out forfeited remuneration and forfeited opportunities and or compensating for losses incurred as a result of joining the Group subject to proof of forfeiture or loss The value of any buy-out award will not exceed, in broad terms, the value of the remuneration forfeited Any award will be structured within the requirements of the applicable remuneration regulations, and will be no more generous overall than the remuneration forfeited in terms of the existence of performance measures, timing of vesting and form of delivery The value of buy-out awards is not included within the maximum variable remuneration level where it relates to forfeited remuneration from a previous role or employer Legacy matters Where a senior executive is promoted to the Board, his or her existing contractual commitments agreed prior to his or her appointment may still be honoured in accordance with the terms of the relevant commitment, including vesting of any pre-existing deferred orlong-term incentive awards 111 Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration policy Executive directors contracts and payments on loss of office or change of control The Groups approach to executive directors in respect of notice periods and payments on loss of office and change of control reflects market practice and is set out below.

114 Standard Chartered Annual Report 2015 Directors report Directors remuneration report 2015 report on remuneration 2015 Group total variable remuneration Determining 2015 discretionary annual incentives In determining 2015 annual incentives, the Committee considered the following factors: Recognition that the Groups financial performance in 2015 has been poor, and as a consequence the share price has suffered and the dividend cut.
In November 2015, the Group Chief Executive set out the Groups new strategy with the intention of addressing the declining performance.
The Group has taken a comprehensive range of actions including raising capital, reducing risk concentrations, managing expenses and laying out a business investment programme That the historical remuneration levels of the Group have generally been below competitive levels in the markets in which it operates and that this position has deteriorated further over the past few years.
This has in part contributed to a rise in the level of voluntary attrition to 16.7 per cent 2014: 15.1 per cent The need to reposition remuneration in the Group to contribute to improving shareholder returns, whilst enabling the Group toensure that good performers are paid competitively The material risk events that have impacted the Group in 2015 In determining the Groups total annual incentives, the Committee has had to use its judgement to establish the right balance between the financial performance of the Group and our ability to attract and retain talent that will drive the Groups new strategy.
On this basis, the Committee determined that the total annual incentives for continuing employees for 2015 should be $855 million, 22 per cent lower than in 2014, as shown below.
The Committee concluded that any lower amount would present a material risk to the ability of the Group to make appropriate and competitive awards.
The total annual incentives of the Group have steadily reduced over the past five years.
Incentive awards were also made to individuals who left the Group during 2015, as part of restructuring, who were in service foratleast nine months of the year, totalling $45 million.
Relative expenditure on pay and allocation of earnings When considering Group variable remuneration the Committee considers shareholders concerns about relative expenditure onpay and makes the determination on the allocation of earnings to expenditure on pay carefully.
The Committee concluded thatthe Group has approached this allocation in a disciplined way over the past five years.
Staff costs include redundancy and other restructuring expenses.
The Committee has included the amount of corporate tax, including the bank levy, because it is a significant payment and illustrates the Groups contribution through the tax system.
Executive directors variable remuneration awarded in respect of 2015 audited Approach to determining individual variable remuneration awards The Committees performance management framework was outlined in the 2014 directors remuneration report.
At its meetings inDecember 2015 and January 2016, the Committee considered Group performance, the performance of each executive director and risk and control-related matters with input from Group Risk and other control functions, and made its determinations.
The Committee followed a three-step process for determining annual incentive awards: Step 1: consider eligibility Step 2: evaluate performance against the Groups priorities Step 3: assess personal performance and finalise annual incentive and LTIP awards for each executive director 1.
Consider eligibility The Committee considered the Groups risk position and its forward-looking capital position, and concluded that it was appropriate to consider the granting of incentives.
Evaluate performance against the Groups priorities At the end of 2015, the Committee reviewed both financial performance and achievement against the Groups strategic priorities, as outlined at the start of the year in the 2015 annual incentive scorecard, published in last years remuneration report.
The Committees assessment of performance against the targets is disclosed in the table on page 117.
In relation to financial performance, the Committee concluded that the financial performance had been poor and did not meet the expectations set at the start of the year.
The Committee noted that progress had been made against the strategic aspirations and the other Group priorities.
However, in light of the Groups broader performance, the Committee concluded that it would not be appropriate to award annual incentives in 2015 to executive directors, but that there was a need to incentivise the new executive director team so LTIP awards should be granted, subject to shareholder approval of the proposed remuneration policy.

Assess personal performance and finalise awards The Committee noted the individual performance of each executive director and the performance in areas of personal responsibility, notwithstanding the decision to make no incentive awards.
The Committee noted that Bill Winters had made a good start to his role.
Since his appointment as Group Chief Executive in June, the Board had discussed and subsequently announced a new strategy that would result in significant changes in how the Group will bemanaged going forward.
The Committee also noted that he had come in during a challenging period and had been critical to developing a clear plan of action and forming a new Management Team.
The announcements in November would position the Group for improved RoE on a strengthened capital base.
The Committee agreed that, in his first full year with the Group, Andy Halford had made a significant contribution to prudent capital management, to the cost reduction programme and to the development of the new strategy of the Group.
Mike Rees has actively supported the work to refocus and transition the respective client and product groups under the new organisational model, making use of his knowledge of the Group and its markets.
The Committee noted that he had been an important advisor to Bill Winters and the rest of the Management Team.
He worked closely with Bill and Andy on the formulation and execution of the new strategy.
Former executive directors Under the terms of their leaving agreements, both Peter Sands and Jaspal Bindra were eligible to be considered for a discretionary variable remuneration award.
As the current executive directors would not be receiving any annual incentives, the Committee decided it would not be appropriate to make any awards to Peter and Jaspal.
In reviewing their performance, the Committee noted that both had supported the transition to the new organisation positively and were professional in terms of the handover totheir successors.
Under the terms of his leaving agreement, V Shankar was not eligible to be considered for a discretionary variable remuneration award.
Award of long-term incentives As outlined in the Chairs covering letter on page 100, to incentivise the new executive director team and align them with the turnaround, 2016-18 LTIP awards of up to 200 per cent of fixed remuneration are proposed under the remuneration policy being put to shareholders for approval at the AGM in May 2016, other than to Mike Rees who will be retiring from the Board on 30 April2016.
The following table summarises the outcome of the Committees decisions on annual incentive and LTIP awards for the 2015 performance year.

Normalised RoE will be based on profit attributed to ordinary shareholders, adjusted, on a tax-affected basis, for profits or losses of a capital nature, amounts consequent to investment transactions driven by strategic intent and infrequent exceptional transactions that are significant or material in the context of the Groups normal business earnings for the period.
This includes material one-off changes to valuation methodologies to align with market practice and restructuring charges.
Normalised RoE would normally exclude regulatory fines but, for remuneration purposes, this would be subject to review by the Remuneration Committee The measures have been chosen to align with the new strategy and in consultation with shareholders.
The equal weighting of the measures provides a balanced set of metrics, giving an appropriate focus on execution of the new strategy, investor interests and prudent risk-taking.
The target levels for LTIP awards are designed to be challenging but realistic.
The Committees starting point for determining target levels was to review the financial plan and the Groups strategic priorities.
As part of the remuneration policy review and setting of performance measures, the peer group used for the calculation of the relative TSR performance measure has been adjusted.
The criteria used to select the peer group are companies with generally comparable business activities, comparable size or geographic spread to Standard Chartered or companies Standard Chartered competes against for investor funds and talent.
In aggregate, the comparator group is intended to be representative of Standard Chartereds geographic presence and business operations.
The constituents of the peer group shall continue to be reviewed annually.
As a result of this review, the following changes were made to the peer group listed on page 122 : RBS and Unicredit were removed from the peer group ANZ which has growing presence in Asian markets and UBS which has significant Corporate & Institutional, Private and Wealth businesses were added 119 Directors remuneration report 2015 report on remuneration TSR will be measured for each company over the LTIP performance period, starting from the date of grant.
TSR will be calculated in British pounds and data averaged over a month at the start and end of the three-year performance period from the date ofgrant.
The current intention of the Committee is that the performance measures for LTIP awards in March 2017 will be similar to those awards to be granted in 2016.
However, the Committee will review the performance measures and targets again in advance ofmaking awards in 2017 in respect of 2016 performance, including an assessment against continued alignment with the Groupspriorities.
Single total figure of remuneration for the executive directors audited This table sets out salary, FPAs, benefits including pensions and one-off amounts such as buy-out awards received in 2015 and variable remuneration awards receivable in respect of 2015.
LTIP awards, granted in 2013 did not vest based on performance between 2013 and 2015.
Bill Winters joined the Group on 1 May 2015 and was appointed to the Board on 10 June 2015.
The figures above include his remuneration from 1 May 2015 2.
Peter Sands remuneration is up to 10 June 2015, the date he stepped down from the Board 3.
Jaspal Bindras and V Shankars remuneration is up to 30 April 2015, the date on which they stepped down from the Board 4.
Information on leavers remuneration arrangements since stepping down from the Board is included in the Payment for loss of office section on page 123 Additional information on the fixed pay allowance figure in the single total figure table audited FPAs are paid in shares, subject to a holding period and released over five years.
The number of shares allocated is determined based on the monetary value of the allowance and the prevailing market price of the Groups shares on the date of allocation.
FPAs are not variable remuneration, therefore, performance measures are not applicable.
Additional information on the benefits figure in the single total figure table audited All executive directors received private medical cover, life assurance, permanent health insurance, an allowance in respect of taxation advice and a car, and for some of the directors, the use of a company vehicle and driver for business purposes.
Some executive directors use a Group car service for travelling and had spouse travel expense benefits.
The Group paid the tax on thesebenefits.
The 2015 benefits figures shown are in respect of the 2014 15 tax year.
This provides consistency with the reporting of similar benefits in 2014.
In 2015, Jaspal Bindra and V Shankar received accommodation benefits of $256,241 and $178,730 respectively as they were undertaking responsibilities in an international location, and in line with market practice, received certain expatriate benefits.
Thebenefits figures for Jaspal Bindra and V Shankar have been restated from those shown in the 2014 directors remuneration report previously $933,511 and $645,414 respectively.
Additional information on the 2014 incentives in the single total figure table audited The annual incentive delivered to Andy Halford in respect of 2014 was delivered in shares.
This was split between upfront shares and deferred shares, the latter vesting over three years.
An LTIP award and underpin shares were also awarded.
Any value from these will be disclosed in the single figure disclosure for the year in which they vest.
120 Standard Chartered Annual Report 2015 Directors report Additional information on the vesting of long-term incentive plan awards in the single total figure table Audited The LTIP awards granted in March 2013 were due to vest in March 2016, based on performance over the years 2013 to 2015.
Performance measures were not met and so the awards lapsed.
The details are shown below.

Unaudited The average share price for the last three months of the 2014 financial year was used to determine the value of the LTIP awards granted in 2012 which vested based on performance to the end of 2014.
This has been restated from the figures shown in the 2014 directors remuneration report using the share price on the date of vesting of 13 March 2015 of 9.55.
Additional information on the buy-out award figure in the single total figure table audited Bill Winters received a buy-out award in respect of shares forfeited as a consequence of leaving his former role to join the Group.
The buy-out award takes the form of restricted shares with a face value of $9.93 million as at the date of grant 22 September 2015.
These shares will vest i. e. the restrictions will lift in three equal tranches in September 2017, 2018 and 2019, subject to continued employment with the Group.
Additional information on the pension figure in the single total figure table audited Mike Rees is, and Peter Sands was, contractually entitled to participate in a DB pension plan, with a headline entitlement of one-thirtieth of salary for each year of service.
The Committee continues to take into account the value of such benefits aspart oftotal remuneration.
As disclosed in the 2013 directors remuneration report, the increase in Mike Rees salary in April 2014, following his change in role, gave rise to a material one-off increase in his accrued pension benefit.
The 12-month averaging period for pensionable salary means that the increase in pension value will be reported over two years.
Accordingly, in the 2015 pension figure of $1.81 million, $1.07 million relates to the increase in pensionable salary.
The increase in Peter Sands pensionable salary in April 2014 gave rise to an increase of $148,991 in his accrued pension benefit in2015.
Jaspal Bindra previously participated in the DB pension plan but in 2013 he elected to give up his future pension accrual and replace it with an individually costed pension allowance of 49 per cent of salary, which was cost-neutral to the Group, and reflected the level of benefit given up.
Jaspals pension allowance was payable in cash.
Bill Winters received pension contributions and a cash allowance, which combined, equate to 40 per cent of his salary.
Andy Halford and V Shankar received cash allowances of 40 per cent of their salary.
Total pension entitlements audited The Groups approved DB pension plan is not open to new joiners but existing members continue to accrue additional rights.
Thisarrangement is supplemented by the Groups unfunded unapproved plan for longer-serving executive directors and senior employees.
Mike Rees and Peter Sands while he remained an employee continued to participate in both of these arrangements and their prospective DB entitlement as at 31 December 2015 are detailed below.
The retirement age forexecutive directors is 60, and if a director retires before this, pension benefits are reduced for early payment.

Inline with market practice and, as would be expected in the recruitment of a senior individual of this nature, the remuneration package included a buy-out of share interests foregone by Bill in order to take up employment with the Group.
The Committees approach in structuring the remuneration package, including the buy-out award, was to ensure that the structure was in accordance with the Groups policy on recruitment of an executive director.
Furthermore, the Committee ensured that careful judgement was applied on where to position the Group relative to international banking peers so that Bills remuneration was competitive, reflected his individual experience and was appropriate for such a role.
Each of the elements of Bills ongoing remuneration package are summarised in the table below, followed by a description of his buy-out award: Element Details Salary $1,757,335 Fixed pay allowances $1,757,335 paid in shares, released over five years Benefits Will be provided in accordance with the remuneration policy Pension 40 per cent of salary Variable remuneration Maximum variable remuneration opportunity of up to 200 per cent of fixed remuneration No provisions for any guaranteed annual incentive or guaranteed variable remuneration amount in respect of 2015 were included in Bills remuneration package The absence of any guaranteed variable remuneration amount has enabled the Committee to retain the flexibility on the determination of the amount and structure of variable remuneration payable to him for2015 On joining, Bill suffered an immediate loss in value by way of share interests foregone at his previous employer.
It was agreed thatBills entitlement to a buy-out award would be limited in his contract to the lower of: i an award with a maximum value of $9.93 million: and ii the value foregone at his previous employer.
The terms of his buy-out award were then determined following his appointment to the Board, giving careful consideration of the value foregone at his previous employer.
The Group undertook a thorough process to quantify the value of the share interests forfeited which determined that the value foregone was in excess of $9.93 million.
As such, the Committee approved a restricted share award of $9.93 million as at the date of grant 22 September 2015, the maximum agreed under the joining arrangements.
122 Standard Chartered Annual Report 2015 Directors report Although the value foregone by Bill was an actual immediate and measurable loss in value suffered by him, it was determined that the buy-out award would be granted in the form of restricted shares vesting in three equal portions after two, three and four years.
The restricted shares will lapse if Bill ceases employment with the Group prior to the relevant vesting dates other than in limited eligible leaver circumstances.
This approach provides alignment with shareholders and retention.
On the basis that no performance measures applied to the shares constituting the value foregone by Bill, no performance measures were attached to the vesting of the restricted shares.
As a result of the analysis carried out prior to the grant of the buy-out award, the Committee was satisfied that the buy-out award was significantly lower in value than the value of the share interests foregone at Bills previous employer.
Payments for loss of office audited Peter Sands, Jaspal Bindra and V Shankar stepped down from the Board during the year.

Some feedback related to comments on the design of the remuneration policy, rather than how the policy was operated.
Although shareholders and investor bodies have a range of views, there were some common themes, and the table below summarises the feedback received and the action taken to address this feedback in the proposed directors remuneration policy.
Feedback received Action taken The proportion of variable remuneration subject to stretching LTIP awards will comprise at least 120 per cent of fixed remuneration performance measures should be increased i. e. at least 60 per cent of the variable remuneration opportunity andwill be subject to stretching, long-term performance measures The variable remuneration structure is complex given the introduction Variable remuneration has been restructured, with a simpler split of underpin shares between an annual incentive and an LTIP award The underpin shares should have performance measures like the Underpin shares will no longer be delivered and the vesting of LTIP LTIP awards awards will be subject to stretching long-term performance measures The LTIP awards for eligible leavers should be prorated for time served On termination, eligible leavers LTIP awards granted from the AGM inMay 2016 will vest pro rata for time served during the period over which performance measures are measured How the remuneration policy will be implemented for executive directors in 2016 The table below summarises the remuneration policy for executive directors that is to be put to shareholders for approval at the AGM in May 2016 and how that policy will be implemented in 2016.

40 per cent of salary except for Mike Rees whose pension will be fully accrued in February 2016 Annual incentive For awards in respect of 2016, the maximum annual incentive opportunity will be 40 per cent of fixed pay defined as salary, FPA and pension.
The annual incentive awarded in respect of 2016 will be determined based on a balanced scorecard, shown on page 126 LTIP For awards in respect of 2016, the maximum LTIP opportunity will be 160 per cent of fixed pay defined as salary, FPA and pension.
The LTIP awarded in respect of 2016 will be made in 2017 and will vest subject toperformance measures determined by the Committee prior to grant 125 Directors remuneration report 2015 report on remuneration 2016 annual incentive scorecard The measures in the scorecard have been determined to be aligned with the Groups strategy and in consultation with shareholders.
The targets are set annually by the Committee and take into account the Groups annual financial plan and its priorities for the next few years within the context of the economic environment.
The Committee considers such targets to be commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Group to disclose them before the endof the financial year.
Targets will be disclosed in the 2016 directors remuneration report alongside the actual level of performanceachieved.
The Committee will review the scorecard annually and may vary the measures, weightings and targets each year.

For those employees with allowances withdrawn, fixed remuneration has been reviewed.
