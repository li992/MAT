C H AI R M AN S AN N U AL S TAT E M E N T Short-term incentives Phillip Colebatch, Remuneration These are used to incentivise performance against annual objectives Committee Chairman set by the Board for individual executive directors each year.
The maximum value which may be awarded under our short-term incentives, as approved at the 2015 AGM, is 300% of salary.
The annual objectives reflect the Boards view of the immediate operating imperatives which will help to build longer-term business growth.
In setting and reporting on these objectives, we are conscious of investor appetite for the adoption and disclosure of quantitative objectives against which shareholders can assess executive performance and the Committees reward decisions.
Mans two executive directors are responsible for the overall development of the business in terms of driving strategy, providing structure and leading culture.
Their objectives will, therefore, tend to be more qualitative and descriptive than quantitative.
While some of the CFOs objectives may lend themselves more to quantification in terms of the achievement of budgetary and other metrics, the CFO has a broad remit and works closely with the CEO on all major strategic and other key objectives.
It should also be noted that, when setting annual objectives, the Committee is keen to avoid any risk of duplicating the reward of achievement against the same quantitative measures of performance which are targeted under the Companys Deferred Executive Incentive Plan DEIP which is Dear Shareholder discussed below.
I am pleased to present our Directors Remuneration report for 2015 Long-term incentives which we will be submitting to shareholders for approval at our 2016 The DEIP incentivises long-term performance by delivering deferred share Annual General Meeting.
awards against a balanced scorecard of performance metrics which drive the achievement of long-term shareholder value.
80% of this scorecard 2015 remuneration policy increase in incentive limits is composed of the four quantitative KPIs which we use to measure At the 2015 AGM we obtained shareholder approval for an adjustment progress against our key business priorities as discussed on page 26 and to the executive incentive limits within our remuneration policy in order 27.
The remaining 20% relates to the development of management talent to increase the range of opportunity available to the Remuneration and business culture and its achievement is assessed by the Committee.
We consulted widely with our major The Board believes that together the DEIPs quantitative metrics create shareholders and with shareholder representative bodies before making a very broad and stretching incentive framework and that maintaining a this change and reduced the quantum of the initially contemplated high level of achievement against each individual metric consistently over increase in the limits in response to their feedback.
The structure of our the three-year performance period represents a considerable challenge.

The purpose of the change An important point to note is that, once the percentage of bonus earned was to provide the flexibility required to recognise and reward, if and under the DEIP metrics is established, the Committee then considers when appropriate, any future strong levels of executive performance.
and has full discretion to decide, within the shareholder approved limits, Without this flexibility, the Board was concerned that it might not be able the multiple of salary to which that percentage should be applied.
It to award compensation which was commensurate with any such higher should be stressed that this discretion is downward only i. e. the multiple performance and was competitive in the market place within which the determined cannot exceed the maximum 525% of salary approved Company operates.
It will continue to apply the same challenge and by shareholders at the 2015 AGM.
In considering this multiple, the rigour in its assessment of executive performance and reward as it has Committee takes account of any performance issues not reflected in the demonstrated in the past.

This provides the context for the award decisions made by the Committee in respect of executive performance The Committee considers that this structure is superior to the more during 2015 which are discussed later in this report.

In the case of the annual bonus determined under the short-term incentives, the Committee also only has discretion to make downward adjustments below the maximum multiple approved in the remuneration policy.

The ultimate value of the thinking.
In discussing our remuneration policy, we emphasised that the award to the director at the time of eventual vesting will be aligned with increase in the incentive limits should be seen only as an enabler for the shareholder return and experience in the intervening period.
The structure award of higher compensation should the Committee consider that the of the DEIP thus creates a long-term performance and holding time level of performance warranted its use.
Shareholders will continue to have horizon of six to eight years in line with Investment Association principles the opportunity to judge and express their views on the Committees and institutional shareholder expectations.
In addition, the balance of application of those limits in their vote on the Remuneration report each our short-term and long-term incentives means that executive reward is year.
We pointed out that even with the increase in incentive limits, the very much weighted, in terms of opportunity, towards long-term deferred combined short and long-term opportunity available to our executives share value.
in terms of multiple of salary remains below the median offered by the Companys UK and US listed peer group.
We also noted that incentives Malus and clawback for private market managers and many US listed asset managers, against The structure and quantum of opportunity provided by the DEIP have which the Company regularly competes for talent, are uncapped.

For example, an annual directors concluded that they would not utilise any of the additional award of 50% of the DEIP maximum on average would lead to a value of flexibility to award higher multiples of salary in the 2015 compensation 10.5 times salary being at risk and subject to malus at any given time.
During the year, the Committee considered how the potential for During our discussions with shareholder representative bodies, it was clawback of annual bonus awards and vested DEIP deferred awards clear that there was some interest in understanding the peer groups might most effectively and equitably be introduced into our remuneration that Man considers potentially relevant to compensation matters.

In complete with awards in 2015 being based upon the performance for applying its judgement, the Board considers all aspects of the proposed 2013, 2014 and 2015.
All future years of the DEIPs operation will measure compensation of the executive directors and all members of the senior performance over three years.
This includes an overall view on Mans business performance and positioning for the future, the environment in which that In the three-year period from 2013 to 2015, the senior management team performance was achieved, internal relativities, retention issues and, with led by Mans two executive directors has made significant progress in the help of our remuneration consultants, consideration of compensation restructuring the organisation, replacing staff where needed, recruiting at selected peers and competitors, as detailed elsewhere in this report.

Annual bonus awards The combination of the quantitative and qualitative performance criteria Manny Roman resulted in a performance achievement of 47.5%.
Having arrived at this Mannys achievements against the objectives set by the Board at the percentage achievement, the Committee has full discretion to apply this beginning of the year are set out in detail in Table R3 on page 71.

lowest both in the peer groups generally and, importantly, relative to peer performance.
Whilst Mannys base salary is above that of a number of Phillip Colebatch CEOs in the peer groups, he is also already a very significant shareholder Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in the Company.
Accordingly, the Committee concluded that the most effective way to recognise Mannys low relative total compensation in relation to performance and his very significant personal contribution was to award Manny a 10% salary increase effective 1 January 2016.
Jonathan Sorrell Jonathans objectives and the details of his achievements are set out in Table R4 on page 72.
Jonathan achieved all objectives set for him at the beginning of the year.
Our overall conclusion, supported by shareholder feedback, is that Jonathan had a further excellent year as CFO.
Nevertheless, the Committee did not feel it to be appropriate to award an annual bonus of the maximum multiple and awarded him a bonus of 250% of salary, 83.3% of the maximum available.
The award of the same percentage of maximum as the CEO reflects a similar strong level of individual performance and their work together as a team in driving the business.

Tables R5 to R7 show the result of this assessment for the awards to be granted in 2016.
For the financial metrics, performance is measured against Mans financial KPIs for each of the three preceding reporting years 2013, 2014 and 2015 and then averaged.
Additional information on Mans financial KPIs is set out on page 27.

The crisis had a significant impact on the hedge fund industry, including Man.
Man responded to this by analysing its strategy, its cost base, its product platform, its geographic footprint and its people and it was clear to the Board that material changes were required across all these dimensions.
A new CEO and CFO were appointed in 2013 and 2012 respectively and charged with clearly defining the strategic plan, its implications across product, geography, senior management, talent and culture and with implementing the necessary changes.
Man has just completed the first three full years, 2013-15 inclusive, in the tenure of that new CEO and CFO.
Over that three year period, Mans two executive directors, working as a team, have: 1.
Redefined Mans desired product platform.
Where necessary, changed elements of the existing Man product platforms, including changes to the leadership of those platforms.
Instituted a strong culture of individual ethics and risk management in which control functions are empowered and respected.
Progressively changed the organisational structure to align with the strategic direction.
Analysed Mans geographic footprint and changed where necessary the products, services and management of Mans overseas offices.
Built a new senior management team from both internal talent and with external hires.
Made a number of key hires into leadership positions on product platforms, sales organisations and general management.
Redefined Mans culture, integrated the acquired organisations and newly hired talent and promulgated that desired culture in to these new arrivals to Man.
Put significant new momentum behind developing key staff, both at senior levels as potential successors to the senior management team and at entry level to provide a talent pipeline for the future.
Increased diversity through a number of initiatives including new recruitment practices, apprenticeships, support networks and collaboration with external organisations who source diverse talent.
Culture, talent and diversity are continuing tasks.
Over the last three years, Mans two executive directors and the senior management team have built a very solid foundation on which to continue building these key elements of the organisation.

Conditional share awards granted under the Deferred Bonus Share and Option Plan DBSOP to former directors Peter Clarke and Kevin Hayes, as reported under Table R19 in the annual report on remuneration for the financial year ended 31 December 2013, vested on 12 March 2015.
Consequently, Peter Clarke received a transfer of 879,683 shares and Kevin Hayes received a transfer of 293,223 shares which numbers include shares representing dividend accrual over the vesting period.
During the year, the DBSOP option granted to Peter Clarke in 2011 over 3,629,238 shares and the DBSOP option granted to Kevin Hayes in 2011 over 777,693 shares each lapsed.
Consequently, there are no outstanding options or awards held by Kevin Hayes, and only the DBSOP options granted to Peter Clarke in 2010 and 2012 as reported under Table R19 in the annual report on remuneration for the financial year ended 31 December 2013 remain outstanding.
As each of these options is now currently exercisable, no further disclosure in respect of these options will be made until such time as the options are exercised or lapse.

Mannys salary has not changed since he joined the firm over five years ago.
As evidenced by Mans relative and absolute TSR, since Manny was appointed CEO three years ago see graph in table R12b, the Company has performed well and the management team he has led has transformed the business.
A review by the Committee shows that Mannys total compensation is one of the lowest in the UK and US listed peer group.
Manny is already a very significant shareholder in the Company.
Accordingly, the Committee concluded that the most effective way to recognise Mannys personal contribution, his low relative total compensation in relation to performance and the fact that his salary had not been adjusted for over five years was to award Manny a 10% salary increase.
The Committee has therefore recommended and the Board has agreed that Mannys salary be increased from $1,000,000 to $1,100,000 per annum with effect from 1 January 2016.

Executive directors remuneration policy Aligning the interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders and with Man Groups strategic goals is central to Man Groups remuneration policy.
In line with shareholders interests being managed within a robust governance framework, the Company aims to retain and incentivise high calibre executive directors by paying competitive base salary and benefits, together with a short-term annual bonus and a long-term deferred bonus linked to: profits and contribution: the achievement of individual objectives which are consistent with the strategy of the Company and building sustainable profitability: the achievement of long-term strategic KPIs in line with the long-term focus of the Company: the creation of long-term shareholder value: ongoing oversight of a robust risk management framework: maintenance of strong capital and liquidity positions: and addition of senior talent, building succession for leadership and setting a strong governance structure for the Boards delegated authorities.
This section of the report sets out the remuneration policy for executive and non-executive directors which shareholders approved at and which was effective from the 2015 AGM, on 8 May 2015.
The remuneration policy has been included in this Annual Report in full using updated data in the scenario charts to provide the context within which the Committee has conducted its work during the year and has been updated for the inclusion of clawback provisions in respect of incentive awards.

Notes to the policy table: In implementing the above remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee shall have regard to all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the UKLA Listing Rules, the Financial Conduct Authority Remuneration Code of practice on remuneration policies, the AIFM Remuneration Code, and to leading investor representative body guidelines including the Investment Association, ISS and the PLSA.
Please note that any commitments made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy approved by shareholders will be honoured.
In addition to the elements of remuneration detailed in the policy table, the Remuneration Committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a different structure in order to facilitate the recruitment of an individual, exercising the discretion available under the UKLA Listing Rules see details in the paragraph Approach to recruitment remuneration.

The long-term performance metrics are in line with the long-term strategic focus of the Company and will be reviewed as required in line with any changes in strategic direction.
3.3 Differences between executive directors and employees remuneration Executive Committee members are eligible to participate in the Executive Incentive Plan alongside executive directors to align the remuneration of the most senior management.
However, in line with market practice in alternative investment funds, their incentive payouts are uncapped.
Employee remuneration includes base salary, benefits, an annual performance bonus and, for senior contributors, long-term share and fund-based deferrals.
The level of deferral increases as total compensation increases.
This provides alignment with shareholders and the future performance of the Company and with the interests of investors in funds managed by the Company.
Sales staff have a specific bonus scheme to reinforce asset gathering and retention whilst aligning interests on costs.
3.4 Shareholding guidelines In order to align the interests of executive directors and shareholders, Man Group requires its executive directors to maintain a proportion of Man Group shares calculated with reference to their base salary.
The Chief Executive Officer is required to maintain a shareholding of 200% of base salary.
Other executive directors are required to maintain a shareholding of 100% of base salary.
Executive directors are required to build up this shareholding on joining the Board and after a reduction in share price.
Incumbents will build up to the prescribed shareholdings with post-tax vested shares where not already at or above this level.
In addition, as explained in Table R23, the long-term deferred bonus element of the Executive Incentive Plan has been designed so that executive directors have the potential to build up over time a significant holding of unvested shares, subject to ongoing service, which are fully aligned with shareholder experience and value.
However, these shares are not taken into account in the calculation of the level of directors holdings measured against our shareholding guidelines which require the holding of totally unrestricted and disposable shares.
3.5 Non-executive directors remuneration policy Non-executive directors have formal letters of appointment.
These do not contain any notice provisions or provision for compensation in the event of early termination.
The current Chairman has a contract with the Company which provides that his appointment as Chairman is terminable on three months notice: there are no notice provisions relating to his appointment as a director.
The incoming Chairman has a contract with the Company which provides that his appointment is terminable on six months notice.
The Boards policy is to appoint non-executive directors for an initial threeyear term, subject to retirement and reappointment by shareholders annually at the AGM, which may be followed by a further three years by mutual agreement.
Any further extension will be subject to rigorous review.
The initial dates of appointment of the non-executive directors to the Board are shown on pages 46 and 48 of this 2015 Annual Report, and their current fee levels are provided in the Directors remuneration report on page 81.
Non-executive directors are also encouraged to build a shareholding in the Company.
Details of the policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below.

They do not participate in any share option or share incentive plans.

Projected pay under three performance scenarios $000 Table R25 Projected pay under three performance scenarios $000 Maximum 13% 34% 53% $9,753 CEO Mid-point 24% 30% 46% $5,537 Minimum 100% $1,320 13% Maximum 13% 34% 53% $6,650 CFO Mid-point 24% 30% 46% $3,775 Minimum 100% $900 13% n Salary & benets n Annual cash EIP n Long-term EIP Assumptions used: The minimum scenario reflects base salary, pension and benefits as disclosed in the Single Figure of Total Remuneration i. e. fixed remuneration which are the only elements of the executive directors remuneration packages not linked to performance during the year under review.
The mid-point scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus a bonus payout of 150% of salary for the short-term award being half of the maximum short-term award and a deferred bonus award of 233.5% of salary being half of the maximum deferred award.
The maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus a full bonus payout of the maximum of 300% of salary for the short-term annual cash bonus award and the maximum of 467% of salary for the deferred bonus award.
The illustrations are based on initial award value and do not, therefore, reflect potential share price appreciation or any dividends received over the deferral periods.

indb 85 24 02 2016 18:04 D I R E C T O R S R E M U N E R AT I O N R E PO R T C O NTI N U E D 3.7 Approach to recruitment remuneration continued In determining the appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both Man Group and its shareholders.
With respect to a new appointment the Remuneration Committee may buy out incentive arrangements, including bonuses, forgone on leaving a previous employer, and awards made under such buy out arrangements may be in addition to the remuneration outlined in the table above.
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to those incentive arrangements and the likelihood of those conditions being met.
In defining the size of this buy out award, the Remuneration Committee would ensure that its fair value is no higher than the fair value of the incentive arrangements forgone.
The Remuneration Committee may also consider it appropriate to structure any such buy out award differently to the structure described in the policy table including whether appropriate performance conditions should apply, exercising the discretion available under the UKLA Listing Rules.
The Remuneration Committee does not intend that such buy out awards will be made as a matter of routine: on the contrary, although the Remuneration Committee cannot anticipate every circumstance which it might face in the future, it is expected that any such awards made under the UKLA Listing Rules will only be contemplated in exceptional circumstances, will be reviewed and approved by the full Board and described fully in the subsequent years Directors remuneration report.
Internal appointment For the appointment of a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the Remuneration Committees approach will be consistent with the policy for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the Board, the Company will continue to honour these commitments.
3.8 Non-executive directors When recruiting a new non-executive director, the Board will utilise the policy as set out in Table R24 on page 84.
A base fee in line with the prevailing fee schedule would be payable for Board membership, with additional fees payable for acting as Senior Independent Director or as a member or Chairman of a Board Committee.
3.9 Service contracts and exit payment policy Service contracts Table R27 Element Condition Contract dates Jonathan Sorrell: 28 September 2012 Emmanuel Roman: 7 February 2013 Current appointment No fixed term Notice period by either Company Emmanuel Roman: 12 months ordirector Jonathan Sorrell: 6 months The Companys policy is that notice periods will not exceed 12 months Contractual entitlement to fixed bonus None or share-based incentive Provisions for contract termination Under both contracts the Company can opt to terminate immediately by making a payment in lieu of the notice period or part of it.
Emmanuel Romans contract requires payment of base salary only in lieu.
Jonathan Sorrells contract requires payment of base salary plus the value of pension contributions or alternative cash allowance and certain other insured benefits in lieu.
Payments in lieu are to be made in monthly instalments unless the Company and the executive director agree otherwise.
Unless the Company decides otherwise both executive directors have a duty to mitigate their losses arising from termination of their employment: any replacement earnings earned in what would otherwise have been the notice period will reduce the obligation on the Company to make payments in lieu.
Short-term annual cash bonus The service contracts do not oblige the Company to pay any cash bonus to executive directors and bonuses are awarded at the Boards discretion following a recommendation from the Remuneration Committee.
Payment of any cash bonus is conditional upon the executive director being in employment and not under notice at the payment date.
Long-term deferred bonus and The treatment of deferred bonuses and other long-term awards is governed by the relevant Plan rules as other awards explained below.
86 Man Group plc Annual Report 2015 23978 Man AR15.
indb 86 24 02 2016 18:04 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 3.9 Service contracts and exit payment policy continued To protect Man Groups business interests the executive directors service contracts contain covenants which restrict the executives ability to solicit or deal with clients and their ability to solicit senior employees.
Emmanuel Roman has also entered into a broader non-compete covenant for an agreed period post termination.
Further, the Board has the right, at its discretion, to require Jonathan Sorrell to comply with a broader non-compete covenant for up to six months post termination to provide additional protection for the Company.
If the Board exercises this right, the Company will pay an additional amount up to six months base salary and the value of pension contributions or alternative cash allowance and certain other insured benefits so that he is not left without income during the time when the Board wishes the non-compete to operate.
This amount is paid in two equal instalments and is reduced by any payments made in lieu of notice.
Executive directors service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.
When considering exit payments, the Remuneration Committee reviews all outstanding incentive awards and assesses outcomes that are fair to both shareholders and participants.
The table below summarises how long-term deferred awards are typically treated in specific circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the Remuneration Committees discretion.
Long-term deferred bonus and other share awards Table R28 Reason for leaving Timing of vesting Calculation of vesting payment 1 Good leaver Follows normal vesting schedule except in the Awards vest on a time pro rata basis under the case of death where the Remuneration Committee long-term deferred bonus of the Executive Incentive may allow early vesting.
No time pro-rating applies under the Deferred 2 Bonus Share and Option Plan.
Any other reason All awards lapse.
Notes: 1 Good leaver reasons include death, retirement, ill-health, injury or disability, redundancy, sale of the company or business in which the individual was employed, leaving with agreement of the Company if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that an orderly handover has been organised and performed.
The Remuneration Committee may also decide, in its discretion, to grant good leaver status in other exceptional circumstances and will take into account the reason for leaving and the executive directors performance up to the date employment ceases.
2 Jonathan Sorrell was granted a conditional share award under the Deferred Bonus Share and Option Plan in March 2013.
3.10 External appointments With the approval of the Board in each case, and subject to the overriding requirements of the Company, executive directors may accept a limited number of external appointments as non-executive directors of other companies and retain any fees received.
Details of external directorships held by executive directors, including associated fees, are provided in the Directors remuneration report for the relevant year.
3.11 Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company In assessing executive director remuneration, internal relativities within the Company are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee.
These internal reviews cover the individual elements of base salaries, benefits and total compensation.
3.12 Consideration of shareholder views The Remuneration Committee takes into account shareholder views received in relation to remuneration resolutions to be considered at the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more broadly.
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback an important input when forming remuneration policy and regularly reviews Man Groups remuneration policy against the guidelines of key institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
The above remuneration policy was discussed with a number of Man Groups major shareholders and certain shareholder voting bodies in early 2015 and reflects the views expressed in that consultation.
