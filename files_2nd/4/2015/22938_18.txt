Directors remuneration report since IPO and RoTE performance in 2013 and 2014.
Since November 2012, grants under the LTIP have been made approximately every six months.
As disclosed last year, the Group achieved an average RoTE of 16.4% over the two-year performance period in 2013 and 2014 which resulted in 82% of the maximum potential vesting of the RoTE element, which comprises 60% of the total award.
A strong share price performance in the three years from Admission, together with dividend payments during the period, resulted in a TSR of 135.1% for the three-year TSR performance period and positioned the Group above the upper quintile compared to companies in the FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts.
This resulted in 100% of the maximum potential vesting under the TSR element, which comprises 40% of the total award.
Overall, 89.2% of the total award vested in November 2015, which is a good level of achievement and is reflective of the business performance and returns to shareholders over the Priscilla Vacassin same period.
Chair of the Remuneration Committee Awards under the LTIP granted in March and August 2013 Dear shareholder are due to vest during 2016.
The RoTE performance period As Chair of the Remuneration Committee the Committee for these awards ended on 31 December 2015 and, subject I am pleased to introduce our report on Directors remuneration to the Committees satisfaction that the financial and risk for the 2015 financial year.
We have set out this report in the underpins have been met at the end of the vesting period, following sections: awards under the RoTE element are due to vest at 94% of the maximum potential, again reflecting the returns delivered Section Pages to shareholders.
Executive remuneration snapshot summarising the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors 72 to 73 We have included these vesting outcomes in the single Annual report on remuneration covering how the remuneration figure for both Executive Directors, details of Group will implement its remuneration policy in which you can find on page 77.

Linking remuneration to performance pay outcomes Pay approach for 2016 for 2015 Our remuneration policy has worked well since its approval As highlighted in the Board Chairmans letter on pages 10 to by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and is still aligned with 11, 2015 has marked another good performance year for the our key strategic priorities.
As such, we will not change the Group with operating profit from ongoing operations ahead approved policy this year.
However, we intend to review of target, despite higher than normal claims costs from major this in 2016 and we will propose a policy for shareholders weather events.
The incentive outcomes for our Executive to approve at the 2017 AGM.
Directors as set out in the annual report on remuneration reflect this level of performance.
Here are the highlights of our approach to pay for the Executive Directors in 2016: We base bonuses under the AIP on performance against key financial, strategic and personal measures.
We awarded The salaries of both Executive Directors will increase by bonuses of 83% of the maximum to the Chief Executive Officer 2.5% in April 2016, a lower increase compared to the and 86% of the maximum to the Chief Financial Officer for average increase to employees across the Group generally 2015.
This reflects achievement of operating profit from Our overall approach to measuring performance under the ongoing operations ahead of the target set under the AIP, AIP in 2016 will be broadly similar to our approach in strong progress made on customer experience metrics, as 2014 and 2015.
We will continue measuring performance evidenced by improved Net Promoter Scores in Personal Lines using financial, strategic and personal targets and the and highlighted in the Group highlights section of the Annual Committee will also use its broader judgement to carefully Report on page 2, and achievement against personal assess payouts.
From 2016, to better align AIP outcomes objectives.
We have provided enhanced disclosure this year with shareholders experience, we will assess financial relating to the AIP outcome for 2015.

At the same time, we will increase the range of the specific customer measures taken into account in order to better reflect the focus of the business in the upcoming year We are not proposing to change the performance conditions for 2016 awards under the LTIP.
The Committee has considered the current targets, and has determined that the levels of TSR performance upper quintile and RoTE performance required for full vesting, as increased in 2015, remain stretching Separately to the executive share plans, we believe it is important for all our employees to have the opportunity to become shareholders in the Company.
We run a Buy-As-YouEarn Share Incentive Plan the SIP which allows employees to receive one matching share for every two shares they purchase.
In addition, to recognise the continued contribution of our employees to the success of our business, we will be granting a further free share award of around 250 to each eligible employee during March 2016.
This award will be the third offer of free shares to employees since the IPO.
Voting on the annual remuneration report As we are not making any changes to our policy, the policy report will not be put to shareholders until the 2017 AGM.
Therefore, the annual report on remuneration will be the only report that we put to an advisory shareholder vote at the AGM on 12 May 2016.
I hope you find this report informative and I welcome any comments you may have.
Finally, on a personal note, this will be my last report as Chair of the Committee as I step down from the Board on 1 March.
I hope that you will agree that the work of the Committee, which I have chaired since IPO, has struck an appropriate balance and served well the interests of shareholders.
I know that my successor, Clare Thompson, will continue to do so.

Achievement under the AIP The actual payouts from the AIP this year reflect performance in 2015, with operating profit from ongoing operations ahead of the target set under the AIP, the progress made towards achieving our strategic objectives and the Executives achievement of personal and shared goals.
Further details of the assessment of performance against the targets are provided on page 78.

The value of the award on vesting, as illustrated below, reflects the significant value generated for shareholders through share price growth and dividends over the three-year period.
The value of these awards has been captured across both 2014 and 2015 single figures for the RoTE and TSR elements respectively on page 77 of the implementation report.
The total value of the award vesting at the end of the three-year performance period in November 2015, inclusive of shares vesting under both the RoTE and TSR elements, was 1,706,857 to Paul Geddes and 1,033,095 to John Reizenstein.

Committee Chair Priscilla Vacassin Non-Executive Directors Mike Biggs Sebastian James Andrew Palmer Advisers to the Committee The Committee consults with the Chief Executive Officer, the Human Resources Director, and senior representatives of the HR, Risk and Finance functions on matters relating to the appropriateness of all remuneration elements for Executive Directors and Executive Committee members.
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and the Human Resources Director are not present when their remuneration is discussed.
The Committee works closely with the Chairs of the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, including receiving reports from those Chairs regarding the setting of targets and payouts under incentive plans and whether it is appropriate to operate malus and clawback.
The Chair of the Audit Committee is a member of the Remuneration Committee: and the Chair of the Board Risk Committee attended Remuneration Committee meetings on three occasions.
The Committee retains FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP FIT as its independent adviser.
FIT is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Groups Code of Conduct.
The Committee appointed FIT when preparing for the IPO and after considering the firms experience in this sector.
During the year, FIT advised on market practice, corporate governance, incentive plan design and target setting, regulations, and other matters that the Committee was considering.
FIT does not provide the Company with any other services.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice FIT provides is objective and independent.
FITs total fees for remuneration related advice in 2015 were 117,406 exclusive of VAT.
FIT charged its fees based on its standard terms of business for providing advice.
Allen & Overy LLP, one of the Groups legal advisers, also provided legal advice relating to the Groups executive remuneration arrangements.

It also reviewed the overall framework's operation to make sure it is still fit for purpose.
The review concluded that, whilst the framework successfully linked Executive Directors' variable pay with the Group's performance, in order to further align the Executive Directors interests with those of shareholders and the objectives of the business, the Committee would implement the following changes in 2016: To further align Executive Directors with shareholders, profit before tax will replace ongoing operating profit as the primary financial measure and will account for 55% of the total AIP outcome, increased from 50% As a result of measuring profit before tax, the Committee decided it was no longer necessary to apply a specific weighting to other profit & loss items not reflected in the definition of ongoing operating profit and the allocation of a specific weighting to this element will, therefore, be removed.
The Committee will instead consider this in determining the overall level of payouts in its exercise of judgement The weighting allocated to the basket of customer measures will be increased from 20% to 25% in line with the Companys strategic objectives Measures Weighting for 2016 Weighting for 2015 Financial Profit before tax 2015: ongoing operating profit 55% 50% Other financial measures not reflected in the definition of ongoing operating profit, primarily the performance of the Run-off segment and restructuring costs 0% 10% Strategic Based on a basket of customer measures, including Net Promoter Score and complaints 25% 20% Personal Objectives for each Executive Director, including shared objectives across the Executive Committee 20% 20% Like previous years, all AIP outcomes will be determined after the Committee determines a payment gateway.
To do this, the Committee must be satisfied that it is appropriate to permit a bonus award at all, or at a given level.
The gateway involves some subjectivity about performance.
This may result in positive or negative moderation of each AIP performance measure or the overall bonus outcome.
The list below sets out the gateway criteria for the AIP for 2016.
There are more criteria than previously.
This ensures the Committee considers a broader range of criteria when judging the level of AIP payments.
Gateway criteria for the Annual Incentive Plan for 2016 outcomes for Executive Directors Year-on-year changes in profit before tax Quality and sustainability of earnings, referring to reserving, gross written premium, costs and loss ratio, and relevant lead indicators Additional customer context, for example, conduct, experience, brand and franchise health Capital strength and affordability Risk management within risk appetite The Groups relative performance to that of its peers The wider economic environment Exceptional events, such as abnormal weather Any regulatory breaches and or reputational damage to the Group Committee satisfaction that paying the bonus does not cause major reputational concerns The Committee may also use its discretion to account for additional factors.
These include the quality of financial results: the direction of travel of all measures: more widely considering reputation, risk, and audit.
In considering such factors, and whether to adjust the overall payouts and or operate malus and clawback, the Committee receives appropriate input from the Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee through receiving reports from and discussion with the Chairs of those Committees.
Performance conditions for LTIP awards LTIP awards granted in 2016 will continue to be subject to performance against these performance conditions: 60% based on RoTE over a three-year performance period 2016, 2017 and 2018 40% based on relative TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts over a three-year performance period, starting on the date of grant.
The starting and closing TSR will be averaged over a three-month period www.
com 75 Directors remuneration report continued For these purposes, we use the Groups standard definition for RoTE, subject to such other adjustments as the Committee may consider appropriate.
To find out more about how we calculate RoTE, see page 175.
The Committee reviewed the performance targets and, in line with its commitment to ensure that awards to Executive Directors would only be payable if significant value has been created for shareholders, decided that there should be no change to targets for 2016 as they remain appropriately stretching following their increase in 2015.
Performance required for threshold vesting Performance required for maximum vesting Vesting for threshold Awards in 2015 Awards in 2013 Awards in 2015 Awards in 2013 Performance measure performance and 2016 and 2014 and 2016 and 2014 Average annual Average annual Average annual Average annual 20% of this element RoTE performance of RoTE performance of RoTE performance of RoTE performance of RoTE of the award 14.5% 14.0% 17.5% 17.0% 20% of this element Relative TSR of the award Median Upper quintile For the TSR element, there is a straight-line interpolation between threshold and maximum performance, on a ranked basis.
For the RoTE element, 40% of the award will vest for RoTE of 15.5% for awards to be made in 2016 which remains unchanged from 2015.
Otherwise, vesting is similar to TSR: a straight-line interpolation occurs from threshold to target, then from target to maximum performance.
The LTIP awards will also vest only to the extent that the Committee is satisfied that the outcome of the TSR and RoTE performance conditions reflects the Groups underlying financial performance from the date of grant until vesting.
When considering these matters, the Committee will also deliberate on whether there have been any material risk failings.
Pension and benefits A pension contribution of 25% of base salary will continue to be paid to both Executive Directors in 2016.
Benefits comprise providing a company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, life assurance, income protection and health screening.
Like all employees, the Executive Directors are also eligible for certain discounted Group products.
Non-Executive Directors fees The current fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors were set in 2012 and have not changed since.
Fees for 2016 Position 000 Board Chairman fee 400 Basic Non-Executive Director fee 70 Additional fees Senior Independent Director fee 30 Chair of Audit, Board Risk and Remuneration Committees 30 Chair of CSR Committee 10 Member of Board Committee Audit, Board Risk or Remuneration 10 Member of Board Committee CSR or Nomination 5 No additional fees are paid for membership or chairmanship of the Investment Committee.
External directorships The Company encourages Executive Directors to accept, subject to the Chairman's approval, an invitation to join another company's board outside the Group in a non-executive capacity.
This recognises that such wider experience is valuable.
Executive Directors can retain any remuneration from their non-executive appointment.
Executive Directors are generally limited to accepting one external directorship.
John Reizenstein is a trustee and Director of Farm Africa, for which he receives no fees.
Otherwise, the Executive Directors do not currently hold any external directorships.

Benefits include a company car or allowance: private medical and income protection insurance.
Includes amounts earned for performance during the year, but deferred for three years under the Deferred Annual Incentive Plan DAIP.
For more information, see page 83.
These deferred awards are not subject to any conditions, except continuous employment.
However, awards remain available for malus and clawback.
The expected vesting outcome figures for the RBS Group LTIP awards granted in 2012 and reported in 2014 have been updated.
These updates are based on the actual vesting share price of 3.39806 on 9 March 2015, compared to the three-month average share price of 2.828 used in reporting this figure in the 2014 remuneration report.
This results in an adjusted reportable increase of approximately 408,958 for Paul Geddes and 92,016 for John Reizenstein, with a corresponding increase to the single figure for 2014 reflected in the table above.
The expected vesting outcome figures for the RoTE portion of the awards granted under the Direct Line Group LTIP in 2012 and reported in 2014 have also been updated.
These updates are based on the actual vesting of the RoTE portion of the awards and a share price of 3.944 on 9 November 2015, compared to the three-month average share price of 2.828 used in reporting this figure in the 2014 remuneration report.
The revised figures reflect the impact of the share consolidation on 30 June 2015 and actual number of dividends accrued on this portion of the award at vesting.
This results in an adjusted reportable increase of approximately 323,814 for Paul Geddes and 195,998 for John Reizenstein, with a corresponding increase of the single figure for 2014 reflected in the table above.
The long-term incentive figures for 2015 include the estimated vesting outcome for the RoTE portion of the awards made under the Direct Line Group LTIP in March and August 2013 as the performance period under this element is now complete.
In line with the criteria set at the time of grant, this has been assessed by referring to RoTE performance during 2013, 2014 and 2015 in respect of 56.4% of the shares under award being a 94% vesting outcome of shares relating to the RoTE element.
For these purposes, an RoTE figure of 17.6% has been used, including the impact of the International division during 2015 until the completion of its sale in May 2015.
Had the RoTE figure of 18.5% from ongoing operations been used for the purposes of determining LTIP vesting, then full vesting under the RoTE element would have been achieved.
The corresponding values under long-term incentives, including the value of dividends accrued to 31 December 2015, are 1,947,016 for Paul Geddes and 1,178,450 for John Reizenstein based on a three-month average Company share price to 31 December 2015 of 3.97283.
Any shares vesting under the Direct Line Group LTIP granted in 2013 will not be delivered until the end of the applicable vesting periods in March and August 2016.
The long-term incentive figures for 2015 reflect the actual vesting under the TSR element of awards made under the Direct Line Group LTIP in November 2012.
In line with the criteria set at the time of grant, this has been assessed by referring to TSR performance to the end of the performance period of 15 October 2015.
A total of 40% of the shares under award being the maximum number of shares relating to the TSR element vested.
The corresponding values under long-term incentives, including the value of dividends on vesting, are 765,407 for Paul Geddes and 463,271 for John Reizenstein using the share price on 9 November 2015 of 3.944.
Includes the value of matching shares under the SIP.
Each Executive Director has confirmed that they have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration, other than those already disclosed in the single figure table.
com 77 Directors remuneration report continued Annual Incentive Plan outcomes for 2015 The Committee established target performance levels at the start of the year.
However, like last year, the Committee did not set a formal threshold to maximum range for performance measures.
Instead, the Committee believed it more appropriate to carefully consider performance relative to AIP targets and to assess over or underperformance by judging overall corporate performance at the year-end.
To be transparent with our shareholders, we are disclosing more information this year about bonus payout levels.
As such, in the table below, we have included the remuneration targets set at the beginning of the year and performance achieved under the financial measures.
We have also explained the performance achieved against the non-financial measures which remain commercially sensitive to disclose.
The chart below illustrates the Committees assessment of the level of achievement under the AIP.
The outcomes reflect strong performance during the year, particularly in terms of the financial measures, as highlighted in the Group highlights and Chairmans statement on pages 2 to 3 and 10 to 11 respectively.
Notwithstanding this success, the Committee felt that it was appropriate, within the wider economic context and our continued ambitions for improvement, to moderate the achievement under the AIP by 4.4% for each Executive Director, from 87.4% to 83% for Paul Geddes and from 90.4% to 86% for John Reizenstein, as illustrated in the chart below.

78 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 78 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Financial element 60% weighting While there is no pre-set scale around target, the Committee used a range of 90-110% of target as an initial reference point to consider vesting levels for the financial measures.
The Committee will consider the appropriate range each year and as such this scale may not be used in subsequent years.
Having considered the actual results against these reference points, the Committee agreed that the level of performance warranted the level of payouts shown in the chart above.
Strategic element 20% weighting As described elsewhere in this Annual Report, during 2015 we have continued to invest in improved customer propositions and on improving the customer experience and reducing complaints.
This has contributed to an increase in Net Promoter Scores across a number of measures, as well as a reduction in complaints.
Overall, a strong performance on the basket of customer measures considered by the Committee has led to an above target payout of 75% of the maximum available under this element.
Personal element 20% weighting This element focuses on the individual's personal objectives as well as shared objectives with other Executive Committee members, set by the Remuneration Committee.
Both Executives demonstrated strong leadership on various strategic initiatives during the year.
As outlined in the Board Chairmans letter on pages 10 to 11, during 2015 the Group progressed on delivering its strategic objectives and building future capability in line with its mission.
These objectives also form part of the Executives personal and shared objectives and, in acknowledgement of progress made during the year, the Committee determined that Paul Geddes and John Reizenstein should each receive awards ahead of an on-target level of performance, of 65% and 80% of the maximum available under this element, respectively.
In determining the level of personal achievement for the Chief Financial Officer, the Committee was particularly mindful to recognise the successful completion of the sale of the International business during 2015, in which he played a key role.
Whilst the agreement was substantially complete in 2014, the Committee decided to wait until all regulatory approvals had been received during 2015 before recognising this exceptional personal performance.
We anticipate including similar disclosures next year in respect of the 2016 AIP outcome which, consistent with market practice, are not included on a prospective basis on the basis of commercial sensitivity.
Consequently, the annual incentive awards for Executive Directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2015 were as follows: Actual 000 Maximum Target Actual including cash and % of salary % of salary % of salary deferred elements Paul Geddes, CEO 175% 105% 145% 1,120 John Reizenstein, CFO 150% 90% 129% 602 Non-Executive Directors Fees were the only remuneration paid to Non-Executive Directors in 2014 and 2015.
Non-Executive Directors may also claim for reasonable travel and subsistence expenses, in accordance with the Groups travel and expenses policy, and, where these are classified as taxable by HMRC, they have been shown under Benefits below.
The Non-Executive Directors receive no other benefits.

Bonus including 1 2 3 Salary Benefits deferred amount Chief Executive Officer 2% 5% 12% All UK employees 3.6% 11% 8% Notes: 1.
Based on the change in average pay for UK employees employed in the year ended 31 December 2015 and the year ended 31 December 2014.
Salaries are not adjusted for number of working hours and the increase therefore partly reflects the increase in working hours for some employees during the year.
There were no changes in benefits provision between 2014 and 2015.
The value increase shown above for all employees is mainly due to an increase in the average value of matching shares provided to employees taking part in the BAYE plan over this period.
Includes average amounts earned under the AIP and, for employees other than the Chief Executive Officer, other variable incentive schemes, including monthly and quarterly incentive schemes operated in certain parts of the Group.
When determining Directors remuneration, the Committee considers employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
The Committee particularly reviews overall pay and bonus decisions in aggregate for the wider Group.
Through the Chief Executive Officer and the HR Director the Committee may, as required, consider input from employee groups, such as the Employee Representative Body.

The RoTE targets for awards granted in 2015, applying to 60% of the award, were 14.5% for 20% vesting, 15.5% for 40% vesting and 17.5% for full vesting.
A straight-line interpolation occurs from threshold to target, and then from target to maximum performance.
The remaining 40% of each award is based on TSR performance conditions, which are the same as noted on page 76.

The Companys policy is to issue awards twice a year, after the Group announces its full and half-year results.
The value of each grant of awards is set at 50% of the normal annual policy level.
This means the total combined face value of awards to each Executive Director during the year equates to 200% of their base salary paid in the year.

For these purposes payments include pension arrangements, the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
Selection of performance measures Annual Incentive Plan The AIP performance measures have been selected by the Committee to incentivise Executive Directors to achieve financial targets for the year as well as specific strategic and personal objectives.
These measures are aligned with the key performance indicators that we use as a business to monitor performance against our strategic priorities, as shown on pages 24 and 25 of the Annual Report & Accounts.
The relevant targets are set at or following the start of each year to ensure that Executive Directors are appropriately focused on the key objectives for the next 12 months.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The ultimate goal of our strategy is to provide long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders.
For 2016, awards under the LTIP will therefore continue to be subject to performance against both RoTE and relative TSR targets, which are important KPIs for the business.
The Committee believes that this combination provides a balanced approach to the measurement of Group performance over the longer term by using both a stated financial KPI that incentivises individuals to keep growing the business in an efficient way and a measure based on relative shareholder return.
This combination of measures achieves an appropriate balance of absolute and relative returns.
Differences in remuneration policy from broader employee population When determining Executive Directors remuneration, the Committee takes into account pay throughout the Group to ensure that the arrangements in place remain appropriate.
The Group has one consistent reward policy for all levels of employees.
Therefore, the same reward principles guide reward decisions for all Group employees, including Executive Directors, although remuneration packages differ to take into account appropriate factors in different areas of the business: AIP approximately 3,200 employees participate in the AIP and the corporate performance measures for all employees are consistent with those used for Executive Directors, although the weighting attributable to those factors may differ.
The Groups strategic leaders also receive part of their bonus in Company shares deferred for a period of three years LTIP our strategic leaders participate in the LTIP currently based on the same performance conditions as those for Executive Directors, although the Committee reserves the discretion to vary the performance conditions for awards made to employees below the Board for future awards All employee share plans the Committee considers it is important for all employees to have the opportunity to become shareholders in the Company.
The HMRC-approved Buy-As-You-Earn Share Incentive Plan in the UK and an International plan mirroring the UK plan for Italy were both launched during 2013.

Principles for recruitment remuneration In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new Executive Director, the starting point for the Committee will be to look to the policy for Executive Directors as set out in the policy table and structure a package in accordance with that policy.
Consistent with the Regulations, the caps contained within the policy table for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, although the Committee would not envisage exceeding these caps in practice For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment, as appropriate For external and internal appointments including a major change in role, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses, legal and other fees involved in negotiating any recruitment or pay expatriate benefits in line with the Groups international assignment policy, as appropriate Buy-out awards Where it is necessary to make a recruitment-related pay award to an external candidate, the Company will not pay more than is necessary, in the view of the Committee, and will in all cases seek, in the first instance, to deliver any such awards under the terms of the existing incentive pay structure All such awards for external appointments, whether under the AIP, LTIP or otherwise, to compensate for awards forfeited on leaving their previous employer will be capped at the commercial value of the amount forfeited and will take account of the nature, time horizons and performance requirements of those awards.
In particular, the Committees starting point will be to ensure that any awards being forfeited which remain subject to outstanding performance requirements other than where substantially complete are bought out with replacement requirements and any awards with service requirements are bought out with similar terms.
However, exceptionally the Committee may relax those obligations where it considers it to be in the interests of shareholders and those factors are, in the view of the Committee, equally reflected in some other way, for example through a significant discount to the face value of the awards forfeited.
It will only include guaranteed or non-prorated amounts under the AIP where the Committee considers that it is necessary to secure the recruitment www.
com 91 Directors remuneration report continued The elements of any package for a new recruit, including the maximum level of variable pay, but excluding buy-outs, and the approach taken by the Committee in relation to setting each element of the package will be consistent with the Executive Directors remuneration policy described in this report, as modified by the above statement of principles where appropriate.
The Committee reserves the right to avail itself of the current Listing Rule 9.4.
2 if needed in order to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, the recruitment of an Executive Director.
Awards granted under this provision will only be used for buy-out awards.
Any commitments made before promotion to the Board except when made in connection with the appointment to the Board can continue to be honoured under the policy even if they are not consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled.
In exceptional circumstances, the initial notice period may be longer than the Companys 12 month policy up to a maximum of 24 months.
However, this will reduce by one month for every month served, until it has reduced to 12 months in line with the Companys policy position.
The remuneration policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors as set out earlier in this report will apply in relation to any recruitments to those positions.
Service contracts Subject to the discretion noted above for new recruits, it is the Companys policy to set notice periods for Executive Directors of no more than 12 months both by the Director or Company.
The Executive Directors service agreements summary is as follows: Notice period by Director or Director Effective date of contract Company Exit payment policy Paul Geddes 1 September 2012 12 months Base salary only for unexpired portion of notice period and to be paid in a lump sum or monthly instalments, in which case instalments are subject to mitigation if an alternative role is found.
John Reizenstein 1 September 2012 12 months Base salary only for unexpired portion of notice period and to be paid in a lump sum or monthly instalments, in which case instalments are subject to mitigation if an alternative role is found.
There are no further obligations which could give rise to a remuneration or loss of office payment other than those set out in the remuneration policy table and termination policy summary.
Termination policy summary It is appropriate for the Committee to retain discretion to consider the termination terms of any Executive Director, having regard to all the relevant facts and circumstances available to them at the time.
A Director is deemed a good leaver if the following circumstances are met: Annual Incentive Plan and Long-Term Incentive Plan death, injury, ill-health, redundancy, retirement, the sale of the individuals employing company or business out of the Group, or in such other circumstances as the Committee determines Deferred Annual Incentive Plan for any reason other than summary dismissal or resignation unless, in the case of resignation only, the Committee determines otherwise The table overleaf sets out the general position although it should be noted that the Committee, consistent with most other companies, has reserved a broad discretion to determine whether an Executive Director should be categorised as a good leaver and that discretion forms part of the approved policy.
Similarly, while the policy is generally to reduce AIP and LTIP awards on a pro-rata basis, the Committee has reserved discretion to disapply such reduction if, in the circumstances, it considers that to be appropriate taking into account the performance of the departing Executive and the circumstances of leaving.

Service agreements for Executive Directors provide that Paul Geddes and John Reizenstein are not eligible to receive any enhanced redundancy terms which may be offered by the Group from time to time.
Their rights to a statutory redundancy payment are not affected.
Depending on the circumstances of departure, an Executive Director may have additional claims under relevant employment protection laws and the Company may contribute to any legal fees involved in agreeing a termination.
It may also agree to incur certain other expenses such as the provision of outplacement services.
Any such fees would be disclosed as part of the detail of any termination arrangements.
Non-Executive Director letters of appointment Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three-year term which may be renewed by mutual agreement.
In common with the Executive Directors, all Non-Executives are subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
The Directors may appoint additional members to join the Board during the year.
Directors appointed in this way will be subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment.
In subsequent years, the Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at each AGM.
Terms and conditions of appointment of all of the Directors are available for inspection by any person at the Companys registered office and at the AGM.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have notice periods of three months from either party, which do not apply in the case of a Director not being re-elected by shareholders or retiring from office under the Articles of Association.
Other than fees for this notice period, the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any compensation on exit.
External directorships The Company encourages Executive Directors to accept, subject to the approval of the Chairman, an invitation to join the board of another company outside the Group in a non-executive capacity, recognising the value of such wider experience.
In these circumstances, they are permitted to retain any remuneration from the non-executive appointment.
com 93 Directors remuneration report continued Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group As explained elsewhere in the Directors remuneration report, the Committee reviews the overall pay and bonus decisions in aggregate for the wider Group and therefore takes account of pay and conditions in the wider Group in determining the Directors remuneration policy and the remuneration payable to Directors.
Through the Chief Executive Officer, Paul Geddes, and other senior management the Committee may receive input provided by employee groups within the Group, such as the Employee Representative Body, as required.
In accordance with prevailing commercial practice, the Committee did not consult with employees in preparing the Directors remuneration policy.
Consideration of shareholders views The Committee takes into account the approval levels of remuneration related matters at the AGM in determining whether the current Directors remuneration policy remains appropriate.
The Committee, consistent with its approach of operating within the highest standards of corporate governance, takes significant account of guidelines issued by the Investment Association and other shareholder bodies such as the National Association of Pension Funds when setting the remuneration policy.
The Committee will also seek to build an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance generally and any changes to the Companys executive pay arrangements in particular.
The Committee is satisfied that no element of the Directors remuneration policy conflicts with the Groups approach to environmental, social or corporate governance matters.
Performance scenarios The Directors remuneration policy has been designed to ensure that a significant proportion of total remuneration is delivered in the form of variable pay and is therefore dependent on performance against our strategic objectives.
The Committee has considered the level of remuneration that may be paid under different performance scenarios to ensure that it would be appropriate in each situation in the context of the performance delivered and the value created for shareholders.
The following charts show the potential remuneration that may be earned by Executive Directors under three assumed performance scenarios as follows: CFO John Reizenstein CEO Paul Geddes 000 000 Minimum 100% 617 Minimum 100% 1,011 On-target 50% 35% 15% 1,242 15% 2,164 On-target 47% 38% Maximum Maximum 0m1m 2m3m 4m 0m1m 2m3m 4m Total xed pay AIP LTIP Total xed pay AIP LTIP 94 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 94 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015 27% 31% 2,300 42% 42% 25% 35% 40% 3,991 Strategic report Governance Financial statements The elements of remuneration included in each scenario are as follows.
