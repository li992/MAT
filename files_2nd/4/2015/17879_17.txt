The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board within its agreed terms of reference, details of which are available at www.
The Remuneration Committees principal responsibility is to determine the remuneration package of both the Companys Executive Directors and its senior management within broad policies agreed with the Board.
When reviewing and setting remuneration policy the Committee considered a range of factors including the Companys strategy and circumstances, the prevailing economic environment and the evolving landscape in best practice guidelines to ensure that it remains appropriate.
In addition, it reviews the remuneration policy for the Company as a whole and oversees and approves the Companys share incentive plans for all participants.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Executive Directors and the Chairman, rather than the Committee.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Remuneration Committee were finalised in four formal meetings during the year, and these were preceded by several informal discussions, including some with advisers none of whom had any other connection with the Company.
The members of the Committee during 2014 15 were Philip Dayer Chairman, Philip Aiken, Jonathan Brooks and Jennifer Allerton.
The Chief Executive Richard Longdon is invited to submit recommendations to the Remuneration Committee and to attend meetings when appropriate.
He was not present when his own remuneration was discussed.
The Committee has access to external advisers as required.
During the year the Committee received advice from Deloitte LLP.
Deloitte also provided unrelated advisory services to the Group in respect of taxation during the year.
Deloitte is one of the founding members of the Remuneration Consultants Code of Conduct and adheres to this Code in its dealings with the Committee.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Deloitte is independent.
The fees paid to Deloitte LLP were calculated based on time spent and expenses incurred for the majority of advice provided but on occasion for specific projects a fixed fee may be agreed.
In 2014 15, Deloitte received fees of 8,750 in relation to advice provided to the Committee.

We highly value shareholders comments on and overwhelming support for our Remuneration Policy.
This was demonstrated at the 2014 AGM where the resolution to approve our Remuneration Policy received 97.31% of votes cast in favour.
It is our belief that it is the preference of shareholders that we should not make frequent changes to the Remuneration Policy and we will propose changes only if we believe that they would lead to a better alignment between pay, strategy and long-term business performance.
No changes have been proposed for 2015 16.
Full details of the Directors remuneration policy, as approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, can be found on our website www.
AVEVAs Executive remuneration philosophy The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that: members of the Executive management team are provided with appropriate incentives to align them with the achievement of the Companys strategy and the future creation of shareholder value: enhanced performance is encouraged: and, the Executive Management team is, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
It also aims for a combination of fixed and variable payments, benefits and share-based awards that will achieve a balance in incentives to deliver short and long-term goals.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of remuneration of Executive Directors should be performance related and should be delivered in shares to create alignment with shareholders interests.
Remuneration for Executive Directors is set in the context of the economic environment in which the Group operates, the outcome of the wider pay review for all Group employees as well as the financial performance of the Group.
When determining remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into consideration relevant external market data as well as the remuneration for employees of the Group generally.
Remuneration commitments made which were consistent with the approved Remuneration policy in force at that time shall be honoured, even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled.

For these purposes payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an award over shares is agreed at the time the award is granted.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios The remuneration package at AVEVA is structured so that the majority of the package is related to the delivery of performance over the short and long-term to ensure that reward is aligned with shareholder value creation.
The charts opposite show hypothetical values of the remuneration package for Executive Directors under three assumed performance scenarios: CEO CFO Maximum award opportunities % of salary Annual Bonus 125% 125% LTIP 150% 120% Minimum No annual incentive pay-out No vesting under the LTIP Mid performance 50% of salary pays out under the Annual Bonus 40% of maximum i. e. half of the core award and none of the outperformance award 050% of maximum vesting under the LTIP Maximum performance 100% of maximum annual incentive pay-out 100% of maximum LTIP vesting The Remuneration Committee believes that, given the annual incentive scheme rewards the achievement of the annual business plan, the targets are commercially sensitive and therefore should not be disclosed in advance.

52 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual report on remuneration Executive Directors Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2014 15 The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that: members of the Executive management team are provided with appropriate incentives to align them with the achievement of the Companys strategy and the future creation of shareholder value: enhanced performance is encouraged: and the Executive management team is, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
Base salary As set out in the Directors Remuneration Report last year, a detailed review of market positioning was undertaken during the course of 2013 14 for the first time since 2011 given the increase in the size and complexity of the Group over the period, and it was determined that the positioning of the Executive Directors remuneration, particularly base salary, had fallen significantly behind market practice.
In light of this, the Committee considered it appropriate to increase the base salary for the CEO and CFO as follows: Base salary with effect from CEO CFO 1 April 2014 445,000 c. 9.7% increase 280,000 c. 7.7% increase 1 April 2015 485,000 c. 9.0% increase 300,000 c. 7.1% increase The first stage of the change was implemented in 2014.
Given the strong performance of each of the Executive Directors and the underlying operational performance of the Group over the course of the year in light of a very difficult external climate, the Committee has considered it appropriate to proceed with the second stage of this increase with effect from 1 April 2015.
Benefits In line with benefits provided for other senior employees, in 2015 16 Executive Directors will be provided with a company car or a mobility allowance, a fuel allowance and a 500 annual allowance towards a range of flexible benefits.
Pension As noted in the Policy Table on page 48, Richard Longdon participated in the AVEVA Solutions Limited defined benefit pension scheme until 2010 when he accrued the maximum benefits that he is entitled to under the scheme.
He is now a deferred member of the scheme and is no longer accruing any further benefits.
James Kidd is a member of the AVEVA Group Personal Pension Plan a defined contribution scheme.
For 2015 16, the Company contribution to the plan will be 10% of salary.
James will continue to be provided with the flexibility to contribute to this plan via salary sacrifice.
Annual Incentive Scheme For 2015 16, the maximum opportunity for Executive Directors under the annual bonus will be 125% of base salary which will be made up of a core award of 100% of salary and an outperformance award of 25% of base salary.
It was agreed that for the core award 90% of bonus shall be based on achieving stretching Group adjusted profit before tax PBT targets.
10% of the core award is contingent upon achievement of key individual performance objectives which were agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the financial year.
Of the 90% of the core award based on financial performance, 10% is based on achievement for the six months to 30 September and the remaining 80% is based on the full year results for 2015 16.
The performance targets for the core and outperformance award are based on Group adjusted profit before tax PBT targets and the outperformance award will only be delivered for the achievement of stretch targets over and above the targets for the core award.
The Remuneration Committee believes that, given the annual incentive scheme rewards the achievement of the annual business plan, the targets are commercially sensitive and therefore should not be disclosed in advance.
Deferral For the core award, at 100% achievement of bonus performance conditions, 60% of the bonus amount is payable in cash and the balance, 40%, is deferred into shares.
If the bonus amount is less than or equal to 70% of the potential maximum core bonus, then 75% of the bonus is paid in cash and 25% paid in deferred shares.
If the bonus amount is between 70% and 100% of the potential maximum core bonus then the proportion paid in deferred shares is determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 40%.

54 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual incentive This reflects the total annual incentive paid and payable in 2015 based on performance in the year ended 31 March 2015.
This includes both the cash element of the bonus and the portion deferred into shares under the deferred share scheme.
10% of the core award was dependent on achieving the half year Group adjusted profit before tax PBT performance target, and 80% dependent on achieving the full year Group adjusted PBT performance target.
Following a review of performance in the year, the Committee determined that none of the financial element award will be made as neither of the targets were met.
The Executive Directors were given individual performance objectives which were specific in nature and important for the long term growth and sustainability of the business.
The Remuneration Committee are satisfied that these objectives were met in full and determined that for both the CEO and CFO, this element of the core award 10% will be paid.
None of the outperformance award will be paid as targets were not met.
Achievement for 2014 15 was 10% of the core award and 8% of the maximum payable for both Executive Directors 2013 14 63% and 50%.

Long-term incentives This includes the LTIP awards, granted under the previous Long-Term Incentive Plan, vesting based on performance in the three-year period ending 31 March 2015.
These awards were subject to the delivery of EPS growth.
0% of awards vest for diluted adjusted EPS growth of less than 9.5% p. a. with 100% of awards vesting for diluted adjusted EPS growth of 16.5% p. a.
Average diluted EPS growth for the three year performance period did not reach the minimum 9.5% p. a. growth needed and therefore 0% of the LTIP awards will vest in the period relating to 2014 15.
For 2013 14, 94% of the maximum LTIP awards granted to the Executives in 2011 12 vested.
The value included in the single total figure of remuneration in respect of 2013 14 has been restated to reflect the actual number of shares that vested and the market value of the shares on the date of vesting 22 July 2014.
The figure included in last years Directors Remuneration Report was estimated based on the average share price for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 March 2014 as the vesting date was post the publication of the 2013 14 Annual Report and Accounts.

Typical salary inflation in some other AVEVA locations is materially higher than the UK, which would distort the comparison.
