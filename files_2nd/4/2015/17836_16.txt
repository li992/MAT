As the markets have improved the Groups employees have become an even more attractive target for a number of our competitors and retaining our key staff has become an increasing priority.
As stated in our remuneration policy, which was approved at last years annual general meeting, we aim to set base salaries for our executives considering their experience and performance, and to be competitive using information drawn from both internal and external sources: and also to take account of pay and conditions elsewhere in the Company.
To varying degrees, our executive board members are paid significantly less than their peers at our competitor companies and certainly all now have both base salaries and total remuneration that is below the median for our comparator companies in the FTSE 50100.
We intend to address this disparity over the coming years.

There were no changes to the remuneration policy during the year.
Notes to the policy table: 1.
I n relation to the DBP, individual awards to directors are dependent on the most relevant measure of profit for the role which they perform, and thus over which they have the most direct influence.
Profit is a key component of earnings per share, one of the Companys key performance indicators and is considered the primary measure which aligns with shareholders interests.
Total shareholder return measures the relative return from Ashtead against an appropriate comparator group, providing alignment with shareholders interests.
b. E arnings per share is also a key measure ensuring sustainable profit generation over the longer term and is a measure which is aligned with shareholders interests.
c. Return on investment is a key internal measure to ensure the effective use of capital in the business which is highly cyclical and with high capital requirements.
d. The use of leverage alongside the other performance measures ensures there is an appropriate dynamic tension and balance in maintaining leverage discipline in a capitalintensive business.
I n relation to both the DBP and the PSP, malus and clawback provisions exist which enable the Committee to reduce or eliminate the number of shares, notional shares or unvested shares held or reduce the amount of any money payable or potentially payable and or to require the transfer to the Company of all or some of the shares acquired or to pay to the Company an amount equal to all or part of any benefit or value derived from, or attributable to, the plans in case of material misstatement of accounts or action or conduct of an award holder or award holders which in the reasonable opinion of the Board, amounts to fraud or gross misconduct.
Share-based incentives and dilution limits The Company observes an overall dilution limit of 10% in 10 years for all Company share schemes, together with a limit of 5% in 10 years for discretionary schemes.
Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 55 Remuneration report continued Remuneration policy continued Remuneration policy on new hires When hiring a new executive director, the Committee will seek to align the remuneration package with the remuneration policy summarised above.
In addition, where the executive has to relocate, the level of relocation package will be assessed on a case by case basis.
Although it is not the Committees policy to buy-out former incentive arrangements as a matter of course, it will consider compensating an incoming executive with like-kind incentive arrangements for foregone incentives with their previous employer, taking into account the length of the period they were held and an assessment of the likely vesting value.
The Committee will ensure that such arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company and the shareholders without paying more than is necessary.
Total remuneration opportunity Our remuneration arrangements are designed so that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of shortand long-term objectives designed to create shareholder value.
The charts below illustrate the potential future reward opportunity for each of the executive directors, based on the remuneration policy set out on pages 53 to 55 and the base salary at 1 May 2015 and the sterling dollar exchange rate at 30 April 2015.

Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 56 Directors report Service contracts The Companys policy is that executive directors have rolling contracts which are terminable by either party giving the other 12 months notice, which are available for inspection at the Companys registered office.
The service contracts for each of the executive directors all contain non-compete provisions appropriate to their roles.
Policy on payment for loss of office Upon the termination of employment of any executive director, any compensation will be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of the directors employment contract and the rules of any incentive scheme which are summarised below.

The Committee reserves the right to make payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of a legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation : or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an executive directors office or employment.
When determining any loss of office payment for a departing individual the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the Company whilst seeking to address the circumstances at the time.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company The constituent parts of the senior management teams remuneration package mirror those of the executives.
The performance conditions attaching to PSP awards are common throughout the Company.
When considering executive compensation, the Committee is advised of, and takes into account, changes to the remuneration of employees elsewhere within the Company.
The Committee does not consider it appropriate to consult with employees when determining executive remuneration.

None of the non-executive directors has a service contract with the Company and their appointment is therefore terminable by the Board at any time.

Consideration of shareholder views The Committee believes that it is important to maintain an open and transparent dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters.
The Committee sought the views of its major shareholders on the changes made to the base salary of the chief executive with effect from 1 May 2014 and the deferred element under the DBP.
The views expressed by the shareholders have been taken into account in determining base pay for 2015 16.
The Committee is consulting with major shareholders over the performance conditions to be applied to the element of the award to executives above 150% of base salary under the PSP.
Looking forward, the Committee will continue to engage with shareholders regarding material changes to the application of the approved policy or proposed changes to the policy.
Other taxable allowances include car, travel and accommodation allowances.

Until 31 March 2014, Sat Dhaiwal was a contributory member of the Ashtead Group Retirement Benefits Plan.
The amount shown above for 2014 represents the increase in his accrued pension benefit, plus one months payment in lieu of pension contributions.
The amount for Geoff Drabble represents a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions at 40% of salary.
The amounts included for Brendan Horgan and Suzanne Wood represent the co-match under Sunbelts 401K defined contribution pension plan and 409A deferred compensation plan.
iii D eferred Bonus Plan includes the cash received by each director from the DBP for 2014 15 performance as explained on page 54.
This includes 67% of this years bonus for each director.

v T he PSP value is calculated as the number of shares vesting, valued at the market value of those shares, plus the payment in lieu of dividends paid during the vesting period.
Market value is the market value on the day the awards vest if they vest before the date the financial statements are approved or the average market value for the last three months of the financial year if the awards vest after the date the financial statements are approved.
The 2012 award is expected to vest fully on 18 September 2015 and has been valued at an average market value of 1,114p for the three months ended 30 April 2015, plus 34.25p per share in lieu of dividends paid during the vesting period.
The PSP value for 2014 has been adjusted to reflect the actual market value on the date of vesting of 934p.
Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 59 Remuneration report continued Annual report on remuneration continued The significant value attributable to the PSP awards within the single total figure for remuneration reflects the significant appreciation of the share price since the awards were granted.

The Company makes a payment of 40% of Geoff Drabbles base salary in lieu of providing him with any pension arrangements.
This was agreed prior to his joining the Company in 2006 and reflected the fact that he was leaving a generous defined benefit arrangement at his previous employer.
Brendan Horgan and Suzanne Wood are members of the Sunbelt 401K defined contribution pension plan and the 409A deferred compensation plan.
They are entitled to a company co-match conditional on contributing into the 401K plan or deferring into the 409A plan.
The co-match is limited to amounts permitted by regulatory agencies and is effected either by a company payment into the 401K plan or an enhanced deferral into the 409A plan and was $16,870 for Brendan Horgan and $30,955 for Suzanne Wood in 2014 15.
At 30 April 2015, the total amount available to Brendan Horgan but deferred under the Sunbelt deferred compensation plan was $406,770 or 264,686.
This includes an allocated investment return of $31,242 or 19,549 2014: 21,435.
The amount available to Suzanne Wood under the same plan was $292,197 or 190,133.
This includes an allocated investment return of $25,600 or 16,019 2014: 16,165.

No share equivalents brought forward.
The performance targets for Geoff Drabble and Suzanne Wood for the year to 30 April 2015 related directly to the underlying pre-tax profits of Ashtead Group.
The targets for Brendan Horgan and Sat Dhaiwal related to the underlying operating profit of Sunbelt and A-Plant respectively.
The Group target set by the Committee for full entitlement under the DBP was significantly ahead of both prior year 362m and consensus market expectation of 410m when the target was set.
The targets for Sunbelt and A-Plant were significantly ahead of the prior year of $631m and 25m respectively.
For the year to 30 April 2015, the underlying pre-tax profit for Ashtead Group was 490m and underlying operating profit for Sunbelt and A-Plant was $833m and 46m respectively.
As a result, the maximum bonus entitlements were earned and were equivalent to 200% of base salary for Geoff Drabble and 150% of base salary for Suzanne Wood, Brendan Horgan and Sat Dhaiwal.
As 2014 15 was the first year of the three-year DBP period, there were no share equivalent awards brought forward.

Following consultation with shareholders in 2011 12, a balanced and holistic approach was adopted involving four performance measures selected because delivery of them through the cycle is a significant challenge and the achievement of them will deliver optimum sustainable performance over the long term.
The performance criteria are as follows: Performance criteria measured over three years Award date Financial year TSR % of award EPS % of award Status 27 7 11 2011 12 From date of grant versus FTSE 250 Index 2013 14 EPS between 8p 12.5% vested Vested in full in July 2014 12.5% at median: 50% at upper quartile and 12p 50% vested Performance criteria measured over three years Award date Financial year TSR 40% EPS 25% RoI 25% Leverage 10% Status 19 9 12 2012 13 From date of grant 25% of this element 25% of this element 100% of this 2012 award versus FTSE 250 Index of the award will of the award will element of the Expected to vest in full 25% of this element vest if EPS vest at an RoI of 10% award will vest if the in September 2015 of the award will vest compound growth with 100% vesting ratio of net debt to at median: 100% at for the three years with an RoI of 15% EBITDA is equal to, upper quartile ending 30 April or is less than, immediately prior 2.5 times to the vesting date is 6% per annum, rising to 100% vesting if EPS compound growth is equal to, or exceeds, 12% per annum 1 7 13 2013 14 As above As above As above As above 2013 award TSR performance is in the upper quartile, EPS growth of 41%, RoI of 19% and leverage of 1.8 times 19 6 14 2014 15 From 1 May of the As above As above As above 2014 award year of grant versus TSR performance is in the FTSE 350 the second quartile, EPS companies ranked growth of 34%, RoI of 75th to 125th by 19% and leverage of market capitalisation 1.8 times For performance between the lower and upper target ranges, vesting of the award is scaled on a straight-line basis.
The 2011 PSP award vested in full on 26 July 2014 with EPS for 2013 14 of 46.6p exceeding the upper target of 12p and the Companys TSR performance ranked it first within the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
EPS is based on the profit before exceptional items, fair value remeasurements and amortisation of acquired intangibles less the tax charge included in the accounts.
Historically TSR performance has been measured relative to the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts rather than a specific comparator group of companies because there are few direct comparators to the Company listed in London and because the Company was a FTSE 250 company.
From 2014 15 the comparator group is comprised of those companies in the FTSE 350 ranked 75th to 125th by market capitalisation excluding investment trusts.
The Companys TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts is shown on page 64.
The executive directors are required to retain at least 50% of shares that vest under the PSP until such time as they have achieved the shareholding guideline detailed on page 55.
