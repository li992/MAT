This means that the balance of measures will be 30 per cent 2015 incentive out-turns EPS, 20 per cent cash conversion, 25 per cent strategic objectives and Throughout the year, the Remuneration Committee continued to 25 per cent personal objectives.
At the heart of the design of the bonus apply the Remuneration Policy prudently, with a clear alignment to the plan is affordability and our challenging EPS targets are set such that no interests of shareholders.
In this regard, the Remuneration Committee EPS or cash element pays out unless the EPS target is met.
Cash feels strongly that rewards should be linked to both Group and conversion has been introduced because the Committee felt that personal performance.
together with the other objectives this created a more balanced scorecard representing the key short and long-term business drivers To encourage behaviours that facilitate profitable growth and the future for Carillion.
The emphasis on driving cash through our operating development of the business, 50 per cent of the 2015 annual bonus activities will fund ongoing investment for growth and returns to opportunity was based on Earnings Per Share EPS performance, shareholders.

Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 57 Remuneration report continued Annual Report on Remuneration Remuneration philosophy and linking executive remuneration with strategy Carillions Remuneration Policy is to provide the Executive Directors with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance in a manner consistent with the Groups strategy and to reward them in a fair and responsible manner for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
The remuneration package has been based on the following key principles: Key focus Remuneration Policy and link to strategy To invest in our people Our Remuneration Policy is designed to reward all employees fairly according to their role, experience and performance and capabilities and with due regard to actual and expected market conditions and the financial performance of the Group.
Alignment with A substantial proportion of the package for the Executive Directors is paid in the Companys shares to ensure that the interests of interests of Executives are aligned with shareholders.
This is further supported by shareholding guidelines.
To create shareholders alignment with shareholders by ensuring that a meaningful portion of each Executive Directors personal wealth is linked to share price performance, each Executive Director is required to hold the net number of shares acquired through the LEAP and the deferred bonus plan until the value of their total shareholding is equal to their annual salary.
Pay for performance Our strategic focus is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth.
and delivery of our business vision A substantial proportion of Executive Director remuneration is variable and linked to the Groups performance, in particular, to the delivery of our business vision and our strategy see the Strategic report on pages 8 to 11 and to the performance of the individual.
To encourage behaviours which facilitate profitable growth and the future development of the business, our short-term performance is assessed against both earnings per share performance and the delivery of specific individual strategic, financial and non-financial objectives.
Our long-term performance is measured by assessing the growth in earnings per share, cash flow conversion and key strategic objectives.
Together, these metrics are a key measure of success in delivering shareholder value.
Be a recognised leader To ensure that remuneration arrangements support our sustainability agenda, the quality of the Groups performance in Health & Safety and in terms of business results and leadership is considered, including achieving high standards in respect of Carillions sustainability Health & Safety, environmental and social performance targets.
This is further supported by the inclusion of strategic objectives in the LEAP since 2014, which include specific and quantifiable sustainability metrics.

In line with best practice, the Directors Remuneration Policy, approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, is that increases in salary for Executive Directors will not normally exceed the range of increases awarded to other employees in the Group with the exception of the specific circumstances listed in the binding policy.
The exceptions include situations where an Executive Director has been promoted and the increase takes account of the individuals development or performance in role e. g. the salary of a newly appointed Executive Director is increased to align it with the market competitive range over time.
In recognition of this policy and as explained in detail in the Chairmans letter in the 2014 Remuneration Report, the Remuneration Committee increased Richard Howsons base salary by 9 per cent to 610,400 with effect from 1 January 2015 to reflect his contribution to the business and his experience in his current role.
Richard Adam received an increase of 2 per cent effective from 1 April 2015, which is in line with the range of increases awarded to other employees in the Group.
2016 Base salary A phased approach to proposed increases for Richard Howson was put in place.
The second increase, which was not guaranteed, was scheduled for 1 January 2016.
Implementation of the 1 January 2016 increase was contingent on a continued improvement in corporate performance and of Richard Howsons personal performance.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the following factors in reaching its decision: The financial performance of the business against budgets for the 2015 financial year The meeting of personal objectives The outcome of the Chief Executives personal development review by the Chairman An assessment of any impending risk factors which might impact the business in the coming year.

Executive Director Financial performance Personal performance Richard Howson and Richard Adam 50 per cent of salary based on achievement 25 per cent of salary based on personal objectives and outperformance of EPS target 25 per cent of salary based on individual stretch targets The personal objectives and individual stretch targets of the Executive Directors were agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the 2015 financial year and assessed in February 2016 to establish the extent to which they had been met.
Performance against targets Financial performance The Group achieved an underlying EPS of 35.0 pence in 2015 which exceeded the threshold level of 34.7 pence and up to 50 per cent of salary resulted in a bonus award of 4.3 per cent of salary for financial performance.

50 per cent of any bonus earned is deferred into shares in the Company for a period of three years under the deferred bonus plan.
Dividend equivalents will be earned on deferred shares during the deferral period.
A clawback provision is operated that gives the Remuneration Committee the right to recover all elements of bonus.
A malus provision is operated that gives the Remuneration Committee the right to reduce any deferred bonus awards which have not yet vested in relation to circumstances of corporate failure, which may have occurred at any time before malus is operated.
Each Executive Director is required to hold the net number of shares acquired through the deferred bonus plan and LEAP until the value of their total shareholding is equal to their annual salary.
For 2015, the values of each Executive Directors annual bonus paid in cash and deferred into shares were as follows: Total annual bonus shown in column c of total remuneration Cash payment Deferred into shares table on page 58 in respect of 2015 Richard Adam 107,608 107,608 215,215 Richard Howson 146,605 146,605 293,210 Summary of 2016 bonus operation Following consideration of the performance metrics being applied for the annual bonus, the Committee has introduced a cash-based metric for the 2016 bonus.
This will constitute 20% of the bonus opportunity with the EPS element being reduced to 30% and the weightings for the other metrics being maintained.
The cash measure is defined as underlying cash flow from operations as a percentage of underlying profit from operations and represents the delivery of cash from the day-to-day operations of the business.
It is considered to be a key performance metric of the business as detailed in the Strategic report and combined with EPS provides a balance between profitability of the business as a whole and cash generation from its operating activities over the financial year.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity remains at 100 per cent of base salary.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the actual annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive as they provide our competitors with insight into our business plans, expectations and our strategic actions and should therefore remain confidential to the Company.
However, the Remuneration Committee will continue to disclose how bonuses paid relate to performance against targets on a retrospective basis.
Value earned from longterm incentive awards The Leadership Equity Award Plan LEAP For the LEAP awards granted to Executive Directors in 2013, 100 per cent of salary was based on growth in earnings per share and 50 per cent of salary was based on average annual cash flow conversion targets as shown below.
50% of salary based Vesting % of maximum 100% of salary based on annual average for Executive Directors on EPS growth cash flow conversion Threshold 17% 6% pa 95% Target 50% 9% pa 100% Maximum 100% 12% pa 110% Growth in EPS is measured based on underlying basic earnings per share as disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts.
This is calculated before intangible amortisation arising from business combinations, non-recurring operating items, non-operating items, and fair value movements in derivative financial instruments and post any impairment of goodwill or intangibles.
The average annual cash flow conversion is calculated as the underlying cash flow from operations divided by the underlying profit from operations as reported in the Annual Report and Accounts.
Annual cash flow conversion over the three-year performance period is averaged to provide a focus on the sustainable delivery of cash-backed profits.

Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 61 Remuneration report continued The performance conditions for these LEAP awards are as follows: Two-thirds of the 2015 LEAP award equating to 100% of salary is subject to EPS and cash flow conversion targets, as set out in the table below: 50% of salary based Vesting % of maximum 50% of salary based on annual average for Executive Directors on EPS growth cash flow conversion Threshold 17% 6% pa 95% Target 50% 9% pa 100% Maximum 100% 12% pa 110% One-third of the 2015 LEAP award is subject to strategic performance metrics that are aligned to the Companys sustainability agenda and drive shareholder value.
For 2015, this is based on two quantifiable and stretching strategic measures that apply equally: delivery of sustainability through measurable cost-savings and efficiencies that will provide contributions to the Companys profit of 96 million over the performance period: and strategic growth measured through the achievement of secured and probable, profitable new orders over the performance period with a book-to-bill ratio of more than one.
Vesting under each strategic element will be based on an audited assessment of performance that will be provided to the Remuneration Committee.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the vesting reflects the underlying performance of Carillion and retains the flexibility to adjust the vesting amount to ensure it remains appropriate.
It is often not possible to assess this formulaically and any adjustment will depend on the nature, timing and materiality of any contributory factors.
In order to maintain transparency, the Remuneration Committee will disclose how the Company has performed against each of the strategic metrics at the end of the performance period and will disclose any adjustments made to ensure that vesting appropriately reflects the underlying performance of the business.
A malus provision is operated that gives the Remuneration Committee the right to reduce any LEAP awards that have not yet vested in relation to circumstances of corporate failure, which may have occurred at any time before malus is operated.
Executive Directors are required to hold onto their vested shares for a further two-year period after the end of the three-year performance period.
Long-term incentive awards for 2016 No changes are proposed to the maximum LEAP opportunity for 2016 and this will therefore remain at 150 per cent of salary annually and the proportion of the award vesting for threshold performance remains at 25 per cent of salary.
Two-thirds of the LEAP award up to 100 per cent of salary for Executive Directors will continue to be subject to EPS and cash flow conversion performance targets, as set out above, and one-third up to 50 per cent of salary for Executive Directors will be based on two quantifiable and stretching strategic measures that will apply equally: delivery of sustainability through measurable cost-saving and efficiencies that will provide contributions to the Companys profit of 108 million over the performance period: and strategic growth measured through the achievement of secured and probable, profitable new orders over the performance period with a book-to-bill ratio of more than one.
Dividend equivalents will be earned on the LEAP vested shares over the course of the performance period and holding period and will also be earned on the 2014 and 2015 LEAP awards.
Total pension entitlements including defined benefit schemes Pensionable salary is limited by an internal cap.
The Carillion cap commenced at the level of 110,000 for the tax year 2006-07 and rose in line with the published increases in HMRCs Life Time Allowance to the current level of 132,700 which has applied since 2010-11.
Future increases are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Salary supplements are paid in respect of salary over the internal cap.
Executive Directors receive pension contributions and supplements up to 40 per cent of salary.
Executive Directors who participate in the Companys defined contribution plan are required to pay 9 per cent of the earnings cap.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 62 Governance The defined benefit scheme was closed to future accrual in April 2009 and Executive Directors who were members of this scheme became deferred pensioners.
Their deferred benefits are based on pensionable salary and service at the date of closure.
Richard Howson was a deferred member of this scheme during the year and details of the pension accrued to him are included below.

2 The accrued pension allows for inflation from the members date of leaving to the current date, consistent with the approach taken in prior years, which differs from statutory revaluation.
3 R ichard Howson transferred his benefits out of the Carillion Staff Scheme during the year and therefore the member no longer has any entitlement to benefits from the Scheme.
The figures provided at 31 December 2015 are therefore illustrative only and are not available for payment from the scheme.

Death-in-service benefits are provided as part of membership of the defined contribution plan.
Payments to past Directors There were no payments made to past Directors during the period in respect to services provided to the Company as a Director.
Payments for loss of office There were no payments for loss of office during the period.
Shareholding guidelines and total shareholdings of Directors To provide alignment with shareholders interests and to promote share ownership, each Executive Director is required to hold the net number of shares acquired through the LEAP and, with effect from 1 January 2014, the deferred bonus plan until the value of their total shareholding is equal to their annual salary.
