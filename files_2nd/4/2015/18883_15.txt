As outlined in last year's Remuneration Report, Karen Witts was appointed to the role of Chief Financial Officer at a salary below the market median with a plan to bring her up to median as she became established in role.
Karen has developed strongly in the role and is now considered by the Remuneration Committee to be fully established.
Accordingly her salary was increased by 4.8% to 550,000.
This completes the phased movement in her salary since joining the Board and, from now on, she will be considered for salary reviews as for any other executive director.
The average salary increase across the wider UK employee population was 2%.

LTIP The value of LTIPs shown in the single figure table shows the level of award resulting from targets set and measured over the relevant reporting period.
The 2011 PSP award level was determined with reference to performance ending in 2013 14.
Therefore, although the vesting of this award was in two equal tranches in June 2014 and June 2015, the full combined value of the two elements was shown in 2013 14 using the share price for the last three months of the 2013 14 financial year.
There was no LTIP based on performance ending in 2014 15 and hence the value for the 2014 15 column is nil.
The shares which vested during the financial year on 17 June 2014 under the first tranche are set out below along with the second tranche which is due to vest on 17 June 2015.

4 This is the second tranche, being the second half of the total number of shares vesting adjusted for dividend equivalents during the 2014 15 financial year and time prorated for the two former executive directors.

Pensions audited information UK pension arrangements Executive directors based in the UK are eligible to join the UK defined-contribution pension plan the DC Scheme.
The Company operates a policy to limit the combined employer and member pension contributions during a tax year to the annual allowance currently 40,000, with the excess employer contribution being directed into a taxable monthly cash allowance.
In addition, executive directors may choose to opt out of the DC Scheme completely, for example, if they have reached the lifetime allowance currently 1.25m.
A summary of the arrangements for the UK-based executive directors is set out below.
Employer contribution rate into Member of the Cash allowance in lieu of employer defined contribution pension scheme UK DC Scheme contributions into DC Scheme Executive directors Vronique Laury 14% No Yes, in full Kevin OByrne 20% No Yes, in full Karen Witts 20% Yes Yes, in excess of the annual allowance Former executive directors Sir Ian Cheshire 30% Yes Yes, in excess of the annual allowance Cash allowances are provided on a cost-neutral basis for the Company.
This means that a discount is applied for those executive directors joining after the introduction of pension salary sacrifice SMART pensions in 2012.
This takes into account the fact that employers national insurance is payable on the cash alternative whereas currently it is not payable on employer pension contributions into the defined-contribution scheme.
Accordingly, the cash alternative for Vronique Laury is 12.5% of base salary and 17.5% of base salary for Karen Witts.
Based on Vronique Laurys current working pattern and her habitual residency status, there is a legal requirement for her to remain in the French social security system rather than move to the UK system.
Ms Laurys pension benefit has been reduced to the employer contribution rate available to all UK employees to take into account the fact that she will continue to accrue pension rights in the French state system.
This will be continually monitored and, in the event that she does revert to the UK social security system, her pension benefit may increase to an employer DC contribution of 20% of salary or a cash alternative of 17.5%, in line with the approved Remuneration Policy.
Kingsher Annual Report 2014 15 54 Governance Non-UK pension arrangements Philippe Tible was a member of a separate French defined benefit pension scheme.
A condition for a pension to crystallise under nd this scheme required Mr Tible to leave the Kingfisher Group no earlier than his 62 birthday.
This condition was met following the termination of his contract of employment on 31 January 2015.
On leaving the Group he qualified for a deferred defined benefit pension of 225,289 based on 12 years of service with the Company which could be drawn from the schemes normal retirement date at the age of 65.
The scheme allows for the early drawing of the pension providing a 3% discount factor is applied for each year it is drawn early, for which Mr Tible opted.
Accordingly, the final pension payable which Mr Tible started to draw from his date of leaving was 213,928 per annum.
During the year the relevant French works councils and the potential beneficiaries of this scheme were informed of its closure from the end of the 2014 15 financial year.

At his date of termination on 31 January 2015, the value of pension was 34,997, which can be drawn from the normal retirement date of the age of 65.
Sir Ian has chosen to draw his pension immediately resulting in a 3% discount being applied per year of early drawing.
2 The increase in Sir Ian's defined-benefit arrangement over the year was an indexation uplift of 0.7% 243 to 34,997.

Performance graph The graph below shows Kingfishers total shareholder return TSR for the six years to 31 January 2015, which assumes that 100 was invested in Kingfisher on 1 February 2009.
The Company chose the FTSE100 Index as an appropriate comparator for this graph, as Kingfisher has been a constituent of that index throughout the period.

2 The original LTIP grant level shows the award level initially given three years prior to the date the vesting percentage was determined.
3 The value of the LTIP for 2013 14, when the award level for the 2011 PSP was determined, has been restated using the share price at the date of vesting for the first tranche, which vested in June 2014, and the average share price for the last three months of the 2014 15 financial year for the second tranche, which is due to vest in June 2015.
4 Sir Ian Cheshire stepped down as Chief Executive Officer on 8 December 2014 and Ms Laury took over the position on this date.
Sir Ian Cheshire's remuneration in the table is from the start of the financial year up until 8 December 2014, and Ms Laury's is from 8 December to the end of the financial year.
Change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer The table below shows how the percentage change in the Chief Executive Officers salary, benefits and bonus between 2013 14 and 2014 15 compared with the average percentage change in the average of each of those components for all full-time equivalent employees based in the UK.
The UK employee workforce was chosen as a suitable comparator group as the Chief Executive Officer is based in the UK albeit with a global role and responsibilities and pay changes across the Group vary widely depending on local market conditions.
As required by statute, the table shows the details for the Chief Executive Officer role and therefore includes a combination of the remuneration of Sir Ian Cheshire and Vronique Laury for 2014 15.
As Ms Laurys overall remuneration is lower than Sir Ian Cheshires, the calculation for 2014 15 results in a downward movement in the year-on-year percentage change.
If the table below reflected Sir Ian Cheshires remuneration for the full financial year, the percentage movement on a like-for-like basis would be an increase of 2.0% in base salary and a decline of 21.8% across the three elements combined.
The significant benefits movement for the Chief Executive Officer is due to the inclusion of initial relocation support offered to Ms Laury in 2014 15 and the Sharesave Plan that vested for Sir Ian Cheshire.

2 The main grant date for the 2014 LTIP was 3 July 2014.
At the time of grant, the business was considering plans for CEO succession, and as this was considered to be potentially price-sensitive, there were restrictions on share dealing for certain senior individuals which included the executive directors at the time and Ms Laury.
As a result the grant was delayed until shortly after the public announcement on CEO succession on 10 September 2014.
The share price between the two dates fell, so in order to prevent executive directors benefiting from the delay, the number of shares awarded was based on 200% of salary using the share price at the main grant date on 3 July 2014.
As well as not benefiting from the delayed grant, the Company did not wish for executive directors to be disadvantaged.
The vesting date for the main grant was therefore applied, being 3 July 2017.
This explains why the face value of the award in the table is less than 200% of salary and why the vesting period is less than three years.
3 All awards lapse seven years less one day from the actual date of grant.
4 The award for Ms Laury was based on her position before her appointment as Chief Executive Officer.
The performance measures attached to the 2014 LTIP were EPS and KEP with equal weighting of 50% each.
A definition of KEP is included in the glossary.
The targets for the EPS element were as follows: Threshold Maximum Performance Measure 25% vesting 100% vesting Earnings per share compound annual growth up to 2016 17 4% 11.5% The EPS growth targets were set to be consistent with market practice in the FTSE 100 and in particular the retail sector.
The intention is to operate this range consistently over the policy period.
The threshold level of performance provides for real growth, which is considered suitably challenging in what remains an uncertain economic environment, but sets an achievable level of performance to ensure participants place value on the plan and are motivated by it.
The Maximum performance level ensures that full vesting is only achieved for outstanding double-digit performance over a three-year period, well in advance of typical industry growth rates.
KEP targets are calibrated to be consistent with the EPS growth targets, recognising that in weaker performance scenarios offsetting capital efficiencies should be identified, whereas stronger performance scenarios may allow increased capital investment.
The Board considers the KEP targets to be commercially confidential because of the additional information they contain regarding potential capital investment plans, and so these targets will be disclosed in full at the point of vesting of the award.

com 61 Directors Remuneration Report continued Dilution limits Kingfishers share plans contain limits that set out the quantum of newly issued shares that may be used to satisfy awards granted under those plans.
These limits are in line with the current Investment Association guidance on headroom limits which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a ten-year period in relation to the Companys issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten-year period on executive plans.
The Company has always operated within these limits.
The Committee regularly monitors the position and prior to the making of any award considers the effect of potential vesting of options or share awards to ensure that the Company remains within these limits.
Any awards which are required to be satisfied by market purchased shares are excluded from such calculations.
No treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended 31 January 2015.

This is a second and final adjustment to align her with the market following her appointment in 2012.
It is the Companys intention to move Ms Laurys base salary towards the market median over the next three to four years.
This may result in percentage reviews being in high single digits as she develops and performs in her role.
Benefits Implemented in line with Policy.
Pension Implemented in line with Policy.
Annual Bonus 2015 16 Implemented in line with Policy.
The weightings of the metrics in the annual bonus scheme for 2015 16 are as follows: Profit before tax 30% Like-for-like sales 30% Working capital 20% Personal objectives 20% For the financial metrics, all executive directors will be measured on Group performance.
At threshold level of performance, the award will be 10% of maximum.
Profit before tax excludes exceptional items according to the judgement of the Committee.
Like-for-like sales is set as an absolute target, but the Committee applies judgement in measuring the outcome against target, taking into account sales growth against the local market out-turn and any consequent increase or decrease in market share.
Any exchange rate upsides downsides will be removed from the results when determining award levels, since they are considered to be outside the executive directors control.
In the opinion of the Board Remuneration Committee, the annual bonus performance conditions and personal objectives for 2015 16 are commercially sensitive and accordingly are not disclosed.
These will be disclosed retrospectively next year to the extent that they are not commercially sensitive.
Kingsher Annual Report 2014 15 62 Governance Long-Term Incentive Plan 2015 Implemented in line with Policy.
The performance measures to be attached to the 2015 LTIP are EPS and KEP with equal weighting of 50% each.
The targets for the EPS element are as follows: Threshold - Maximum Performance Measure 25% vesting 100% vesting Earnings per share compound annual growth up to 2017 18 4% 11.5% The EPS growth targets were set to be consistent with market practice in the FTSE 100 and in particular the retail sector.
The maximum performance level ensures that full vesting is only achieved for outstanding double-digit performance over a three-year period, well in advance of typical industry growth rates.
The Board considers the KEP targets to be commercially confidential because of the additional information they contain regarding potential capital investment plans so these targets will be disclosed in full at the point of vesting of the award.
Malus and clawback As a result of the UK Corporate Governance Code published in 2014, clawback provisions have now been included in the rules of the annual bonus scheme and the Kingfisher Incentive Share Plan.
Clawback provisions will apply for three years from the award of an annual bonus and two years from the vesting of a long-term incentive.
The malus and clawback provisions allow unvested awards to be reduced or delivered awards to be recovered in the following circumstances: x The Companys financial results being materially misstated: x The determination of the award being made in error: x The actions of a participant leading to the Company suffering reputational damage: or x Material misconduct of a participant.

Kingsher Annual Report 2014 15 72 Governance Notes to the remuneration policy table Annual bonus The performance conditions are set annually based on the metrics the Committee feels are most appropriate for the business.
Like-for-like sales performance is a key metric, and profit before tax ensures that this sales growth is delivered in a way that creates value for shareholders.
Other strategic KPIs are chosen to support particular objectives for the year, and the individual component enables outstanding contribution to be incentivised and rewarded.
Annual bonus targets are set with reference to internal budgets and analyst consensus forecasts, with maximum pay-out requiring performance well ahead of budget.
Long-term incentive plan The Committee believes that long-term incentive plan measures should be aligned to shareholder value while providing line of sight to management, so that they are meaningful and incentivising.
EPS growth is a key measure of our success in growing value for shareholders over time, while KEP balances profit growth with efficient management of our balance sheet.
The setting of LTIP targets takes into account analyst consensus forecasts, internal projections, and the levels of performance required over the long term to deliver absolute value appreciation for shareholders.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees All employees are entitled to base salary and benefits and may also receive bonus, pension, profit share and share awards which vary according to local jurisdiction and market practice.
The maximum provision and incentive opportunity available is determined by the seniority and responsibility of the role.

Remuneration Car allowance as an alternative to a company car and pension benefit.
Cash benefits The Company provides a range of additional benefits, including private medical insurance on a family basis, death-in-service Non-cash benefits cover equal to four-times base salary, a subsidised staff canteen, a staff discount card, allowance for financial planning and 30 working days holiday per year.
Reimbursement of reasonably incurred costs in accordance with their duties.
Expenses During employment and for 12 months after leaving.
In respect of Philippe Tible, an amount equal to 50% of annual salary Non-compete and car benefit must be paid to him on a monthly basis if his employment is terminated by the Company.
This amount is standard under French law in order to ensure that the non-compete provision is enforceable.
In the case of resignation, no payments on departure will be made on termination, even if by mutual agreement the notice period Contractual is cut short.
If notice is served by the Company in full, no other payments should be due on departure.
For any period of notice termination payment period not served, the payment takes the form of liquidated damages, which pays the departing executive 8.3% of salary per Executive directors month for the remainder of their notice period.
These monthly payments are subject to mitigation.
The maximum payment post departure would be 1 x base salary.
If notice is served by either party, the executive director may continue to receive base salary and benefits for the duration of their notice period, during which time the executive director may continue their duties or be assigned a period of garden leave.
The Groups policy is that payments for termination will not exceed 12 months base salary.
The terms of the phased payment clauses in the service contracts of Sir Ian Cheshire and Kevin OByrne were consistent with the governance guidelines at the time the contracts were put in place.
In circumstances where the Company were to terminate their agreements, they would have received phased payments of 15% and 12% of base salary respectively for a maximum of 12 months from the date of termination subject to mitigation.
The termination clause in Philippe Tibles contract would have been determined by the collective convention which applies to all French employees.
A termination payment would have been made up of two parts: i the dismissal indemnity which would have been 3% of annual remuneration per year of service and ii a payment for any unpaid notice which would have been a maximum of three months remuneration.
The combined cost based on years of service to date would have been approximately 1 x base salary.
Remuneration in this context consists of base salary, car benefit and cash bonus award.
In the event of a compromise or settlement agreement, the Committee may agree payments it considers reasonable in settlement of legal claims.
This may include an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under employment protection legislation in the UK or in other jurisdictions.

non-executive directors Kingsher Annual Report 2014 15 74 Governance If notice is served by either party, the executive director may receive bonus payments in cash on a prorated basis from the Leaver provisions for start of the financial year up to the date of termination of employment, based on the determination of the results at the annual bonus year end against targets set.
In the event that an executive director ceases to be employed during or shortly after the financial year and before the date of the annual bonus award, the Committee has the discretion to make a bonus payment and determine the basis upon which it is made and its value taking into account the individual circumstances of the departure.
If the executive ceases employment as a result of a reason defined as a good leaver which includes ill-heath or retirement, then the normal approach would be to award a time prorated bonus in cash based on the actual results against the performance measures set once they have been determined following the end of the financial year.
In the case of resignation, no bonus award will be made.
