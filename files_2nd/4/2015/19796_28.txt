Bonus targets Bonus targets are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive as they would give away details of our budgeting to competitors.
We therefore do not publish details of the targets on a prospective basis.
However, we will provide full and transparent disclosure of the targets and the performance against these targets on a retrospective basis in next years Annual Report at the same time the bonus outcome is reported.
The targets set are considered to be appropriately stretching taking into account the internal budget and external forecasts.
Performance Share Plan PSP The performance measures for the PSP award for 2015 have been changed from those used in the last few years.
The priority is to have a plan aligned to two key strategic priorities: Delivery of significant value to shareholders through share price and dividend performance: and Returning the business to be one that generates sustainable, quality cash flow.
Therefore, we will use a combination of relative Total Shareholder Return and Cumulative Retail Cash Generated from Operations to determine awards.

The initial measurement period for the TSR calculation will be based on the three-month average share price of 1 October 2014 to 31 December 2014.
This start period has been selected as a one-time approach to be aligned with the timing of the appointment of the new executive team and to recognise that both the CEO and CFO changed their plans and joined the business earlier, providing vital leadership during a challenging time for the business and taking immediate action to commence a significant change programme.
The performance period will continue to the end of financial year 2017 18 to ensure that management is incentivised over three complete financial years and awards will not vest until three years following the date of grant.
The final measurement period will be 1 December 2017 to 28 February 2018.
It is anticipated that any future TSR initial measurement periods will revert to standard market practice, being the three months immediately prior to the start of the performance period.

Targets were set as a matrix of stretching earnings growth and sustainable Return on Capital Employed targets.
The increase in undiluted EPS over three years from 2012 13 to 2014 15 and ROCE performance for 2014 15 were below threshold.

Shareholding guidelines and share ownership Share ownership guidelines Four times base salary for the CEO Three times base salary for the CFO The purpose is to create alignment with the interests of shareholders This requirement is at the upper end of typical market practice for similar-size companies The Remuneration Committee believes that a significant shareholding by Executive Directors aligns their interests with shareholders and demonstrates their ongoing commitment to the business.
Shareholding guidelines policy Shares included Shares held outright will be included in the calculation of shareholding guidelines, as will shares held by an Executives connected persons.
Shares held in plans which are not subject to forfeiture will be included on a net of tax basis for the purposes of calculating Executive Directors shareholdings.
Vested but unexercised market value share options are not included in the calculation.
Accumlation period New appointees will be expected to achieve this minimum level of shareholding within five years of appointment.
PSP participation Full participation in the PSP will generally be conditional upon maintaining the minimum shareholding.
Holding policy Where an Executive Director does not meet the shareholding requirement they will be required to hold, and not dispose of, at least 50% of the net number of shares that vest under incentive arrangements until they meet this requirement.
Given the importance of owning shares, the Executive Committee and a number of other senior managers are also required to build a holding of Tesco shares.
The chart below illustrates the value of Executive Directors shareholdings, based on the three-month average share price to 28 February 2015 of 209.6p per share, compared to the shareholding guideline.
Dave Lewis and Alan Stewart will be expected to meet the shareholding requirement by 1 September 2019 and 23 September 2019 respectively.

54 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Share dealing policy Tesco has a share dealing policy in place for Executive Directors and for members of the Executive Committee.
This policy prevents Executive Directors and Executive Committee members and their connected persons dealing in shares at times when this would be prohibited by the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules.
At all times, Executive Directors and Executive Committee members must seek advance clearance before dealing in shares on their own behalf or in respect of their connected persons.
Further details on the buyout awards The Committees policy is that where appropriate awards forfeited on leaving a previous employer should be bought out taking into account the expected level of performance.
Buyout awards should vest over an equivalent period to awards forfeited.
Dave Lewis On leaving Unilever, Dave Lewis forfeited outstanding awards under the performance-related deferred bonus matching plan MCIP and under the long-term performance plan GSIP.
These awards were subject to performance and were capable of vesting between 0% and 200% of the initial award granted.
Unilever does not disclose targets for long-term incentive awards and therefore it was not possible to estimate the level of vesting for outstanding awards.
The Committee therefore decided that it was appropriate to buy out these awards assuming that performance was met at target i. e. 100% vesting of the initial award.
The Committee considered that this level of vesting was appropriate as the average vesting at Unilever over the past three years was 110% of target.
These awards vest on the same date as the original Unilever awards would have vested.
Dave Lewis also received a cash payment of 525,000 reflecting the expected 2014 bonus, which was forfeited on leaving Unilever.
This was a pro-rata payment based on time in employment during the Unilever financial year and the average payout received over the previous three years.
Alan Stewart On leaving Marks & Spencer M&S, Alan Stewart forfeited outstanding awards under the deferred bonus plan and the performance-related long-term incentive plan.
Deferred bonus shares were not subject to future performance conditions and therefore these awards were bought out in full.
The level of vesting for 2012, 2013 and 2014 PSP awards was estimated based on performance to date.
The estimated levels of vesting were 12%, 25.8% and 42% respectively.
If the 2014 M&S award vests at less than 42% then the corresponding buyout award will be reduced to reflect this.
Awards vest on the same date as the original M&S awards.
Alan Stewart will also receive a further award in respect of his 2014 15 M&S bonus forfeited.
This will be based on the payment he would have received had he remained at M&S pro-rated for time and will be paid 50% in cash and 50% in Tesco shares deferred for three years.
The actual value of this award is currently unknown and therefore we have estimated that he would receive a target bonus.
This equates to an amount of 400,000 which is included in the single figure table as an estimated value.
This will be adjusted in next years report to show the amount that was actually paid.
The buyout awards made to Dave Lewis and Alan Stewart on 24 October 2014 were granted under Listing Rule 9.4.
The value of awards was calculated using the share prices of Tesco, Unilever and M&S as relevant over four dealing days immediately after joining Tesco.
Awards were made over nil cost options and are subject to continued employment until the relevant vesting date.
The buyout award in respect of Alan Stewarts 2014 15 M&S bonus will be made in June 2015 under Listing Rule 9.4.
The value of this award will be calculated using the market price of Tesco shares at the date of grant.
Awards accrue dividend equivalents and are subject to malus, in the circumstances set out on page 64, until the shares are transferred.
Pensions This section has been audited.
Dave Lewis and Alan Stewart receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension of 25% of base salary.
Philip Clarke and Laurie McIlwee are members of the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme, which provides a pension of up to two-thirds of base salary on retirement, normally at age 60, dependent on service final salary scheme.
Each years pension earned before 1 June 2012 will be increased in line with the Retail Price Index up to a maximum of 5%, and pension earned after 1 June 2012 in line with the Consumer Price Index up to a maximum of 5%.
Pension accrued before 1 June 2012 and drawn before age 60 will be actuarially reduced to reflect early retirement.
Pension accrued from 1 June 2012 will be actuarially reduced if it is drawn before the age at which a full pension is paid originally age 62 but subject to adjustment up or down to reflect unexpected changes in life expectancy.
Since April 2006, following implementation of the regulations contained within the Finance Act 2004, Executive Directors have been eligible to receive the maximum pension that can be provided from the registered Pension Scheme without incurring additional tax charges.
The balance of any pension entitlement for Executive Directors is delivered through an unfunded retirement benefit scheme SURBS.
The SURBS is secured by using a fixed and floating charge over a cash deposit in a designated account.
Executive Directors who are members of the final salary scheme are required to contribute 10% of salary.

Payments to former Directors This information has been audited.
There were no payments made to former Directors which exceeded the fide minimis threshold of 10,000 set by the Company.
Payments made to Philip Clarke and Laurie McIlwee in respect of them ceasing employment are set out below.
Loss of office payments This information has been audited.
Early in the investigation of the commercial income issue, the Company announced that it had suspended payment of the termination amounts due.
The Company, with legal advice, then fully evaluated the available evidence relating to Philip Clarke and Laurie McIlwee in relation to the commercial income issue.
Under the relevant service contracts, payments were legally due and payable unless Tesco was able to establish a case of gross misconduct by the relevant Director.
Having taken detailed legal advice, the Board determined that there was not any basis to continue to withhold payments, and that defending potential claims that may arise, in the absence of such a basis, would not be in the Companys best interests.
Therefore, the payments have been made.
However, if new information arises which would change this assessment, we have explicitly reserved the Companys rights to pursue recovery of these payments.
Leaving arrangements for Philip Clarke Philip Clarke stepped down as CEO and as an Executive Director of Tesco PLC on 1 September 2014 when the new CEO, Dave Lewis, joined the Company.

Outside appointments Tesco recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other companies.
Such Non-executive duties can broaden a Directors experience and knowledge which can benefit Tesco.
Subject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are allowed to accept Non-executive appointments, provided that these appointments are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest, and they may retain the fees received.

Other disclosures Change in CEO remuneration compared to the change in colleague remuneration The following table illustrates the change in CEO salary, benefits and bonus between 2013 14 and 2014 15 compared to other UK colleagues.
The Committee decided to use other UK colleagues for the purpose of this disclosure as over half of our colleagues are based in the UK and the CEO is also predominantly based in the UK albeit with a global role and responsibilities.
The Committee therefore considered that this is an appropriate comparator group given that pay changes across the Group depend on local market conditions.
