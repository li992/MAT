Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Directors Remuneration Report Directors Remuneration Policy Set out below is our remuneration strategy and policy together with other relevant information about the terms and conditions applicable to executive Directors of the Group: 1.
Overview Our remuneration strategy is designed to be simple and transparent.
In setting levels of remuneration it is important to: Reflect the interests and expectations of shareholders and other stakeholders Take account of pay and employment conditions of employees in the Group Reward the sustained growth and profitability of the business Encourage management to adopt a level of risk which is in line with the risk profile of the business as approved by the board Ensure there is no reward for failure by having no entitlement to compensation for loss of office 2.
Executive Directors potential remuneration Executive Directors receive basic pay only.
There are no bonus or incentive schemes in operation or any form of share option scheme or long term incentive plan.
The executive Directors are incentivised by their substantial interests in family shareholdings which more directly align their interests with shareholders generally.
Strategy Purpose The salary is set to be competitive, relative to other companies operating in the same sector.
Annual review A review of executive Directors salaries is carried out each year once the results for the year are known and with reference to a comprehensive peer group of similar companies.
The annual review takes into consideration: Individual responsibilities, experience and performance Salary levels for similar positions in comparable businesses The level of pay increases awarded to staff whose services are provided by management companies Economic and market conditions Overall performance of the business There is no overall limit to maximum increases save as to comply with the strategy outlined above.

Benefits There are no additional benefits granted to any Director over and above basic pay.
Pension The Group does not operate a pension scheme for the Directors and therefore they do not receive either pension contributions or entitlement to pension benefits as part of their remuneration by the Group.
Recruitment and executive Directors No new appointments of executive Directors have been made for a number of years but if an appointment was made, salary would take into account market data for the relevant role, the individuals experience and the responsibilities expected of them.
Service contracts No Director has a service contract.
Company policy is to employ executive Directors at will, with no contractual entitlement to compensation for loss of office.
