Pension arrangements T J Cooper withdrew from participation in the defined contribution section of the Groups UK pension scheme witheffect from 1April2014 as a consequence of the change in Lifetime Allowance effective at that date.
L S Burdett and M L Court participate in the defined contribution section of the Groups UK pension scheme.
Members of the UK pension scheme are entitled to life assurance cover of four times salary and a retirement pension subject to the scheme rules: if a member dies whilst in pensionable service, the value of the members retirement account will be used by the trustees to provide either or both a lump sum and a pension payable to dependents.
DRHummel will continue to participate in a defined contribution scheme and a life assurance plan operated in respect of the Groups US employees.
TheGroups contribution to his pension scheme and associated salary supplement remain at 25% of salary.
Where the promised levels of benefits cannot be provided through the appropriate scheme, the Group will continue to provide benefits through the provision of salary supplements.
Annual bonus The maximum bonus potential for the year ending 30 September 2016 will remain at 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of basic salary for the Group Finance Director and the Managing Directors.
Awards continue to be determined based on a combination of both the Groups financial results, being growth in Group profit before tax weighted at 80%, and an executives personal performance achievement level weighted at 20%.
The Group believes that this combination of financial and personal performance objectives reflects the strategic focus on Group profit while maintaining a measurement of personal contribution across key operational goals for the business.
The Committee will continue to run a thorough annual review of personal objectives to ensure they are measurable, robust and aligned with overall Group-wide objectives.
Any amount of bonus will only be payable if, in the opinion of the Committee, there is an improvement in the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group during the year ending 30 September 2016.
If this is not achieved, the Committee will retain the discretion to reduce the value of award which would otherwise have been payable.
Deferral into shares for any part of the Chief Executives bonus above 100% of salary and the clawback provisions for all executive Directors will continue to apply.
Victrex plc 56 Annual Report 2015 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Annual Report on Remuneration continued Long-term incentives The extent to which LTIP awards which will be granted for the 2015 2016 financial year will vest, will be dependent on two independent performance conditions 25% determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return TSR and 75% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS, as follows: u the TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three-year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 25% on a pro-rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance: and u the EPS element of an award will vest in full if average annual EPS growth exceeds 12% over the three-year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 20% on a pro-rata basis if EPS growth exceeds 6% per annum on average over the period and is reduced to nil if average annual EPS growth over the period fails to exceed 6%.
As noted in the Chairmans Review, the EPS measure has been emphasised in LTIP awards to be made from the year ending 30 September 2016 onward.
In addition, the EPS performance range has been restated in order to better reflectrelevant analyst forecasts, the Groups internal EPS projections and competitor and FTSE 250 market EPSperformance ranges.
As set out in the 2013 Directors Remuneration Policy Report, awards granted from December 2013 onwards are subject to a clawback provision.
Non-executive Directors The Companys approach to non-executive Directors remuneration is set by the Board, with account taken of the time and responsibility involved in each role, including, where applicable, the Chairmanship of Board Committees.
