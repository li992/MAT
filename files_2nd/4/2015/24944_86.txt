Adjusted PBT was up in two of five regions.
Adjusted revenue increased by $538m or 1% in 2015 to $57,765m compared with $57,227m for 2014, driven by revenue growth in clientfacing GB&M, principally in Equities and Foreign Exchange.

LICs increased in CMB and in RBWM.
Adjusted operating expenses increased by $1,606m or 5% to $36,182m compared with $34,576m for 2014, reflecting investment in growth, and regulatory programmes and compliance costs.
Excluding the bank levy which is booked in the fourth quarter each year, operating expenses in the second half of 2015 were broadly in line with the first half of the year.
This was despite investment and inflationary pressures, and partly reflects the initial effect of our cost saving initiatives and a strong focus on cost management.
Dividends in respect of 2015 increased from $0.50 per ordinary share in 2014 to $0.51 per ordinary share.
Our CRD IV end point CET1 capital ratio of 11.9% at 31 December 2015 was up from 11.1% at 31 December 2014.
We continue to generate capital from profit and our progress to achieve targeted RWA initiatives strengthened our CET1 ratio, creating capacity for growth.
