Baroness Ford an individual which has caused financial loss to Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 2015 Annual Remuneration Report The following section provides details of how the Companys Remuneration Policy was applied during the financial year ending 31 December 2015 and how it will be applied in 2016.
For David Sleath, the taxable benefits figure has reduced as he has elected to take cash in lieu of a Company car.
2 As Andy Gulliford and Phil Redding are members of the defined benefit pension scheme, this sum comprises the pension input value increase in accrued pension.
Further information can be found on page 103.
For David Sleath and Justin Read, this sum comprises cash paid in lieu of pension.
3 Includes the cash Bonus payable and monetary value of the shares awarded under the DSBP.
In accordance with the Remuneration Policy, 50 per cent of any Bonus earned in 2015 will be deferred into shares under the DSBP.
As the MSCI IPD Benchmark data was not available at the date of publication of the 2014 Annual Report, the 2014 Bonus payments disclosed last year were based on an estimate of 0 per cent of the TPR element.
The TPR element has since been confirmed at 0 per cent and accordingly no adjustment has been made to the 2014 figure.
See page 96 for details of the Bonus payment 2015.
4 In the 2014 Annual Report, the monetary value of the 2012 Transitionary LTIP Award was estimated using a share price of 3.74.
This has been updated to reflect that when this award actually vested in May2015, the share price on the date of release was 4.29.
Consequently, the sum disclosed in the multiple year variable LTIP for 2014 is higher than the sum disclosed in the 2014 Annual Report.
The 2014reported figures were: David Sleath 632,000: Andy Gulliford 289,000: Justin Read 413,000: and, Phil Redding 272,000.
See page 101 for details about the calculation of the 2012 LTIP Award.
5 Includes SIP, based on the number of shares awarded during the year and the share price at the date of grant, and Sharesave based on the discount represented by the option price, multiplied by the annual savings.
95 SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Remuneration Committee Report continued Base salary and benefits With effect from 1 April 2015, the Chief Executives base salary was 583,495 and the base salaries of the Group Finance Director, Chief Investment Officer and the Chief Operating Officer were each 381,924.
With effect from 1 April 2016, each of the Executive Directors will receive an increase to base salary of 3 per cent, which is in line with the average all employee increase.
The Executive Directors currently receive life assurance, private medical insurance, car cash allowance and pension contributions or cash in lieu of pension, as applicable.
Non-Executive Directors single figure audited The Non-Executive Directors fees are reviewed by the Board in the absence of the Non-Executive Directors, while the fees paid to the Chairman are reviewed by the Committee.
There were no changes to fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors or the Chairman in 2015 see Chart 2 below.
The Non-Executive Directors fees were increased by 2,000 with effect from 1 January 2016.
Following this change the base Non-Executive Director fee is 55,000 per annum, with additional fees of 10,000 for chairing a Board Committee and a further 12,000 for being a Senior Independent Director.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Companys share-based incentive schemes nor do they receive any other benefits or rights under the pension schemes.

Bonus payment 2015 For the Executive Directors, the 2015 Bonus comprised three equally weighted components: EPRA Profit Before Tax PBT : rent roll growth RRG : and relative TPR.
Profit EPRA PBT against target For this element, a Bonus is earned for EPRA PBT performance against target.
25 per cent is earned on achieving the threshold target 118.9 million for 2015, rising to 100 per cent for achieving the maximum target 131.4 million for 2015.
100 per cent of this element was achieved in 2015, with EPRA PBT performance for bonus purposes of 136.4 million achieved, exceeding the target by 5.0 million.
Rent roll growth RRG against target For this element, a Bonus is earned if the rent roll growth from the existing standing stock is positive the threshold.
Once the threshold is achieved, the Bonus is determined based on total RRG existing standing stock plus the impact of development RRG, with a sliding pay-out scale rising from 0per cent for flat total RRG through to 100 per cent for achieving the maximum increase 16.1 million in 2015.
In 2015, RRG from standing stock was positive, thus ensuring the threshold was achieved.
Total RRG including the contribution from developments was 22.9 million for Bonuspurposes and, accordingly, 100 per cent of this element was achieved.
96 SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements TPR Relative TPR against the MSCI IPD Benchmark For this element, 25 per cent is earned when the Companys TPR for the UK and Continental Europe equals the TPR of a comparable MSCI IPD Benchmark, as calculated by MSCI Real Estate, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent when the Companys TPR exceeds the MSCI IPD Benchmark by 1.5 per cent.
Only the UK data for this calculation was available at the date of this report: TPR for the Companys UK assets under management AUM including 100 per cent of joint venture assets, was 19.0 per cent, compared to the performance of an equivalent MSCI IPD Benchmark of 18.4 per cent, meaning that 55 per cent of the TPR-related Bonus will be earned in respect of UK assets.
However this sum will be adjusted once the 2015 pan-European MSCI IPD data is available.
Note that these figures are different to the figures in the KPIs on page 16 because the MSCI IPD Benchmark for Bonus payments is a bespoke calculation based on a portfolio of properties in the MSCI IPD universe constructed to mirror the Companys AUM as closely as possible, unlike the KPI equivalents which are based on the Companys wholly owned assets plus share of joint venture assets and are compared to the MSCI IPD UK Quarterly All Industrial data.
On the basis of the UK portfolio performance above, the Committee has estimated that 55 per cent of the overall TPR element will be achieved for 2015 Bonus purposes.
Bonus targets for EPRA PBT and RRG are set at the start of the year using the prevailing exchange rate at the time and are adjusted to reflect changes in the business such as acquisitions and disposals.
The EPRA PBT and RRG outturns which have been used to compare to the 2015 targets were calculated using a consistent exchange rate to that used when the target was set and also include adjustments for specific items in accordance with theBonus scheme rules as approved by the Committee.
The EPRA PBT and RRG element of the 2015 Bonus will be paid in April 2016, less a 50 per cent deduction for the DSBP.
Payment of the TPR element will be deferred until summer 2016, when the pan-European MSCI IPD data becomes available.
Accordingly, the actual payment made under the TPR element of the 2015 Bonus, together with the deferral under the DSBP, may differ from the amount disclosed in this Report.
The DSBP award will be made once the final Bonus figures can be calculated.
The vesting of the 2015 DSBP will be in April 2019, the third anniversary of the payment of the profit and RRG element of the 2015 Bonus.
Any payments under the 2016 Bonus and the DSBP will be made in accordance with theRemuneration Policy.

The Committee will determine the TPR element as soon as the measurement can be completed based on actual data.
Any difference between the estimated and actual figures will be reconciled in the 2016 Annual Report.
2016 Bonus framework During the year the Committee reviewed the TPR benchmark used for bonus purposes and for 2016, has decided to align this with the TPR benchmark used for LTIP purposes to aid simplicity and ease of measurement.
Going forward the profit element of the Bonus will be based on Adjusted Profit before tax, the Groups preferred measure of underlying profit.
There are no other changes to the operation of 2016 annual bonuses.
Bonus payment 2014 Calculation of the TPR element of the Bonus payment is based on comparison with the MSCI IPD Benchmark, the data for which was not available at the time of publication of the 2014 Annual Report.
The Remuneration Committee estimated that 0 per cent of this element would be achieved and this was later confirmed based on actual TPR data.
Accordingly, no payment was made under the TPR element of the 2014 Bonus.

LTIP awards made after 2011 are subject to TSR and TPR performance conditions, which are equally weighted and measured over a four-year performance period, save for the 2012 Transitionary award which was measured over a three-year performance period.
The performance conditions for the LTIP awards are based on TSR and TPR.
TSR this benchmark is based on the weighted mean TSR of other FTSE 350 REITs.
25 per cent of this element vests if the Companys four-year TSR isin line with benchmark TSR, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting if the benchmark is exceeded by 5 per cent per year.
TPR this benchmark is based on the MSCI IPD Benchmark with UK European industrials weighted to reflect the geographical mix of the Groups portfolio 75 25 UK Continental Europe for this cycle.
25 per cent of this element vests if the Companys four year TPR is in line with the MSCI IPD Benchmark, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent if the MSCI IPD Benchmark is exceeded by at least 1.5 per cent per year.
On vesting, calculations are reviewed by the auditor and are approved by the Committee.
The Committee retains the discretion to withhold vesting of awards should such payments be deemed inappropriate.
The 2012 Transitionary award vested on 1 May 2015, subject to the TSR and TPR performance conditions over the three-year performance period to 31 December 2014.
The Companys TSR over the period led to a 85.7 per cent vesting of the TSR element and, as estimated in the 2014 Annual Remuneration Report, the TPR element did not vest.
Overall, this resulted in a total payout of 42.85 per cent.
The 2012 LTIP award will vest on 1 May 2016, subject to relative TSR and TPR over the four-year performance period to 31 December 2015.
The Companys TSR over the performance period was 137.2 per cent and the benchmark TSR was 103.0 per cent.
The Companys TSR outperformance of 4.0 per cent per annum compared with the benchmark led to 84.6 per cent of the TSR element vesting.
The TPR data will not be available until after the date of this report.
For the purposes of the Directors single figure calculations Chart 1, the performance for the TPR element has been estimated at 0 per cent.
This is based on the Companys annualised TPR between 2012 and 2014 of 9.7 per cent and the MSCI IPD Benchmark over the same period of 10.5 per cent.
In estimating the overall four year performance, the Committee assumed that SEGROs 2015 relative TPR would be insufficient to overcome the underperformance in the first three years.
Details of the LTIP awards granted to the Executive Directors are set out in Chart 12.
Any awards made under the LTIP in 2016 will be made in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.

Mr Hens was required to give evidence on behalf of the Companys subsidiaries in prosecutions brought in Belgium and the Netherlands against a third party unconnected with the Group.
Remuneration Committee advisers The Committee has access to sufficient resources to discharge its duties, which include access to independent remuneration advisers, the General Counsel and Group Company Secretary, the Group HR Director and other advisers as required.
The Committee is responsible for appointing its external advisers and during the year it received advice from Kepler Associates, a brand of Mercer Kepler, which is a founding member and signatory to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants in the UK, in discharging its responsibilities.
Kepler was appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 2011 following a competitive tender process.
During the year, Kepler provided advice on Executive Directors remuneration, market and best practice guidance.
Its total fees for advice to the Remuneration Committee in 2015 were 44,868 2014: 39,369 on the basis of time and materials.
The Committee evaluates the support provided by its advisers periodically and is comfortable that Kepler provides independent remuneration advice to the Committee and does not have any connections with SEGRO which may impair its independence.
To ensure a consistent approach to remuneration across the Group, Kepler also provides advice to the Company in respect of matters relating to the remuneration of all employees.
Aon Hewitt Limited provided information to the Company in respect of pension-related matters.
During the year, Slaughter and May provided advice to the Company in respect of its share-based incentive schemes as well as regulatory and pension matters.

The full Remuneration Policy as approved by shareholders is available at www.
Remuneration policy The key aim of the Remuneration Policy is to align the interests of Executive Directors with those of the shareholders by supporting the delivery of strategy.
The structure of the remuneration framework is designed to reflect the strategic direction of the business and to align it with the Companys KPIs.
In setting the Remuneration Policy, the Committee takes into consideration, amongst other matters, investor guidelines and the maximum amount of remuneration the Executive Directors could receive should all targets be met.
The Executive Directors remuneration is set within a remuneration framework which applies to all employees across the Group.
Each of the key elements of the remuneration package is designed to drive the creation of long-term shareholder value, without encouraging Executive Directors to take inappropriate risk.
Each year, with the support of external advisers, the Committee undertakes a review of the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
It has oversight of the remuneration of the Leadership Team, who are the senior managers immediately below Board level.
It considers the responsibilities, experience and performance of the Executive Directors and pay across the Group.

106 SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional notes Remuneration Policy: the policy for the Executive Directors is designed with regard to the policy for employees across the Group.
All employees are eligible for an annual Bonus on the same performance measures which are consistent with those of the Executive Directors save that those below Board level have a fourth target based on their individual performance score.
The maximum Bonus opportunity is fixed according to seniority banding across the Company.
The LTIP performance conditions are the same for all participants and the size of awards are determined by seniority.
Subject to consultation with major shareholders, the Committee retains the ability to adjust and or to set different LTIP and Bonus performance measures if events occur such as a change in strategy, a material acquisition and or divestment of a Group business, or change in prevailing market conditions which cause the Committee to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that they achieve their original purpose.
Payments from existing awards: Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval and implementation ofthe Remuneration Policy.

Policy on recruitment In determining appropriate remuneration for a new Executive Director, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders.
The Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, and the proportion of the vesting period remaining, and will seek to do no more than match the fair value of awards foregone.
In limited circumstances where employees are awarded benefits for which Executive Directors are not eligible, such as share retention awards, the Committee would consider honouring existing awards should these employees be appointed to the Board.
Chart 4: Recruitment policy Component Approach Maximum opportunity Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined taking into account the experience and skills of the individual, pay across the Group, relevant market data and their previous salary Bonus The structure set out in the Remuneration Policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant 150% for the Chief Executive and maximum being pro-rated for their first year of employment 120% of salary for Executive Directors DSBP The structure set out in the Remuneration Policy table will apply to new appointees 50% of the bonus awarded will bedeferred LTIP New appointees will be eligible for awards under the LTIP on the same terms as the other Executive Directors 200% of salary 300% in exceptional circumstances Pension New appointees will be offered membership of the SEGRO plc Group Personal Pension Plan or a cash alternative unless already a member of the SEGRO Pension Scheme 108 SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Policy on termination payments The Company retains the right to terminate the service contract of any Executive Director subject to contractually agreed payments in lieu of notice which are limited to annual salary plus any specified benefits.
Payments are normally phased over the 12-month notice period, based on the principle ofa Directors duty to seek alternative employment and thereby mitigate their loss.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith, for example: in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation : or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Directors office or employment.
In determining compensation, the Committee will take into account the circumstances of the departure, best practice and the provisions of the Code, and will take legal advice on the Companys liability to pay compensation.
Under the rules of the LTIP and the DSBP, the Committee has discretion to declare a Director leaving the Company to be a good leaver as defined under the respective rules of the schemes.
In respect of LTIP, this would normally allow the Directors, who the Committee determines to be good leavers, to receive their shares at the date of vesting subject to the achievement of performance conditions, with any vesting pro-rated in accordance with length of service during the period of grant.
In respect of DSBP, this would normally allow the Directors, who the Committee determines to be good leavers, toreceive their shares, in full, at the end of the holding period.
Where a Director may be entitled to pursue a claim against the Company in respect of their statutory employment rights or any other claim arising from the employment or its termination, the Company will be entitled to negotiate settlement terms financial or otherwise with the Director that the Committee considers to be reasonable in all the circumstances and in the best interests of the Company and to enter into a Settlement Agreement with the Director to effect both the terms agreed under the Service Agreement and any additional statutory or other claims, including bonus and or share awards, in line with the policies described above.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the Employee Benefit Trust, in consultation with the Company, has the discretion to determine whether, and the extent to which, awards vest.
Financial performance and institutional guidelines would be taken into account in exercising this discretion.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any compensation on termination of their appointment.
Policy on Executive Directors external appointments With the support of the Chairman and Chief Executive, the Executive Directors may normally be permitted to take one non-executive directorship outside the Group, as these roles can broaden the experience brought to the Board.
Such appointments require Board approval and the time commitment the appointment will require is taken into consideration.
Executive Directors may retain fees for external appointments.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group The Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors is designed with regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole.
The Committee has oversight of the remuneration of the Leadership Team.
The Committee is kept updated through the year on general employment conditions and it approves the budget for annual salary increases.
The Company did not consult with employees in formulating Executive Remuneration Policy.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee remains committed to open dialogue with shareholders on remuneration.
When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into account the guidelines of investor bodies and shareholder views.
In 2011, it consulted with shareholders on changes to the remuneration structure and, inearly 2013, it consulted on an amendment to the Bonus rules.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is available for meetings with shareholders should they have any concerns about remuneration matters which they wish to discuss.
