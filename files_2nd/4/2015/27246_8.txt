ANNUAL REPORT For the year ended 31 December 2015 35 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 ANNUAL REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Remuneration Policy The determination of the Directors fees is a matter dealt with by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and the Board.
The Committee considers the remuneration policy annually to ensure that it remains appropriately positioned.
Directors will review the fees paid to the boards of Directors of similar investment companies.
No Director is to be involved in decisions relating individual aspects of his or her own remuneration, however the Board as a whole sets the level of directors fees.
No Director has a service contract with the Company and Directors appointments may be terminated at any time by one months written notice with no compensation payable at termination.
The Companys policy is for the Directors to be remunerated in the form of fees, payable quarterly in arrears.
No Director has any entitlement to a pension, and the Company has not awarded any share options or long-term performance incentives to any of the Directors.
No element of the Directors remuneration is performance related.
Directors are authorised to claim reasonable expenses from the Company in relation to the performance of their duties.
The Companys policy is that the fees payable to the Directors should reflect the time spent by the Board on the Companys affairs and the responsibilities borne by the Directors and should be sufficient to enable high calibre candidates to be recruited.
During the year 2015, the policy was for the Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the other Committees to be paid a higher fee than the other Directors in recognition of their more onerous roles and more time spent.
The Board may amend the level of remuneration paid within the limits of the Companys Articles of Incorporation.
The Companys Articles of Incorporation limit the aggregate fees payable to the Board of Directors to a total of 500,000 per annum.
The Chairman of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee may consult with principal shareholders of the Company should it be proposed to exceed the aggregate limit.
