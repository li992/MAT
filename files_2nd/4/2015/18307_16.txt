Long term incentive plan Performance conditions Set out below is a summary of the performance conditions that apply to both the LTIP awards maturing in 2015 and the outstanding LTIP awards, including those granted in December 2013 and February 2015.
With effect from 1 October 2014, new LTIP awards were granted under the PSP at 175% of base salary: no further awards have been made under the SMP although existing SMP awards will continue to mature with the final awards maturing in November 2016.
The performance conditions applying to new awards made under the PSP have been revised from those set out below for existing awards granted in 2012 and 2013.
The first performance condition for the LTIP awards is that the average annual compound growth in the Companys adjusted EPS, over the three consecutive financial years following the financial year immediately prior to the grant, must exceed the annual compound growth rate in the UK Retail Price Index RPI by a specified amount over the same period.
For the new awards, the adjusted EPS targets will be specified as absolute figures, not relative to RPI.
The performance conditions are as follows: % of new % of existing awards Existing awards 2012 and 2013 awards vesting New awards from 2014 vesting Adjusted EPS growth over 3 years PSP SMP Adjusted EPS growth over3years PSP RPI 15% p. a. or above 100 100 RPI 12% p. a.
25 Below RPI 3% p. a. Nil Nil Below 5% p. a. Nil Where the Companys adjusted EPS performance is between these percentage bands, vesting of the award is on a straight-line basis.
For the purposes of this condition, EPS is adjusted EPS as defined in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and this definition remains consistent with the definition of adjusted EPS approved by the Committee in previous years.
Remuneration Committee Report continued Annual Report on Remuneration 60 The second performance condition compares the growth of the Companys TSR over a three year period to that of the companies in the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts.
The performance conditions are as follows: % of new % of existing awards Existing awards 2012 and 2013 awards vesting New awards from 2014 vesting TSR relative to FTSE 250 Index over 3 years PSP SMP PSP Median 15% p. a. or greater 100 100 Median 12% p. a.

The FTSE 250 Index was chosen because this is a recognised broad equity market index of which the Company is a member.
Awards vesting in 2015 The PSP and SMP awards made to the Executive Directors on 19 December 2012 and 20 December 2012 respectively, were subject to operating performance conditions, independently assessed over a three year period ended 30 September 2015, as set out in the table above.

The Committee was able to obtain only limited specific feedback from shareholders, however it deduced from these comments and from those made by various proxy agencies that these objections related to the use of discretion, as allowed under the rules of the Scheme, to increase the bonus paid to the Chief Executive Officer by 10% of the amount payable.
Whilst the Committee feels that it is important to retain discretion to amend on occasion awards to Executive Directors, both downwards and upwards, it notes shareholders concerns and commits to appropriate consultation before exercising such discretion in future.

The remuneration of the Executive Director is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to exercise the options to acquire the shares and the total value of the shares on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil cost options on the vesting date he may exercise the options at any time up to the day preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the underlying share price between the initial vesting date and the date of exercise of the option.
This increase or decrease in value reflects an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
