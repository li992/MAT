The awards vested in October at 41.9% and in the above table for the period ended 4 October 2014 the long-term incentives gures have been updated to reect that vesting.
The value has been calculated by multiplying the number of shares in respect of which the awards vested by 1.615 being the market value of a share on 23 October 2015, the date of vesting.
The long-term incentives gure for the period ended 4 October 2014 also includes 2,537 for Andrew Andrea, 1,105 for Peter Dalzell and Ralph Findlay, in respect of SAYE options granted in that period, as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report for the period ended 4 October 2014.
42 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Figures in the single figure table are derived from the following: Total salary and fees The amount of salary fees received in the period.
Taxable benets The taxable value of benets received in the period.
These are car allowance, private medical insurance and life assurance.
Annual bonus The annual bonus earned in the period ended 3 October 2015.
A description of Group performance against which the bonus pay-out was determined is provided on page 44.
No Executive Director has elected to defer any of the bonus earned into shares.
Long-term incentives The value of LTIP awards that vest in respect of the financial period and the value of SAYE options granted in the financial period.
LTIP: The 2012 LTIP award vested at 41.9%.
In the single total gure of remuneration table for the period ended 4 October 2014, the relevant value is calculated as disclosed in the footnote to that table.
The original estimate disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report for the period ended 4 October 2014 was that 36% of the 2012 LTIP would vest.
Awards vest after the end of the financial period and then only subject to the Committee being satisfied that the current underlying financial performance supports the formulaic output of the award.
Thebestestimate at that time was that the awards would vest at 36%.
In October 2015 the Committee were satisfied that the financial performance of the Group for 2014 15 supported the vesting of the awards based on EPS performance over the previous three years, at 41.9%.
LTIP: The 2013 LTIP award will vest in June 2016 but the pay-out will continue to be determined by the Committee in October 2016 subject to the financial performance of the Group for 2015 16.
For the purposes of the single total gure of remuneration table for the period ended 3 October 2015, it has been estimated that the 2013 LTIP will vest at 41.7%, and the value included in the table has been calculated by multiplying the number of shares in respect of which the 2013 LTIP is estimated to vest by the average share price over the last quarter of the financial period ending 3 October 2015.
SAYE: For the period ended 3 October 2015, for Peter Dalzell, the long-term incentive value includes the value of SAYE options granted based on the fair value of the options at grant.
Pension related benets The pension gure represents the cash value of pension contributions received by the Executive Directors.
Thisincludes any salary supplement in lieu of a Company pension contribution and for individuals in the Companys dened benefit pension scheme at the time of the scheme closure 30 September 2014 the 2014 gurealso includes the additional value achieved in the period calculated using the HMRC method using a multiplier of 20.
Further details of pension benets are set out on page 46.
INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS OF REMUNERATION EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Base salary Base salaries for individual Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are set with reference to individual performance, experience and responsibilities within the Group as well as with reference to similar roles in comparable companies.
For 2014 15, Ralph Findlay, Andrew Andrea and Peter Dalzell received an average 2.5% salary increase, which was in line with the average salary increases across the Group.
For 2015 16, the basic salary increase for Executive Directors is circa 2%, which is in line with the average salary increases across the Group.
Peter Dalzell has been awarded an additional salary increase of 3.5% to reect his span of responsibility, to align his salary with the other Executive Directors and to recognise his contribution to the long-term success of the Group.
The base salaries for 2014 15 and 2015 16 are as set out below: 2015 16 2014 15 Name base salary base salary Increase Andrew Andrea 331,000 325,000 1.8% Peter Dalzell 305,000 289,000 5.5% Ralph Findlay 531,000 521,000 1.9% During the year Ralph Findlay was appointed as a Non-executive Director of Bovis Homes Group PLC.
Any fees payable in connection with the role are paid directly to, and retained by, the Company.
43 Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Directors Remuneration Report continued Annual bonus With the exception of our pub managers and eld-based sales teams, all bonus arrangements within the Group have the same structure and pay-out mechanism, though the maximum potential award, expressed as a percentage of salary, varies between different employee groups.
Payments are calculated based upon achieving or exceeding pre-set targets for both Group profit and return on capital.
2014 15 For 2014 15, Executive Directors could earn a bonus equivalent to 50% of base salary for hitting on-target performance and this increases on a linear basis for performance above the set targets up to a maximum of 100% of base salary.
If the target is not achieved then there is a linear reduction in the bonus awarded using the prior period as a base.
For Executive Directors, the bonus agreement includes three additional conditions: Any bonus earned in excess of 40% of the maximum opportunity is payable in shares in the Company, which will be deferred for a period of three years: A malus provision is operated which gives the Remuneration Committee the discretion to reduce lapse unvested deferred shares if an act or omission of the participant contributes to a material misstatement of the Groups financial statements or results in material loss or reputational damage for the Company: and A clawback provision allows the Remuneration Committee to recover any cash bonus awarded for up to two years after payment if certain events occur.
These events include serious misconduct and a material misstatement of the Groups audited results.
The Directors consider that the future Group profit and return on capital targets are matters which are commercially sensitive: they provide our competitors with insight into our business plans and expectations and should therefore remain condential to the Group.
However, the following table sets out the bonus pay-out to the Executive Directors for 2014 15 and Marstons target and actual Group profit and return on capital performance for the year.
Executive Director bonus as Group profit Group profit Target return on Actual return on a percentage of target actual capital capital salary 2014 15 93.0m 91.5m 10.6% 10.8% 40% before non-underlying items.
2015 16 No changes are proposed in respect of the annual bonus scheme for 2015 16 with awards based on Group profit two-thirds and return on capital one-third.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to disclose how the bonus pay-out delivered relates to performance against the targets on a retrospective basis.
Long Term Incentive Plan Awards vesting in respect of the financial period 2014 15 LTIP awards granted in 2012 13 were subject to the achievement of an EPS growth performance condition over a three-year period.
Awards vest on a sliding scale with 35% becoming exercisable if annual EPS growth exceeds RPI by 3% 9.3% over three years.
For 100% of an award to vest EPS growth must exceed RPI by 9% per annum 29.5% over three years.
The extent to which the LTIP awards granted in June 2013 will vest will not be determined by the Remuneration Committee until October 2016, therefore an estimate of the level of vesting has been made.
During the 2013 14 financial period the Remuneration Committee noted that the historical EPS gure would be restated to reect the new pension accounting standard and also discussed the impact of the portfolio disposal activity on the remaining awards made under the 2004 LTIP scheme.
Given the short term impact on earnings for longer-term improvements in performance it was agreed that the 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards should be measured against an adjusted EPS gure.
It is estimated that the 2013 LTIP will vest at 41.7%.
The awards will only vest if the prevailing performance of the Group in 2016 supports it.
This decision is at the discretion of the Committee.
44 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Awards granted during 2014 15 In respect of the period ended 3 October 2015 the following awards were granted under the 2014 LTIP: % of award Percentage Number Face value vesting at Performance 1 Type of award ofsalary of shares atgrant threshold period Financial Andrew Andrea LTIP 125% 248,167 406,249 25% periods 2014 15 Peter Dalzell LTIP 125% 220,678 361,249 25% to 2016 17 Ralph Findlay LTIP 125% 397,831 651,249 25% inclusive 1 The face value at grant has been calculated using the mid-market share price at date of grant of 1.637.
The performance metrics for these LTIP awards are as follows: Threshold Maximum vesting Vesting vesting at 25% at 50% at 100% of the ofthe of the maximum maximum maximum % linked to award Base award award award CROCCE 40% 10.8% Base 0.25% Base 0.5% Base 1.0% Base 7.5% Base 15% Base 30% average average average FCF 40% 300m growth growth growth Relative TSR 20% Median Upper quintile When considering the 2014 15 LTIP award proposals the Remuneration Committee reviewed the base numbers and performance conditions and agreed they remain challenging and so are unchanged.
Each award is also subject to a further underlying financial performance condition and will only vest if, in the opinion of the Committee, the prevailing financial performance of the Group in the period of vesting supports it.
There will be straight-line vesting between the points and no reward below threshold performance.
The base amounts will be set at a level that is considered stretching but without encouraging undue risk.
CROCCE: Cash Return On Cash Capital Employed.
The use of CROCCE as opposed to an EBIT return on book value removes potential distortions from subjective decisions on depreciation policy and asset revaluation.
CROCCE will be based on the budget target for 2016.
Threshold vesting for this measure would only be earned if this target is exceeded by 0.25% over the threeyear period.
This reects the operating cash ow of the business after tax and interest which is available to return to shareholders as dividends: to reinvest to increase returns: or to pay down debt.
It is more closely aligned to operating performance than a simple leverage ratio.
FCF in 2016 will be set as a three-year cumulative amount based on the projections for 2016, 2017 and 2018.
Awards will only be earned if FCF exceeds that cumulative level at the end of three years by at least 7.5%.
Relative TSR: Total Shareholder Return compared against the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
The Remuneration Committee believe that a wider comparator group is a more robust and realistic way of measuring how shareholders value the Company and, furthermore, have set the maximum reward at upper quintile performance recognising our commitment to ensuring there are demanding performance targets.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee will require that the element of the award associated with TSR performance will only be earned if underlying financial performance supports it.
The weightings for each measure have been set to balance what the Remuneration Committee consider to be the direction of focus for management in its day-to-day direction of the business with its ultimate responsibility to shareholders.
In order to maintain transparency the Remuneration Committee will disclose how the Group has performed against each of the performance metrics following the end of the performance period.
45 Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Directors Remuneration Report continued 2015 16 Awards It is intended to make awards under the LTIP in 2015 16 based on the same performance metrics.
Base numbers will be nalised and disclosed next year.
Total pension entitlements Defined benefit schemes The dened benefit scheme was closed to new entrants from 29 September 1997.
The scheme closed to future accrual on 30 September 2014 upon which date Peter Dalzell became a deferred member.
Peter Dalzell takes a salary supplement of 20% of base salary in lieu of future pension provision.
Ralph Findlay became a deferred member of the Marstons PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme on 5 April 2012 and takes a salary supplement of 25% of base salary in lieu of future pension provision.
The details of pensions accrued in the dened benefit scheme are shown in the table below: Accrued pension Accrued pension at 30.09.15 at 30.09.14 Normal retirement age Peter Dalzell 80,659 79,693 65 Ralph Findlay 109,969 108,655 60 Early retirement can be taken from age 55 provided the Group gives its consent.
The accrued pension will then be reduced to take account of its early payment.
On death before retirement, if still employed by Marstons, a spouses pension is payable equal to one-third of the members pension for Peter Dalzell and 50% for Ralph Findlay plus a lump sum equal to the Directors contributions including those made via salary sacrifice.
On death after retirement the spouses pension payable is 60% of the members pre-commutation pension, for both Peter Dalzell and Ralph Findlay.
Defined contribution scheme The Group makes contributions into the Group Personal Pension Plan GPPP on behalf of Andrew Andrea.
A rate of 20% of base salary paid partly as a GPPP contribution and partly as a taxable cash supplement is payable in return for a minimum personal contribution of 7.5%.
For the period ended 3 October 2015, the Group contribution for Andrew Andrea was 65,000, being 15,625 pension contribution and a salary supplement of 49,375.
In 2014 15, in lieu of pension contributions, Ralph Findlay received a taxable cash supplement of 25% and Peter Dalzell received a taxable cash supplement of 20%.

Fees The Remuneration Policy for Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman, is determined by the Board and is reviewed every two years.
Fees for the Non-executive Directors were reviewed in 2013 2014 and reect the responsibilities and duties placed upon Non-executive Directors whilst also having regard to market practice.
The Chairmans fee was set on his appointment to the Board in September 2013 and was reviewed by the Remuneration Committee this year.
The increase of 4.2% is in line with average pay awards within the Group over the last two years.
The Non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the Groups share incentive plans nor do they receive any benets or pension contributions.

PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE There were no payments for loss of ofce made during the year.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS SHAREHOLDINGS AND SHARE INTERESTS Executive Directors are expected to build up and maintain a shareholding in the Company equal to at least one times salary.
During the period the Committee reviewed Directors shareholding requirements and agreed to adopt market value at the end of the financial period as the basis for calculating the required shareholding, instead of the historic acquisition costs.
This aligns the valuation method with market practice and better reects the Directors level of investment and commitment to the Company.
As at 3 October 2015, Andrew Andrea held 87%, Peter Dalzell held 50% and Ralph Findlay held in excess of 100% of base salary based on the closing mid-market price of an ordinary share on 2 October 2015 being the last business day prior to the period end.
