Pierre Goad, Group Head of Human Resources, Group variable pay pool Alexander Lowen, Group Head of Performance and Reward, Variable pay pool determination The Committee considers many factors in determining Marc Moses, Group Chief Risk Officer, the Groups variable pay pool funding.
Both the annual Robert Werner, Global Head of Financial Crime incentive and GPSP are funded from a single annual Compliance and Group Money Laundering Reporting variable pay pool from which individual awards are Officer, and considered.
Variable pay pool determination Performance and risk The variable pay pool takes into account the performance of the Group considered within the context of our appetite statement risk appetite statement RAS which includes a number of earnings capital related metrics, such as return on equity, return on notional risk weighted assets, common equity tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio.
This ensures that the variable pay pool is both economic and shaped by risk considerations and any Groupwide notable events.
Additionally, individual RAS has been developed for Financial Crime Compliance and Regulatory Compliance to reflect the current regulatory focus on these risks.
The Group CRO regularly updates the Committee on the Groups performance against the risk appetite statement and summarises the notable issues for the various business lines.
The Committee uses these updates along with feedback from the Group Risk Committee as delivered by the Group CRO when determining the annual variable pay pool to ensure that return, risk and remuneration are aligned.
Countercyclical funding We use a countercyclical funding methodology which is categorised by both a floor and a ceiling and the methodology payout ratio reduces as performance increases to avoid pro-cyclicality risk.
The floor recognises that even in challenging times, remaining in a competitive position is important.
The ceiling recognises that at higher levels of performance it is possible to limit reward as it is not necessary to continue to increase the variable pay pool, thereby limiting the risk of inappropriate behaviour to drive financial performance.
Distribution of profits In addition, our funding methodology considers the relationship between capital, dividends and variable pay to ensure that the distribution of post-tax profits between these three elements is considered appropriate see next page for the 2015 and 2014 split.
It is deemed fundamental that the majority of post-tax profits should be allocated to capital and to shareholders, particularly when strong performance is delivered.
Commerciality and Finally, we consider the commercial requirement to remain competitive in the market and overall affordability affordability.
Funding of the Groups annual variable pay pool is determined in the context of Group profitability, capital strength, shareholder returns and the overall compensation and benefits expense.
This approach ensures that performance-related awards for individual global businesses, global functions, geographical regions and levels of staff are considered in a holistic fashion.
Market competiveness is also considered in determining the variable pay pool.
This allows us to address any gaps to market identified when comparing total reward with our global peers.
This also recognises the challenges which arise from being headquartered in the UK and having to apply more stringent reward practices than those in all other markets.
We need to retain a competitive market position in Asia, the Middle East and the US in attracting and retaining talent, where our competitors are not subject to discounts applied by employees on their pay due to regulatory requirements including a variable pay cap, higher and longer deferrals, malus and clawback.

HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 307 FINANCIAL Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Financial Review Strategic Report Directors Remuneration Report continued Annual report on remuneration Jaws The Group targeted the achievement of positive adjusted jaws in 2015.
Based on the profile of the Groups revenues and cost base, it was judged that no award should be made under this element of the scorecard.
Grow dividends The Group is committed to paying out progressive dividends to shareholders, predicated on the growth of overall profitability and the continuing ability to meet regulatory capital requirements.
Prospective dividend growth remains dependent upon the long term overall profitability of the Group and delivering further release of less efficiently deployed capital.
The Group was able to increase the dividend per ordinary share in 2015 as well as improve its capital position.
Strategy Committee reviewed the progress to date in driving the Strategic Actions announced during the June 2015 execution Investor Update, particularly around re-sizing and simplifying the Group, and re-deploying capital to invest in higher-return businesses.
The Group had achieved $124bn reduction in RWAs in the year, ahead of the 2015 target and accounting for 45% of the total RWA reduction to be achieved by the end of 2017 to drive improved profitability.
The Committee further recognised favourable progress in optimising the global network with the planned sale of our operations in Brazil.
The Committee acknowledged the work under way to re-build profitability in the United States, although noted that underlying revenue growth remains challenged.
The Committee also noted the implementation of several initiatives to control costs, improve efficiency, and shift the Groups front office to back office ratio towards customer facing activities.
There were advances made in re-deploying capital to invest in higher-return businesses.
The Committee recognised the Groups progress in leveraging its global network to drive growth from global connectivity, in particular through its range of transaction banking products, and to deliver revenue synergies from its universal banking model.
The Pivot to Asia strategy is being executed to capture growth opportunities in China's Pearl River Delta, in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and in the Asian Asset Management and Insurance businesses.
The Group continues to play a leading role in the Internationalisation of the renminbi, being able to grow revenues and demonstrate several market firsts during 2015, such as the first Panda bond issued by a foreign bank in mainland China.
Global Standards The Committee was advised that the Group has continued to make progress in the implementation of Global including risk and Standards, including completion of certain milestones related to customer due diligence, transaction monitoring compliance and sanctions screening.
In addition, the global businesses are focusing on increasing operational impact and improving consistency across geographies to support the implementation of global AML and sanctions policies.
During 2015, the Global Standards programme assurance function has been strengthened to provide additional insight into programme outcomes and effectiveness.
This has resulted in enhanced visibility of potential risks and compliance weaknesses and has enabled proactive mitigating actions.
The Committee recognised that the Group had progressed with the implementation of other compliance and regulatory programmes in addition to Global Standards, including global stress testing, ring-fencing and global conduct e. g. development of Conduct Management Information Dashboard.
The Committee further noted favourable trends in customer redress, regulatory fines and regulatory provisions.
However, the Committee exercised its discretion and reduced the assessment from 75% to 60%.
This was based on feedback received from the Monitor, matters arising from risk and compliance incidents, and the number and extent of unsatisfactory internal audits covering AML and sanctions related issues.

However, the Committee exercised its discretion and reduced the assessment from 75% to 45%.
Streamline processes These objectives have progressed, supported by the management of business performance, delivery of key and procedures transformation initiatives, and re-engineering of policies, procedures and systems.
For example, credit risk management was significantly strengthened through the implementation of multiple new policies on collections, allowances, stress testing, approval authorities and products.
One significant structural change was the announcement of a new development in risk analytics at HSBC: the creation of a centralised team called Global Risk Analytics People The execution of the pay and performance plans, as well as the learning and development plans which were part of the comprehensive people strategy for the Global Risk function were noted.
Key initiatives include the first Aspiring CRO programme and further investment in the three lines of defence.

Return on equity In February 2015, the Group announced an updated medium-term return on equity target of greater than 10%.
The Group did not achieve the stated target in 2015, with return on equity decreasing from 7.3% in 2014 to 7.2% for the year.
Significant items, including fines, penalties, UK customer redress and associated provisions, as well as the UK bank levy, continue to have a significant effect, reducing our return on equity in 2015 by 190 basis points.
The Committee acknowledged the progress being made to implement the 10 strategic actions announced at the June 2015 Investor Update which are being undertaken to improve the return on equity.
However, the Committee decided not to make any award under this opportunity.
Jaws The Group targeted the achievement of positive adjusted jaws in 2015.
As this target was not met, the Committee judged that no award should be made under this element of the scorecard.
The Groups ability to generate revenue growth was affected by a slowdown in global trade, reflecting reduced commodity prices, and weaker investor sentiment in the second half of 2015 following stock market corrections in Asia.
Operating expenses increased, as expected, reflecting wage inflation, continuing investment in strategic growth areas and in regulatory programmes and compliance.
The Committee noted positive momentum on costs in the second half of the year, with cost growth slowing and a reduction in staff numbers.
This was achieved through a strong focus on cost management and the initial effect of our cost saving programmes.
Grow dividends The Group is committed to increasing the dividends we pay to shareholders each year, measured by dividends per ordinary share in respect of the year.
Actions to address these points are core elements of the Investor Update provided in June 2015.
The Group's strong capital position supports its capacity to generate dividend growth, despite a challenging operating environment.
HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 310 FINANCIAL Strategy execution The Group outlined 10 Strategic Actions at the June 2015 Investor Update to re-size and simplify the Group and redeploy resources to capture future growth opportunities.
There was strong progress in driving reductions in RWAs, with 45% of the targeted 2017 RWA reduction delivered to date.
The Group is implementing several transformation programmes to streamline the cost base, and it was noted that more work is required to meet related medium-term targets in this regard.
The Group has set the foundations for further growth in Asia, investing in select locations, for example, the Pearl River Delta in mainland China and in products, including Insurance and asset management.
The Committee also noted the Groups role in driving the internationalisation of the renminbi and business scale in ASEAN.
Global Standards The Group published Global Standards for AML and sanctions compliance in all countries and progressed including risk and the implementation of enhanced controls and related data initiatives.
Significant effort continues towards compliance embedding the enhanced standards and controls and improving operational effectiveness.
The Committee noted progress made, and that material work remains to comply fully with enhanced Global Standards by the end of 2017.
