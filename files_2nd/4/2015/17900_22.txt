The performance conditions for this award and the resulting vesting level is as follows: Metric Performance condition Threshold target Stretch target Actual % Vesting 1 1 2 EPS Absolute EPS growth for the financial year ended 30 June 2015.
20p 28p Basic 100 2 EPS 45.5p TSR TSR against the constituents of the FTSE 250 index excluding investment Median ranking Upper quartile Rank of 2 TSR of 100 trusts.
25% of this element vests for median performance and 100% of this of 94.5 TSR of of 47.5 TSR of 362.9% element vests for upper quartile performance or above.
TSR measured over 81.9% 137.2% three financial years with a three month average at the start and end of the performance period.
Total vesting 100 1 F ollowing the Companys refinancing during FY13, the Committee informed each participant of the 2012 13 LTPP that it would be adjusting the vesting levels, at the end of the plan period, 30June 2015, to ensure that participants did not benefit from the expected positive impact upon EPS arising from the refinancing for the relevant parts of those plan periods.
Accordingly, the EPS threshold and stretch targets were increased by 2 pence each from 18 pence and 26 pence respectively.
2 T he actual earnings per share of 45.5 pence has been rebased using the corporation tax rate applicable at the date on which the 2012 13 LTPP targets were set, as the subsequent reduction to the rate of corporation tax was not performance related.
The actual earnings per share has also been rebased using the same number of shares in issue as used in the 2012 13 LTPP targets.
The rebased earnings per share used for the purpose of determining vesting, which is directly comparable to the 2012 13 LTPP targets, was 44.5 pence.
The Committee considered the underlying financial performance of the Group and was satisfied that given the continued improvement in the Groups financial results as illustrated on page 76, the above level of vesting of the 2012 13 LTPP was justified.
Accordingly, the award details for each of the Executive Directors are as follows: Estimated 2 Number of Number of Number of Dividends on value 1 Executive Director shares at grant shares to vest shares to lapse shares to vest Total 000 Mark Clare 0 N A 825,357 825,357 825,357 4,704 David Thomas N A 534,493 534,493 0 534,493 3,046 Steven Boyes 534,493 534,493 0 N A 534,493 3,046 1 The relevant number of shares will be released to each participant as soon as is practicable in October 2015, following the vesting date.

The levels of vesting against TSR are measured over a three-year period commencing 1 July 2014, and against EPS and ROCE for the financial year ending 30 June 2017.
Given the commercial sensitivity of the EPS and ROCE targets to the Groups future strategy, the Committee agreed that it would not publish these targets prospectively but would set out performance against the targets on an annual basis.
Accordingly, if the performance period of the 2014 15 LTPP was for one year, commencing 1 July 2014 and the award had vested on 30 June 2015, the level of vesting would be as follows: Performance target Performance as at 30 June 2015 Level of vesting had the award vested as at 30 June 2015 TSR 59.1% Upper quartile 33.3% EPS 45.5 pence ROCE 23.9% 13.3% Total 46.6% Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Barratt Developments PLC 87 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Statement of Directors shareholding and share interests Audited For the financial year ended 30 June 2015 Executive Directors were required to hold shares in the Company equivalent in value to 200% for the Chief Executive and 150% for the other Directors.
