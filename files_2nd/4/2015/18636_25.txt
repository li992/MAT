Incentive Outcomes for 2015 Annual bonus in respect of 2015 In 2015, the maximum bonus opportunity for executive Directors was 100% of salary, linked to performance as measured by an Economic Value Added EVA calculation 100%.
For the CEO and FD, bonuses are calculated based on Group profit exceeding a target calculated from the profits for the three preceding financial years after charging cost of capital, including the cost of acquisitions.
As the EVA for each year is utilised for a further three years in the comparator calculations, executives must consider the medium-term interests of the Group otherwise there is the potential for an adverse impact on their capacity to earn a bonus.
EVA calculation: Profit for Minus Minus Plus minus Minus Equals each year A charge on cost A charge on Unrealised profit The resultant bonus The EVA for of acquisitions workingcapital in inventory itself to make it each year self-financing In the case of a Sector CEO, a bonus is earned if the profit of the sector for which they are responsible exceeds a target calculated from the profits of the three preceding financial years.
The profits calculated for this purpose regard each sector as a stand-alone group of companies charging it with the cost of capital it utilises including the cost of acquisitions.
Bonuses for 2015 are based on the sectoral allocation that existed throughout 2015.
Transitional provisions exist for restructuring to ensure Sector CEOs remain appropriately incentivised.
Subsidiary executives participate in bonus arrangements similar to those established for senior executives.
Further details of the bonuses paid and performance against targets are provided in the tables below.

84 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2016 Salary The Committee conducted a consultation of the top 10 shareholders in February and March 2015.
The consultation was highlighted as necessary in last years report to shareholders and was deferred until this year in order to accommodate changes in the Board constitution and to coincide with the necessity to replace the Performance Share Plan.
As stated last year, the Committee had identified that, whilst Halmas performance had been strong in recent years, salaries for Halmas executive Directors andthe value of the total package were not competitive for a group of Halmas size and complexity.
The Committee believed it was appropriate to move salaries above market lower quartile and closer to a market median level.
The robust review conducted this year makes those necessary adjustments: for the remainder ofthe policy period, it is anticipated that salary increases will align with those awarded across the Group more generally.
The Committee recognises the need to continue to exercise restraint on executive remuneration, and notes that theresulting packages remain at or below median for companies of our size and sector.
Therefore, the Committee approved the following salary increases with effect from 1 April 2015.
By way of comparison, the average salary increase across the sectors for 2016 was between 2% and4%.
Salary from Salary from Executive Director 1 April 2015 1 April 2014 % change Andrew Williams 600,000 515,000 16.5% Kevin Thompson 375,000 330,000 13.6% Neil Quinn 250,000 250,000 % Adam Meyers $470,000 $450,000 4.4% A s mentioned above, Neil Quinn has given the Company notice of his resignation effective 31 March 2016.
Accordingly he will be paid his salary to that date and be entitled to receive a pro rata bonus and will not be receiving a PSP award for 2015 16.
PSP awards from earlier years will vest on their third anniversary and be subject to pro-ration for service and performance conditions always subject to good leaver status being confirmed.
Pension and benefits No change to the executive Directors current pension and benefits arrangements is anticipated for 2015 16.
Annual bonus The maximum annual bonus opportunity 2016 will increase to 150% for the Group CEO and FD and 125% for other executive Directors 2015:100% with one third being payable in shares which are deferred for two years.
Bonuses will continue to be based on EVA performance against a weighted average target of EVA for the past three years for an executives sector, in the case of a Sector CEO, or the Group, in the case of the Group CEO and FD.
Bonus payments will be subject to recovery and withholding provisions during a period of three years from the date of payment.
PSP Subject to shareholder approval, PSP awards will be made after the 2015 AGM.
The number of shares over which awards will be made is determined by the share price leading up to the award, but the value of each award, relative to salary has been fixed as follows: Salary for PSP Value of Executive Director 2015 16 fixed award 2015 award Andrew Williams 600,000 200% 1,200,000 Kevin Thompson 375,000 175% 656,250 Adam Meyers $470,000 150% $705,000 The PSP awards to be granted in August 2015 will be subject to an earnings per share performance target for 50% of the award and a ROTIC target for 50% of the award.

Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 89 Remuneration Committee Report continued Annual Remuneration Report continued Directors pensions As noted below, two UK executive Directors are deferred members of the Halma Group Pension Plan Plan.
Their benefit is a funded final salary occupational pension from a plan registered with HMRC providing a maximum pension of two thirds of final pensionable salary after 25or more years service at normal pension age 60.
Up to 5 April 2006, final pensionable salary was the greatest salary of the last three complete tax years immediately before retirement or leaving service.
From 6 April 2011, final pensionable salary was capped at 139,185 andis increased annually thereafter by CPI currently 155,528.
Bonuses and other fluctuating emoluments and benefits-in-kind are not pensionable nor subject to any pension supplement.
The Plan also provides for life cover of three times salary, pensions in the event of early retirement through ill-health and dependants pensions of one-half ofthe members prospective pension.
Where an executive has a form of pension protection, life cover is provided by a separate trust.
Early retirement pensions, currently possible from age 55 with the consent of the Company and the trustees of the Plan, are subject to actuarial reduction.
Pensions in payment increase by 3% per annum for service up to 5 April 1997, by price inflation subject to a maximum of5% through to 31 March 2007 and 3% thereafter.
UK executive Directors receive pension supplements to compensate them for the fact that their pension accrual entitlement under the Halma Group Pension Plan is limited by the pensionable salary cap introduced from 6 April 2006 or the Lifetime Allowance.
The Company introduced a pensionable salary cap in order to address changes affecting the Plan made in the Pension Act 2006.
During the year, the Company closed the DB section to future accrual with effect from 1 December 2014.
The Company obtains external advice regarding the changes to the Plan and executive pension arrangements and provides educational seminars on the impact of pension legislation changes annual and lifetime allowances on individuals.
Otherwise, executive Directors are responsible for obtaining advice specific to their circumstances.
Prior to drawing his pension, to the extent that an executives current salary exceeds the Plan salary cap, the Company compensates him at an annual rate of 26% of the excess.
In April 2006, Kevin Thompson chose to cease future service accrual in the Plan in return for the pension supplement on his full salary.
In April 2014, Andrew Williams chose to cease future service accrual in the Plan in return for the pension supplement on his full salary.
This change is, broadly, cost neutral.
Neil Quinn has reached the Normal Retirement Date and is drawing his pension, therefore no future pension contribution or cash supplement is payable.
Two Directors accrued benefits under the Companys Defined Benefit pension plan during the year as follows.
Years of Increase in pensionable Increase in accrued benefits Accrued benefits Age at service at accrued benefits net of inflation at 28 March 2015 Executive Director 28 March 2015 28 March 2015 000 000 000 Andrew Williams 47 20 1 61 Kevin Thompson 55 18 5 1 118 The accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 60 based on service to the end of the year.

Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension plan.
The transfer values are Gilt-related and depend upon the relative standings of the Gilt market at the respective valuation dates.
The increase in transfer values in recent years is predominantly due to the significant reduction in the yields available on UK Gilts.
Other factors that have increased the transfer values are the impact of any additional service, revaluation in line with inflation and any real salary increases as well as the anticipated ageing of the member.
These values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
