They include vested shares where the executive director has beneficial ownership, shares independently acquired in the market and those held by a spouse or civil partner or dependent child under the age of 18 years.
Although the share ownership guidelines are not contractually binding, executive directors are normally expected to retain any after tax vested share awards until the guideline is met.
The Committee retains the discretion to withhold future grants under the PSP if executives are not making satisfactory progress against the guidelines.
Once shareholding requirements have been met, executive directors may sell surplus shares if they wish.
The Committee has discretion to allow executive directors to sell shares prior to the shareholding requirements being met if there are extenuating circumstances for example, changes to personal circumstances.

No person is present during any discussion relating to his or her own remuneration.
At the invitation of the Remuneration Committee, a representative from Deloitte LLP also attends Committee meetings.
During 2015, Deloitte principally advised the Committee on external developments affecting remuneration as well as specic matters raised by the Remuneration Committee.
Deloitte were appointed by the Committee.
It is the view of the Committee that the Deloitte LLP engagement team that provide remuneration advice to the Committee are independent.
Deloitte are signatories to the remuneration consultants group code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
The total fees paid to Deloitte in relation to Remuneration Committee work during 2015 were 118,000 excluding VAT.
While fee estimates are required for bespoke pieces of work, fees are generally charged based on time with hourly rates in line with the level of expertise and seniority of the adviser concerned.
During the year, Deloitte also provided the Company with international tax advice, other consulting services and real estate advice.
Terms of reference The Committees terms of reference are available on our website.
The remit of the Committee includes the remuneration strategy and policy framework for the whole company as well as the executive directors.
The Committee particularly focuses on: Determining the individual remuneration for executive directors and for other designated individuals or for those who are discharging a head of control function role Undertaking direct oversight on the remuneration of other high earners in the group Oversight of the remuneration of Code staff and employees in the control and oversight functions | LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 83 GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REPORT ON REMUNERATION ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION Considering risk The Reward Steering Committee RSC and the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function make a key contribution to the process of designing reward structures and evaluating whether achievement of objectives and any payment from plans have taken into account the overall risk prole of the company.
Reward steering committee RSC Reporting to the Remuneration Committee, the RSC helps set the framework within which our incentive arrangements are normally reviewed and implemented, with a view to supporting business strategy, whilst acting within the groups risk appetite.
The members of the RSC include group and business HR directors, reward and performance director, the group director of regulatory risk and compliance, the regulatory risk director, and the chief compliance officer, LGIM.
Where a business unit tables a proposal for consideration, the relevant business manager is required to attend the RSC meeting to explain the background and to answer all questions and challenges from the RSC.
Group regulatory risk and compliance function The Remuneration Committee also works closely with the group regulatory risk and compliance function with respect to remuneration proposals.
In particular, the function reports to the Committee on an annual basis on whether any risks have been taken outside of pre-agreed parameters, there have been regulatory breaches, or they are aware of any other considerations that may lead the Committee to consider whether it should impact the payment of bonuses to staff including in particular the executive directors and code staff.
The CRO also specically looks at the overall risk prole of the company and whether executive directors have achieved objectives within the companys accepted risk appetite.
The CRO also reviews the executive directors objectives for the forthcoming year to ensure they are in line with the risk parameters.
Engagement with shareholders The Committee seeks to maintain an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance generally and any changes to the companys executive pay arrangements.
During early 2014, the Remuneration Committee sought the views of the groups major shareholders on the proposed changes to executive remuneration arrangements for 2014 onwards.
Following the strong support received from shareholders at both individual meetings and at the AGM, the Committee considered it appropriate to enact the proposed changes to the policy during 2014.
No changes in the overall remuneration policy were made in 2015, nor are any proposed in 2016.
The Committee will review the current remuneration policy during 2016 to ensure it remains supportive of the group strategy going forward as the current policy is due to expire at the 2017 AGM.
The Committee will engage with the groups major share-holders if any substantial changes in policy are considered appropriate.

Remuneration is considered within the overall context of the groups sector and the markets in which the divisions operate.
The policy for the majority of employees continues to be to pay around the relevant mid-market range with a competitive package designed to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, and with an appropriate proportion of total remuneration dependent upon performance.
We define core remuneration as base salary, annual bonus and other benets such as pension.
Key employees are also eligible to participate in the performance share plan PSP.
Summary of the remuneration structure for employees below Board ELEMENT POLICY Base salary We aim to attract and retain key employees by paying salaries which deliver competitive total remuneration.
Factors taken into account when determining salaries include: The nature, size and scope of the role The knowledge, skills and experience of the individual Individual and overall business performance Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group Appropriate external market data For 2016, base salary budgets have been set on average at 2.8% for all employees below Board, including LGIM.
However, this does not mean a at increase at this level for everyone.
Annual bonus The majority of employees participate in a discretionary bonus plan, unless an alternative plan applies based on role.
An employee will be considered for a discretionary bonus award based on achievement against objectives, conduct and behaviours, the role performed during that year and internal relativities.
The group operates bespoke bonus plans where business appropriate.
However, the Remuneration Committee has ultimate discretion over all bonus plans.
Bonuses above a certain threshold are subject to deferral with the deferral amount increasing with the size of the bonus.
Deferred awards are normally held in shares for three years.
The company reserves the right to adjust deferral levels for code staff as deemed appropriate.
Performance share Participation in the PSP is offered to a small number of senior executives each year in recognition of the strategic and inuential plan PSP role that they hold in terms of driving company performance, as well as their individual contribution.
This includes employees in LGIM whose roles span different business divisions and whose participation encourages synergy and teamwork across the group.
Participation in the plan for one year does not guarantee participation in future years.
PSP awards will be made to under 80 employees during 2016.
Where appropriate, grants under the PSP may also be made for new employees who join the company during the year in key roles.
Other share The company operates a Share Bonus Plan SBP which provides the vehicle for deferral of annual bonuses in the majority of cases plans and long and also allows for a limited number of awards of shares to high potential individuals and those with critical skills.
term incentives In addition, the company operates a cash based long-term incentive plan for LGIM LGIM LTIP based on the financial performance of the division.
Participation in the LGIM LTIP is limited to senior managers within the division.
Pension All employees are given the opportunity to participate in a group pension scheme.
Shareholding The leadership group is asked to build up a voluntary shareholding of 50% of base salary.
requirements | LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 85 GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REPORT ON REMUNERATION ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION Annual equal pay audit The group seeks to ensure that our pay policies and practices are free from unfair bias.
Part of the pay review process is an annual equal pay audit that reviews pay and bonus decisions by gender, ethnicity, age and full-time versus part-time working.
In addition, it considers the pay of the control function departments risk, compliance and internal audit as well as the oversight departments of finance and human resources and looks at decisions for employees who report directly to the business versus those who report to the function head.
The review extends to all employees, including those in LGIM.
Dilution limits The companys all-employee plans and the now-closed ESOS operate within the ABIs dilution limit of 5% of issued capital in ten years for executive schemes and all its plans will operate within the 10% of issued capital in ten years limit for all schemes.
As at 31 December 2015, the company had 4.94% of share capital available under the 5% in ten years limit, and 9.63% of share capital under the 10% in ten years limit.
As at 31 December 2015, 17,962,834 shares were held by the Employee benefit Trust to hedge outstanding awards of 35,225,924 shares for the PSP and SBP.
Other information relating to directors remuneration External appointments The company considers that certain external appointments can help to broaden the experience and contribution to the Board of the executive directors.
Any such appointments are subject to annual agreement by the group and must not be with competing companies.
Subject to the groups agreement, any fees may be retained by the individual.
However, they received no fees for the below appointments.
