In addition to the TSR measure, the Committee introduced an EPS compound annual growth rate CAGR measure for the 2015 LTIPawards, replacing theindividual strategic measures applied in 2014.
In setting the targets, the Committee took into account the internal and external projections for the EPS CAGR at the time of grant.
Threshold performance 2% would result in the vesting of 20% of the EPS CAGR award: on target performance 4% would result in50% of theEPS award vesting: and at the maximum 6% or above, 100% of the EPSaward would vest.

The following information has not been subject to audit.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTORS PAY POLICY IN 2016 In 2016 the base pay of the Group Chief Executive was increased by 1% with effect from 1 January.
The base pay of the Group Finance Director and the fees paid to the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors were increased by 1.5%.
In determining those payrises, the pay rises for employees averaging 1.8% and other factors were taken into consideration.
For 2016 the Committee has introduced organic revenue growth ORG as a second performance measure for the annual bonus.
Both Executive Directors may earn a maximum bonus equivalent to 150% of base salary, with the maximum award for EPS performance being 120% of base salary and the maximum award for ORG being 30%.
Performance below 95% of the EPS target will result in no EPS-related bonus.
On target performance will result in a bonus equivalent to 90% of salary.
A below threshold performance for ORG will result inno ORG-related bonus.
An on target performance will result in a 10% ORG-related bonus.
The 2016 LTIP awards follow the same structure as the 2015 awards.
The initial award is equivalent to 200% of the Group Chief Executives base salary and 150% of the Group Finance Directors base salary.
The same performance measures will apply, namely relative TSR against the FTSE 51 150 companies and EPS CAGR, with equal weighting to both, together with the same performance ranges.
The performance ranges were determined after the Committee took into account a variety of factors, including the internal and external projections for the Groups performance.
The introduction of the new annual bonus measure and the continuing use of the LTIP measures provide a clear line of sight to the priorities set out in the Growth Acceleration Plan see pages 10 and 11 and align incentive awards with success in delivering against the Plan.
These measures seek to balance sustainable and efficient revenue growth, while continuing to deliver against EPS expectations and driving long-term Shareholder value.
The Committee will set appropriately stretching targets for each performance cycle, taking into account factors including the internal goals, analyst expectations, cost of capital and peer performance.
HISTORICAL TSR AND GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE PAY The following graphs illustrate the Groups TSR performance compared with the performance of the FTSE All-Share Media Index and the FTSE 350 Index excluding Investment Trusts, in the seven-year period ended 31 December 2015.
These indices have been selected for this comparison because the Company is a constituent company of both and performance relative to these indices informs vesting or partial vesting under the 2013 LTIP award.
