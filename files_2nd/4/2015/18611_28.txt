2 E xactly in accordance with the contractual provisions specified in their service agreements and having reference to the Companys policy for departing Executive Directors, Andrew Cunningham and Mark Greenwood were not eligible for a bonus in relation to the year under review having given notice to the Company to terminate their employment in connection with their retirement.
3 T he legacy bonus paid in 2015 represents the final tranche of an historic earned bonus that was due to Andrew Cunningham.
The scheme, which applied to Andrew Cunningham only, closed in 2010 when the balance in the notional bonus pool stood at 545,621, reflecting performance between 2003 and 2010, and it was agreed to pay out this sum in five equal tranches beginning in 2011.
The final instalment of 109,125 was paid in March 2015.
4 P ursuant to evolving best practice following the introduction in 2013 of the Remuneration Reporting Regulations, the basis on which the LTIS vesting values has been determined has been changed for 2015.
The 2015 LTIS vesting values are based on the forecast value of the awards due to vest on 10 December 2015 50% of the award is based on NNNAV performance measured over the three years to 30 September 2015 and 50% of the award is based on absolute total shareholder return measured over the three year period to 10 December 2015.
The NNNAV performance measured to 30 September 2015 was marginally less than the maximum performance requirements and 96% of this part of the award is due to vest and forms part of the 2015 LTIS value.
Absolute TSR performance based on an assessment of performance measured to 30 September 2015 is forecast to exceed the maximum performance requirement and the 2015 LTIS value thus assumes 100% of this part of the award is due to vest.
The share price for the purposes of valuing the award is the share price at 30 September 2015, 238p for the NNNAV element, and the three month average share price to 30 September 2015 237.2p for the TSR element.
This value will be trued up in next years report to reflect the actual level of vesting and share price at the vesting date.
The 2014 LTIS value has been restated and reflects the actual value of the awards that vested in December 2014.
5 The pension costs are based on 15% of base salary.
6 Peter Couch left the Company on 31 January 2014.
