There is no requirement for Non-executive Directors to own shares inthe Company.
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires the Committee to consider an extended holding period, including after leaving the Company, for shares arising following vesting of the three-year awards under the PSP.
This matter was considered by the Committee prior to submission ofthe Directors Remuneration Policy to the 2014 AGM and was reviewed again in 2015.
In the context of the Directors Remuneration Policy targetting below median levels of reward, the three-times base salary shareholding requirement being significantly above the norm of one or two times salary and each Executive Director having in practice a much higher shareholding than the requirement, the Committee determined not to impose ashareholding retention period, but to keep the position under review.
