DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Rewarding long-term performance REMUNERATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS Gwyn Burr Chairman Terry Duddy Judy Gibbons David Tyler Anthony Watson retired 22 April 2015 One of the responsibilities of the Committee is to ensure that DEAR SHAREHOLDERS Executive Directors remuneration reflects achievements against I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for long-term strategic success.
Table 65 at the end of this letter shows the year ending 31 December 2015. the aggregate of short and long-term variable reward taken home by each Executive Director in 2015.
This consists of the AIP for REMUNERATION OUTCOME: AIP 2014 that was paid in 2015 and the 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan You will have read earlier in this Annual Report that the Company LTIP awards that vested in 2015.
These amounts differ from the delivered another strong performance in 2015 with adjusted statutory disclosure in table 66 which includes within it elements earnings per share growing to 26.9 pence, up 13% on the prior earned but not paid in 2015.
Also shown in table 65 is the on-target year.
Although the Company has final information on its own and maximum opportunity for each of these areas of variable Total Property Return TPR, the Remuneration Committee reward.
Although Executive Directors had an opportunity to earn Committee uses estimated information regarding benchmark substantial variable reward in 2015, the actual amount earned performance for the purposes of reporting the likely bonus AIP generally represented approximately 88% of on target and 32% of payment, and based on these estimates TPR is showing a strong maximum.
It is worth noting that table 87 on page 97 shows the performance against that benchmark.
No AIP payments for TPR remuneration of the Chief Executive over the last seven years.
In are made until the actual benchmark data becomes available and the last four years, the average amount earned represented 72% of we have included in the implementation report the final outturn maximum for AIP and 26% of maximum for LTIP.
AIP is also payable in respect of the Group operational targets of growth in like-for-like net rental REMUNERATION OUTCOME: LTIP income and reduction in the cost to income ratio.
The final It was disappointing to note that, yet again, there was no material component of AIP is personal performance, which is assessed not vesting of the LTIP in 2015.
One of the reasons for this was that the only for specific personal objectives, but also includes an LTIP awards made in 2011 measure TPR relative to an All assessment of behaviours based on the Companys values as well Property Index, although the Company disposed of its non-retail as how each Executive Director has led and maximised the assets in 2012.
The Committee debated in April 2015 whether it contribution of colleagues.
The average pay out for AIP for 2014 was appropriate to amend the TPR performance measures for the was 66%, and using estimated information for TPR, the strong 2011 and 2012 LTIP awards to reflect this but concluded that there financial performance of the Company in 2015 is reflected in a should be no change to those performance measures.
It is likely higher average pay out of 77%.
that the 2012 LTIP also will not vest under the TPR performance measure, although there will be a partial vesting under the Absolute Net Asset Value performance measure.
The TPR performance measure was changed for awards made from 2013 onwards and the Committee is hopeful that LTIPs will start to vest under the TPR performance measure, reflecting the steady performance of the Company in delivering total property returns to shareholders.

In the period since its approval, the Company has changed its focus to retail property, and shareholders and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Table 65 Variable reward taken home by Executive Directors in 2015 The table below shows the total variable remuneration received by Executive Directors during 2015.
It compares this with the on-target and maximum opportunities for the Annual Incentive Plan AIP that was paid in 2015 and the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP that vested in 2015.

Actual LTIP corresponds to the LTIP that vested in 2015, table 72 on page 90, and is different to the numbers shown in table 66, which shows some elements earned but not paid in 2015.
The AIP maximum opportunity has been calculated as 200% of 2014 base salary.
The on-target opportunity is calculated as 50% of the maximum.
The LTIP maximum opportunity has been calculated by multiplying the aggregate of the shares that vested and lapsed in 2015 refer to tables 80 to 83 from page 94 by the relevant share price.
The relevant share prices used in the calculation are 672.80 pence for David Atkins, Peter Cole and Jean-Philippe Mouton and 654.40 pence for Timon Drakesmith.
The on-target opportunity is calculated as 25% of the maximum.

Benefits Taxable benefits available to all Executive Directors include a company car or a car allowance and private medical health insurance.
Jean-Philippe Mouton receives a seniority allowance and welfare contribution.
UK Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the Companys all-employee share plan arrangements SIP and Sharesave.
Jean-Philippe Mouton participates in a profit-sharing scheme in France and receives an employers contribution to a French employee savings scheme.
During the year, no payments were made to Executive Directors for expenses other than those incurred wholly and directly in the course of their employment.
AIP Achievements against Company financial targets and personal objectives for 2015 resulted in an average entitlement for Executive Directors of approximately 77% of the maximum bonus opportunity.
However, the data above estimates the Total Property Return TPR outcome because not all relevant data was available for that measure at the date of this report.
Further information concerning the annual bonus outcomes for 2015 can be found on page 89.
In the 2014 Annual Report, the TPR element was estimated at IPD 1.1%, resulting in a payout level estimated at 40% for that measure.
The final closing measurement for TPR during 2014 was IPD 1.09%, resulting in a final payout level of 39.75%.
The data for 2014 has therefore been updated to reflect the actual TPR outcomes.
LTIP 2014 figures in the 2014 Annual Report included estimated numbers for the TPR performance measure as final data was not available at the date of that report.
The estimated value was nil.

The performance period for awards to David Atkins, Peter Cole and Jean-Philippe Mouton ended on 1 April 2015.
Performance conditions for this measure were not satisfied, resulting in a nil vesting.
For Timon Drakesmith, the performance period for the 2011 LTIP award ended on 6 June 2015 and vested on 8 June 2015.
Performance conditions for this measure were partially satisfied.
The value is calculated using actual performance and the share price on the date of vesting.
TPR The 2015 figures for Total Property Return TPR are estimated values for the 2012 LTIP awards scheduled to vest in 2016, where the performance period ended on 31 December 2015, as final IPD data was not available at the date of this report.
The estimate compares the Companys actual TPR figures with the best available information.
The estimated vesting for TPR is 0%.
Final IPD data will be available in April 2016 and the award will vest in that month.
The actual 2015 TPR figure will be reported in the 2016 Annual Report.
The 2014 figures for TPR where the performance period ended on 31 December 2014 were estimated nil in the 2014 Annual Report, as some IPD data was not available at the date of that report.
When IPD data became available, the performance conditions for this measure resulted in a nil vesting.
Absolute The 2015 figures for Absolute Net Asset Value Absolute NAV are the values for the 2012 LTIP awards that are scheduled to NAV vest in 2016 where the performance period ended on 31 December 2015.
This measure is calculated to vest at 70.4%.
The 2015 figure has been estimated using the average share price over the three months prior to 31 December 2015.
BASE SALARY In February 2016, the Remuneration Committee determined that an increase in base salaries of 2.5% was appropriate for Executive Directors.
This increase is broadly in line with increases in salaries awarded across the Group.
A number of factors influenced this decision, including the effect of inflation and evidence of salaries within the real estate sector.
Executive remuneration benchmarking data was also considered in making the decision to approve the increase, which takes effect from 1 April 2016.

Salary supplements for the year ended 31 December 2015 are detailed in table 76 below and are reflected in the single figure remuneration table on page 86 table 66.
All salary supplements paid to Executive Directors in lieu of pension benefits are subject to deductions as required for income tax and social security contributions in the UK and France.
Jean-Philippe Mouton also participates in a legacy collective supplementary defined contribution pension scheme, operated by Hammerson Asset Management, France, which is the French company that employs him and which makes employer contributions at the annual statutory limit.
Salary supplements received by all Executive Directors and the pension benefit received by Jean-Philippe Mouton do not qualify for AIP purposes or entitlements under the LTIP.

Executive Directors deferred pension benefits Following the closure of the Companys defined benefit pension scheme Scheme in 2014, David Atkins and Peter Cole remain eligible for a deferred pension based on their pensionable salary and service at the point they ceased to accrue further benefits in the Scheme.
The normal retirement age under the Scheme is 60: members may draw their pension from the age of 55, subject to actuarial reduction and the Trustees consent.
Further information concerning the Scheme can be found in note 6 to the accounts on page 133.
Table 77 below shows the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2015 representing the annual pension that is expected to be payable on retirement, given the length of pensionable service and salary of each Executive Director at the date each ceased to accrue further benefits under the Scheme.
The increase in accrued benefit earned during the year represents the statutory increase applied as a result of changes in the Consumer Price Index CPI.
Such increases are subject to statutory limits.
Table 77 also shows the transfer values of Executive Directors accrued entitlements under the Scheme calculated under the Companies Act 2006.
The figures represent the value of assets that the Scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Schemes liability in respect of each Executive Directors pension benefits.
The figures do not represent sums paid or payable to individual Executive Directors but represent a potential liability of the Scheme.
The statutory disclosures are based on required assumptions.
Any increase or decrease in transfer value over the year represents a change in the transfer value assumptions that the Scheme applies.

COM 93 2015 Directors remuneration: implementation report continued EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS SHARE PLAN INTERESTS INCLUDING SHARE OPTIONS Tables 80 to 83 below set out the Executive Directors interests under the Deferred Benefit Share Scheme DBSS, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Sharesave scheme.
Awards under the DBSS and Sharesave scheme are not subject to any performance conditions other than continued employment on the vesting date.
The LTIP awards are subject to performance conditions, details of which can be found on page 91.
The TPR element of any bonus payment to Executive Directors including the deferred shares element awarded under the DBSS is made only when all IPD index data is available for calculation of actual performance against the TPR performance measure.
The DBSS B award below is that part of the award payable when final TPR data is available.
Face values shown in tables 80 to 83 below are calculated by multiplying the number of shares granted during 2015 by the relevant share price.
For the DBSS, the average share price for the three business days preceding the award is used.
For the LTIP, the average share price for the five business days preceding the award is used.
Notional dividend shares accruing are not included in the face value calculations for either scheme.
Face value for the Sharesave scheme is calculated by reference to the exercise price of options granted in 2015.
Awards to UK Executive Directors under the DBSS and since 2012 for the LTIP are made in the form of nil cost share options.
All awards up to and including those made in 2013 accrue notional dividend shares to the date of transfer.
Awards made from 2014 onwards accrue notional dividend shares to the date of vesting.
The Sharesave scheme does not accrue notional dividend shares.
For French tax reasons, LTIP awards granted to Jean-Philippe Mouton are in the form of conditional awards of free shares.
Notional dividend shares accrue to the date of vesting in respect of 2014 LTIP awards and subsequent awards.
For the DBSS, notional dividend shares accrue to the date of transfer in respect of 2013 awards and to the date of vesting for subsequent awards.
The opening balance for awards held at 1 January 2015 has been adjusted to account for a rounding error in calculating the number of notional dividend shares that accrued during 2014.
The opening balance for awards held at 1 January 2015 has been adjusted to reflect an administrative error whereby notional dividend shares were not accrued during 2014 in respect of the dividend paid in August 2014.
Jean-Philippe Moutons entitlement to awards arising under the LTIP and DBSS is calculated in euro.
The prevailing exchange rate at grant is used to determine the number of shares to award.
On 12 March 2015, Jean-Philippe Mouton was granted an additional award under 2015 DBSS A award to correct an administrative error made in the original award.
The opening balance for the award held at 1 January 2015 has been adjusted to reflect an administrative error whereby notional dividend shares were not accrued during 2014.
