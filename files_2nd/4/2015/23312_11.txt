Remuneration Responsibilities The Board has resolved that a remuneration committee is not appropriate for a company of this size and nature.
Remuneration is therefore regarded as part of the Boards responsibilities to be addressed regularly.
All Directors are non-executive and all participate in meetings of the Board at which Directors remuneration is considered.
Directors Remuneration Policy The Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 18 July 2014 and became effective on that date.
The policy is that the remuneration of Directors: be fair and reasonable in relation to that of other investment trusts and to the time commitment and responsibilities undertaken: be reviewed relative to movements in the Retail Price Index: be sufficient to retain and motivate appointees, as well as ensure that candidates of a high calibre are recruited to the Board but not be more than necessary for the purpose: and take into consideration any committee memberships and chairmanship duties.
Fees for the Directors are determined by the Board within the limits stated in the Companys Articles of Association Articles.
The maximum currently is 250,000 in aggregate per annum.
Directors do not have service contracts.
Directors are appointed under letters of appointment, copies of which are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company.
Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for any reasonable expenses properly incurred by them in the performance of their duties.
Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other incentives or benefits.
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors concerning compensation for loss of office.
Notwithstanding the above, the Companys Articles also provide that additional discretionary payments can be made for services which, in the opinion of the Directors, are outside the scope of the ordinary duties of a Director.
The level of Directors remuneration is normally reviewed annually, although such review will not automatically result in any changes.
This Directors Remuneration Policy will apply to any new directors, who will be paid the appropriate fee based on the Directors fees level in place at the date of appointment.
The Board will consider, where raised, shareholders views on Directors remuneration.
The Board may amend the level of remuneration paid to Directors within the parameters of the Directors Remuneration Policy.
This Directors Remuneration Policy is the same in all material respects as that currently followed by the Board and summarised in the last Directors Remuneration Report.
This policy is intended to take effect immediately upon its approval by shareholders.
The Company has no employees and consequently has no policy on the remuneration of employees.
