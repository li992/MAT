The approval lasts for three years and expires at our AGM in 2017.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the policy this year and I am pleased to say that we believe it continues to be fit for purpose.
It remains aligned to and supports the delivery of the Groups business strategy and the creation of value for our shareholders.
Stephen Williams Chairman, Remuneration Whitbread is, and must remain, competitive in the employment market in order to attract Committee and retain a high calibre of person as appropriate to the specific role.
This is true across the organisation and not just at executive level.
Our Winning Teams make everyday experiences special for our customers and they deserve and need high quality leadership.
The leadership talent challenge Whitbreads Premier Inn and Costa brands are growing rapidly.
In order to meet the demands of this growth, we need to fill our talent pools with leaders who have developed the right skills and qualities.
With this in mind, we have chosen to adjust the WINcard measures to be used for the 2015 16 incentive scheme, within the framework of the policy approved last year.
We will do this by adding a new measure to incentivise talent development.
Executives will be able to earn up to 10% of base salary for the achievement of the new WINcard target, but the overall level of potential reward to executives under the Annual Incentive Scheme will remain unchanged.
Further details can be found on page 46.
Remuneration linked to strategy Whitbreads strategy is to invest in growing its leading brands, Premier Inn and Costa.
We have developed stretching targets which, if delivered successfully, will create significant shareholder value.
The Committee believes that the executive team should be rewarded for the achievement of this strategy and that incentives should be clearly aligned to delivering earnings growth and returns above our cost of capital.
Along with profit and returns targets, as well as the new leadership talent target outlined above, the WINcard is a key element of our remuneration structure.
It measures performance against both financial and nonfinancial targets and executives are incentivised based on the achievement of these targets.
Further details can be found on page 76.
The Whitbread Business Model, which is described on page 4 shows how we intend to deliver our strategic aims by providing a great place to work for our people, so that they care for our customers and provide them with an experience that will make them come back time and time again.
We intend to deliver these aims whilst being a force for good in the communities in which we operate.
The diagram on page 63 shows how elements of the remuneration package are linked to this model.
For some years now a significant proportion of the incentives available to executives has been paid in shares, a material element of which is deferred.
This remains core to our remuneration arrangements.
The Remuneration Committee believes that executives should use the incentive schemes to build a significant shareholding in the Company in order to provide greater alignment between executives and shareholders.
New strengthened shareholding requirements were introduced in 2013 14.
Annual Incentive Scheme As well as meeting the leadership talent challenge as described above, we have made a minor change to the Annual Incentive Scheme rules during the year, with the addition of a new clawback provision.
This gives the Company the right, in certain circumstances, to recover cash incentive payments made under the Scheme.
This brings Whitbread into line with the new governance requirements in this area.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP At the AGM in 2014 a new Long Term Incentive Plan was approved following a shareholder consultation.
The new LTIP allows for awards to be made up to a maximum of 200% of salary.
As we reported last year however, the actual awards to be made this year will be based on 125% of salary.
The awards will, for the first time, be subject to a twoyear postvesting holding period.
Whitbread continues to be a fastgrowing, capitalintensive business.
The Groups growth, which is based on a fiveyear business plan and the delivery of our growth milestones along with strong returns, is vital for the future success of the Company.
It is for this reason that the LTIP performance conditions, a combination of ROCE and EPS, have been selected and we believe that they continue to be appropriate.
We reviewed the targets for the 2015 LTIP awards, and concluded that the targets set in 2014 continue to be stretching, particularly in light of the level of recent freehold hotel acquisitions.

The Company is still on track to meet its growth milestones and has now introduced new milestones for 2020.
As a result, the executives have been deservedly rewarded for this performance with incentive payments towards the top end of the range.
Patrick Dempsey We announced in December last year that Patrick Dempsey would be leaving Whitbread, after more than ten years in which he made a fantastic contribution to the Company.
You will see later in this report that the Committee exercised its discretion to treat him as a good leaver for share scheme purposes.
All of the remuneration arrangements agreed in relation to Patricks departure were in accordance with the policy approved last year.
Andy Harrison You will be aware that Andy Harrison has decided to retire from his position as Chief Executive.
He will continue to be entitled to his salary, benefits and incentives in the usual way until he leaves the Company.
As he will not be taking up a full time executive role elsewhere, it has been agreed in principle that he will be a good leaver in accordance with the rules of the Annual Incentive Scheme and LTIP.
Andy will, however, not be eligible for a 2015 LTIP award.
This has been reflected in this report.
Looking ahead The new UK Corporate Governance Code principle states that remuneration arrangements should promote the longterm success of the Company and that performancerelated elements of remuneration packages should be transparent, stretching and rigorously applied.
I strongly support this principle and believe that our current structure already achieves this.
However, I think it is important that we take time to reflect on our current arrangements and I have arranged a day later in the year for the Remuneration Committee to discuss all elements of our remuneration structure to ensure that they remain appropriate to the Company as it continues to grow.

For executives, our approach is designed to: align with the business strategy and the achievement of planned business goals: support the creation of sustainable longterm shareholder value: provide an appropriate balance between remuneration elements that attract, retain and motivate the highest calibre of executive talent: and encourage a highperformance culture by ensuring performancerelated remuneration constitutes a substantial proportion of the remuneration package and by linking maximum payout opportunity to outstanding results.
