As we approach the end of the third year of the multi-year strategic plan announced in June 2012, I am pleased to However, in light of the high-priced market conditions for report, as you will have read earlier in this Annual Report, Private Equity and Infrastructure assets, it was important that this has been another successful year for the that the Company maintained an emphasis on disciplined Company.
The business has continued to deliver a good investing.
Numerous potential investments were declined flow of realisations and strong unrealised value growth for pricing reasons and only a select number of investment driven by quality earnings growth.
This, combined with the opportunities were pursued and completed.
Companys continued cost discipline, has generated a total return of 20% on opening shareholders funds.
This return was achieved despite significant currency headwinds.
In addition, all the objectives set out at the start of the strategic plan have been met or exceeded.
72 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Operating profit For many years prior to FY2014, the Company had operated at a material annual operating cash loss, which diluted capital returns to our shareholders.
Annual operating cash profits have further improved from 5 million in FY2014 to 28 million for FY2015.
This significantly exceeded the FY2015 target due to the 12% growth in Debt Management AUM, improved portfolio income cash generation in Private Equity and dividend proceeds from 3iN.
Strategy, investor relations and culture We are now at the end of the three year strategic plan thatwas set out by our Chief Executive, Simon Borrows, inJune 2012.
Each phase of the plan from the first years Restructuring, the subsequent Transition and delivery phase and now the achievement of the strategic goal hasbeen well communicated to, and supported by, our shareholders.
As a result of these strategic changes, theCompany today is now a more robust, efficient and energised operation than three years ago.
The effects of this turnaround are reflected in the longterm remuneration of the Executive Directors in two ways.
We have operated LTIP schemes for key management for many years.
This year is the first since 2008 in which any long-term incentive award has actually vested at 3i.
The amounts received by the Executive Directors, which are entirely in line with policy, reflect the Companys excellent performance under their guidance over the last three years and the appreciation in the share price from 1.97 per share at the time of grant.
COMMITTEE PRIORITIES AND POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE CURRENT YEAR The Committee remains committed to maintaining a remuneration framework which rewards progress in meeting the Groups strategic objectives.
We regularly monitor relevant guidelines and regulatory changes, and our current arrangements are fully in line with these.
During the current year, the Committee will continue to follow developments, and in particular will assess the potential impact of the draft EBAguidelines on remuneration in relation to CRD IV, which may necessitate changes to our remuneration policy in FY2016.
The Committee will also review its malus clawback policies in FY2016.
The Remuneration Committee values all feedback from shareholders and hopes to receive your support at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Jonathan Asquith Chairman, Remuneration Committee 13 May 2015 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 73 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Directors remuneration report continued POLICY REPORT The policy as set out in the 2014 Directors remuneration report was formally approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 17 July 2014.

FY2015 ANNUAL BONUS The annual bonuses for Executive Directors for the year were awarded against a balanced scorecard of both financial and strategic measures agreed by the Committee in May 2014.
The Committee uses the scorecard as a prompt and guide to judgment and considers the performance outcomes in the wider context of personal performance including values and behaviours, risk, market and other factors.
74 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The scorecard review was completed in the context of a very strong performance by the business, resulting in a 20% total return for the year.
Highlights of this performance included: A strong level of realisations 831m from the Private Equity portfolio, delivered at a significant premium 27% to opening value: Unrealised value growth of 684m in the Private Equity portfolio, underpinned by growth in earnings in portfolio companies of 19%: Improved origination activity resulting in increased levels of investment in Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management, whilst retaining a disciplined and selective approach to investment opportunities: and Value uplifts and realisations from the European Infrastructure portfolio leading to a material increase in the value of 3iN.
Virtually all of the Group and business line KPIs, including those set out in the scorecard assessment shown below, have outperformed versus plan from the beginning of the year.
Overall, performance for FY2015 not only exceeded plan but in all material respects improved further on the excellent performance in FY2014.
The specific metrics considered by the Committee to assess the performance of the Executive Directors in each area ofstrategic focus are set out below, together, where appropriate, with their associated targets.
For some metrics, particularly in the area of new investments and realisations, the Board sets expectations rather than targets.
This is because the timing of acquisitions and disposals is highly sensitive to market conditions, and a more prescriptive approach would run the risk of creating perverse incentives for executives.
For example, to achieve a target level of realisations may result in the earlier sale of assets than would otherwise be appropriate, or to achieve a target level of investments may result in investing at inflated prices.
In practice, the Boards expectations in these areas were met or exceeded in each case.

Policy element Implementation of policy during FY2016 Base salary A Group-wide 3% increase to salaries will take place in FY2016, which will also be applied to Executive Director salaries.
Effective from 1 July 2015, salaries for the Executive Directors will therefore be as follows: Chief Executive: 583,495 3% Group Finance Director: 424,360 3% Pension No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2016.
The Executive Directors will continue to receive a pension contribution or salary supplement as follows: Chief Executive: 15k Group Finance Director: 12% of salary Benefits No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2016.
Benefits will continue to include a car allowance, provision of health insurance and any Share Incentive Plan matching share awards.
Annual bonus The maximum annual bonus opportunities for FY2016 will remain unchanged, in line with the remuneration policy, as follows: Chief Executive: 400% of salary Group Finance Director: 250% of salary Awards over 75% of this maximum will be made only in exceptional circumstances.
Any bonus will be awarded based on a balanced scorecard of both financial and strategic measures agreed by the Committee, alongside a consideration of the wider context of personal performance including values and behaviours risk, market and other factors.
Measures for the FY2016 scorecard are based 85% on financial measures 50% portfolio returns, 25% investment management and 10% operating performance and 15% on strategic and people objectives.
They are calibrated to current business strategy and will evolve year on year as the Groups situation and priorities develop.
The Committee considers that the specific targets and expectations contained in the FY2016 scorecard are commercially sensitive and therefore will not be disclosed in advance.
We will report to shareholders next year on performance and the resulting bonus outturns.
At least 50% of any bonus award will be deferred into shares vesting in equal instalments over four years.
Under the Companys malus and clawback policy, any deferred bonus may be forfeited or reduced prior to vesting in exceptional circumstances on such basis as the Committee considers fair, reasonable and proportionate.
This would include material misstatement of Group financial statements, or cases where an individual is deemed to have caused a material loss for the Group as a result of reckless, negligent or wilful actions or inappropriate values or behaviour.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 79 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Directors remuneration report continued Policy element Implementation of policy during FY2016 Long-term incentive plan Awards under the long-term incentive plan in FY2016 will be made as follows: Chief Executive: 400% of salary Group Finance Director: 250% of salary Performance will be measured over a three year period and will be determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Performance measures remained unchanged from the previous year and will be as follows: 50% of the award is based on absolute TSR measured over the performance period, and vests: 0% vesting below 10% pa TSR: 20% vesting at 10% pa TSR: Straight-line vesting between 10% and 18% pa TSR: and 100% vesting at 18% pa TSR.
50% of the award is based on relative TSR measured against the FTSE 350 Index over the performance period, and vests: 0% for below median performance against the index: 25% for median performance against the index: 100% for upper quartile performance against the index: and Straight-line vesting between median and upper quartile performance.
Awards under the FY2015 plan were measured against the FTSE 250 Index.
After a review, the Committee has decided that the FTSE 350 Index is a more appropriate index to measure the Companys relative TSR, as this Index reflects both the variety of the Companys portfolio of international investments as well as the diverse currencies in which those investments are denominated.
Under the Companys malus and clawback policy, any long-term incentive award may be forfeited or reduced prior to vesting in exceptional circumstances on such basis as the Committee considers fair, reasonable and proportionate.
Shareholding requirements No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2016.
Shareholding requirements will therefore remain as follows: Chief Executive: 300% of salary Group Finance Director: 150% of salary Non-executive Director fees No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2016.
Fees for the non-executive Directors will therefore remain as follows: Chairman fee: 265,000 plus 30,000 in 3i shares Non-executive Directors: Board membership fee: 50,000 plus 3,000 3i shares.
Deputy Chairman including SID fee 40,000 Senior Independent Director fee: 10,000 Committee Chairman: 20,000 Committee member: 8,000 Committee fees are payable in respect of the Audit and Compliance Committee, Remuneration Committee and Valuations Committee.
