com Stock code: ShI 90 24298.02 30 March 2016 2:38 PM PROOF1 GOVERNANCE INCENTIVE OUTCOMES FOR 2015 annual bonus in respect of 2015 in 2015, the maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors was 100% of salary.
90% of bonus was based on financial performance of which 15% related to savings from the Group Strategic initiatives, and 10% on Health & Safety.
For the financial performance element, 55% of bonus was linked to underlying PBT, 20% of bonus to the Groups Return on Capital Employed ROCE and 15% to savings from the Group Strategic initiatives.
Further details of the bonuses paid, including Group and individual targets set and performance against each of the metrics, are provided in the tables below: Financial element outcomes Performance targets Weighting Actual Payout Measure % of salary Threshold Target Stretch performance % of salary Underlying PBT 55% 105.0m 113.0m 118.0m 87.4m 0% ROCE % Year to 31 Dec 15 20% n a 11.6% n a 9.3% 0% Cumulative savings from the Group Strategic initiatives 15% 20.0m 30.0m n a 22.7m 7.7% Total 90% 7.7% Non-financial element outcomes Executive Director Objectives for the year Payout % of salary Mr S.

Therefore, based on performance, an outcome of 17.7% out of a maximum of 100% in respect of both financial and non-financial elements was warranted for both Executive Directors.
The Executive Directors have taken the decision to waive their 2015 bonuses in light of Group financial performance.

Long-term Incentive plan: 2013 awards On 18 April 2013, Mr S. R. Mitchell and Mr. D. G. Robertson received an award of 363,036 and 214,191 nil-cost options respectively under the 2004 LTiP.
Vesting of the award was dependent on three year average ROCE, defined as underlying operating profit after tax divided by average net assets plus average net debt representing two-thirds of the award, and three year cumulative underlying EPS performance representing the remaining one-third of the award.
There was no re-testing of performance.
The performance targets are illustrated overleaf: SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 91 24298.02 30 March 2016 2:38 PM PROOF1 Directors Remuneration Report CONTiNUED Annual Report on Remuneration ROCE element of the award 2 3rd EPS element of the award 1 3rd 100% 100% 0% 0% 9% 13% 30p 40p Average ROCE 2013-2015 Cumulative underlying EPS 2013-2015 operating profit after tax divided by the sum of total pence equity plus net debt For the ROCE element, if three year average ROCE over the three financial years ending 31 December 2015 is less than or equal to 9%, no shares will vest.
Awards vest in full for ROCE of 13% or higher and vesting is on a straight line basis between these two points.
For the EPS element, if cumulative underlying EPS over the three financial years ending 31 December 2015 is less than or equal to 30p, no shares will vest.
Awards vest in full for cumulative EPS of 40p or higher and vesting is on a straight line basis between these two points.
Actual average ROCE was 9.47% and cumulative underlying EPS was 33.5p, which resulted in the vesting of c. 7.78% and c. 11.67% of the maximum award respectively.
19.5% of the total award will therefore vest on 18 April 2016, subject to continued employment.

it is anticipated that the satisfaction of this target will be mainly achieved by the vesting of shares through the Companys share plans.

As in 2015, the 2016 bonus will be linked 55% to Group underlying PBT, 20% to ROCE, 15% to savings from the Group Strategic initiatives and 10% to Health & Safety.
As was the case last year, the Committee has determined that performance targets will not be disclosed on a prospective basis for reasons of commercial sensitivity, but will be disclosed on a retrospective basis in the following years report.
in 2016, financial performance objectives in respect of the bonus, will be measured based on budgeted exchange rates at the start of the year.
This approach is in line with prevailing market practice, was applied in 2015 in respect of financial performance and will be consistently applied in 2016 and future years.
Financial performance in respect of the LTiP will continue to be based on actual exchange rates, in line with market practice.
As in 2015 and in line with the Remuneration Policy, one-third of the annual bonus will be deferred in SiG shares for a period of three years.
As set out in last years report, malus and clawback provisions apply to the annual bonus from the performance year ending 31 December 2015 i. e. payments from 1 January 2016.
LtIp in advance of each LTiP cycle, the Committee reviews the performance measures and corresponding targets to ensure they are appropriately stretching over the performance period.
The Committee intends to make LTiP awards in September 2016, and will determine the appropriate measures and targets closer to the time and disclose them in the 2016 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Malus and clawback As mentioned in the Chairmans Letter, the Committee last year noted the requirement for both malus and clawback provisions to be included in incentives under the updated UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee took action in 2015 in order to implement clawback provisions in the Companys incentive schemes.
Malus and clawback provisions are in place for awards made in and after September 2015 in respect of the LTiP, and for awards made on or after 1 January 2016 in respect of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP and annual bonus.
chairman and Non-executive director fees With effect from 1 May 2015, the fee payable to the Chairman of the Board is 168,000 p. a. and the basic fee payable to each Non-Executive Director is 48,204 p. a.

To provide a meaningful comparison, the analysis includes only salaried employees and is based on a consistent set of employees, i. e. the same individuals appear in the 2015 and 2014 populations.
Given that the Company operates across a number of diverse economies with pay levels and structures reflecting local market conditions, the Committee believes that using the SLT as a subset for purposes of comparing Chief Executive pay against wider employee pay provides a more meaningful comparison than using pay data for all employees.
