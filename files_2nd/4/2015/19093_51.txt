122 Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2015 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Annual bonus Approach to disclosure of bonus targets Mondi has, since its 2012 report, disclosed the performance measures used for the annual bonus as well as outcomes against these measures.
Since the 2013 report we have, in the case of financial measures, provided broad indications of where performance outcomes fell within the bonus ranges that had been set.
Precise bonus ranges were not disclosed, principally for reasons of commercial sensitivity.
Few of Mondis competitors are subject to the same disclosure obligations and such disclosure would place Mondi at a competitive disadvantage.
The Committee is however committed to providing disclosure as soon as the passage of time has rendered such competitive considerations less acute.
For the 2015 report, bonus outcomes have been reported in the same manner as in recent years.
In addition, retrospective disclosure of the financial bonus ranges for the previous 2014 performance year has been provided.
It is the Committees view that this strikes the correct balance between disclosure needs and commercial sensitivity.
In the case of the safety element, where competitive considerations are less pertinent, the disclosures below relate to the 2015 performance year.
For the personal bonus element, the achievements of our executives against key 2015 focus areas are described, together with the ratings awarded to each executive.
2015 bonus outcomes For the annual bonus in respect of 2015 performance, the performance measures and achievement levels were: BSP performance measures EBITDA ROCE Safety Personal Total Weight 30 30 10 30 100 Outcomes: David Hathorn 29.6 30 5 25 89.6 Andrew King 29.6 30 5 26 90.6 Peter Oswald 29.6 30 5 25 89.6 1 Retrospective disclosure of 2014 financial bonus ranges, and outline disclosure of 2015 financial bonus outcomes Financial performance was assessed against the EBITDA and ROCE ranges that were set for 2014.
The 2014 ranges and outcomes were: EBITDA Bonus outcome ROCE Bonus outcome m points % points Entry level 925 7.5 13.0 7.5 Ceiling 1,150 30.0 17.0 30.0 Outcome 1,126 27.6 17.2 30.0 1 For the 2014 performance year, bonus ranges that were communicated within Mondi did not make reference to specific target values.
Since the 2015 performance year bonus ranges have included entry level, target and ceiling values and future disclosures will therefore include all these elements.
Financial performance for 2015 was strong.
Both EBITDA and ROCE were in excess of target performance levels.
ROCE was also in excess of the applicable range ceiling while EBITDA performance came close to the range ceiling.
Full disclosure of the 2015 bonus ranges and outcomes will be included in the 2016 report.
Safety element of 2015 bonus Five points of the 10-point safety element was payable on the achievement of total recordable case rate TRCR targets.
If the achieved TRCR rate was 0.83 or better, then the entire five points would be earned.
One point would be earned for a TRCR of 0.91, with straightline interpolation for TRCR performance between 0.83 and 0.91.
The other five points were payable if there were no fatalities within the Mondi Group.
If there is one fatality then these five points are forfeited.
If there are two fatalities during the year then the entire 10 points attributable to safety are forfeited.
Mondi continued to achieve an industry-leading TRCR performance.
The TRCR that was achieved for 2015 was 0.70.
The full five points attributable to this element were therefore earned.
Following the tragic and unacceptable fatality of an employee engaged in Mondi operations, the portion of the safety element that is payable if there are no fatalities was not paid.
Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2015 123 Annual report on remuneration Personal objectives of executives for 2015 bonus Key objectives and achievements The executive directors share many key objectives and also have individual objectives that are specific to their roles.
Key objectives, and achievements against these objectives during 2015, included: Strategy development All committed major projects on track and on budget andexecution Divested two consumer packaging plants and one containerboard plant A large number of potential acquisitions considered.

Under Mondis LTIP and BSP rules clawback can be applied to awards made on or after 1 January 2011 if there has been a misstatement of financial results, or performance outcomes that are relevant to the plans, that had the effect that awards were larger than they would have been had such errors not been made.
Clawback may, at the Committees discretion, take the form of a demand for the participant to repay amounts to Mondi, a reduction of future bonus payments to the participant, and a reduction in the number of conditional share awards held by a participant.
Clawback applies to misstatement of results or miscalculation of relevant performance outcomes but not to other conduct that may result in the Group wishing to recover funds from the participant.
The Committee and the Group cannot foresee circumstances under which misconduct of a severity that would render the desire for such redress appropriate would be compatible with the participants continued employment.
In the case of employment termination Mondi is able to cancel subsisting but unvested share awards, withhold payments that would otherwise be due to the participant, and, where appropriate, initiate legal proceedings to recover funds to which the Group is legally entitled.
124 Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2015 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Vesting of the 2013 award The LTIP awards that were made in 2013, with a three-year performance period that ended on 31 December 2015, were reviewed by the Committee in February 2016 against the equally weighted relative TSR and ROCE performance conditions.
Maximum performance was achieved against the TSR targets and ROCE targets.
100% of the shares under award therefore vested in March 2016.
Awards granted in 2015 The maximum award that can be made to any LTIP participant in any year is equal to two times salary.
For 2015, the award made to David Hathorn was 185% of salary and the awards made to Andrew King and Peter Oswald were 150% of salary.
For the LTIP awards made in 2015, the performance conditions are based on two performance measures of equal weight relative TSR and ROCE, measured over a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2017.
The Committee believes that this combination of metrics provides an appropriate means of aligning the operation of the LTIP with shareholders interests and the Groups business strategy.
The TSR performance condition is based on the Groups TSR relative to a group of competitor companies.
For the 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 LTIP awards, the following group of companies were selected: 1 Amcor 2013 DS Smith International Paper Mets Board Sappi UPM 1 3 4 Bemis 2013 Domtar Mayr-Melnhof Norske Skog 2012 Smurfit Kappa WestRock 2 Billerud Holmen MeadWestvaco Portucel Stora Enso 1 As previously reported, Amcor and Bemis were added to the peer group for 2013 and subsequent awards.
2 MeadWestvaco was included in LTIP awards until its merger with Rock Tenn in 2015 when it was, in accordance with Committee practice, removed from the peer group for all subsisting awards.
3 As previously reported, Norske Skog was excluded from the peer group for 2013 and subsequent awards.
4 WestRock, the company that was formed by the merger of MeadWestvaco and Rock Tenn, has been included in the peer group for 2016 and subsequent awards.
For the 50% of awards attributable to TSR: If the Groups TSR is below the median when ranked against the comparator group, this part of the award will lapse in full.
For TSR at the median, 25% of this part of the award i. e. 12.5% of the total award will vest, with a straightline progression to the upper quartile, at which point 100% of this part of the award i. e. 50% of the total award will vest.
For the 50% of awards attributable to ROCE: This part will lapse in full if ROCE is below 10%.
25% of this part of the award i. e. 12.5% of the total award will vest for achievement of ROCE of 10%, with a straight-line progression to full vesting of this part ofthe award for achievement of ROCE of 16% i. e. 50% of the total award.
Mondis TSR performance over the last seven years The following graphs set out the comparative TSR of Mondi Limited relative to the JSE All-Share Index, and Mondi plc relative to the FTSE All-Share Index, for the period between 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2015.
Those indices were chosen because they are broad equity market indices of which Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, respectively, are members.

The award value shown in the 2014 Remuneration report was an estimate based on the average share price over the last three months of the performance cycle which was 10.38 for Mondi plc LTIP awards and ZAR183.79 for Mondi Limited LTIP awards.
The total remuneration for 2014 has been restated on this basis.
2 David Hathorns remuneration in 2011 included 3.9 million from the proceeds of a one-off, shareholder approved, share award under a Co-Investment Plan he participated in at the time of the Groups demerger from Anglo American plc in 2007.
Under this plan, he invested 1 million from his own funds in Mondi plc shares in August 2007.
He was eligible to receive a match of up to 250% of the number of investment shares based on a relative TSR performance measure over a four-year period.
As the TSR achieved by Mondi plc was better than the upper quintile Mondi was the top-performing company in the comparator group the Committee approved the maximum vesting in accordance with the Plan rules.

3 In most of the Group the majority of benefits are provided through social security.
Additional benefits represent less than 5% of the salary bill.
4 Aggregate bonuses paid during 2015 are compared with those paid in 2014.
This includes annual bonuses that are paid in arrears and periodic bonuses that are paid more frequently.
Each years numbers therefore include some payments attributable to that year and some that reflect performance in the previous year.
Bonuses are often based on specific objectives that are set at the level of local operations that do not necessarily correlate with Group-wide metrics that underpin the CEOs bonus.
