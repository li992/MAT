Clawback provisions In line with the revised UK Corporate Governance Code issued in September 2014, the Committee has formally introduced clawback provisions.
These will apply to the annual bonus plan and the Plans, as set out in the following table.
Plan Period of time clawback will apply for First application Annual bonus paid in cash Three years following the end of the bonus year Bonus earned in respect of FY16 i. e. paid in June 2016 Annual bonus invested in CIP Three years following the end of the bonus year Bonus earned in respect of FY16 deferral period i. e. deferred in May June 2016 CIP matching awards One year following the end of the performance period Awards made in respect of FY16 deferred bonus i. e. made in May June 2016 PSP awards One year following the end of the performance period Awards made in May June 2015 Clawback will not apply to the annual bonus payable in 2015 or the CIP award to be granted in 2015 because the terms of these arrangements had already been put in place prior to the Committees decision to implement clawback.
92 Governance Report on directors remuneration Annual report on remuneration continued Annual bonus Other than the formal introduction of clawback provisions, the Committees approach to operating the annual bonus plan for the year ending 31 March 2016 will be unchanged from 2015.
Under the clawback provisions, the Company may recover part, or all, of any annual bonus paid, at any time during the three years following the end of the financial year.
In line with previous practice, the Committee has chosen not to disclose the annual bonus target calibration for 31 March 2016 for reasons of commercial sensitivity.
If the Committee decides that targets have ceased to be commercially sensitive, they will be disclosed in the next available remuneration report.
CIP The executive directors have elected to defer 100% of their bonus into the CIP.
Matching shares, equivalent to 200% of the invested bonus, are expected to be granted in the first quarter of the year ending 31 March 2016.
These will vest subject to satisfying the following performance conditions, which will be measured over a three-year performance period: 1 2 Vesting Performance measure Weighting No match 1:1 match 2:1 match Benchmark PBT per share annual growth 50% Below 4% 4% 8% Cumulative operating cash flow 50% Below US$3.6bn US$3.6bn US$4.0bn 1 Straight-line vesting between the points shown.
2 T he vesting of awards is subject to the Committee being satisfied that the vesting is not based on financial results which have been materially misstated.
In addition, the Committee has the discretion to vary the level of vesting if it considers that the level of vesting determined by measuring performance is inconsistent with the Groups underlying financial and operational performance.
The cumulative operating cash flow target range is lower compared to last year to take into account the effect of the movement in key exchange rates impacting the Group US dollar to Brazilian real, euro, sterling and Colombian peso.
PSP Awards equivalent to 200% of salary are expected to be granted in the first quarter of the year ending 31 March 2016.
These will vest subject to satisfying the following performance conditions, which will be measured over a three-year performance period: 1 2 3 Vesting Performance measure Weighting 0% 25% 100% Benchmark PBT per share annual growth 75% Below 4% 4% 8% TSR of Experian vs TSR of FTSE 100 Index 25% Below Index Equal to Index 25% above Index 1 Straight-line vesting between the points shown.
2 V esting of these awards will be subject to the Committee agreeing that ROCE performance is satisfactory and that vesting is not based on financial results which have been materially misstated.
3 Under the clawback provisions, the Company may recover part or all of any vested award, at any time during the 12 months following the end of the performance period.
The Committee selected these financial measures as performance metrics as they reflect three of our key performance indicators EBIT, operating cash flow and ROCE.
As described in the Chairmans introduction and highlights, the Benchmark PBT metric has been amended slightly and will now be measured on a per share basis.
Whilst continuing to encourage profit growth this will also reinforce the discipline of balancing growth investments against the value of returning capital to shareholders and therefore enhance the alignment of management and shareholders interests.
The use of the financial metrics provides a direct link to the strategic aims of the business.
The use of TSR recognises the importance of returning value to shareholders.
