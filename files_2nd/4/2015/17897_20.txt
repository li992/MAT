com AR2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 69 Directors remuneration policy report The policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 15 May 2014.
Although there is no requirement to include the Policy Report this year, it has been included for ease of reference.
Policy overview The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the Companys remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of the executive Directors of the Company and the Chairman.
In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account a number of factors, including: general trends in pay and conditions throughout the Group the positioning of remuneration levels against the external market the balance between fixed and variable pay more specifically, variable pay should form a significant but not disproportionately high level of potential remuneration the strategy of the business.
In setting the overall remuneration policy, general trends and average increases throughout the Group are taken into account when setting executive Directors reward packages.
A key feature for the executive Directors is that a higher proportion of their remuneration package is delivered through performance-related pay, which has a greater linkage to the results of the Group.
The areas covered in this Policy Report comprise: Consideration of shareholders views 69 Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group 69 Summary of executive Directors remuneration policy 70 Remuneration scenarios for executive Directors 72 Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors 72 Service agreements and payments for loss of office for executive Directors 73 External appointments of executive Directors 73 Appointment of non-executive Directors 73 Consideration of shareholders views The Committee considers feedback from shareholders received at each AGM, and any feedback from additional meetings, as part of any review of executive remuneration.
In addition, the Committee engages proactively with shareholders and will ensure that shareholders are consulted in advance, where any material changes to the remuneration policy are proposed.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group In determining the remuneration of the Companys Directors, the Committee takes into account the general trends in pay and conditions across the Group as a whole.
Whilst employees have not been consulted formally on executive pay, due in part to the diverse geographic disposition of the Group, the Committee seeks to ensure that the underlying principles which form the basis for decisions on Directors pay are consistent with those on which pay decisions for the rest of the workforce are taken.
These are focused for the most part on market competitiveness, business performance and personal performance.
In practice, the remuneration policy for executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees, so that a significant proportion of their remuneration is dependent on Company performance.
For employees below Board level, variable pay represents a lower proportion of their total remuneration, which is driven by market comparators and general performance.

6 No share price appreciation or dividend awards have been assumed for the DBP shares and PSP awards.
Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors To ensure the ongoing leadership continuity of the Group, the appointment of high-calibre executives may be necessary, either by external appointment or internal promotion.
The remuneration package for a new executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of theCompanys remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the scope and complexity of the role, the experience ofthe individual, the prevailing market rate for that experience and the importance and immediacy of securing that candidate.
The salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract the most appropriate candidate.
The AIP potential would be limited to 120% of salary, and grants under the PSP may be up to the plan maximum of 200% of salary.
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer.
It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards were consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal executive Director appointment, any remuneration awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according toits terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and or incidental expenses as appropriate.
com AR2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 73 Service agreements and payments for loss of office for executive Directors It is the Companys policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term, which are subject to one years notice by the Company and six months notice by the executive Director.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all executive Directors submit themselves for re-election at the AGM.
In the event of early termination, the executive Directors contracts provide for compensation in line with their contractual notice period.
In summary, the contractual provisions are to provide the following: Provision Detailed terms Notice period 12 months by the Company, six months by the executive Director.
There are no contractual compensation provisions for termination of employment.
However, other non-contractual considerations are as follows: Notice payments If any existing contract was breached by the Company, it would be liable to pay an amount approximating to the net loss of salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period, subject to mitigation and phased payments where appropriate.
Remuneration entitlements Pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with vesting for outstanding share awards in certain circumstances see below.
In all cases, performance targets would apply.
Change of control No executive Directors contract contains additional provisions in respect of change of control.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive Director under the Companys share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment under the PSP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, good leaver status may be applied.
For good leavers, awards will not be forfeited on cessation of employment and, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions, will vest under the normal vesting schedule, being reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.
However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine that PSP awards vest at cessation and or to amend time pro rating.
Outstanding DBP awards will lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain good leavercircumstances, DBP awards will vest in full on the date of cessation.
External appointments of executive Directors The Committee recognises that benefits can arise from allowing executive Directors to take a non-executive directorship elsewhere.
Executive Directors are permitted to have one external appointment, from which fees may be retained with the approval of the Board.
Appointment of non-executive Directors Non-executive Directors are appointed by the full Board following recommendations from the Nomination Committee.
All non-executive Directors are appointed for a term of three years.

The normal review date for executive Directors base salaries is 1 July, but it was agreed on appointment that neither would receive an increase in 2015.
The next salary review date is 1 July 2016.
Performance targets for the AIP in 2016 For 2016, the AIP for the executive Directors will be a maximum bonus of 120% of base salary subject to three performance measures: profit before tax 51% cash 25% strategic business and personal objectives 24%.
The three elements are measured and calculated independently of each other and 50% of any bonus earned will be deferred for three years in the form of Balfour Beatty shares.
While the Committee has chosen not to disclose in advance the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be presented in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance targets for PSP awards granted in 2016 Consistent with the approach adopted in 2015, the PSP awards to be granted in 2016 will be subject to the following targets: relative TSR 33.3% the Companys TSR measured against a comparator group of UK listed companies ranked 51150 by market capitalisation in the FTSE All Share Index excluding investment trusts as at 1 January 2016, the start of the performance period.
There is no vesting below median, with 25% of this part of an award vesting at median ranking, rising to 100% vesting of this part of an award at upper quartile or higher EPS 33.3% the growth in the Companys EPS over the three-year performance period Cash 33.3% cash remains critical as a long-term performance measure during the Companys transformation.
As at the date of publication of this Remuneration report, the Committee had not finalised the EPS and cash performance targets for the PSP award to be granted in 2016.
These EPS and cash targets will be set at an appropriate level of stretch and will be fully disclosed in the RNS announcement issued immediately following the PSP award and in the Remuneration report for 2016.
Non-executive Directors As detailed in the Policy Report, the Companys approach to setting non-executive Directors fees is by reference to fees paid at similar companies and reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of each role.
A summary of current fees is as follows: 1 July 2014 1 July 2015 % increase 1 Chairman 265,750 270,000 1.6% Base fee 56,000 56,000 0% Senior Independent Director fee 10,000 10,000 0% Committee chair fee 10,000 10,000 0% 1 The Chairmans fees shown at 1 July 2014 are those paid to Steve Marshall who stepped down from the Board on 26 March 2015, and was replaced by Philip Aiken whose fees are shown at 1 July 2015.

Therefore afull payment of the 25.0% weighting for this element is payable, ie 30.0% of salary as the AIP maximum payment is 120.0% following detailed consideration by the Committee of performance against strategic business and personal objectives, the executive Directors were both awarded a payment of 22.0% of the 24.0% weighting payable for this element, ie 26.4% of salary as the AIP maximum payment is 120.0%.
The factors the Committee considered in agreeing this assessment included the success of the Build to Last transformation programme and the delivery of other key strategic objectives including the review of the Investments portfolio and the refinancing.
The Committee considered carefully the AIP performance out-turn for the executive Directors against the background of disappointing profit performance and determined that the above payments are appropriate.
The performance issues relate to legacy contracts and the recently appointed executive Directors have, in the opinion of the Committee, dealt with these challenges to create the foundations for asustainable business.
