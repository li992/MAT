Salaries are generally reviewed with effect from 1 March.
b Value of STIP deferred under the BDP, the vesting of which is subject to continued service.
c Based on the value of the LTIP awards which vested in respect of the performance period that ended 31 December.
The Rio Tinto Ltd and Rio Tinto plc share prices used to calculate the value of the awards vesting are based on the closing prices on 15 February 2016 which were A$42.22 and 18.51 respectively.
Executives who were members of the Executive Committee at the time the 2012 PSP awards were granted Hugo Bague, Andrew Harding, Harry Kenyon-Slaney and Debra Valentine also received a cash payment equal to the aggregate net dividends that would have been paid on the 2012 PSP shares that vested had they owned them during the four-year performance period.
No payment was made in respect of the shares that lapsed.
d For defined benefit plans, pension or superannuation reflects the value of the pension or superannuation accrued during the year assuming that it was to come into payment immediately.
For defined contribution plans and cash paid in lieu of pension contributions it is the amount contributed in the year by the Company.
This differs from the value reported in table 1a which is calculated using an IAS19 methodology and assumptions on rates of investment return, inflation and salary increases.
e Includes healthcare, other post-employment benefits, allowance for professional tax services and car allowance or car.
Includes active or legacy expatriate related benefits, as relevant.
g Remuneration details for 2014 reflect remuneration received for the period 1 June 2014 31 December 2014.
The value of LTIP awards vesting in 2014 includes an award of 5,278 MSP shares granted on 16 September 2014 which vested on 31 October 2014.
This award was made to Mr Barrios in lieu of forfeited and foreshortened vesting periods of stock options from his previous employer.
h Given Alan Davies has been living and working in the UK for some time, his remuneration was localised in accordance with policy, with effect from 1 March 2015.
To comply with Australian legislation, the Company made a payment to Alan for his accrued long-service leave, which was valued at 240,000.
In addition, Alan received a part payment of his accrued annual leave of 167,000 and a lump sum payment of 225,000 in lieu of contractual commitments already made in relation to his future, multi-year entitlements to housing allowance, education assistance, home leave and a resettlement allowance.
The percentage change in total remuneration has been calculated by converting Alans 2014 remuneration denominated in Australian dollars to pound sterling using the 2014 average exchange rate of 1 1.82531 A$.
i Remuneration details for 2015 reflect remuneration received for the period 1 January 2015 28 February 2015.
Remuneration received for the period 1 March 2015 18 March 2015 was base salary of 26,000, STIP of 30,000, value of LTIP awards vesting of 16,000, pension of 3,000 and other benefits of 45,000.
Other benefits included unused and accrued vacation, healthcare benefits and standard benefits related to repatriation from Australia to the UK.
A severance payment of 1,050,000 was paid on termination.
Further details are provided under the heading - Departures from the Executive Committee.
Context to outcomes for the Executive Committee The decrease in the single total figure of remuneration for most executives is due mainly to the significantly lower value of LTIP awards vesting in 2015 compared with 2014.
This was due to a lower vesting level for the PSP awards 65.4 per cent for the 2012 PSP versus 73.5 per cent for the 2011 PSP combined with lower share prices at the date the 2012 PSP awards vested in February 2016 compared with the share prices at the date the 2011 PSP awards vested in February 2015.
In addition, a number of executives Alan Davies, Jean-Sbastien Jacques and Greg Lilleyman had residual MSP awards vest during 2014 which were granted prior to their appointment as executives.
Alf Barrios 2014 remuneration included the vesting of an MSP award which was made to him in lieu of forfeited and foreshortened vesting periods of stock options from his previous employer.
His total short-term pay has increased in 2015 as his remuneration details for 2014 reflect remuneration received for part year service only.
The increase total remuneration for Alan Davies in 2015 is influenced by the one-off payments explained in note h above.
