Melrose Industries PLC Governance 64 Annual Report 2015 Directors Remuneration Report M elroses remuneration philosophy Justin Dowley Remuneration Committee Chairman is that executive remuneration should be simple and transparent, support the delivery of the business strategy and pay for performance.
Dear Shareholder, The Board has delegated to the On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our report on Directors remuneration at the end of yet another highly successful Remuneration Committee the Committee year, the highlight of which has been the sale of Elster to Honeywell responsibility for overseeing the remuneration International Inc. Honeywell.
The Directors Remuneration of the Companys Directors, Company Report sets out the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 31December 2015 and the remuneration policy for the Directors Secretary and other senior employees.
of meetings The Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended Justin Dowley Chairman 3 3 31December 2015 is presented in two sections: the Annual Perry Crosthwaite 3 3 Report on Remuneration and the Directors remuneration policy.
John Grant 3 3 The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details on the Liz Hewitt 3 3 amounts earned in respect of the year ended 31December 2015 and will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM to be held on 11May 2016.
The existing Directors remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and took binding effect from the conclusion of that meeting.
The approval of the Directors remuneration policy is normally valid for three years, provided the Company does not intend to make changes to the policy within this period, and therefore shareholder approval of the policy would not normally be required until the AGM in 2017.
However, due to the introduction of a new holding company for the Group in November 2015, the Company is required to seek shareholder approval for the Directors remuneration policy in respect of the new holding company at the 2016 AGM.
It is important to note that no changes have been made to the remuneration policy being put to shareholders: it is wholly consistent with the remuneration policy approved in 2014.
It should be noted that the 2012 Incentive Plan, which is a legacy arrangement, no longer forms part of the forward-looking policy as explained below.
We have also formally incorporated within the policy the clawback arrangements which have applied in respect of the annual bonus for 2015 and future years, as referred to in the 2014 Directors Remuneration Report.
The Directors remuneration policy sets out the forward-looking remuneration policy that will be subject to a binding vote at the AGM and shall take binding effect from the conclusion of that meeting.
A key element of the Melrose remuneration framework is the 2012 Incentive Plan, the Companys long-term incentive arrangement, which was approved by special resolution of shareholders at a general meeting held in April 2012.
As no more awards will be granted to executive Directors under the 2012 Incentive Plan, it is not included in our forward-looking Directors remuneration policy.
The existing options set out on page 73 will continue in accordance Board of Directors 48 with their terms.
In the interests of transparency, we have set out on Governance Melrose Industries PLC Annual Report 2015 65 page 68 an illustration of how the growth in value of the Company Annual bonus: The maximum bonus payable is set at 100% over the period from the start of the 2012 Incentive Plan in March of base salary.

scheme receive the same percentage bonus.
In the last six years, the average percentage of base salary payable has been 84%.

In addition, Honeywell assumed all Elster-related pension obligations as well as the Groups FKI UK and McKechnie Rather than successive one-year long-term incentive arrangements, UK defined benefit plans, which had combined gross liabilities we believe that a five-year arrangement is preferable, given that of 849 million and a net accounting deficit of 112 million at it is closer to a typical ownership cycle for an acquired business.
By its nature, this means that any payment under the Groups long-term incentive arrangements is only made once every five In accordance with our strategy, the Board returned 2.4 billion of years and so the payment in that fifth year should not be regarded the disposal proceeds to shareholders, equivalent to 240 pence as an annual payment.
The long-term incentive arrangements are intended to directly Since flotation on AIM in 2003, Melrose has raised approximately align our executive Directors incentive arrangements with the 2.0 billion from shareholders, provided a total shareholder return interests of shareholders by linking remuneration specifically of 574% as at 2 March 2016, compared to 144% for the FTSE to shareholder value.

This means that, whilst shareholder investment exceeds returns, the 2012 Incentive It is with this performance in mind, and in line with Melroses Plan has a minimum growth requirement effectively a charge remuneration philosophy of pay for performance, that the Committee which requires the net invested capital to be inflated by RPI 2% has taken its decisions in respect of executive Directors per annum.
Equally, if and so long as shareholder returns exceed remuneration arrangements for 2015 and 2016. shareholder investment, the net shareholder returns are treated as increased by the RPI 2% per annum amount.
The value payable Our remuneration structure for executive to management under the 2012 Incentive Plan comprises 7.5% of Directors value created in excess of these amounts.
The 2012 Incentive Plan Melroses remuneration philosophy is that executive remuneration is then paid out to participants in predetermined proportions, either should be simple and transparent, support the delivery of the in ordinary shares or and only in certain circumstances which are business strategy and pay for performance.
This philosophy is within the complete control of the Remuneration Committee as a reflected in our remuneration structure.

The formula by which growth is calculated, Base salary: Base salaries are paid in line with a marketas set out in the Companys articles of association, takes account competitive range compared with companies of similar size and of every change to the capital structure and dividend payment.
Since flotation in 2003, all current executive Directors have received the same annual increases to base salary.
In the last six years these increases have averaged 3%.
Pension: Pension contributions salary supplements for executive Directors are payable at the level of 15% of base salary, which is considered modest for a business of the size and complexity of Melrose.

Benefits The range of benefits provided to Directors has not changed since the inception of Melrose and there is no intention to widen the range of benefits Directors may receive.
All of the executive Directors received taxable benefits during 2015, being a company car allowance, fuel allowance, private medical insurance, life insurance and group income protection.
Geoffrey Martin also received paid train travel to and from London.
Bonus The maximum bonus opportunity is set below the maximum median annual bonus opportunity for FTSE 250 companies to reflect the participation of the executive Directors in the 2012 Incentive Plan.
For the year ended 31December 2015, the maximum bonus opportunity was equal to 100% of base salary.
Following the application of the formulaic basis used in previous years and as explained in the table on page 72 of this report, it was determined by the Remuneration Committee that Simon Peckham and Geoffrey Martin being the only executive Directors participating in the annual bonus plan should be awarded a bonus of 88% of base salary.

These calculations are set out in the Consolidated Income Statement on page 90 of this Annual Report and financial statements.
For the purposes of the annual bonus, the Remuneration Committee determined it to be inequitable to exclude recognition for the trading results of Elster over the year in determining performance and, as such, earnings per share have been adjusted to include the trading results of Elster to 29December 2015.

Notwithstanding the performance during the year, the Remuneration Committee has determined that no such adjustment will be made.

The Remuneration Committee considers the FTSE 100 Index, the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE All-Share Index to be appropriate indices for the year ended 31December 2015 for the purposes of this comparison because of the comparable size of the companies which comprise the FTSE 100 Index and the FTSE 250 Index and the broad nature of companies which comprise the FTSE All-Share Index.
The data shown below assumes that all cash returns to shareholders made by the Company during this period are reinvested in ordinary shares.

This means that the full value of the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Plan on 11April 2012 is shown for the year ended 31December 2012 and no value will be reflected in the total figure of remuneration for the 2012 Incentive Plan until the trigger date which will be May 2017 or an earlier trigger date determined in accordance with the arrangements.
The value of the 2009 Incentive Plan was earned over a period of approximately five years.
Therefore, in the view of the Remuneration Committee, inclusion of this value in respect of the year ended 31December 2012 does not give a fair representation of the Chief Executives yearly remuneration over each of the previous five years.
Therefore, an additional column has been added to the table below to show total remuneration excluding the value received on the maturity in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Plan.
No other long-term incentive plan vested in favour of any executive Director in any of the other years.
The amount of that value shown in respect of David Roper and Simon Peckham for the year ended 31 December 2012 reflects the proportion of that year for which each was the Chief Executive.

Because the value derived on the crystallisation of the 2009 incentive shares depended upon the shareholder value created over the relevant period, it is not possible to express the value derived as a percentage of the maximum opportunity.
The crystallisation of the 2009 incentive shares was satisfied by the conversion of those shares into ordinary shares.
3 T he value derived in 2012 from the 2009 incentive shares represents the Chief Executives share, determined in accordance with the terms of those shares, of the shareholder value created over a period of approximately five years.

This group of senior management was considered an appropriate comparator group because of their level of seniority and the structure of their remuneration package.
The spread of the Companys operations across various countries and industries means that remuneration policies vary to take account of geography and industry such that the Remuneration Committee considers that selecting a wider group of employees would not provide a meaningful comparison.

As part of the Restructuring of the Group and in accordance with their terms, the options were exchanged for like options over 2012 incentive shares in New Melrose, on substantially the same economic terms as the former options.
No further options will be granted to executive Directors pursuant to the 2012 Incentive Plan.
However, the existing options will continue and may be exercised by their holders in accordance with their terms and the 2012 incentive shares acquired pursuant to any such exercise shall then be dealt with in accordance with the Companys articles of association.
The options over such shares currently held by the executive Directors are set out on page 73.

Explanation of performance metrics chosen Performance measures are chosen to align with the Companys strategy.
Annual bonus Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual bonus, to reflect the key financial and strategic objectives of the Company and to reward for delivery against these targets.
When setting the targets, the Remuneration Committee will take into account a number of different reference points including its plans and strategy and the market environment.
Differences between the Companys policy on Directors remuneration and its policy on remuneration for other employees Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group are determined based on the same principle that rewards should be sufficient as is necessary to attract and retain high calibre talent, without paying more than is necessary and should be achieved for delivery of the Companys strategy.
The Company has operations in various countries, with Group employees of differing levels of seniority.
Accordingly, though based on the over-arching principle above, reward policies vary to take account of these factors.
The Company has also implemented divisional long-term incentive plans for senior managers of businesses within the Group to incentivise them to create value for the Company and its shareholders.
Illustration of the application of Directors remuneration policy The options under the 2012 Incentive Plan were granted in 2012 prior to the policy set out in this Directors Remuneration Report coming into effect.
Therefore, and in accordance with the requirements of the applicable regulations, they are not taken into account in the charts below.
However, in the interests of transparency, and to illustrate how the 2012 Incentive Plan may operate, we have set out on page 68 an illustration of how the growth in value over the period from the start of the 2012 Incentive Plan might translate into value earned by participants in that arrangement.
Accordingly, in illustrating the potential reward under the policy set out in this Directors Remuneration Report, the following assumptions have been made: Minimum performance: fixed elements of remuneration only base salary effective from 1January 2016, and benefits and pension rate as set out in the single figure table for the year ended 31December 2015 on page 70.

In addition to the policy elements set out in the table on pages 76 and 77, the Remuneration Committee retains discretion to make appropriate remuneration decisions outside the standard policy to meet the individual circumstances of the recruitment, including discretion to include any other remuneration component or award.
The Remuneration Committee does not intend to use this discretion to make a non-performance related incentive payment for example a golden hello.
In this regard, elements that the Remuneration Committee may consider for the purposes of a remuneration package for the recruitment of a new executive Director include but are not limited to the following: Element Approach Incentive remuneration Recognising that any new executive Director would not participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan or any other existing opportunity long-term incentive arrangement, the Remuneration Committee may award a maximum annual bonus opportunity of up to 300% of salary until such time as a new long-term incentive arrangement is put in place for the executive Directors in which that new executive Director could participate.
Compensation for forfeited The Remuneration Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buy out remuneration arrangements remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will have regard to relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to such arrangements, the form of those awards e. g. cash or shares and the time frame of such awards.
While such awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to on the following page, the Remuneration Committees intention is that the value awarded as determined by the Remuneration Committee on a fair and reasonable basis would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements.
Where considered appropriate, buyout awards will be subject to forfeiture or clawback on early departure.
Notice period The notice period will be the same as the Companys ordinary policy of 12 months.
Relocation costs Where necessary, the Company will pay appropriate relocation costs.
The Remuneration Committee will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary.
Retirement benefits The maximum contribution of 15% of salary referred to in the policy table on page 77 will apply to any new executive Director.
However, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to pay the contribution into any pension arrangement or to pay the amount as a supplement to base salary in lieu of a pension arrangement.
Melrose Industries PLC Governance 80 Annual Report 2015 Directors Remuneration Report continued Under the applicable reporting regulations, the Company is required to set out the maximum level of variable remuneration that may be granted when agreeing the components of a remuneration package for the appointment of Directors, excluding any remuneration constituting compensation for the forfeiture of any variable remuneration award with a previous employer.
In order to provide sufficient flexibility in recruitment scenarios and to reflect the fact that a newly-appointed executive Director would not participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan or any other existing long-term incentive arrangement, the Remuneration Committee has set this maximum level of variable remuneration at three times salary.
Incentive awards and buyout awards may be granted under new plans as permitted under the Listing Rules, which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of a Director.
Where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue in accordance with their subsisting terms.
The remuneration package for a newly-appointed non-executive Director would normally be in line with the structure set out in the policy table for non-executive Directors.

Governance Melrose Industries PLC Annual Report 2015 81 The principles on which the determination of payments for loss of office will be approached are summarised below: Provision Treatment upon loss of office Payment in lieu of notice If the Company terminates an executive Directors employment with immediate effect, a payment in lieu of notice may be made.
This may include base salary, pension contributions and benefits.
Annual bonus This will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an individual basis and the decision whether or not to award a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon a number of factors including the circumstances of the executive Directors departure and their contribution to the business during the bonus period in question.
Typically, bonus amounts will be pro-rated for time in service up to termination.
Other payments The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Directors office or employment.
In appropriate circumstances, payments may also be made in respect of legal fees.
The overall amount of any payment made in respect of a loss of office will not exceed the aggregate of any payment in lieu of notice and any payment made in respect of annual bonus, as referred to above.
Entitlements in respect of the 2012 Incentive Plan will be dealt with in accordance with their terms and, were the Company to make an award on recruitment of an executive Director to buy out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, the leaver provisions for that award would be determined at the time of grant.
If an executive Director ceases to be employed by the Company, the Company is wound up or there is a change of control of the Company, the options granted pursuant to the 2012 Incentive Plan, and any 2012 incentive shares issued in accordance with the plan, will be dealt with in accordance with their terms.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company Salary, benefits and performance-related awards provided to employees are taken into account when setting policy for executive Directors remuneration.
There is no consultation with employees on Directors remuneration.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views The Company is committed to ongoing engagement and seeks the views of major shareholders in advance of amending its remuneration policies.
The policies are set to reflect the Companys commercial strategy and the 2012 Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders in 2012.
Shareholding guidelines The shareholding guidelines which apply to the executive Directors and the minimum levels of shareholdings are set out on page 72.
Payments outside the policy in this report The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office outside the policy set out in this report: where the terms of the payment were agreed before the policy came into effect: where the terms of the payment were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the payment was not in consideration of the individual becoming a Director of the Company: and or to satisfy contractual commitments under legacy remuneration arrangements.
For these purposes, payments includes the satisfaction of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
Any such payment shall include the satisfaction of the exercise of any options under the 2012 Incentive Plan and the delivery of the value attributable to the 2012 incentive shares in accordance with the Companys articles of association.
Approval This report was approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by: Justin Dowley Chairman, Remuneration Committee 3 March 2016
