There is no retest provision.
The Committee considers that the targets applying under each of the performance measures are no less stretching than in previous years.

IMPLEMENTATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2016 The Committee undertook a full review of Unite Executive Director remuneration towards the end of 2015.
Although it was concluded that the overall structure of remuneration remains appropriate, the Committee considers that the attractiveness of the overall package has fallen below market rates versus comparable companies.
Taking into account the Groups sustained exceptional performance, the increase in scale of Unites operations in recent years and strong competition for talent from new market entrants, the Committee is proposing to make a number of adjustments to executive remuneration for 2016 and is therefore seeking shareholder support for the revised remuneration policy set out earlier in this report.
Details of how the Committee intends to operate the new policy in 2016 are included below: Base salary The Committee has approved the following salary increases with effect from 1 March 2016: Base salary from 1 March 2015 Base salary from 1 March 2016 Executive Director to 28 February 2016 to 28 February 2017 Percentage increase M C Allan 434,000 460,000 6% J J Lister 274,600 291,000 6% R C Simpson 247,700 270,000 9% R S Smith 247,700 270,000 9% The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 85 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED A salary increase averaging 2.0% across the Group was awarded at the annual pay review.
It is proposed that the salaries of Messrs. Simpson and Smith will be increased by up to an additional c. 9% effective 1 March 2017 subject to continued strong performance.
This staged approach to salary increases is designed to help ensure there is no reward for failure, and allows the Committee to assess performance again before finalising the second increase next year.
Although the Committee has not set a specific threshold for approving the second year increases, we will be looking for evidence that Unites performance has maintained its current trajectory and that each of the two managing directors has contributed to the further success of the Group.
Further details will be included in this section of next years report.
Pension Executive Directors will continue to receive a pension contribution of up to 20% of salary or an equivalent cash allowance.
Performance related annual bonus Corporate measures Wgt.
Financial 75% Adjusted EPS 25.0% TR per share 25.0% Net debt to EBITDA ratio 25.0% Non-financial 25% Customer satisfaction 25.0% The performance related annual bonus for the 2016 financial year will operate on broadly the same basis as in 2015.
The Committee has approved a maximum bonus opportunity for each executive of 144% of salary, consisting of a maximum of 120% of salary under the corporate element and a maximum individual multiplier of 1.2x.
For 2016, the corporate element of the annual bonus will continue to be based on a combination of financial and non-financial measures, weighted 75% and 25% respectively.
Proposed target levels have been set to be challenging relative to the 2016 business plan, although specific targets are deemed to be commercially sensitive at this time.
It is the Committees current intention to disclose these targets retrospectively in the 2016 Directors Remuneration Report.
Annual bonuses will continue to be paid in cash, unless the recipient has not met their shareholding guidelines, in which case up to 50% of the amount payable will be satisfied by an allocation of shares in the Company deferred for three years.
Clawback provisions will apply, in addition to the current malus provisions, to annual bonuses from 2016 onwards.
LTIP For 2016, the LTIP will continue to operate broadly on the same basis as in the 2015 financial year.
Subject to shareholder support for the new remuneration policy, it is intended that Executive Directors will each receive an award equivalent to a maximum of 200% of salary delivered through a combination of the PSP and ESOS, with the final level of vesting dependent on the achievement of three-year performance targets relating to EPS, TR and TSR, as follows: Measure Weighting Targets 2018 adjusted earnings per share EPS 1 3 0% vesting below 30.0 pence 25% vesting for 30.0 pence 100% vesting for 38.0 pence or more: Straight line vesting between these points Total return TR per share p. a.
100% vesting for 15% p. a. or more: Straight line vesting between these points TSR outperformance of the FTSE 350 Real Estate 1 3 0% vesting if Group underperforms the Index Supersector Index 20162018 25% vesting for matching the Index 100% vesting for outperforming Index by 9% p. a. : Straight line vesting between these points Targets have been set with reference to internal and external reference points, including our strategic plan and broker consensus estimates, and are designed to be stretching but achievable for participants.
Full vesting under each element will require continued exceptional performance over the next 3 years.
Any awards vesting for performance will be subject to an additional two-year holding period, during which time clawback provisions will also apply.
Further details of the grant date and number of interests awarded will be disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report on Remuneration.
