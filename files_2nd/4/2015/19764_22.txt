In this way, we maintain a keen focus on delivering long-term growth, thereby enhancing long-term value for shareholders.

Similarly, additional consideration may be provided, if necessary, to secure specific agreements following separation for example an enhanced non-compete provision that protect the Companys interests.
Depending on the role and circumstances of departure, a director who has been relocated may be repatriated in accordance with previously agreed terms.
The Company may pay some or all of the costs incurred by the executive in respect of legal, financial, outplacement or other relevant personal advisory services and or expenses in connection with relocation.
The Committee will approve such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, with a view to maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements and consistency with internal Company policies that may apply.
Application of remuneration policy The tables and charts below illustrate the application of the remuneration policy described in this report, by showing the value that may be delivered from each element of the package under different performance scenarios during the financial year to which the Report relates.
No bonus is paid at or below threshold: the target opportunity is 75% for the CEO and 50% for the CFO: while the maximum is 175% of salary.
2 The maximum award is 300% of base salary.
15% vests at threshold, and the target shown is halfway between threshold and stretch ie 57.5% of maximum.
3 Nick Hampton joined the Company on 1 September 2014.
The values shown here represent the annual value of the core remuneration terms on which he was appointed and are not pro-rated for the part-year.
This does not include the potential value from one-off awards made in connection with his appointment details are given in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of shareholder views The remuneration strategy and policy described here were established in 2010 following a review and extensive consultation with major shareholders.
Shareholders overwhelmingly approved the continuing use of the Performance Share Plan as our long-term incentive at the AGM in 2012, and formally approved the Remuneration Policy at the AGM in 2014.
The Committee led by the Committee Chairman engages with our major institutional shareholders each year specifically on remuneration topics, alongside the Boards wider-ranging shareholder engagement programme.
The Committee also receives regular updates on investors views and corporate governance matters.
These lines of communication ensure that emerging best practice principles are factored into the Committees decision making during the year.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company The principles on which we base remuneration decisions for executives as described on page 60 are broadly consistent with those on which we base remuneration decisions for all employees.
In particular, the Committee takes into account the general pay and employment conditions of other employees of the Company when making decisions on executive directors remuneration.
This includes considering the levels of base salary increase for employees below executive level, and ensuring that the same principles apply in setting performance targets for executives incentives as for other employees of the Group.
The Committee also reviews information on bonus payments and share awards made to the broader management of the Group when determining awards and outcomes at executive director level.

Executive director changes during the year Appointment of Nick Hampton as Chief Financial Officer Nick Hamptons appointment as Chief Financial Officer was announced on 24 June 2014, along with details of the remuneration terms on which he was appointed.
Nicks remuneration, benefits and incentives are consistent with the policy on directors remuneration approved by shareholders.
Consistent with our remuneration policy relating to the terms of directors appointment, as approved by shareholders, we have made provision to compensate Nick for specific short-term and long-term incentives given up by him as a consequence of him leaving his former employer.
As announced at the time of his appointment, these compensatory awards comprised a one-off Restricted Stock Award RSA of 1,200,000 worth of shares in Tate & Lyle PLC subject to employment and specified performance conditions and an award of 1,440,000 worth of shares in Tate & Lyle PLC subject to the same EPS and ROCE performance conditions that are applicable to 2014 awards under Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 71 GOVERNANCE Directors Remuneration Report continued the Performance Share Plan.
Nick joined the Board on 1 September 2014 and, in light of the matters covered in the trading updates issued on 23 September 2014 which had their origins prior to his arrival and the associated market reaction, the Committee re-considered the compensatory awards.
Following consultation with a number of the Companys largest shareholders which indicated a broad level of support, and in keeping with our shareholder approved policy in relation to the terms of directors appointments, the Company has agreed to make a restricted stock award to Nick with a face value of 700,000 on grant, to honour the agreed value of the compensatory awards.
This award will vest following the announcement of results for the year ending 31 March 2017.
As a condition of the grant of this award, Nick will be required to surrender the award that was made over 1,440,000 worth of shares.
Tim Lodge As announced on 24 June 2014, and to enable an orderly transition of responsibilities, Tim Lodge stepped down as Chief Financial Officer on 31 August 2014 and ceased employment with the Group on 31 December 2014.
Arrangements relating to his departure were disclosed at the time and are set out on page 75.
Base salary Executive directors salaries are reviewed annually, with effect from 1 April.
At the 2015 review, the Committee agreed executive director salaries for the year ahead, taking current market positioning into account.

Annual bonus The bonus structure described here applied during the year ended 31 March 2015 and will be retained for the year ending 31 March 2016 with a change to the cash metric, as described below.
The bonus focused performance on three objectives: profitability: sales performance: and cash conversion.
Before any bonus is payable, a minimum level of profit has to be achieved by the Company, regardless of performance against other metrics.
For each performance metric, there is a corresponding multiplier, which varies between threshold, target and stretch levels of performance.
Once the minimum profit threshold is achieved, bonuses are calculated by applying the multipliers which have the effect of increasing or decreasing the value of the bonus depending on performance against each metric in turn.
To achieve the maximum payout, performance against all three metrics must be at or above the stretch level.
Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Target bonus % of base salary Profitability multiplier Sales performance Cash conversion Bonus achieved Chief Executive 75% X once minimum X X multiplier multiplier as % of base salary Chief Financial Officer threshold is achieved 50% Profit performance is the most important of the three metrics, so multipliers for the profitability factor are more heavily geared than for the other two metrics, that is, improvements in profitability have the greatest impact on bonus payments.
All multipliers and their weightings are agreed by the Committee when targets are set at the start of the year, reflecting the importance of each of the metrics in the context of the progress made against the Companys long-term business strategy.
72 | Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION Annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2015 audited The table below provides further information on each metric.
The Board considers that bonus targets are commercially sensitive because they may reveal information about the business plan in the year ahead that may damage our competitive advantage, and accordingly does not disclose these on a prospective basis.
However, we continue our practice of reporting the level of performance required to achieve maximum bonus for the year just ended relative to the prior years performance, and the level of performance actually achieved against those targets.
Bonus objective Profitability Sales performance Cash management Metric PBTEA Net sales less cost of raw materials Cash conversion cycle Definition Adjusted profit before tax, Gross sales net of associated selling The number of days between cash exceptional items, amortisation and costs, less the costs of raw expenditure and collection, taking net retirement benefit interest materials used in production account of inventory, payables and receivables: based on the average of the four quarter-end results Rationale Measures the underlying profit Measures whether management is Measures whether the business is generated by the business and growing the business: by assessing managing its working capital and whether management is converting growth after deducting the cost of converting profit into cash effectively growth into profit effectively raw materials, this metric better reflects the value added by the business Performance 2.3% increase vs prior year 5.5% increase vs prior year 1.8% improvement vs prior year required for maximum bonus Actual performance 28% reduction vs prior year 5.9% increase vs prior year 17.5% lengthening vs prior year Bonus outcome Below threshold Above stretch Below threshold Comments on actual Performance in both divisions was Lower reported sales largely driven Our average quarterly cash performance adversely impacted by supply chain by supply chain disruption and conversion cycle worsened by eight disruption.

Bulk Ingredients deployment of our upgraded IS IT operating profit was lower by 23% system in North America as a result of the supply chain issues and the impact of price volatility in commodity markets Performance is measured on the basis of constant exchange rates for the Groups continuing operations.
The Committee reviews and approves the performance outcomes, considers the Groups safety performance, and then may make adjustments on an exceptional basis to ensure that the results are a true reflection of the underlying strength and performance of the Company.
On the basis of these performance outcomes, no annual bonus 0% of base salary was awarded by the Committee to either the Chief Executive or the Chief Financial Officer for the year ended 31 March 2015.
Arrangements for the coming year As described above, this framework is retained for the year ahead, with a change to the cash metric.
Having considered the effectiveness of the cash conversion cycle metric over the past few years, the Committee has agreed that targets for the year ahead will be set against Adjusted Group Operating Cash Flow.
The Committee believes this simpler metric will have greater impact on promoting effective overall cash management in the business, and is more closely aligned with shareholders interests.
Deferral and malus claw back provisions Any bonus amount up to 100% of base salary is paid in cash.
Any excess above 100% of base salary is paid in the form of deferred shares.
The shares are released after two years subject to the executive director remaining in service with the Company, and carry the right to receive a payment in lieu of dividend between award and release.
Both the cash and share elements are subject to malus and claw back provisions for a period of 24 months following award, which mean that they may be recouped in whole or in part, at the discretion of the Committee, in the exceptional event that results were found to have been misstated or if an executive director commits an act of gross misconduct.
Long-term incentive Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan PSP was reviewed in 2010 to provide a long-term incentive that is consistent with the business strategy.
We consulted with shareholders in detail at that time and again when we renewed the PSP on the same key terms in 2012.
The PSP closely aligns executive directors and senior executives interests with the strategy and with the interests of shareholders over the long term, and is therefore an important component of the overall package.
At the 2012 AGM, 98% of shareholder votes cast supported the resolution to approve the PSP.
Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 73 GOVERNANCE Directors Remuneration Report continued Maximum award level Since the 2010 AGM, awards to executive directors and other senior executives have been granted at the discretion of the Committee, with flexibility for the Committee to make awards of up to 300% of base salary where necessary to ensure market competitiveness, while taking into account Company performance.
Performance conditions The release of awards depends on the Groups performance during the three-year performance period beginning on 1 April in the year of the award.
For awards made since 2010, the performance conditions comprised two elements, explained in the table below, consistent with the principles established following the review and consultation with shareholders at that time.
Metric Adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS Adjusted return on capital employed ROCE Definition Performance is measured by comparing the compound Performance is measured by the adjusted ROCE annual growth rate CAGR of the Companys adjusted on continuing operations achieved at the end of the diluted EPS from continuing operations over the three-year performance period against the pre- 1 performance period against pre-determined targets determined targets Weighting 50% of the award depends on this metric 50% of the award depends on this metric Rationale The Committee selected this metric as it is a key The Committee selected this metric as it is a good determinant of shareholder value creation indicator of the effectiveness of strategic investment decisions and of the quality of earnings generated EPS performance Vesting outcome ROCE performance Vesting outcome Vesting CAGR % of maximum % of maximum schedule 2012, 2013, 2014 Below 6% Nil Below 13.4% Nil awards 6% 15% 13.4% 15% Between 6% and 15% On a straight line Between 13.4% and 16.4% On a straight line between between 15% and 100% 15% and 100% At or above 15% 100% At or above 16.4% 100% 1 The ROCE outcome may be adjusted downward in the event of an asset impairment adding this back into capital employed : this is to encourage a prudent investment strategy.
For this reason, in the event of there being an impairment of assets during the performance period, the ROCE figure for PSP purposes can be significantly lower than the unadjusted ROCE number reported in the Companys accounts.
In relation to the closure of Singapore, no adjustments have been made to the reported ROCE on the basis that the impairment is a non-cash item and the underlying investment has delivered strong cash returns to the business over the full life-cycle.
The Committee reviews the appropriateness of metrics and targets ahead of the grant of awards in any year to ensure these remain sufficiently stretching.
In practice, no changes to the performance targets have been made since they were established in 2010, and accordingly shares awarded under the PSP in 2012, 2013 and 2014 may vest in accordance with the schedule set out in the table above.
Before any shares are released, the Committee must also be satisfied that the level of vesting determined by performance against these targets is justified by the broader underlying financial performance of the Company.
2015 awards As noted in the Chairmans introduction, our review of current arrangements indicated that incentive awards require careful calibration of targets against the business strategy and outlook, to ensure their continued effectiveness.
On 21 April 2015, we announced a restructuring of our European and SPLENDA Sucralose businesses to establish a more focused company from which to accelerate the delivery of our strategy.
These actions improve our strategic positioning and are expected to improve our long-term outlook and ability to maximise returns in a competitive market.
However, the structural and mid-term financial considerations will also impact the appropriateness of the performance conditions attached to future incentive awards.
We therefore expect to review the PSP conditions that will apply for awards made in 2015, in keeping with our approved remuneration policy, and to consult with shareholders, as appropriate, later in the year.
2012 PSP awards vesting by reference to the period ended 31 March 2015 audited PSP awards made in 2012 were dependent on EPS growth and ROCE targets as described above, with each condition applicable to half of the award.
Performance against these conditions and the vesting outcome is indicated in the table below.
Performance Weighting Performance Vesting outcome Combined vesting outcome condition outcome for this element EPS growth Based on the combination of EPS and ROCE 50% 12.3% reduction nil performance, the Committee has confirmed ROCE 50% 13.9% Above threshold that 14.7% of the PSP awards made in 2012 are capable of vesting.
However, the Chief Executive has informed the Committee that, having taken into account financial performance in the round, he has waived his entitlement to the award.
In confirming any vesting outcome, the Committee also considers the broader underlying financial performance of Tate & Lyle over the performance period, to ensure that vesting results based on these performance outcomes are consistent with a broader view of the financial health and performance of the business.
74 | Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION Malus and claw back provisions Awards made under the PSP from 1 April 2013 are subject to malus and claw back provisions for a period following the vesting date and extending to the fifth anniversary following the date of grant.
During this period, the Committee may determine that an award will lapse wholly or in part or may require that a participant shall repay up to 100% of the value of any award that has vested by virtue of performance, in the event of circumstances including the following: material misstatement of financial results: misconduct which justifies, or could justify, summary dismissal of the participant: or if information has emerged which would have affected the value of the original award that was granted to a participant, or the level at which the performance conditions were judged to have been satisfied.

Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 77 GOVERNANCE Directors Remuneration Report continued Statement of directors shareholding and share interests audited Personal share ownership requirements policy on executive share ownership The Committee and executive management believe that personal investment in Company shares is an important part of our overall remuneration framework.
Material personal investment in Company shares serves to strengthen the long-term alignment of interests between senior executives and shareholders.
Our executive shareholding requirements are more demanding and extend to a greater number of senior executives in the Group when compared with similar UK-listed companies.
The Chief Executive has a target share ownership requirement of four times base salary, and his shareholding currently exceeds this target.
The Chief Financial Officer has a target shareholding of three times base salary, to be achieved within five years of appointment.
In this capacity, Tim Lodges shareholding exceeded this target.
Nick Hampton joined Tate & Lyle in September 2014, and therefore has until September 2019 to meet this target.
Other Executive Committee members are subject to the share ownership policy, with target holdings at three times salary.
This policy extends to a broader group of executives who have senior leadership roles within the Company.
The shareholding targets for this group is equal to their base salary.
The Committee monitors progress against the share ownership requirements annually.
