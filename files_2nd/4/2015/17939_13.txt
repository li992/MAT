Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT I am pleased to present the Report of the Remuneration Committee for 2015, which sets out the remuneration paid to the Directors in the financial year ended 27 March 2015 and the policy for the forthcoming year.
This is my second report under the new regulations for the reporting of directors remuneration.
The Committees approach to remuneration is that it should be kept as simple and comprehensible as possible.
As such, our Remuneration Policy remains unchanged from last year.
The remuneration policies of the Company are intended to ensure: Incentives for Executive Directors and executives should be closely linked to performance, thus aligning the interests of Executive Directors, executives and shareholders: Executive Directors rewards should be correlated with those received by other employees of the business: and Executive Directors are not rewarded for failure.
The Committee is of the view that we have a structure of reasonable base pay, bonuses and long term incentives which are aligned to growing long term shareholder value.
We are satisfied that the outcomes to date have reflected business performance and that the targets set are stretching in the context of the market in which we operate and, if delivered, will have added significant value for shareholders.
Moreover, we believe that the remuneration policy and incentive framework in place is working well to support the Companys strategy and is helping to retain, recruit and motivate our management team.
In the context of our future performance goals the Committee will continue to keep under review the targets attached to PSP awards to be granted in 2015.
We look forward to hearing your views in the future and hope to receive your continued support at this years AGM.
This Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 20 May 2015.
Karen Jones Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 34 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Governance Governance Role of the Committee The Remuneration Committee has defined Terms of Reference which were reviewed in November 2013 and can be found in the Investor Relations Investor Centre Legal Documents section of the Groups website.
A copy may be obtained from the Company Secretary.
The Remuneration Committee advises the Board and makes recommendations: on the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and executives including remuneration, share incentives and other benefits: on the terms of service contracts with Executive Directors and executives and any compensation arrangements resulting from the termination of an Executive Director or executives service contract: and concerning the grant and vesting of awards under the PSP.
Membership The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Karen Jones and also comprises Lord Bilimoria and Andrew Cripps, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors.
Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors biographies on pages 18 and 19.
Their remuneration is set out later in this Report.
The quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two, each of whom must be a Non-Executive Director.

The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.

The Committees overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages.
The Company wishes to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and executives of the requisite quality.
Accordingly, the Committees policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward Executive Directors and executives fairly for their contribution.
The Committee will take into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when determining Executive Directors remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases.
Directors Remuneration Policy The policy for Executive Directors remuneration, set out below, took effect from the date of the 2014 AGM, and is available to view in the Investor Relations Investor Centre Legal Documents section of the Groups website.
The Committee considers the remuneration policy annually to ensure that it continues to underpin the Groups strategy.
It is, however, intended that the policy set out below will apply for three years from the 2014 AGM.

38 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Governance Notes to Future Policy Table Bonus The Earnings before interest and tax EBIT bonus scheme, which is consistent with the FY14 bonus scheme, covers Executive Directors, executives, branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 1,700 colleagues of the Group.
The aggregate bonus pool is determined each year by the level of improvement in Group EBIT year on year and no bonus is paid unless there is an improvement.
The maximum bonus achievable for an Executive Director is 100% of basic salary.
Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, does not participate in this bonus scheme.
The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arise from his significant shareholding in the Company.
Payments to Executive Directors are based upon a percentage of basic salary and do not form part of pensionable earnings.
The proportion of the bonus pool accruing to Executive Directors is less than 15%.
PSP The PSP scheme allows Executive Directors and approximately 1,000 employees to receive share awards, subject to the achievement of performance targets set by the Committee, measured over a three year period.
Awards are made annually and, other than in exceptional circumstances, will not be more than 150% of annual salary for Executive Directors.
For the 2011 14 PSP cycle, the performance measures were share price based.
Details of structure and outcome are set out on page 48.
For the 2012 15, 2013 16 and 2014 17 PSP cycle, the Committee resolved to grant maximum awards at 150% of base salary for the Executive Directors.
Vesting for points between Threshold and Maximum is calculated on a straight line basis, as follows: 50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting at 8% growth per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting for 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 years from the award date.
50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving Absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as measured between March 2012 and March 2015, March 2013 and March 2016 and March 2014 and March 2017.
In setting the TSR performance target, the Committee has taken into account the TSR returns achieved by companies in the FTSE350 commencing with the three year period to May 2002 and then walking forward on a weekly basis with the last data point being the returns of each company through to July 2012.
There is no re-testing of performance targets under the PSP, and awards lapse if they are not met.
The Committee will review the performance measures for the 2015 18 cycle for the Executive Directors excluding Charles Wilson, in the context of our future performance goals.
39 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Fixed and Variable Pay Mix Individual reward elements for all Executive Directors excluding Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, who does not participate in any incentive schemes are designed to provide a balance between fixed remuneration and variable at risk reward, linked to the performance of the Company.
Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen from the outset not to participate in the bonus scheme and does not participate in the PSP.
The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arises from his significant shareholding in the Company.
Illustrative scenarios Below is an illustration of the value that could be received by each Executive Director under the Directors Remuneration Policy in respect of 2015 16, showing: minimum, which comprises base salary, benefits and employer pension contributions only equivalent to 15% of base salary total fixed pay : on-target, which includes total fixed pay and assumes an on-target award for the Bonus 50% of salary and 50% of maximum PSP vesting: and maximum, which includes total fixed pay and a maximum award under the Bonus 100% of salary and 100% of maximum PSP vesting.
The salaries included are those that will apply from 1 April 2015.
The benefit values included are estimates.
The amounts shown in relation to Bonus and PSP do not take account of any share price appreciation or depreciation and the PSP vesting is calculated using a share price of 147.70p being the closing share price on 27 March 2015.

This feature helps ensure alignment between executive rewards and shareholder returns.
Other Uses of Discretion The Committee will operate the Companys incentive plans according to their respective rules, the policy set out in the table above and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
The Committee retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the incentive plans.
These include, but are not limited to, determining who participates in the incentive plans, the time and size of awards, measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction and the adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends.
The discretions that can be applied in the case of leavers under the Bonus and PSP are set out in the section on Policy on Payment for Loss of Office on page 42.
Any exercises of discretion by the Committee will be fully disclosed and explained in the relevant years Remuneration Report.
The Committee will also use its judgement as to what is appropriate within the terms of the Directors Remuneration Policy, to make decisions that do not involve the exercise of discretion.
Approach to Recruitment Remuneration The remuneration of any new Executive Director will be determined in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Policy and the elements that would be considered by the Company for inclusion are: salary and benefits, including defined contribution pension participation and relocation costs, where appropriate: participation in the Bonus: pro-rated for the year of recruitment to reflect the proportion of the year remaining after the date of commencement of employment.
participation in the PSP: awards would be granted on the same terms and subject to the same performance conditions as those which apply to PSP awards granted to existing Executive Directors in the year of recruitment.
The maximum annual level of variable remuneration that may be granted to a newly recruited Executive Director excluding any awards to compensate for incentives forgone on recruitment would be in line with that of the existing Executive Directors: Bonus award: maximum 100% of salary: and PSP award: maximum 400% of salary for a full PSP cycle commencing after appointment, plus pro-rated awards in relation to PSP cycles outstanding at the time of recruitment up to a further 150% of salary.
In addition, the Committee may, in its discretion, compensate a newly recruited Executive Director for incentives forgone from a previous employment as a result of their resignation.
The Committee would seek validation of the value of any potential incentives forgone.
Awards made by way of compensation for incentives forgone would be made on a comparable basis, taking account of performance achieved or likely to be achieved, the proportion of the performance period remaining and the form of the award.
Compensation would, as far as possible, be in the form of awards under the PSP in order to immediately align a new Executive Director with Company performance.
41 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Policy on Payment for Loss of Office Contractual Notice Period and Pay in Lieu All current Executive Directors have a rolling service contract with a notice period from the company of 12 months.
As an alternative, the Company may, at its discretion, pay in lieu of that notice.
Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
Payment in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months pension contributions, and other contractual benefits.
Where possible, the Company will seek to ensure that where a leaver mitigates their losses by, for example, finding new employment, there will be a corresponding reduction in compensation payable for loss of office.
The Companys approach to the termination of contracts of service of Executive Directors is dictated by the relevant events, bearing in mind the circumstances of termination and the interests of the Company.
A bonus element is not normally included in the termination payment, however, if the Company enforces the non-compete clause, up to 12 months on target bonus will be payable.
An Executive Director may have an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under relevant employment legislation in the UK.
Under Charles Wilsons contract, in the event of a change of control of the Company, Charles Wilson has the right to terminate his employment on 30 days notice and to receive a payment equal to his gross salary for his contractual notice period.
Termination by Mutual Agreement In certain circumstances it can be in the best interests of the Company for the Board to proactively manage succession planning and the development of the senior talent pipeline.
In such circumstances, the Board may agree that an executives departure will be by mutual agreement.
In order for this to apply, the Committee will need to be satisfied that the executive has demonstrated performance in line with expectations and where required they should have contributed to an orderly succession.
The Companys experience is that this approach is successful and has previously enabled the Company to recruit a former Executive Director to lead Makro on an interim basis immediately after its acquisition.
An Executive Director terminated by mutual agreement will be treated as a good leaver for the purposes of the Bonus and PSP plans.
If the termination date falls during the financial year, they will be eligible to be paid a pro-rated on target bonus and if they are employed at the end of the financial year, the bonus payable would be based on actual results.
Other than as set out above, the Committee does not anticipate using the discretion provided by the Bonus and PSP plan rules in respect of termination payments.
There may, however, be unforeseen circumstances where this is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Where such discretion is exercised, explanations will be provided in the next Remuneration Report and will comply with the Companys overall remuneration policy aim that Directors should not be rewarded for failure.

1 Committee has discretion to pro-rate to a later date see below.
2 Committee has discretion to determine otherwise see below.
3 Committee has discretion to accelerate vesting see below.
The Committee would only exercise the discretions available in the Bonus and PSP plan rules relating to: whether an award is made or an unvested award forfeited: and the extent and timing of any such award or forfeiture in exceptional circumstances, for example permanent disablement.
Notice periods would not usually be included when calculating the pro-rata amount of Bonus and PSP awards that vest.
The Committee would only exercise its discretion to include some or all of the notice period in such calculation in exceptional circumstances, such as ill health, and would not do so in circumstances of poor performance.
The Committee has the discretion to determine that an individual should be treated as a Good Leaver for the purposes of the PSP.
In exercising such discretion the Committee will consider factors such as personal performance and conduct, overall Group performance and the specific circumstances of the Executive Directors departure including, but not restricted to, whether the Executive Director is leaving by mutual agreement with the Company.
If an individual is not a Good Leaver then they will be treated as an Other Leaver, as set out above.
Committee Interaction with Stakeholders The Committee engages with shareholders on remuneration matters.
Discussions were held with a number of shareholders and with shareholder representative organisations over the year.
43 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Legacy Arrangements The Committee reserves the right to honour any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of those payments were i entered into with current or former directors before this policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant executive was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes payments of variable remuneration under the Bonus scheme and the PSP in line with the terms of the payment agreed at the time the award was granted.
The Committee may make minor changes to this policy, which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid its operation or implementation taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek shareholder approval.
Consideration of Employment Conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group when determining remuneration for its Executive Directors.
Salary increases for Executive Directors will broadly increase in line with the general workforce other than when there is a change in role or responsibility, or a significant variance to the market arises, warranting a larger increase.
Newly promoted or recruited Executive Directors to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the benchmark policy level while they become established in role.
In such cases, salary increases may be higher than the general workforce until the target positioning is achieved.
Group employees salaries are compared to cross-industry standards to ensure fair pay for that job.
The Company does not directly consult with employees as part of the process of determining Directors remuneration.
While formal comparison measurements were not used in determining Executive Director remuneration, the Committee made decisions in the knowledge of incentive arrangements of the rest of the Group, upon which the Committee is briefed regularly.
Remuneration Policy for Other Employees The Companys policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors is consistent with that of other senior employees.
This group of approximately 1,700 people also participates in and receives payments under the EBIT Bonus scheme.
Eligibility to participate in the PSP extends to a similar set of around 1,000 employees in total.
Outside the senior employees group, the composition of remuneration differs.
Of the Groups average 13,000 employees, over 9,000 employees are eligible for a bonus payment based on customer satisfaction.
Customer satisfaction is measured independently by calling 10,000 customers selected at random covering retailers, caterers, delivered and collect across our 202 branches each quarter to ask them to rate key areas of service.
Around 1,300 logistics employees are eligible for a quarterly bonus payment based on achieving productivity and efficiency targets at the site at which they are employed.
In addition from time to time certain incentive arrangements may be introduced for executives and colleagues in order to achieve particular objectives.
Eligibility for, and participation in, benefits and incentive plans differs depending on location, seniority, length of service and other factors.
44 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Governance Service Contracts and Notice Periods for Executive Directors The Committees policy is for all Executive Directors to have rolling service contracts with a notice period of 12 months.
All new appointments will have 12 month notice periods, unless, on an exceptional basis to complete an external recruitment successfully, a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months is used.
This is in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
All Executive Directors appointments and subsequent re-appointments are subject to election and annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM.
Details of Current Executive Directors Contracts The table below summarises the service contracts of the Executive Directors.
Copies of the service contracts will be available for inspection at the Companys registered office during business hours and at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.

All Executive Directors will stand for re-election at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.
External Appointments Executive Directors are not permitted to hold directorships or offices of companies whose shares are listed on a recognised stock exchange and, accordingly, no Executive Director serves as a Non-Executive Director of any such company.
45 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors The policy for Non-Executive Directors will apply for three years from the date of the 2014 AGM, and is available to view in the Investor Relations Legal Documents section of the Groups website.

The time commitment for Non-Executive Directors is set out in the relevant Non-Executive Directors letter of appointment.
Non-Executive Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties as Directors of the Company.
Details of Letters of Appointment and Notice Periods for Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years subject to termination on one months notice.
In addition, the UK Corporate Governance Code requires that all Non-Executive Directors stand for re-election annually.
Non-Executive Director appointments are also subject to the Articles of Association of the Company.

46 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Governance Annual Report on Directors Remuneration The Annual Report on Directors Remuneration explains how the Directors Remuneration Policy for 2014 was implemented and the resulting payments to each of the Directors.
The notes to the single figure table provide further detail, including measures and outcomes for 2015 where relevant, for each of the elements that make up the total single figure of remuneration in respect of each of the Executive Directors.
This report is subject to an advisory vote at the 2015 AGM.
Taxable benefits all taxable benefits in kind arising from the individuals employment in 2014 2015.
Bonus the bonus relating to the Companys performance in the year ended 27 March 2015, to be paid in July 2015.
PSP Based on the share price at the date of actual vesting.
Pension Benefits the value of Company contributions to pension plans or any cash allowances paid in lieu of pension contributions.
No consideration was paid to third parties for making available the services of any person as a Director of the Company during the year.
Salary audited information In 2015, the Committee conducted a review of Executive Director salaries in light of approaches made to Executive Directors.
That review confirmed the number of criteria outlined in the Remuneration Policy that must apply in order for a salary increase to be considered had been met, particularly: where there is a change in role or responsibility: where there are major changes within the Group or where a significant variance to the market arises.
As a consequence, the Committee reviewed basic salaries for the Executive Directors.
The Committee revisited the benchmarking undertaken by PwC in April 2012 based on a company with a market capitalisation of 1.5bn i. e. considerably smaller than Bookers current market capitalisation and increased the comparator salaries by 6% to reflect the 2 years that had passed since that benchmarking report.
Based on that benchmarking information, the Committee approved salary increases of circa 10% for each of the Executive Directors excluding Charles Wilson.
Whilst these increases are significant, the Committee considers that the increases are fully necessary to ensure the Company continues to prosper in a challenging trading environment.
47 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Bonus audited information The level of pre-bonus earnings before interest and tax EBIT achieved in 2015 gave rise to the following awards to the Executive Directors: Director EBIT award as % of salary Jonathan Prentis 51.98% Mark Aylwin 51.98% Guy Farrant 51.98% Bryn Satherley 51.98% The EBIT bonus scheme covers approximately 1,600 colleagues, including the Executive Directors other than Charles Wilson.
The scheme has been in operation since 2007 albeit that up to 2012 it was based on increases in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and is targeted on increasing the Group EBIT year on year.
The Group EBIT increase of 19.9m to 140.3m resulted in a bonus being awarded to Executive Directors of 51.98% of salary.
The maximum bonus payable under the scheme to Executive Directors was 100% of salary, had the Group EBIT exceeded 187.0m, an uplift on prior year of 60.3m.
If EBIT had not increased year on year no bonus would have been paid.
Bonus is paid on basic salary as at 31 March each year.

Participation As well as the Executive Directors, approximately 1,000 employees have been granted PSP options.
In addition 3,069 employees participate in the 2014 SAYE scheme, 2,888 employees participate in the 2013 SAYE scheme and 1,576 participate in the 2012 SAYE scheme.
The Executive Directors have chosen not to participate in any of the current SAYE schemes.

Since 2007, when the reverse takeover of Blueheath was completed and the Company became admitted to trading on AIM, the equity value of the Company has increased from approximately 300m to over 2.6bn as at 20 May.
The value of the PSP options awarded has been equivalent to 2% of the value generated.
Statement of Directors Shareholdings audited information Alignment to shareholder interests is a key element of the Groups remuneration policy which maintains commitment over the long term and ensures that the interests of the Executive Directors are aligned with those of shareholders.
The Committee sets shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors.
The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal and or spousal holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least the Executive Directors annual base salary.
All of the Executive Directors currently meet these guidelines.

This is considered the most appropriate index against which to measure performance following the Companys inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index in December 2009.
TSR is defined as the return a shareholder would receive if they held a notional number of shares and received dividends over a period of time.
Assuming dividends are reinvested into the Companys shares, it measures the percentage growth in the Companys share price together with any dividends paid.
The closing mid market price of an Ordinary Share on 27 March 2015 was 147.70p and the price range during the year was 115.00p to 165.00p.
