Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 49 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT: REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMANS ANNUAL STATEMENT Dear Shareholder, On behalf of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to present the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2015.
This report sets out the remuneration policy for the directors of RPC Group Plc and discloses amounts paid to them over the course of the financial year and proposed remuneration for the forthcoming year.
This report complies with the Companies Act 2006, the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts & Reports Amendment Regulations 2013, which came into force on 1 October 2013 and which set out the new reporting requirements in respect of Directors remuneration and the Listing Rules and consists of two parts: The Directors remuneration policy report reproduces in full the directors remuneration policy for the S Rojahn Company effective from the AGM on 16 July 2014.
It was approved by 97.8% of shareholders who cast their votes in a binding resolution at the 2014 AGM: and Chairman of the The Annual report on remuneration provides details of the remuneration earned by directors in the year Remuneration Committee ended 31 March 2015 and how the policy will be implemented for the year ending 31 March 2016 and will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the forthcoming AGM.
Remuneration Outcomes in 2014 15 For the year under review, the Remuneration Committee considered that the policy initially published in the 2013 report and subsequently approved by shareholders in a binding resolution at the 2014 AGM remained fit for purpose and the remuneration of executive directors fairly reflected their individual performance whilst reflecting the challenges the Company has faced in a difficult macro-economic environment in the UK and Eurozone.
Consequently, a 1.0% to 1.3% increase to basic salary was awarded to executive directors with effect from 1 April 2014.
The Committee has carefully considered the effect of the acquisition of Ace Corporation Holdings Ltd in June 2014 and Promens Group AS and PET-Power Holding BV both in February 2015, the dilutive effect of the rights issue in January 2015 used to partly finance the Promens acquisition and the importance of ensuring that variable remuneration fairly reflect the achievements of the executive directors and the Companys underlying performance and does not discourage the directors from making acquisitions that are beneficial to shareholders.
Despite the continued difficult trading conditions, good progress was made during the year in the implementation of the three core elements of the Companys Vision 2020: Focused Growth strategy.
The performance against the stretching adjusted PBIT profit before interest and tax annual bonus target excluding acquisitions made during the year resulted in a bonus of 95% of the maximum being payable to the executive directors for the year ended 31 March 2015 and the health and safety, free cash flow and ROCE before taking account of the acquisitions during the year moderators were also achieved.
The 2012 Performance Share Plan PSP award which vests in July 2015, based on performance over the three year period up to and including 31 March 2015, will vest at 73% in respect of the EPS performance targets including the acquisition of Ace but excluding the Promens acquisition and associated rights issue and the acquisition of PET Power being partially achieved.
Remuneration Policy for 2015 16 The key elements of the current Directors remuneration policy have been in operation since April 2013.
Over the past two years the Groups size and complexity has increased substantially from 1bn sales and 7,000 employees to 1.7bn annualised sales and 15,000 employees.
Over the same period the Companys market capitalisation has increased from circa.
Despite the expanded size, scope and responsibility of the executive directors roles, the Remuneration Committee has decided that before any adjustment is made to remuneration policy and or packages, the benefits realised and successful integration ofthe recent acquisitions should be assessed over an appropriate period of time.
Consequently the Committee plans to review the Directors remuneration policy in 2016.
In addition to the substantial changes to the size, global spread and complexity of the Group and the responsibilities of the executive directors, the proposed review of the Directors remuneration policy in 2016 will also take into consideration developments in UK corporate governance and best practice since the current policy was formulated.
Major investors and representative bodies will be consulted in respect of the conclusions reached by the Committee and any changes to the policy will be the subject of a binding shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM.
In the meantime the current remuneration policy will continue to apply for 2015 16 and the key points to note are as follows: Executive director base salary increases were 3.2% with effect from 1 April 2015: The maximum bonus opportunity for 2015 16 will remain at 100% of salary for the executive directors and the structure taking into account the full year equivalent results of the acquisitions made during 2014 15 will be broadly similar to those operated in the previous year: and PSP awards to be granted in 2015 will continue to be based on stretching EPS and relative TSR total shareholder return targets.
I hope that you support the Committees intention to defer the review of the remuneration policy until next year once we have greater visibility on the acquisitions and developments in governance best practice and that you will support the resolution to approve the Directors remuneration report at this years AGM in respect of how the remuneration policy has been operated in the year ended 31 March 2015 and how it will be operated over the next 12 months.
Finally, after nine years as an independent non-executive director, in accordance with good corporate governance, I will retire from the Board with effect from the end of the AGM to be held on 15 July 2015 and hand over the chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee to L Drummond.
It has been an exciting nine years with RPC Group and I thank the Board for excellent working relations and open discussions and constructive decision-making processes.
I wish the Group a successful future.
Yours sincerely, S Rojahn Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 10 June 2015 50 RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT: DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY Policy Overview In accordance with best practice and to assist the reader, the Directors remuneration policy has been reproduced in full in this years report.
This policy, was approved by shareholders and became formally effective from the Annual General Meeting held on 16 July 2014 and applies for three years unless shareholder approval is obtained to make any changes proposed as a result of the review of the policy to be undertaken in 2016 as described in the Remuneration Committee Chairmans annual statement on page 49.
The objective of our remuneration policy is to attract, retain and incentivise a high calibre of senior management who can direct the business and deliver the Groups core objective of growth in shareholder value by building a business that is capable of delivering long-term, sustainable and growing cash flows.
To achieve this objective, executive directors and senior management receive remuneration packages with elements of fixed and variable pay.
Fixed pay elements basic salary, pension arrangements and other benefits are set at a level to recognise the experience, contribution and responsibilities of the individuals and to take into consideration the level of remuneration available from a range of the Groups broader competitors.
Variable pay elements annual bonus and Performance Share Plan PSP awards are set at a level to incentivise executive directors and senior management to deliver outstanding performance in line with the Groups strategic objectives.
Consideration of Shareholders Views A consultation exercise was held with major shareholders and representative bodies in 2013 in respect of proposed changes to executive remuneration and their views were incorporated when designing the current remuneration policy.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to engage pro-actively with shareholders and ensure that shareholders are consulted in advance and their views considered, where any material changes to the remuneration policy are proposed.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 51 Consideration of Employment Conditions Elsewhere in the Group In determining the remuneration of the Groups directors, the Committee takes in to account the pay arrangements and terms and conditions across the Group as a whole.
Whilst employees were not directly consulted, the Committee seeks to ensure that the underlying principles which form the basis for decisions on directors pay are consistent with those on which pay decisions for the rest of the workforce are taken.
There are some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for the executive directors and other senior employees, which the Remuneration Committee believes are necessary to reflect the different levels of responsibility of employees across the Company.
The key differences in remuneration policy between the executive directors and employees across the Group are the increased emphasis on performance related pay and the inclusion of a share-based PSP for executive directors.
The PSP is not granted to employees outside of the most senior executives as they are reserved for those anticipated as having the greatest potential to influence Group level performance.
Key Elements of the Remuneration Policy for Directors Set out below is a summary of the main elements of the remuneration policy for directors, together with further information on how these aspects of remuneration operate.
52 RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT: DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED Notes: The Committee has given careful consideration to the performance measures applicable to both the annual bonus and the PSP.
The annual bonus measure is primarily based on growth in adjusted PBIT profit before interest and tax which the Committee believes appropriately rewards directors for growing the business whilst maintaining a suitable profit margin.
As a result of the Committees desire to further align management performance with the Companys key objectives, bonus moderators may operate to reduce payouts for failure to achieve targeted levels in certain areas.
The Committee retains discretion over the calculation of adjusted PBIT and the moderators in order to appropriately adjust for any material one-off items including but not limited to : major acquisitions and changes in accounting policies.
PSP performance measures incentivise sustained growth in adjusted EPS and the generation of TSR total shareholder return.
The adjusted EPS measure appropriately captures the impact of managements decisions and actions in areas such as production efficiency, margin improvement and efficient use of financial resources.
TSR is a clear indicator of the relative success of the Group in delivering shareholder value and, as a performance measure, firmly aligns the interests of directors and shareholders.
The EPS target range will be assessed annually and will normally be based on outperformance of a relevant inflation index.
Performance against the adjusted EPS and TSR targets will be independently calculated and reviewed by the Committee.
The Committee retains discretion over the calculation of adjusted EPS in order to appropriately adjust for any material one-off items including but not limited to : major acquisitions, changes in accounting policies and major share issues.
The Committee operates share plans in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC where relevant.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plans.
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors remuneration policy, authority was given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors.
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the Annual report on remuneration as they arise.
Illustration of Application of Remuneration Policy The balance of the potential remuneration package available for executive directors is weighted towards variable pay elements, which have stretching performance targets attached to them.
The chart below shows the value of the executive directors packages under three performance scenarios, minimum, on-target and maximum: Basic Salary, Benets & Pension Annual Bonus PSP Award 2,000 1,750 1,499 1,500 36% 1,134 1,250 1,018 36% 1,000 26% 769 28% 26% 750 21% 537 28% 405 21% 500 100% 53% 36% 100% 53% 36% 250 0 Minimum Target Maximum Minimum Target Maximum P R M Vervaat S J Kesterton Notes: 1 P R M Vervaats remuneration has been converted into using the exchange rate prevailing on 31 March 2015 being 1:1.3749.
2 Salary levels are based on those applying from 1 April 2015.
3 Benefits have been estimated based on the cost of provision in the year-ended 31 March 2015.
4 Pension cost is estimated at 20% of annual basic salary applicable at 1 April 2015.
5 For illustrative purposes and in the interests of simplicity, the target annual bonus and PSP have both been assumed to be 50% of the maximum values see below.
6 The maximum bonus potential is 100% of base salary.
7 The maximum value of the PSP is taken to be 100% of the face value of the award at grant i. e. 125% of salary.
8 No share price appreciation has been assumed for the deferred bonus shares and PSP awards.
Approach to Recruitment and Promotions The remuneration package for a new executive director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Companys prevailing approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
000s Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 53 Salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract the most appropriate candidate and may be set initially at a below mid-market level on the basis that it may progress towards the mid-market level once expertise and performance has been proven and sustained.
The annual bonus potential would be limited to 100% of salary and grants under the PSP would normally be limited to 125% of salary with the capability to grant 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based awards to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer.
The Committee would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal executive director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and or incidental expenses as appropriate.
Service Contracts and Payments for Loss of Office Contractual provisions The Committee determines the terms of the service contract for each executive director and the Companys policy is that service contracts normally continue until the directors agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree which is subject to a maximum of nine months notice by the employer and six months by the director.
The service contracts contain provision for early termination for payments in lieu of salary with the ability to phase payments and mitigate such payments if alternative employment is obtained.
A directors service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.
If the employing company terminates the employment of an executive director in breach of contract, compensation is limited to basic salary due for any unexpired notice period.
Payments in lieu of notice are not pensionable.
The following table shows details of the service contracts for the current executive directors and those who held office during the year ended 31 March 2015: Notice Required from Group Notice Required from Individual Name Commencement Date months months 1 P R M Vervaat 1 May 2013 9 6 2 S J Kesterton 1 April 2013 9 6 1 P R M Vervaat stepped up from Finance Director to Chief Executive Officer on 1 May 2013.

However in certain prescribed circumstances including death, disability, ill-health, injury, redundancy, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee good leaver status may be applied.
For good leavers in respect of the annual bonus, a bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the financial year worked, although it will be pro-rated for time and paid fully in cash at the normal payout date.
Awards held under the deferred bonus plan will vest in full on the date employment is ceased.
Other appointments The Board recognises that executive directors may be offered external non-executive directorship positions, which would broaden their skills and experience.
Executive directors are permitted to accept an external non-executive position subject to the Boards approval, taking into account any potential conflicts ofinterest and expected time commitments.
Any fees earned will normally be retained by the executive director.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors are not employed under service contracts and do not receive compensation for loss of office.
They are appointed for fixed terms of three years renewable for further three year terms if both parties agree and are subject to annual re-election by shareholders.

54 RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT: ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for the Year Ending 31 March 2016 The Remuneration Committee awarded the executive directors the following increase in basic salary effective from 1 April 2015: Basic salary From 1 April 2014 From 1 April 2015 Increase P R M Vervaat 569,640 587,868 3.2% S J Kesterton 314,000 324,048 3.2% The increase excluding promotion and increases in responsibility across the Groups UK employees was up to 1.5% for the 2015 pay review.
Pension Arrangements Recent changes in Dutch legislation have increased the standard retirement age in retirement plans and reduced the maximum amount that can be accrued under the current pension arrangement for P R M Vervaat.
It is anticipated that the review of the pension arrangement for P R M Vervaat with a view to retaining the current plan or replacing it with a defined contribution arrangement will be concluded during the year ending 31 March 2016.
The employers obligation will continue to be capped at a maximum of 20% of salary.
S J Kesterton participates in a defined contribution pension plan in the UK with an employers pension contribution of 9% and a salary supplement of 11% making up the maximum of 20% of salary.
Performance Targets for the 2015 16 Annual Bonus The performance conditions for the annual bonus for the financial year ending 31 March 2016 will continue to be based on the Groups adjusted PBIT with a sliding bonus scale commencing at 0% of salary for a challenging threshold level of performance.
Full bonus payout 100% of salary will result for achieving the stretch level of performance, with 50% of the maximum bonus payable for achieving 60% of the target range between threshold and stretch levels.
As a result of the Committees desire to ensure the long-term financial health of the Company bonuses for the year ending 31 March 2016 will be reduced by the following moderators: 12.5% if the targeted level of free cash flow generation is not achieved: and 12.5% if the targeted ROCE is not achieved.
As the reported accident frequency rate RAFR significantly improved during the year ended 31 March 2015 the Committee has concluded that the target applied for the 2014 15 bonus year has been effective in strengthening the executives focus on health and safety and has decided that the RAFR will not be a moderator for 2015 16.
The Committee deems the performance targets for the upcoming year to be commercially sensitive and has therefore taken the decision to not disclose the targets in advance.
The performance targets and performance against them will be disclosed retrospectively in next years Directors remuneration report when the Committee is comfortable that the information is no longer commercially sensitive.
The maximum bonus potential will continue to be 100% of salary for the executive directors.
Of the bonus payable, 50% will be paid in cash and the remaining 50% is paid as deferred shares which are held for three years subject to continued employment.
An exceptional negative event provision operates and the deferred bonus is subject to claw back provisions.
Performance Targets for PSP Awards to be Granted in 2015 16 The Committee reviewed the performance targets in the year and decided that in view of the continued low level of growth in GDP in mainland Europe, where the majority of the Groups revenue arises, the threshold performance level for the EPS element of the award will continue to be CPI 4%p.
a. with 15% of the award vesting at threshold performance.
The target at the maximum 100% vesting level is unchanged.
The base year EPS will be the published adjusted EPS for the financial year ended 31 March 2015.
Therefore, PSP Awards to be granted in 2015 16 will be subject to the following performance targets: EPS element 2 3rds growth in the Companys adjusted EPS in excess of CPI.
15% of this element of an award will vest for annual adjusted EPS growth of CPI 4% p. a. increasing pro-rata to 50% vesting for annual adjusted EPS growth of CPI 8% p. a. vesting then increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting for annual adjusted EPS growth of CPI 12% p. a.
Relative TSR element 1 3rd the Companys TSR relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
20% of this element of the award will vest if the Company is ranked at the median, increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting for a ranking at upper quintile or better.
The 2015 16 grant level will continue to be 125% of salary for the executive directors.

This was less than the general increase excluding promotions and increases in responsibility across the Groups UK employees of up to 2.0% for the 2014 pay review.
Following the triennial review the directors fees for the Chairman and non-executive directors base fees were increased with effect from 1 April 2014 by 7.1% and 8.1% respectively.
This compares with the increase in CPI inflation over the three years since the previous review of 8.1%.
In addition the fees for the Remuneration and Audit Committee chairmen were increased from 7,000 p. a. to 10,000 p. a. reflecting the Boards view of the significant increase in the responsibilities and time commitment of both roles.
Taxable benefits The taxable benefits for P R M Vervaat include: a company car and fuel provision in the Netherlands, an allowance for medical insurance premiums and fees for preparation of his tax return.
Additionally during the year ended 31 March 2014, P R M Vervaat received an ex-pat allowance of 2,833 per month and was also provided with the following benefits: a UK company car and fuel provision, UK accommodation, the cost of commuting from the Netherlands to the UK and an amount equivalent to the UK income tax payable on these benefits for part of the year.
However, the provision of the ex-pat allowance ceased on 30 April 2013 and the additional benefits all ceased by 31 July 2013.
The taxable benefits for S J Kesterton and R J E Marsh comprised a UK company car and fuel provision or a car allowance alternative and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2015 The annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2015 was based upon the Groups adjusted PBIT operating profit excluding the results for Ace Corporation Holdings Ltd with a sliding bonus scale commencing at 0% of salary for a threshold above the adjusted PBIT of 101.3m for the year ended 31 March 2014 and full pay out 100% of salary for achieving a stretching level of performance.
In addition, 50% of the maximum bonus would be payable for achieving 57% of the target range.
In addition, RAFR, free cash flow and ROCE key performance indicators moderators applied.
Any bonus payable would be reduced by: 9% if the Groups health and safety RAFR for the year 31 December 2014 was not lower than the RAFR of 1,436 for the year ended 31 December 2013: 8% if the Groups free cash flow for the year ended 31 March 2015 was less than 47.9m: and 8% if the Groups ROCE for the year ended 31 March 2015 was less than 18.7%.
The results of the annual bonus for the year under review were: Bonus payable reduction Threshold 50% Maximum Actual Reported Applied % 1 Adjusted operating profit 103.0m 111.0m 117.0m 131.6m 116.4m 95% 2 RAFR 1,436 804 778 0 % 3 Free cash flow 47.9m 50.8m 50.8m 0 % 4 ROCE 18.7% 14.8% 19.5% 0 % Total Bonus Payable % of maximum 95% 1 T he Committee considered the effect of acquisitions during the year and concluded that in addition to the acquisition of Ace Corporation Holdings Ltd all subsequent acquisitions should also be excluded.
The aggregate adjusted operating profit for Ace Corporation Holdings Ltd, PET-Power Holding BV and Promens Group AS was 15.2m resulting in a revised adjusted operating profit of 116.4m.
2 T he Committee decided that for consistency and due to the short period during which the directors had control over the management of the businesses acquired during the 2014 calendar year, performance should be measured against the RAFR excluding acquisitions during the year.
3 F ree cash flow on a consistent basis excluding the combined negative cash flows of 4.0m in respect of the three acquisitions was 54.8m.
4 R OCE before taking account of the acquisitions during the year was 19.5%.
The Committee decided that it would be appropriate to exclude the effect of the acquisitions in order to be consistent with the calculation ofthe revised adjusted operating profit and in order not to penalise the participants and discourage the directors from making acquisitions that were beneficial to the Group in the future.
Of the bonus payable, 50% will be paid in cash and the remaining 50% will be deferred into shares which will not vest for three years with vesting subject to continued employment.
Vesting of Performance Share Plan awards The award of nil cost options made on 18 July 2012 under the RPC Group 2008 Performance Share Plan PSP were subject to a performance condition based on a sliding scale of growth in the adjusted basic EPS in excess of CPI for the three years ended 31 March 2015.
At threshold vesting 25% of the award would vest for an annual adjusted EPS growth of CPI 5% p. a. increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting based on 75% of salary at the award date for annual adjusted EPS growth of CPI 10% p. a.
The performance targets taking into account the actual CPI over the vesting period and the actual performance against those targets wasas follows: Threshold vesting Maximum vesting Reported Applied Vesting Metric EPS EPS EPS EPS % Adjusted basic EPS 44.6p 50.2p 41.0p 48.1p 73.0% 1 T he Remuneration Committee decided that the actual adjusted basic EPS should include the results for Ace Corporation Holdings Ltd given its acquisition early on in the financial year 2 June 2014 but should be revised to exclude the adjusted profit after tax of 1.1m 0.5p attributable to Promens Group AS and PETPower Holding BV acquired during the last two months of the financial year 20 February 2015 and 13 February 2015 respectively and the diluting effect of 7.6p in respect of the rights issue of 62,596,987 shares in the Company on 8 January 2015 to partly fund the acquisition of Promens.
Consequently, the EPS used to determine the outcome of the 2012 PSP award was 48.1p.
The Committee is of the view that this approach adopted is both fair to shareholders and management and the vesting percentage is reflective of Company and management performance over the three year vesting period.

Pension P R M Vervaat has an individual defined benefit pension policy with a Dutch insurance company, .
The plan provides a guaranteed cash balance on retirement and aims to provide a career average pension based on an annual accrual of 1.875% p. a. with effect from 1 January 2015 2.15% p. a. from 1 January 2014 and previously 2.25% p. a. of pensionable salary capped at 100,000 under Dutch legislation with effect from 1 January 2015 and a spouses pension of 70% of his pension on death.
In addition to the reduction in the accrual rate permitted and cap on pensionable salary under Dutch legislation, the retirement age under the plan increased from 65 to 67 years with effect from 1 January 2014.
Up to 30 April 2013, the employer contributions were capped at 60,000 p. a.
Following his appointment as Chief Executive on 1 May 2013, the maximum total payable by the employer is 20% of basic salary.
This may be in the form of a pension contribution or a salary supplement or a combination of the two.
Up to 30 April 2013 PRMVervaat contributed 8.7% of basic salary, thereafter, his contributions are nil.
Although it is a defined benefit plan, the employers obligation for the provision of pension benefits is fixed at 20% of salary and previously capped at 60,000 p. a.. Consequently, RPC is no longer expected to be exposed to any material actuarial risks in relation to the accrued benefits in this plan.
Therefore, the pension arrangement is being treated as a defined contribution plan for accounting and disclosure purposes.
S J Kesterton is entitled to receive a Group pension contribution of 20% of basic salary, paid either as a non-pensionable salary supplement or delivered partly through the Groups defined contribution arrangement capped at 15% of basic salary, subject to a 5% of basic salary employee contribution and partly through a salary supplement 5% of basic salary.
For the year ended 31 March 2015, the employer pension contribution was 9% of basic salary 28,260: 2014: 27,900 and the 11% salary supplement paid was 34,540 2014: 34,100.
In addition, S J Kesterton has elected to participate in the employers pension salary exchange arrangement whereby salary is reduced in exchange for the employer paying additional contributions of 3% 9,420: 2014: 9,300.
Life assurance of four times basic salary is also provided for P R M Vervaat and S J Kesterton.
The Company does not contribute to any pension arrangements for non-executive directors.
Other Income During the year under review, P R M Vervaat received fees of 4,208 for the period from 1 March 2015 in respect of his appointment as a non-executive director ofAvon Rubber plc.
Payments to Former Directors R J E Marsh retired from the Board on 10 July 2013 and retired from the Company on 30 September 2013.
Consequently, there was no compensation for loss of office.
The remuneration received by R J E Marsh whilst a member of the Board is reported in the directors remuneration table on page 55.
R J E Marsh received additional remuneration in the year ended 31 March 2014 as an employee from 10 July 2013 to 30 September 2013 equating to 64,000 of salary, 20,000 of pension and benefits and 64,000 of annual bonus.
In addition, the 2011 PSP award completed its performance period on 31 March 2014 and vested at 49.0% on 1 August 2014.
The 2012 PSP award completed its performance period on 31 March 2015 and 73% is expected to vest on 18 July 2015.
The amount of shares vesting has been pro-rated to reflect the portion of the performance period completed between the grant date and the date of retirement from the Company.
The value of the shares expected to vest on 18 July 2015 is 101,000 using the three month average share price to 31 March 2015 of 5.62 per share.

This index has been chosen as it is a broad market index of which RPC is a constituent and is therefore considered to be the most relevant yardstick against which the Companys total shareholder return performance may be measured over the six years ended 31 March 2015.

% Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 61 The table below shows the single total remuneration for the Chief Executive for the last six years, together with the proportion of the maximum annual bonus paid and vesting of the relevant long-term incentive plan.
The remuneration shown represents amounts received for performing the role of Chief Executive.
The amounts includes 11 month of salary, benefits and pension contributions: and also 11 12ths of the bonus received to reflect the amount of bonus received in respect of performing the role of Chief Executive for 11 months.
The full amount of the PSP is included as this represents remuneration received for performance over a 3 year period.
The amounts includes 1 month of salary, benefits and pension contributions: and also 1 6th of the bonus received for employment to 30 September 2013 to reflect the amount of bonus received in respect of performing the role of Chief Executive for 1 month.
No amount is shown in respect of the PSP as this vested following retirement from the Company.
Prior to adopting the RPC Group Annual Bonus Plan for the year ended 31 March 2012 there was no bonus arrangement.
The first awards under the RPC Group 2008 Performance Share Plan vested in respect of the year ended 31 March 2011.
Prior to this options were granted under the RPC Group 2003 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes.
Although the options that vested in respect of the performance period ended 31 March 2010 vested in full, the market value of the options on the vesting date was less than the exercise price payable.
Percentage change in Chief Executives remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in the salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus from the year ended 31 March 2014 to the year ended 31 March 2015 compared with the average equivalent amount per employee for all UK participants in the Groups Annual Bonus Plan.
This group of UK employees was considered a more appropriate comparator group given that the three elements required for comparison are present and that the Chief Executives remuneration is based on UK remuneration practices.
Chief Executive UK employee comparator group 1 % change % change Salary 4.0% 5.5% Taxable benefits 36.5 % 2.6 % Annual bonus 1.2 % 5.1% 1 T he Chief Executive, P R M Vervaat, is paid in euros.
The percentage change in the Chief Executives remuneration has been calculated based on the remuneration denominated in euros to eliminate the effect of exchange rate movements.
The change in the Chief Executives remuneration includes one months remuneration of R J E Marsh who was Chief Executive prior to 1 May 2013 in the comparative year.
For historical reasons, the former Chief Executives remuneration was not in line with Chief Executives of other companies of similar size and complexity.
The reduction in the Chief Executives taxable benefits is due to an ex-pat allowance and UK benefits which ceased by 31 July 2013.
There have been a number of promotions and increases in responsibilities within the more senior management throughout the Group including the UK which has resulted in the above inflation increase in the remuneration of the comparator group.
Relative importance of spend on pay The following table shows the Groups actual expenditure on pay for all its employees relative to other financial indicators: 2015 2014 Change m m % Staff costs 289.5 239.3 21.0 Dividends 37.1 28.1 32.0 Revenue 1,222.4 1,046.9 16.8 Operating profit 83.2 72.9 14.1 Capital investment including acquisitions 547.7 179.6 368.1 Staff costs include salaries, fees, bonus and employer pension and social security contributions for directors.
This is different from the remuneration given in the remuneration tables above.
The increase is due to the addition of staff costs for acquired businesses and employment costs associated with restructuring.
Dividends comprise the interim paid and final proposed dividend payable for the relevant financial year and have increased significantly due to the rights issue, placing and other shares issued during the year.
Capital investment includes the acquisitions of Ace Corporation Holdings Ltd, PET-Power Holding BV and Promens Group AS.
