The maximum employee purchase is governed by HMRC limits.
The Group provides two matching shares for every share purchased on the first 10 of each employees monthly investment.

Following the end of each financial year, the Committee determines the annual bonus for each executive director for the year just ended.
This is based on each directors performance in achieving the set objectives.
The objectives comprise both financial objectives for the Group and individual business related objectives for each director.
For each executive director, the Group financial objectives for the year ended 30 April 2015 were to meet financial targets with respect to measures of profit before interest and taxation, earnings per share, and net debt.
For the year ended 30 April 2015, Martin Griffiths and Ross Paterson each had a maximum potential bonus of up to 100% of basic salary, with 70% allocated over a range of financial objectives and 30% for meeting individual business related objectives.

5 EPP and LTIP awards during the financial year audited Tables 7 and 8 set out the awards to the Executive Directors under the Companys share schemes during the year ended 30 April 2015.

The maximum and expected values shown above ignore non-market vesting conditions and do not include any assumed share price appreciation or dividends paid.
The actual number of Incentive Units if any which vest will depend on the performance conditions being achieved.

The maximum and total expected values ignore non-market vesting conditions and do not include any assumed share price appreciation or dividends paid.
There are no specific performance conditions attaching to the release of these Deferred Shares because the annual bonus is already subject to performance conditions.
6 Payments to past directors audited There have been no payments in excess of the fide minimis threshold to former directors during the year ended 30 April 2015 2014: Nil in respect of their former roles as directors.
The Company has set a fide minimis threshold of 10,000 under which it would not report such payments.
7 Payments for loss of office audited There have been no payments for loss of office to directors during the year ended 30 April 2015 2014: Nil.

8 Statement of directors shareholdings and share interests audited The Executive Directors and certain other senior executives are expected to accumulate significant shareholdings in the Company.
In the case of the Executive Directors, they are each expected to accumulate an effective interest in shares in the Group with a value of at least 200% of basic salary.
A target of 100% was first introduced in 2005 and was amended to 200% in June 2014 following feedback from shareholders.
The Executive Directors are allowed five years from the date of appointment to accumulate the appropriate level of shares.
For these purposes, EPP Deferred Shares will be counted on a post-tax basis only and all interests in shares will be counted at current value as at the 30 April year end.
LTIP Incentive Units are not included in this measure.
At 30 April 2015, Martin Griffiths had an interest in shares equivalent to 332% 2014: 327% of his basic salary and Ross Paterson an interest in shares equivalent to 240% 2014: 230% of his basic salary.
Both directors therefore met the shareholding guideline.
The effective interests of the Directors including those of connected persons as at 30 April 2015 were: Scheme interests vested TABLE 9 DIRECTORS INTERESTS IN SHARES OF THE GROUP Interests as at during year ended AS AT 30 APRIL 2015 30 April 2015 30 April 2015 LTIP Incentive EPP Shares BAYE Shares LTIP Incentive EPP Shares Units subject not subject not subject Units subject not subject Shares held to performance to performance to performance to performance to performance outright conditions conditions conditions conditions conditions Executive directors Martin Griffiths 435,240 777,337 234,471 1,989 99,310 73,085 Ross Paterson 211,650 467,283 107,210 1,989 49,149 27,081 Non-executive directors Gregor Alexander 10,406 Sir Ewan Brown see note below Ann Gloag 62,501,721 Helen Mahy 8,971 Sir Brian Souter 86,900,445 55,762 54,758 Garry Watts 16,000 Phil White 4,070 Will Whitehorn 72,288 Sir Ewan Brown has an indirect interest in the share capital of the Company.
He and his connected parties own approximately 18% 2014: 18% of the ordinary shares of Noble Grossart Holdings Limited, which in turn through its subsidiary, Noble Grossart Investments Limited, held 3,267,999 ordinary shares in the Company at 30 April 2015 2014: 3,267,999.
Although Sir Brian Souter retired as an executive director of the Company on 30 April 2013, retirement is not a vesting event for the EPP and so he retains awards of EPP Deferred Shares that are expected to vest on their original planned vesting dates.

9 Performance graph The graph below charts the performance of the total shareholder return TSR share value movement plus reinvested dividends from the Companys ordinary shares over the six years to 30 April 2015 compared with that of the FTSE Travel and Leisure All-Share Index, and the FTSE 250 Index.
The FTSE 250 Index has been selected for this comparison because it is the index used by the Company for the TSR based performance criterion for the LTIP Scheme, while the FTSE Travel and Leisure All-Share Index is shown as the Company and a number of its peers make up a significant element of that index.

Therefore the bonus percentages shown in Table 11 above reflect the amounts awarded to Sir Brian net of the waivers.
For information, the full bonus percentage entitlements based on performance and before the waivers are shown in Table 12 below.

10 Percentage change in Chief Executive Remuneration audited The change in the Chief Executives remuneration from 2013 14 to 2014 15 in comparison to a comparator group of employees is shown in Table 13 below.
TABLE 13 PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION FOR THE ROLE OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE Percentage change of Chief Executive Percentage change per capita of employees in the comparator group throughout both years Salary 2.4% 3.7% Benefits -0.7% 4.7% Bonus -33.4% -9.7% The comparator group used comprises over 300 employees including the corporate head office employees, the management teams of each of the Groups divisions and their administrative support staff.
This comparator group was used because the Committee believes it provides a sufficiently large and relative comparator group to give a reasonable understanding of underlying increases, based on similar annual bonus performance measures utilised by Group management and support functions.
The Group seeks to ensure that the basis for pay increases for Group management support functions are generally consistent with the pay rises at UK Bus and Rail operations.
11 Relative Importance of spend on pay audited The table below shows the expenditure of the Group on employee remuneration costs in the year ended 30 April 2015 and the year ended 30 April 2014.
In addition, it details the disbursements from profit made by way of dividend payments during the same periods.

13 Implementation of remuneration policy in the financial year ending 30 April 2016 In the year ending 30 April 2016, the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors remuneration policies will be implemented as follows.
13.1 Implementation of executive directors remuneration policy 8.5.
1 Fixed elements basic salary The Committee made the following 2015 16 basic salary decisions which are in line with the Directors remuneration policy.
TABLE 16 INCREASES IN BASIC SALARY 2015 16 2014 15 salary salary Percentage change Martin Griffiths 626,700 614,400 2.0% Ross Paterson 417,800 409,600 2.0% Salaries are effective from 1 May each year.
The Committee has considered the broader employee context in determining salaries.
2 Other elements The implementation of policy in relation to other elements of remuneration is in line with the Directors remuneration policy, and there are no changes in the maximum bonus or LTIP potential amounts as a percentage of basic salary.
Short-term incentives Annual Bonus The implementation of policy in relation to annual bonus is in line with the Directors remuneration policy.
Targets are approved by the Remuneration Committee around the beginning of the year.
Each executive director has a maximum potential bonus of up to 100% of basic salary, with 70% allocated over a range of financial objectives and 30% for meeting individual business related objectives.
The Committee has determined that the element of the potential bonus related to financial objectives will be allocated as follows for 2015 16: TABLE 17 FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES FOR 2015 16 BONUS Potential bonus % of the basic salary Consolidated profit before interest and taxation PBIT from Group companies 23.4 Consolidated adjusted earnings per share EPS 23.3 Consolidated net debt Net Debt 23.3 Element of bonus related to Group financial objectives 70.0 The three measures listed in Table 17 will be defined consistently with 2014 15 see note iii to Table 1.
The Committee is of the view that the values of the performance targets for the financial element under the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose these before the end of the financial year.
The targets and achievements in respect of the year ending 30 April 2016 will be disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report.
The Committee is of the view that the performance targets for the personal element are commercially sensitive as they relate to internal management projects, strategic objectives and personal goals and it is not intended that these will be disclosed in advance.
The Committees intention is that a summary of these objectives will be disclosed when they are no longer considered commercially sensitive.
50% of any actual bonus earned in the year will be deferred as shares under the EPP.
Long-term incentives LTIP awards LTIP awards vest after three years subject to performance conditions.
A summary of the intended awards during the year ending 30 April 2016 and the nature of the performance conditions are provided in Table 18 below.
TABLE 18 INTENDED LTIP AWARDS Face value of award Percentage of award Length of Award Performance at maximum vesting vesting for threshold Performance Type metric % of 2015 16 salary achievement period Martin Griffiths Incentive Units TSR relative against 75% 25% 3 years FTSE 250 Incentive Units EPS growth objectives 75% 25% 3 years Ross Paterson Incentive Units TSR relative against 75% 25% 3 years FTSE 250 Incentive Units EPS growth objectives 75% 25% 3 years In all cases, awards will only vest subject to the achievement of the performance conditions and if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the vesting of awards.
Awards are generally made twice a year following the announcement of the Annual Results in June, and in December following the issue of the results for the half-year.
The maximum level of awards granted for an individual in relation to any financial year is limited to Incentive Units with an aggregate face value at the time of award not exceeding 150% of basic salary.
The 2015 16 awards will be split one half based on TSR performance against a comparator group of the list of FTSE 250 companies at the date of award, and the other half based on a measure of earnings per share.
For the TSR based awards, the TSR must exceed the median of the comparator group and the amount of Incentive Units awarded which are released will range from 25% to 100% of the available Incentive Units depending on the actual ranking.
A top quartile ranking is required to achieve 100% release of units.
Demanding targets for the growth in earnings per share will be set for the other half of the awards based on relevant market factors and expectations for the Group as at the date of award.
The portion of the award that is EPS based will attract a threshold payout level of 25% if the EPS growth over the three-year performance period is at least 15%, and a 100% payout only if the EPS growth is at least 27% over the three-year performance period.
A sliding scale of vesting on a straight-line basis would be applied between these lower and upper vesting levels.
13.2 Implementation of non-executive directors remuneration policy Annual fees for 2015 16 The implementation of policy in relation to non-executive directors is in line with the Directors remuneration policy.
The fees per annum for the Non-Executive Directors for 2014 15 and the amount set for 2015 16 are set out in Table 19 below.
Each non-executive directors fee is set by the Board, taking account of the views of each director, the specific responsibilities of each director and the fees for equivalent roles in comparable organisations.
