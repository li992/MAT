Board and Governance Directors Remuneration Report Directors Remuneration Report Dear Shareholder, On behalf of the Remuneration Committee the Committee, I would like to extend our sincere thanks to our shareholders, as many of you have taken time to consider and provide views to the Committee on executive remuneration matters at Burberry.
As you would expect, the Committee has reflected carefully on the results of the 2014 Annual General Meeting AGM.
Although we were pleased to gain 83.9% of votes in favour of our remuneration policy, we were extremely disappointed that we did not receive majority support for the remuneration report.
The Committee has invested considerable time since the AGM to engage with and listen to shareholders to endeavour to better understand and respondto the areas of Burberry executive remuneration that have caused concern.
The Committee takes shareholders concerns very seriously and the Chairman and I have both taken a personal role in following up on the AGM vote, with theteam having met with or spoken to the majority of our 50 largest shareholders, specifically to discuss the subject ofBurberry executive remuneration.
Based on our analysis of the votes against the remuneration report and our follow-up discussions with shareholders, concerns centred largely around the structure of the remuneration package for Christopher Bailey, our Chief Creative andChief Executive Officer, and in particular, his award of one million shares granted in 2013 and his award of 500,000 performance-based shares granted in 2014 as part of his appointment to the CEO role.
We acknowledge that we released information regarding Christopher Baileys remuneration package through a number of different mediums and therefore maynot have been sufficiently clear on the context for the package and these exceptional share awards.
We have sought tobetter explain Christopher Baileys remuneration package to our major shareholders during our engagement and I set outbelow the rationale behind our decisions.
Remuneration Philosophy Our philosophy on remuneration is based on the following three key points: Creativity is at the heart of everything we do and is the key driver of sales and profit.
We must attract and retain the best creative talent available.
We aim to reward our people on a basis that is strongly aligned to sustainable long-term performance and commitment tothe brand that delivers value to our shareholders.
Burberry is an international luxury brand and in key areas we compete with, and recruit from, an international rather than domestic talent pool.
Christopher Baileys Remuneration Christopher Bailey has been with Burberry for 14 years, working in close partnership with two CEOs first Rose-Marie Bravo and, from 2006, Angela Ahrendts.
Over that period, he led the creative side, overseeing everything the customer sees and touches including brand imagery, product design and development, creative marketing and architecture.
He also led the consumer technology and digital innovation for which Burberry is renowned and is the basis for our leadership in this area when compared to our luxury peers.
Christopher Bailey was also a strong commercial partner to his CEOs, which is why, through our succession planning, he was the Boards clear choice when Angela Ahrendts announced her intention to leave Burberry in 2014.
A number of our major shareholders have made it clear how important it is that the Company retain Christopher Bailey, givenhis value to the Company and its ongoing success and the difficulty of replacing him.
The Committee has also taken this view and over the years considered it appropriate to make a number of decisions regarding his remuneration.
These decisions were not taken lightly.
They were difficult decisions which were made after considerable debate at the Committee meetings, given that the quantum and structure of Christopher Baileys remuneration would look unusual, especially in a UKcontext.
I set out below the key decisions that have been made, and the Committees rationale for these decisions: In 2010, Christopher Bailey was granted an exceptional award of 350,000 shares that would vest if he remained at the Company for five years.
These will vest ahead of the 2015 AGM and he has committed to retain 50% of these to achieve his shareholding guideline and demonstrate his commitment to Burberry and alignment with shareholders.
In 2013, and as the Chairman explained at the 2014 AGM, Christopher Bailey was approached for a role at another brand, rewarding him at much higher levels than his then existing Burberry package.
Put simply, the market value for his creative talents was far in excess of what he was earning.
81 Board and Governance Directors Remuneration Report The Committee believed it was essential to take action to retain Christopher Bailey, and while we could not match the offer, we increased his remuneration package accordingly, including an exceptional award of one million shares that wouldvest in full only if he stayed at Burberry until 2018.
The Committee also considered it appropriate to provide Christopher Bailey with a cash allowance of 440,000.
This was specifically chosen as a method of increasing Christopher Baileys fixed remuneration without increasing other costs to Burberry for his annual bonus, performance-related share awards and pension allowance.
Upon taking up the combined role as CC & CEO in 2014, the Committee made no changes to Christopher Baileys ongoingremuneration package.
To reflect his additional role and responsibilities as CC & CEO, we did, however, make Christopher Bailey a grant of an exceptional performance-related award of 500,000 shares that may vest between 2017and 2019, subject to performance.
Recognising that we did not provide sufficient information on the performance conditions attached to this award in the 2013 14 Directors Remuneration Report, the Committee disclosed further details of the performance conditions on our website on 25 June 2014, as summarised in section 5 of this report.
These are a mixture offinancial, strategic and personal performance conditions.
In addition to the information and context we have shared on the 2014 award of 500,000 performance-based shares, the Committee would like to further improve transparency around the performance conditions for the benefit of shareholders.
While there will be a degree of discretion applied when determining any outcome, we will provide detail subject to commercial sensitivity on how in practice performance has been tested at the end of each year.
Section 5 of this report includes this commentary on progress towards the objectives for the first year of the performance period and the Committee reached the conclusion, in the light of strong financial performance, outstanding shareholder returns, excellent strategic progress and Christophers own exceptional personal contribution, that overall there was an 85% performance achievement in the year.
Christopher Bailey is clearly in demand in the international luxury space and the Board is delighted that he has chosen to stay at Burberry, demonstrating his full commitment to the Company and shareholders during his first year as CC & CEO.
Asfurther demonstration of his long-term commitment to Burberry and strong alignment with the interests of shareholders, Christopher Bailey has committed to achieving his shareholding guideline requirement of 500,000 shares shortly after the 2015 AGM.
On 31 March 2015, the closing share price was 17.33 and so this level of shareholding represented almost 8times his salary.
A second area of shareholder concern was the level of discretion the Committee has in parts of the policy.
While the Committee might at times require the flexibility to apply discretion, this will be done infrequently, after careful consideration and, if material, after consultation with major shareholders.
Discretion can work both in favour of and against executives.
Executive Share Plan Final Design The Committee consulted extensively with shareholders on the design of the new Executive Share Plan ESP and was pleased that the plan received strong support at the 2014 AGM, with 91.2% of votes cast in favour.
Whilst the ESP design has been agreed, the remuneration policy allows a degree of flexibility around a number of the ESP design elements.
Thisflexibility allows the Committee to determine the most appropriate approach to the following parameters ahead of eachannual award: the weighting of each performance measure within the specified ranges : the definition and calculation approach of each performance measure: and the threshold and maximum performance targets for each performance measure.
The parameters for the 2015 ESP awards are explained in detail in section 4 of this report.
The Committee has also decided to apply an additional holding period on all new ESP awards granted to executive directors.
To increase long-term alignment with shareholders, while executive directors are employed by Burberry, no ESP shares may be sold until five years from the date of grant.
Remuneration Policy Operation The Remuneration Committee is pleased to confirm that all remuneration payments to executive directors made during theyear have been in line with the policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
The Committee is satisfied that theremuneration policy has proved fit-for-purpose, reflecting the long-term performance of the Company, and remains appropriate going forward.
82 Board and Governance Directors Remuneration Report In 2014 15, underlying growth in Group Revenue and Adjusted Profit Before Tax Adjusted PBT were 11% and 7% in a challenging global external environment.
Managements consistent execution of key strategies and dynamic response to challenges and opportunities delivered this strong performance.
Against this backdrop, the annual bonus paid out at 81% ofmaximum, as Adjusted PBT for the year was between the target and maximum levels set by the Committee.
Underlying growth in Adjusted PBT over the last three years has been 8.3% per annum and so the Co-Investment Plan awards granted in 2012 will vest at 75% of maximum.
The Restricted Share Plan awards granted to senior executives in 2012 did not vest, asthe performance conditions for these awards were not met.
Finally, in terms of how the remuneration policy will be operated during the 2015 16 year, section 4 sets out the Committees intended approach in detail.
The points I would draw to your attention are that: the executive directors will be receiving zero increases to salaries: awards under the ESP will be 350% of salary for Christopher Bailey and 250% of salary for the other directors: and a clawback measure will be introduced on the annual bonus and ESP awards going forward.
The Committee will continue to engage with shareholders to ensure an open dialogue and improved transparency around executive remuneration arrangements at Burberry.
Once again, I would like to personally thank shareholders for all the feedback this year and I look forward to gaining your support on the remuneration report when it is put to the vote at the Annual General Meeting in July 2015.

Directors remuneration policy Burberrys directors remuneration policy remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting AGM and took effect from the date of the 2014 AGM, 11 July 2014.
Since the policy has a maximum life of three years, we are not seeking approval for it this year and it is set out in this report for reference only.
There have been no changes to the remuneration policy and the Committee intends that this policy should apply until the 2017 AGM.
The charts illustrating indicative levels of total remuneration for the executive directors have not been included this year, and the full original version of the remuneration policy can be found in the 2013 14 Annual Report, available on the Companys website.
The Committee believes the Groups remuneration should be strongly linked to performance and internationally competitive, taking into account the global markets in which it operates and from which it recruits.
The remuneration policy is based on the following principles.
Linked to the success and strategy of the business: the overall remuneration framework should provide a balance between key short-term and long-term business objectives.
Variable pay for executive directors includes 1 an annual cash bonus based on the financial performance of Burberry currently Adjusted Profit Before Tax as per the audited income statement Adjusted PBT is the sole performance measure, and 2 long-term share-based incentives linked primarily to the financial performance of the Company but having regard to the delivery of objectives set in accordance with the Companys longterm strategic themes.
Shareholder value: remuneration should provide close alignment with long-term value creation for shareholders through theselection of appropriate performance measures and targets, be tied to the future success of the Company, emphasise variable pay and deliver a significant proportion of remuneration in shares, some of which are expected to be retained in accordance with the Groups executive shareholding policy.
Adjusted Profit Before Tax is defined in note 2 of the Financial Statements and all references to Adjusted PBT in this report refer to this definition.
83 Board and Governance Directors Remuneration Report Competitive in the global talent market: total remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain exceptional talent within the global luxury goods and digital sectors.
Total remuneration for executive directors and other senior executives is therefore benchmarked against Burberrys main global competitors for talent and comparable UK companies.
The Committee recognises that, for each executive, the relative importance of each of these reference groups may be different depending on the skills and experience required to undertake the specific role.
Benefits are based on competitive market practice for each executive depending on individual circumstances.

50% of bonus will be deferred in shares for three years until executive shareholding guidelines are met.
Use of judgement: The Committee may determine that itis appropriate to adjust down or up the bonus outcome.
This may take into account factors such as misalignment of adjusted profit performance with other financial and operational measures of performance or targets no longer being appropriate.
It is anticipated that any adjustment would be infrequent and in exceptional circumstances only.

Non-executive directors The non-executive directors serve under Letters of Appointment with the Company.
Non-executive directors may continue to serve subject to the annual re-election by shareholders at each Annual General Meeting of the Company, subject to six months notice by either party.
There are no provisions for compensation for loss of office, or payments in lieu of notice in the Letters of Appointment.
Development of directors remuneration policy In developing and reviewing the directors remuneration policy, the Committee is mindful of the views of shareholders andissensitive of the relativities of arrangements for senior executives to those for employees more generally.
The Committee proactively seeks feedback from shareholders when considering any significant changes to remuneration for executive directors.
The Committee also listens to and takes into consideration investor views more generally throughout the year.
As detailed in the introductory letter from the Remuneration Committee, the Company has consulted extensively during the 2014 15 year with its major shareholders to follow up on the 2014 AGM and also on the performance measures and targets for the first awards under the ESP to be granted June 2015.
Base salary increases awarded to executives are determined within the broader context of Company-wide salary increases.
Given the scale, geographic spread and the diversity of roles of the Companys employees, the Committee does not proactively consult with employees specifically on the remuneration policy for directors.
Employees are free to communicate their views internally on any topic including by using the Burberry internal social media platform or using the employee confidential helpline.
In addition, many of the Companys employees are shareholders, through the Sharesave and Free Share plans, andthey, like other shareholders, are able to express their views on directors remuneration at each general meeting.

Salary for 2014 15 When Christopher Bailey became an executive director and took on the role of Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer on1 May 2014, his salary remained unchanged at 1,100,000.
John Smiths salary was reviewed in July 2014 and increased by 3.0% to 592,000.
Carol Fairweathers salary was also reviewed in July 2014 and increased by 11.1% to 500,000 in recognition of her strong performance as CFO and to address that her salary was set at below market levels when she was appointed to the role.
The executive directors have decided not to accept any increase to their salaries for the 2015 16 year.
Annual bonus outcomes 2014 15 audited Annual bonuses for 2014 15 were based entirely on Adjusted PBT.
For the year to 31 March 2015, the 2014 15 Adjusted PBT achieved was between the target and maximum level set by the Committee, which resulted in bonuses for the executive directors of 81% of maximum, as set out in the table below.

The level of Adjusted PBT achieved is therefore different higher this year than the reported 2014 15 Adjusted PBT due to the adjustments made by the Committee to reflect constant exchange rates.
92 Board and Governance Directors Remuneration Report The 2013 14 Adjusted PBT targets were set at 440m threshold, 450m target and 470m maximum.
The level of Adjusted PBT achieved in 2013 14 was 457.7m which resulted in 2013 14 bonuses of 70% of maximum.
This level of Adjusted PBT achieved was lower than the reported 2013 14 Adjusted PBT due to adjustments made by the Committee toreflect constant exchange rates and any other items deemed to be outside of managements control.
John Smith will invest 50% of his bonus after the deduction of tax into Burberry shares, in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
Co-Investment Plan outcomes for 2014 15 audited In June 2012, Christopher Bailey and Carol Fairweather were awarded Co-Investment Plan CIP matching awards of 313,534 and 32,178 shares respectively.
Vesting was subject to performance from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2015, as follows: 25% of awards vest if growth in Adjusted PBT is 5% per annum over three years, 100% vest if Adjusted PBT growth is equalto or exceeds 10% per annum over three years.
The vesting outcome based on three-year Adjusted PBT growth is calculated using Adjusted PBT as disclosed in the annual accounts.
Actual Adjusted PBT growth over the three-year period to 31 March 2015 at constant exchange rates was 8.3%, therefore 75% of awards will vest in June 2015, as set out in the table below.

Adoption of a clawback measure on the annual bonus and ESP The Committee has decided to introduce a clawback provision on future bonus payments, whereby for a period of 3yearsfrom date of payment, any bonus may be recovered from individuals in whole or in part in the event of a material misstatement in the Companys audited financial statements or if the outcome has been incorrectly calculated.
Similarly, a clawback provision is also being introduced on future ESP awards, whereby for a period of 3 years from dateofvest, any vested shares or awards may be recovered from individuals in whole or in part in the event of a material misstatement in the Companys audited financial statements or if the outturn has been incorrectly calculated.
This isinaddition to the malus provision that we currently have on the ESP whereby unvested shares or awards may be forfeitedinwhole or in part in the event of a material misstatement in the Companys audited financial statements.
97 Board and Governance Directors Remuneration Report 4.3.
Further information on ESP performance measures Whilst the ESP design has been agreed, the remuneration policy allows a degree of flexibility around a number of the ESP design elements.
This flexibility allows the Committee to determine the most appropriate approach to the following parameters ahead of each annual award: the weighting of each performance measure within the specified ranges the definition and calculation approach of each performance measure the threshold and maximum performance targets for each performance measure The following performance measures have been selected by the Committee.
G rowth in Group Adjusted Profit Before Tax Adjusted PBT this will be calculated on a constant currency basis consistent with our current approach for the Adjusted PBT performance measures on outstanding Co-Investment and Restricted Share Plan awards.
G rowth in Group Revenue this will be calculated on a constant currency basis in the same manner as Adjusted PBT.
A djusted Retail Wholesale Return on Invested Capital ROIC this has been determined by the Committee as the mostappropriate return measure.
It measures the efficient use of capital to deliver attractive returns on incremental investment, which is important given the Groups investment in new projects.
At present, Burberrys Group ROIC includes the contribution from its licensing business, a high return business.
For example, in FY 2014 15, licensing generated 56.0m of adjusted operating profit from 2.6m of total assets see note 3 of the Financial Statements.
Given the expiry of the Japan licence during FY 2015 16, a strategy which is fully supported by our majorshareholders, the Committee decided that it is most appropriate to measure ROIC on Burberrys Retail Wholesale business only.
Retail Wholesale ROIC, for the purposes of the ESP performance measure, is calculated as the Retail Wholesale post-tax adjusted operating profit divided by the average operating assets, measured over the three year period, on a reported currency basis.
A reconciliation of Adjusted Retail Wholesale ROIC is included in the 5-year summary on page 162.
The ROIC performance targets have been set with the objective of rewarding maximum performance if growth in operating assets does not exceed growth in profitability.
This is seen as a challenging target given the growing capital intensity of Burberrys strategy, including the continuing shift in the business model from wholesale to retail, continued investment in retail stores, particularly in Japan given the transition to a direct retail business, and further evolution of the store portfolio, increasingly focused on flagship markets.
It should be noted that Retail Wholesale ROIC in 2014 15 was 17.8%, so even if ROIC were to decline, Burberry is still creating long-term value for shareholders.
The proposed targets for all three performance measures have been carefully calibrated in light of a number of factors, including the latest Burberry strategic plan, Burberrys long-term financial goals, latest three-year projections and broker earnings estimates for Burberry and its competitors.
The Committee believes these targets are stretching, extremely so at the top end, given the changes to the business model in Japan and globally and the current growth prospects in the luxury sector.
They will ensure management are incentivised to continue to deliver superior returns to shareholders.
The performance measures for the 2015 ESP awards are summarised below Target % of maximum vesting Weighting ESP performance measure Definition % of award Threshold 25% Maximum 100% Group Adjusted Profit Before 3-year growth, calculated 50% 3% p. a.

98 Board and Governance Directors Remuneration Report ESP awards will vest 50% after 3 years and 50% after 4 years from the date of grant.
To increase long-term alignment with shareholders, while executives are employed by Burberry, no ESP shares may be sold except to cover any tax liabilities arising out of the award until five years from the date of grant.
Note that the CIP and RSP have both now expired and no further awards will be made under these plans.

Further information on Christopher Baileys 2014 exceptional performance-based award of 500,000 shares The exceptional performance-based award of 500,000 shares that was granted to Christopher Bailey upon his appointment to the Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer role was intended to recognise: how important it is to ensure Christopher Bailey is well-aligned with shareholders interests and is highly motivated tosuccessfully execute the long-term strategy of Burberry: and how important it is to retain Christopher Bailey given his importance to the continued success of the Company and also the challenge the Board would face to attempt to replace him.
The quantum of the award, at 500,000 shares, was carefully considered by the Committee and was intended to recognise the significant increase in the scope of his role upon appointment as the CEO, in addition to continuing his role as Chief Creative Officer at Burberry.
Vesting will be determined by reference to the following key performance criteria: the strategic development of the business measured against the strategic plan approved by the Board from time to time: the Companys financial performance, in assessing which the Remuneration Committee will have reference to the profit before tax condition applied to awards made in 2014 under the Burberry Group Co-Investment Plan.
This performance condition requires growth in Adjusted PBT over three years of between 5% at threshold and 10% p. a. at maximum.
the personal contribution made by Christopher Bailey: the shareholder value delivered in the context of the evolution of the luxury goods markets in which Burberry operated over the period between the date of grant and the relevant vesting date: and any other performance factors which are appropriate in assessing the extent of vesting having regard to the interests ofshareholders.
Vesting of the award will be phased over 5 years from the date of grant and only subject to the extent that the performance criteria outlined above has been met.
125,000 shares will vest on 31 July 2017, 125,000 shares on 31 July 2018 and 250,000shares on 31 July 2019, subject to performance measured from the date of grant to the relevant vesting date.
99 Board and Governance Directors Remuneration Report The Committee assesses progress towards achieving these objectives each financial year and prior to each vesting date willdetermine the extent to which the objectives were achieved over the 3, 4 or 5 year performance period, having regard tothe level of performance achieved in each relevant financial year.
Accordingly, at the end of 2014 15 the Committee reviewed performance in relation to the award of 500,000 shares granted to the Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer, in the context of the following.
Strategic development In 2014 15 Burberry made excellent progress across the six pillars of its strategic agenda, including: 1.
Inspire with the Brand Continued to strengthen the Burberry brand through key brand investments including the Dreams of London event at the Shanghais Kerry Centre store opening, digital interactions in established and emerging social media platforms, and the 2014 Festive campaign, the brands most comprehensive holiday marketing program to date 2.

Pursue Operational Excellence Further evolved the sourcing model to a more collaborative and sustainable manufacturing approach, focusing onkeystrategic raw material and finished goods partners 6.
Build our Culture Continued to attract top talent to the organisation Professional social network LinkedIn named Burberry 36th most in-demand employer globally Financial performance Underlying Group Adjusted PBT annual growth of 7.0% in a challenging global environment.
Underlying Group revenue annual growth of 11% in a challenging global environment.
Personal contribution Burberry commenced the 14 15 year with an imminent change of CEO from Angela Ahrendts to Christopher Bailey.
Shareholders understandably expressed concern over the departure of Angela Ahrendts and the Boards objective wasfor this management transition to be seamless given a major change of this nature can be very disruptive at a numberof levels, impacting financial performance and shareholder value.
This transition required the ongoing evolution and execution of strategy and the delivery of strong financial performance in terms of revenue and profit growth and shareholder return, all in the context of what was becoming an increasingly uncertain environment.
Further it required keymembers of the senior management team to be retained, united and motivated under new leadership.
Christopher Baileys performance in achieving this objective in his first CEO role has been exceptional particularly in the context ofhiscreative achievements, from the innovative runway shows to the flagship events in Shanghai and Los Angeles.
100 Board and Governance Directors Remuneration Report Shareholder value Share price has increased by 16.7% since Christophers appointment to the CEO role from closing price on 30 April 2014 to 31 March 2015 and dividends for 2014 15 are 35.2 pence per share.
Overall Total Shareholder Return TSR of 30.1% for the 2014 15 year from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015, which outperformed all our core luxury peers and compares to an average TSR of 7.6% for this group and 7.5% for the FTSE 100.
Boss, Coach, Ferragamo, Hermes, Kering, LVMH, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Richemont, Swatch, Tiffany, Tods After careful review the Committee considers that shareholder return was exceptional in 2014 15 as was Christopher Baileys performance in his first year in the CC & CEO role, whilst he continued to be the creative leader of Burberry.
The strategic development of the business was excellent whilst underlying adjusted PBT growth was 7%, as reflected in the financial performance criteria, noting however that underlying revenue growth was 11%.
Accordingly taking into account the degree of achievement of each of the performance criteria the Committee reached the conclusion that overall there was an 85% performance achievement in the 2014 15 year.
