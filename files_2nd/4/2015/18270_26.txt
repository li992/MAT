Stock Code: DPH 85 slugline Directors Remuneration Report continued LTIP Awards Vesting in Respect of the Year Ended 30 June 2015 The LTIP Awards granted on 5 March 2013 are due to vest on 5 March 2016.
Ian Page and Tony Griffin were granted LTIP Awards on 5 March 2013, the performance targets for which are as follows: 50% of the Award is subject to a performance condition based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over the performance period relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts over the performance period as follows: TSR Performance Vesting Percentage Below median 0% Median 25% of the TSR portion will vest Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata vesting between 25% and 100% based on the Companys ranking in the comparator group Upper quartile 100% of the TSR portion will vest 50% of each Award is subject to a performance condition based on the Companys underlying diluted Earnings per Share EPS in the final year of the performance period as follows: EPS Vesting Percentage 33p 0% 33p 25% of the EPS portion will vest Between 33p and 40p Pro-rata vesting between 25% and 100% 40p 100% of the EPS portion will vest Each of the TSR element and the EPS element is subject to an additional Return on Capital Employed ROCE performance measure.
Unless the Companys ROCE is 10% or more in the final year of the performance period, the Awards will lapse in full regardless of TSR and EPS performance.
The percentage vesting will be reduced by 10% by every 1% that ROCE falls below 15%.
The EPS targets originally agreed for the LTIP Awards granted in March 2013 were set for organic growth, with the intention that they would be appropriately adjusted for the impact of any acquisitions and divestments.
Therefore, as reported in the Directors Remuneration Report for the years ended 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2014 and following a consultation with major shareholders at the beginning of November 2013, the performance conditions for those Awards were adjusted in accordance with the LTIP rules to take account of the disposal of the Services Segment in August 2013 so as to ensure that performance was measured on a fair and consistent basis over the performance period.
The EPS and ROCE performance measures detailed above are as adjusted to reflect the divestment of the Services Segment.
As described below, the 2015 EPS 39.90 pence represents 23.3% compound annual growth from a rebased 2012 EPS figure of 21.28 pence in EPS.
With respect to the performance conditions relating to the LTIP Award due to vest on 5 March 2016, the Companys TSR performance was over 129.8% compared with a 137.4% TSR for the upper quartile company in the comparator group.
Therefore 87.2% of the TSR element will vest.
In addition, the Groups underlying diluted EPS for 2015 was 39.90 pence.
Accordingly, 98.9% of the EPS element will vest.
Overall, taking into account that ROCE performance for 2015 was 20%, the LTIP Awards will vest as to 93.1% of maximum opportunity.
In the single figure table on page 84, the value attributable to this Award is calculated by multiplying the number of shares in respect of which the Award is expected to vest by 10.086 being the average market value of a share over the last quarter of the Companys financial period ended on 30 June 2015.
Recruitment Award for Anne-Francoise Nesmes Vesting in Respect of the Year Ended 30 June 2015 As disclosed in the 2014 Directors Remuneration Report, on her appointment the Committee agreed to award Anne-Francoise Nesmes two LTIP Awards, each to the value of 100% of her base salary.
The first Award vested in full on 30 June 2014, the details of which were disclosed in the 2014 Annual Report.
The vesting of the second of those Awards was subject to the same performance conditions as those applying to the LTIP Awards granted on 5 March 2013, as detailed above.
Therefore this second Award vested as to 93.1% on 30 June 2015.
In the single figure table on page 84 the value attributable to this Award is calculated by multiplying the number of shares in respect of which the Award vested, 38,859, by 9.83 being the market value of a share on 30 June 2015.
The details of the LTIP Awards granted during the year ended 30 June 2015 are set out below.

For these purposes, UK employees were chosen as a comparator group reflecting that Ian Page is UK based and the number of UK employees was sufficiently large to provide a robust comparison.
Employees outside the UK were not included in the comparator group since country specific differences could distort the comparison.
