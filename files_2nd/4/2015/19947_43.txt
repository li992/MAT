The Committee is comprised to exercise independent judgement and consists only of the following independent Non-Executive Directors: Chairman: Luc Vandevelde Committee members: Valerie Gooding from 29 July 2014 : Renee James: Samuel Jonah: Philip Yea until 29 July 2014 The Committee regularly consults with Vittorio Colao, the Chief Executive, and Ronald Schellekens, the Group HR Director, on various matters relating to the appropriateness of awards for Executive Directors and senior executives, though they are not present when their own compensation is discussed.
Inaddition, Adrian Jackson, the Group Reward and Policy Director, provides a perspective on information provided to the Committee, and requests information and analysis from external advisors as required.
Rosemary Martin, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, advises the Committee on corporate governance guidelines and acts as secretary to the Committee.
External advisors The Remuneration Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisors where appropriate.
The appointed advisors, Towers Watson, were selected through a thorough process led by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and were appointed by the Committee in 2007.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee has direct access to the advisors as and when required, and the Committee determines the protocols by which the advisors interact with management in support of the Committee.
The advice and recommendations of the external advisors are used as a guide, but do not serve as a substitute for thorough consideration of the issues by each Committee member.
Advisors attend Committee meetings occasionally, as and when required by the Committee.
Towers Watson are a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
This is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants.
Towers Watson has confirmed that they adhered to that Code of Conduct throughout the year for all remuneration services provided to Vodafone and therefore the Committee are satisfied that they are independent and objective.
The Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct is available at .

2014 annual general meeting At the 2014 annual general meeting there was a binding vote on our Remuneration Policy and an advisory vote on our Remuneration Report.
Details of the voting outcomes are provided in the table below.
Outside these meetings there are frequent discussions usually by conference call.
The principal agenda items at the formal meetings were as follows: Meeting Agenda items May 2014 a 2014 annual bonus achievement and 2015 targets and ranges a 2014 Directors remuneration report a 2012 long-term incentive award vesting and 2015 targets and ranges July 2014 a 2015 long-term incentive awards a Large local market CEO remuneration November 2014 a 2016 reward strategy a Corporate governance matters a Executive Committee remuneration December 2014 a Succession planning for Stephen Pusey February 2015 a 2016 annual bonus framework March 2015 a 2015 reward packages for the Executive Committee a 2015 Directors remuneration report a Non-Executive Director fee levels a Committees effectiveness and terms of reference a Chairmans fees a Risk assessment 83 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2015 Directors remuneration continued Annual Report on remuneration continued 2015 remuneration In this section we summarise the pay packages awarded to our Executive Directors for performance in the 2015 financial year versus 2014.
Specifically we have provided a table that shows all remuneration that was earned by each individual during the year and computed a single total remuneration figure for the year.
The value of the annual bonus GSTIP was earned during the year but will be paid out in cash in the following year and the value of the long-term incentive GLTI shows the share awards which will vest in July 2015 as a result of the performance through the three year period ended at the completion of our financial year on 31 March 2015.
The Remuneration Committee reviews all incentive awards prior to payment and uses judgement to ensure that the final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate.
If circumstances warrant it, the Committee may adjust the final payment or vesting downwards.
On this occasion, the Committee did not exercise its judgement considering the annual bonus GSTIP payout and the final vesting level of the long-term incentives awards GLTI reflected performance and were considered fair and appropriate.
2 Taxable benefits include amounts in respect of: P rivate healthcare 2015: 1,854: 2014 1,734 : Cash car allowance 19,200 p. a. : and Travel 2015: Vittorio Colao 18,022: Nick Read 7,164: 2014: Vittorio Colao 17,155.
3 The value shown in the 2014 column is the award which vested on 28 June 2014 and is valued using the execution share price on 30 June 2014 of 196.19 pence.
Please note that the values disclosed in this table in 2014 are slightly different as the value was based on an average of the closing share price over the last quarter of the 2014 financial year of 234.23 pence.
4 Participants also receive a cash award, equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period on any shares that vest.
The cash in lieu of dividend value shown in 2014 relates to the award which vested on 28 June 2014.

The performance measures and weightings for 2016 are as follows: a Service revenue 20% : a EBITDA 20% : a adjusted free cash flow 20% : and a customer appreciation KPIs 40%.
This includes an assessment of net promoter score NPS and brand consideration measures.
In respect of the measures included under the customer appreciation KPIs, NPS is used as a measure of customer advocacy whilst brand consideration acts as a measure of the percentage of people who would consider using a certain brand as their telecoms provider.
Both measures utilise data collected in our local markets which is validated for quality and consistency by independent third party agencies.
The data is sourced from studies involving both our own customers and customers of our competitors for the NPS measure, and both Vodafone users and non-users for the brand consideration measure.
In formulating a final assessment of performance under the customer appreciation KPIs, the Committee will also consider other relevant customer factors such as churn, customer growth and service levels.
Annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive and therefore will be disclosed in the 2016 remuneration report following the completion of the financial year.
Long-term incentive GLTI awards for 2016 As described in our policy on pages 78 to 80 the performance conditions are a combination of adjusted free cash flow and TSR performance.
The details for the 2016 award are provided in the table below with linear interpolation between points.
Following the annual review of the performance measure, the Committee decided that for the 2016 award the TSR outperformance range should revert back to 0% to 9%.
This range was used in all years other than 2015, remains positioned at the upper end of market practice and is considered appropriately stretching against forecast performance.
The Committee will keep the calibration of the range under review and continue to only make changes where there is sufficient evidence to suggest this is appropriate.

Long-term incentive GLTI awards vesting As discussed in detail in last years Annual Report, Project Spring involves significant organic investment over the next two years to enhance network and serviceleadership further.
This investment will have a significant impact on adjusted Free Cash Flow FCF, which is the primary performance condition for the GLTI and we expect an initial drop in FCF that will then build again as the investment pays off over the longer term.
The impact is predicted as follows: Financial year of award Performance period end Impact 2014 March 2016 Targets for the 2014 awards were set prior to the announcement of Project Spring therefore we will remove the impact on FCF when calculating the vesting results following the end of the performance period.
2015 onwards March 2017 onwards The 2015 awards and all future years will have the full impact of Project Spring included in the targets and no further adjustments will be necessary.
