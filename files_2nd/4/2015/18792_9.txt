Directors Remuneration Policy In my introduction to the 2014 Directors Remuneration Report, I said that the Remuneration Committee would revisit all aspects of the APP and LTIP during 2015.
I also said that we would bring forward the Directors Remuneration Policy DR Policy to a shareholder vote in 2016.
In 2015, we commenced a thorough review of the APP and LTIP measures and their relationship to our business strategy.
We concluded that there is no urgent business need for any material change to the structure of the APP and LTIP awards to be made in 2016.
However, we are continuing our review in light of the effective completion of our major asset-disposal programme and the changing, global, competitive landscape.
We will complete our next DR Policy review in good time to consult formally with major shareholders again, and bring it to a vote of all shareholders in 2017.
