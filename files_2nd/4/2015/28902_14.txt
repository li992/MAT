Components of Executive Directors remuneration Base salary The Committee reviewed the Executive Director salary levels during 2015, and did so referencing a range of information including market data from two benchmarking peer groups of listed international insurers and FTSE companies of a broadly comparable market capitalisation to RSA, excluding banks and heavy industries.
It took into account the average reviews applied elsewhere in the Group, including those for employees subject to collective bargaining agreements, and UK inflation figures.
No changes were made as a result of this review, as shown below.

S cott Egan was appointed as a director effective 1 October 2015 on an annual salary of 525,000, which will first be reviewed in 2017.
R ichard Houghtons salary effective 1 April 2015 remained unchanged at 494,400.
Employment benefits The Executive Directors received a range of employment benefits during 2015, including car, medical benefits and life cover, and the value of these is noted in the table on page 71.
Pension provision audited The Executive Directors pension benefits for the year were as follows: Scott Egan joined the RSA Pension Scheme following his appointment in October 2015, and is eligible to receive an employer pension contribution of 15% of base salary.
Stephen Hester received a taxable cash allowance of 30% of base salary.
Richard Houghton received a taxable cash allowance of 13.18% of base salary for the period he was employed during 2015.
The aggregate value paid by the Company into the RSA Pension Scheme a defined contribution plan for the Executive Directors in 2015 was 13,125 2014: 11,124.
Annual Bonus Plan audited For the 2015 financial year, the Executive Directors Annual Bonus Plan consisted of financial and business targets aligned to the Groups operational plans.
These included: Group underlying Return on Tangible Equity ROTE, Group underlying Profit before Tax PBT, Group Combined Operating Ratio COR, a Business Review Scorecard and role-specific personal objectives.
Overall, these targets required demanding business improvements from the prior year.
The maximum bonus opportunity was 160% of salary, of which half of any award is deferred into RSA shares for three years.
Bonus awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions under the Groups Clawback Policy, as detailed on page 75.
In determining 2015 bonus awards under this Plan, the Committee considered how goals had been met, ensuring that performance also took account of key risk factors.
Financial performance 40% weighting achieved 19.5% As shown in the following table, RSAs financial performance for each metric was around the level targeted, leading to an outcome under this element of 19.5% against a possible maximum of 40%.
Business Review performance 30% weighting achieved 27% The Business Review Scorecard offered an opportunity of up to 30% of the overall award and is designed to capture progress against underlying improvements targeted by the turnaround plan, including restructuring actions.
The Committee assessed performance taking into account capital, risk and disposal achievements together with the results of actions aimed at delivering the business turnaround targets.
Performance under the Business Review Scorecard was assessed to have been at or above that targeted across all of these areas.
Outperformance was noted in much of the transformation.
Divestments were planned and implemented well with execution risks managed, and the Group benefitting from the resulting focus.
Capital ratios were above target and expense reduction exceeded Plan.
Outcomes on the Solvency II internal model approval and UK pension scheme agreements were also positive.
Current year underwriting profits increased to record levels and new reinsurance protection worked well.
The Committee was of the view that overall strong progress has been made, and as a result assessed an outcome of 27% out of a possible score of 30% in this category.
Strategic Report Directors and Corporate Governance Report Financial Statements Other Information Directors and Corporate Governance Report Directors Remuneration Report RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 73 Personal element 30% weighting achieved 30% This element focuses on personal performance versus the priorities set by the Board for the Group Chief Executive in 2015: namely driving strategic refocus and disposals, capital strength and risk control, stakeholder engagement, customer focus and Executive team development.
The Company as a whole met its underlying profitability targets for the year, as reflected in the financial element of the bonus, and performance was much improved on recent years.
The Chief Executives leadership was central to the level of outperformance seen in the business across the full agenda targeted.
It included driving the evolution and implementation of the strategy and action plans, strengthening customer franchises with a range of product and service initiatives and internally building the performance culture.
The unsolicited takeover approach by Zurich was also testing and the Group Chief Executive played an important role in its handling and keeping disruption from destabilising Company momentum.
Taking all of the above into account, and the personal leadership strengths required, the Committee determined that Stephen Hester would receive an award of 30% out of 30% for this element.
As a consequence, Mr Hester was awarded a bonus of 76.5% of the maximum available opportunity, being 122% of his annual base salary.
Overview of bonus outcome The table below summarises the 2015 annual bonus outcome for Stephen Hester.

These measures are referenced in the capital disclosure on page 122 to 123.
Adjusted for timing of business disposals.
Stephen Hesters bonus has been determined by the Committee relative to his gross annual basic salary of 950,000.
H alf of the bonus shown is awarded in Deferred Bonus Shares.
The shares vest three years from the date of grant, and are subject to malus adjustment under the Groups Clawback Policy detailed on page 75.
The Committee is mindful of guidance published by investor representative bodies around enhancing transparency, and aligned to this, further information on the targets will be published in the 2016 report.
This content provides information on the Groups planning process, and is therefore particularly commercially sensitive during the business transformation.
Group Chief Financial Officer compensatory award On leaving his previous employer, Scott Egan forfeited a number of cash-based awards.
The Committee carefully reviewed these awards and determined compensatory awards should be made in line with the principles outlined in the Remuneration Policy.
The following awards, which consist of a combination of cash and shares, have been made and are included in the single figure remuneration table for 2015 on page 71: Upon appointment, a cash payment of 1,104,647 was made to replace cash payments forfeited by Mr Egan or paid back by him to his previous employer upon resignation.
Mr Egan also forfeited a cash bonus from his previous employer in respect of 2015, which has been replaced by a compensatory award payable in early 2016, in line with the payment schedule of the original forfeited award.
The payment will be 50% in cash 250,000 and 50% in restricted shares valued at 250,000.
In line with the Policy, the forfeited cash bonus was bought out partially with shares in order to give Mr Egan an early stake in RSA.
These awards are subject to repayment terms in the event of resignation or termination for gross misconduct within two years of appointment.
Mr Egan must meet his RSA shareholding requirement of 150% of salary prior to the sale of any shares, excluding those sold to cover statutory deductions.
Mr Egan will not receive an RSA Annual Bonus award in respect of the period worked in 2015.
74 Directors and Corporate Governance Report Directors Remuneration Report RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Directors Remuneration Report continued Long-term incentives awards vesting from 201315 cycle audited Conditional long-term incentive awards were made to Executive Directors in the 2013-15 cycle in the form of Performance Shares.
Under the LTIP arrangements operated at that time, Executive Directors could also receive Matching Shares for each share deferred through the 2012 Annual Bonus Plan, via both compulsory and voluntary deferral.
Performance and Matching Shares will lapse in full in 2016, as the Relative TSR and Group underlying ROE conditions attached to these awards were not achieved.
The Companys TSR was less than the unweighted index of comparators, and the three- 1 year average Group underlying ROE over the performance period was 7.3% compared to a 9-14% target range.
The awards were granted prior to the appointment of the current Executive Directors, and neither of them have awards in this cycle.
T he Relative TSR threshold target 25% vesting is equal to the unweighted index of comparators which includes: ACE, Admiral, Allianz, Amlin, Aviva, Direct Line, Gjensidige Forsikring, Hiscox, Intact, Mapfre, QBE, Topdanmark, Tryg and Zurich.
The maximum target 100% vesting is to outperform the index by at least 7% per annum 22.5% compound over three years or to exceed the TSR of the highest performing company in the index.
Catlin had originally been included in the index, however it was delisted during the performance period and so the Committee determined to exclude it from the calculation.
The Group underlying ROE threshold target 25% vesting is 9% and maximum target 100% vesting is 14%, measured as a three-year average over the performance period.
Long-term incentives awards granted in 2015 audited A conditional long-term incentive award was made to the Group Chief Executive on 7 April 2015 under the Performance Share Plan PSP, which was approved by shareholders on 9 May 2014.
These Performance Share awards will vest in 2018, subject to the satisfaction of the plans performance conditions based on Group underlying ROTE, relative Total Shareholder Return and a Business Review Scorecard.
The Scorecard measures a range of indicators on an underlying basis, and includes: growth in Tangible Net Asset Value per Share TNAV, cumulative earnings, controllable expenses and a range of capital strength metrics including the ratio of Tangible Net Asset Value to Net Written Premium TNAV:NWP.
The targets for the performance measures are shown in the following table.
Achievement against the Business Review Scorecard will be evaluated using a performance framework whereby each metric will be reviewed against its target, and judgement in the round used to determine the level of vesting, taking into account underlying business performance indicators and any material risk items.
The specific targets cannot be disclosed prospectively for commercial reasons, including price sensitivity.
A performance narrative will be given to summarise the level of vesting on the Business Review Scorecard once the performance conditions have been tested.

A straight-line calculation is applied to determine the portion of awards that vest for performance between the threshold and maximum targets.
Amlin and Catlin were also originally included in the index, however they have since been delisted and the Committee will ratify their exclusion from the TSR index at the end of the performance period.
Group underlying ROTE will be calculated on a three-year average basis.
A straight-line calculation is applied to determine the portion of awards that vest for performance between threshold and on-target, and between on-target and maximum.
The average required for on-target vesting 62.5% vesting is less than the mid-point of the 11-16% range and is considered commercially sensitive because it is set in line with, and therefore signals, the Groups forward plan for the period.
Disclosure will be provided retrospectively following the end of the performance period.
Strategic Report Directors and Corporate Governance Report Financial Statements Other Information Directors and Corporate Governance Report Directors Remuneration Report RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 75 As disclosed in the last years Directors Remuneration Report, Stephen Hesters award in the 201517 cycle was for 300% of salary at maximum vesting, in view of his criticality to the turnaround.
The awards granted are set out in the table below: 1, 2 Performance Shares 3 4 Director Basis of award Number of shares Face value Stephen Hester 300% of salary 669,202 2,850,000 Notes: 1.
T he performance measures are Group underlying ROTE, relative TSR and a Business Review Scorecard weighting each.
T he performance period is three years and ends on 31 December 2017.
If threshold performance is achieved, 25% of the number of shares shown will vest.
T he face value of the award is calculated as the maximum number of shares that would vest if all performance measures and targets are met, multiplied by the mid-market closing price of an RSA ordinary share averaged over the five business days preceding the date of grant 7 April 2015, of 4.2588.
Clawback Policy A Clawback Policy was introduced in 2013 regarding variable remuneration and is reviewed annually, as set out in the Remuneration Policy on pages 84 and 86.
In summary, for awards issued in 2014 onwards, the Committee may reduce or forfeit awards that have yet to be paid or vest in the case of shares, to delay the payment or vesting date or to amend another form of award or benefit which has yet to be received malus adjustment.
For cash bonuses awarded for 2015 performance onwards, and long-term incentive awards granted from 2015 onwards, the Committee may also recover sums already paid to Executive Committee members if it considers it appropriate to do so clawback.
This can be applied during a two-year period after receipt in the case of cash bonuses or vesting in the case of long-term incentives.
The circumstances in which malus and clawback may apply are outlined in the table below: Malus adjustment Clawback Material financial misstatement of results for any financial year or the material Material financial loss of a business unit financial loss under-performance of a business unit that could have been as a result of circumstances that should reasonably risk-managed reasonably have been risk-managed by the individual Error or material misstatement leading to an overpayment Material error or financial misstatement of results which has resulted in an overpayment Employee misconduct, including regulatory or other breaches Gross or serious employee misconduct.

Directors shareholding audited Executive Directors shareholding RSA believes it is in shareholders interests for its executives to hold shares in the Company.
Under the guidelines applicable during 2015, executives are expected to retain vested shares arising from the Companys share plans, and so build up a minimum shareholding over a five-year period and maintain it thereafter.
No shares are to be sold until the holding level is reached, except where required to cover statutory deductions.
Unvested share awards and those otherwise subject to forfeiture are excluded when calculating an executives current shareholding level.
The table below shows the Executive Directors shareholding and their unvested scheme interests in the Companys incentive plans.
Stephen Hester joined RSA in February 2014 and continues to build up his shareholding to the target level shown below within the allotted five-year period.
Scott Egan joined RSA in October 2015 and will be granted share awards in 2016 as detailed on page 73 and page 81, and start to build his shareholding to the target level shown below.

Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2016 This section outlines decisions taken by the Committee in respect of the 2016 financial year, and how the Committee intends to implement the Directors Remuneration Policy during 2016.
RSA has a pay-for-performance culture, whereby remuneration is closely linked to the performance of both the business and the individual.
Executive Directors reward opportunity contains a balance of fixed and variable elements.
The Committees aim is that superior levels of remuneration will only be paid in return for delivering superior levels of performance.
The variable element is fully flexible such that no award is guaranteed.
The charts below show how much the Executive Directors could earn for the 2016 financial year based on the application of the Remuneration Policy detailed on pages 83 to 90.
Their remuneration potential changes according to varying levels of performance achievement.

T he below threshold scenario shows the minimum remuneration receivable.
It includes the value of base salary and pension for 2016, and the value of benefits based on the single total figure of remuneration for 2015.
No bonus is awarded and no LTIP vesting occurs.
T he on-target scenario shows the remuneration receivable with a bonus award at half of the maximum opportunity i. e. 80% of salary and LTIP vesting at 62.5% i. e. half-way between threshold 25% vesting and maximum 100% vesting.
The LTIP maximum award level is taken to be 230% of salary for the Group Chief Executive, and 200% of salary for the Group Chief Financial Officer.
The maximum scenario shows the remuneration receivable with both the Annual Bonus Plan and the LTIP paying out in full i. e. 160% of salary and 230% 200% of salary, respectively.
The remuneration structure is intended to promote the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The table below shows when each component of the Executive Directors remuneration package, as set out in the charts above, would be delivered to them once any performance conditions or other restrictions have ended as noted by the shading.
These each relate to the 2016 financial year and, in the case of long-term incentive performance share awards, for awards vesting in 2019.

How will incentives be aligned to the business strategy in 2016?

Its performance measures are aligned with the core priorities for focus in 2016.
The Executive Directors will be expected to deliver against stretching targets, which are geared towards making continued performance improvement.
They are targeted against the performance of the entire Group, taking into account their contribution thereto.
The Business Review Scorecard component includes capital strength metrics and strategic management actions required to deliver this stage of the turnaround.
The Personal Scorecard consists of SMART objectives, which are aligned to the areas of: financials, strategy, risk management, customer and people.
The bonus opportunity remains unchanged at 80% of salary for on-target achievement, rising to a maximum of 160% of salary.
Threshold performance represents 16% of salary i. e. 10% of the maximum opportunity.
Half of the total bonus will be awarded in cash where clawback can apply, the balance is deferred into shares for a three-year period where malus adjustment can apply.
The Committee will assess performance for 2016 once the financial year has ended, taking into account material risk factors.
All of the bonus targets are considered to be commercially sensitive because they signal the Groups forward plan for the year, and therefore they are not provided in this document.
Disclosure will be provided in the 2016 Directors Remuneration Report, to the extent that the targets do not remain commercially sensitive.
The table below sets out the structure of the Executive Directors bonus plan for 2016.

The plan directly supports the building of shareholder value by targeting Group underlying Return on Tangible Equity ROTE, relative Total Shareholder Return TSR and a Business Review Scorecard.
The Scorecard measures a range of indicators on an underlying basis, and includes: growth in Tangible Net Asset Value per Share TNAV, cumulative earnings, controllable expenses, attritional loss ratio and a range of capital strength metrics including the ratio of TNAV:NWP and Solvency II coverage ratio.
Strategic Report Directors and Corporate Governance Report Financial Statements Other Information Directors and Corporate Governance Report Directors Remuneration Report RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 81 For the 2016 grant, performance measures will be assessed against a performance period of 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018, taking into account underlying business performance and material risk factors.
To maintain an appropriate degree of stretch in the targets, the three-year average required for an on-target level of vesting on the Group underlying ROTE element is set higher up the 11-16% target range compared to the 2015-17 cycle.
This ensures account is taken of the turnaround progress made in the previous year.
Underlying ROTE is defined in the Key Performance Indicator section on page 22.
It will be measured on a simple average basis over the performance period.
The Business Review Scorecard will be evaluated using a performance framework whereby each metric will be reviewed against its target, together with any other aspects connected to the business turnaround and judgement in the round used by the Committee to determine the level of vesting.
Stephen Hesters maximum LTIP opportunity in the 2016 grant will reduce to 230% of salary at maximum vesting compared to earlier years, which is the usual level of award for the Group Chief Executive.
Scott Egans LTIP opportunity in 2016 will be 200% of salary at maximum vesting.
Executive Directors must retain all vested shares arising from this incentive plan for two years post-vesting except those sold to cover statutory deductions, and they are subject to the Groups Clawback Policy.
The table below summarises the LTIPs structure.

T he TSR index of comparators for this cycle includes: ACE, Admiral, Allianz, Aviva, Direct Line, Gjensidige Forsikring, Hiscox, Intact, Mapfre, QBE, Topdanmark, Tryg and Zurich.
Executive shareholding requirement The Group Chief Executives target shareholding requirement is maintained at 300% of salary.
The requirement for other Executive Directors remains at 150%.
Non-Executive Directors fees Under RSAs Articles, the Non-Executive Directors remuneration is determined by the Board, within limits set by shareholders.
The only exception is in respect of the Chairman, whose terms fall within the remit of the Group Remuneration Committee.
The Chairman and Board minus the Non-Executive Directors discharges its accountability for setting and managing NonExecutive Directors remuneration: it will do this when their contractual terms or fee structure are under consideration, which is typically once a year, as noted on pages 88 to 89.
The Committee reviewed the Chairmans fee in accordance with the Remuneration Policy, and did so referencing a range of information including market data on fees taken from the same peer groups used to benchmark the Executive Directors salaries, UK inflation figures and the average reviews applied elsewhere in the Group.
The Chairmans fee will remain unchanged at 400,000 per annum, effective 1 January 2016.
Future reviews will take place annually.
The table below shows the Non-Executive Director fee structure.
The Company reviewed the Non-Executive Directors fees during 2015 in accordance with the Remuneration Policy and the fees effective from 1 July 2013 will remain unchanged in 2016.
Fee structure From 1 July 2013 Base fee 60,000 Additional fee for chairing committees: Group Audit Committee 20,000 Group Remuneration Committee 20,000 Group Investment Committee 12,500 Board Risk Committee 20,000 Additional fee for Senior Independent Director 20,000 1 Additional committee fee 5,000 Note: 1.
