108 | Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2015 Governance The Companys policy is to provide remuneration packages that fairly reward the Executive Directors for the contribution they have made tothe business and to ensure that the packages are appropriately competitive to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and Senior Managers of the right calibre.
The policy is to align the directors interests with those of shareholders and to incentivise the directors to meet the Companys financial and strategic priorities by making a significant proportion of remuneration performance related.
The Companys strategic objectives are set out in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 73.
The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration policy outlined in the table below is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promoteexcessive risk-taking: Maximum opportunity Performance metrics Base salary increases will be applied in line with the outcome Individual and Company performances are considerations ofthereview.
In the normal course of events, increases in the base salaries will not exceed the average increasefor employees.

Notes to the Future Policy Table 1.
Performance measures and targets Shortand long-term performance measures have been selected by the Committee for 2015 16 in order to provide a direct connection to the Companys strategy by being linked to the key fundamental performance indicators as set out below: the Companys TPR Capital growth performance is measured against the performance of a relevant IPD index to reect the Companys operations: NAV targets are set by reference to internal forecasts to ensure focus on sustained asset growth: and the Companys TSR performance is measured against the performance of an appropriate comparative Index selected by the Committee to ensure superior shareholder returns.
The Committee regularly reviews the TSR and TPR Capital growth comparators to ensure that they remain appropriate the TPR comparator group was adjusted last year and the NAV targets are set following a robust budget setting process.
The targets for the annual bonus and the LTIP SMP for 2015 16 are set out in the Annual report on remuneration on page 96.
The Committee is of the opinion that given the commercial sensitivity around GPEs business, disclosing capital growth, NAV and individual targets for the Annual Bonus Plan in advance would not be in the best interests of shareholders or the Company.
Actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of performance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees All employees of GPE are entitled to base salary and benets on the same basis, with quantum of awards being set at levels commensurate with their role.

Discretion The Committee will operate the annual bonus LTIP and SMP awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan according to their respective rules and ancillary documents and in accordance with the Listing Rules where relevant.
The Committee retains discretion consistent with market practice, in a number of regards to the operation and administration of these plans as noted in the policy table and in the recruitment remuneration and payments for loss of ofce sections as relevant.
Any use of these discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual report onremuneration and may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultations with the Companys major shareholders.
In addition, the Committee has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or waitfor shareholder approval.

112 | Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2015 Governance Approach to recruitment remuneration The Committees approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract appropriate candidates to the role, and our principle is that the pay of any new recruit would be assessed following the same principles as for the directors and the policy previously summarised.
Executive Director recruitment Component Policy Base salary andbenets The salary level will be set taking into account relevant market data, the experience and skills of the individual, responsibilities of the individual and the salaries paid to similar roles in comparable companies in line with the currentprocess undertaken by the Committee when setting the salary levels for its existing directors.
Executive Directors shall be eligible to receive benets in line with the Companys benets policy as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Pension Executive Directors will be able to receive a pension contribution or receive a supplement in lieu of pension contributions in line with the Companys pension policy as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Executive Directors will be eligible to participate in the Annual Bonus Plan as set out in the remuneration policy table.
For Executive Directors joining part way through a year, awards would be pro-rated.
Different performance measures may be set initially for the annual bonus, taking into account the responsibilities of theindividual, and the point in the financial year that they joined.
Annual bonus The annual maximum potential opportunity under this plan is 200% of salary.
Long-term incentives Executive Directors will be eligible to participate in the Long-Term Incentive Plan set out in the remuneration policy table.
Awards may be granted up to the maximum opportunity allowable under plan rules at the Committees discretion of 200% of salary under the LTIP element of the plan and 100% of salary under theSMP element of the plan when the Executive invests a third of salary.
Share buyouts Awards may be granted to replace those forfeited by the Executive Director on taking up the appointment replacement awards where considered by the Committee to be appropriate.
The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards such that overall they are no more generous in terms ofquantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited.
Where the Company compensates new directors inthisway, it will seek to do so under the terms of the Companys existing variable remuneration arrangements, but maycompensate on terms that are more bespoke than the existing arrangements, including awards granted under Listing Rule 9.4.
2, where the Committee considers appropriate.
In such instances, the Company will disclose a full explanation of the detail and rationale for such recruitment related compensation.
In making such awards, the Committee will seek to take into account the nature including whether awards are cash or share based, vesting period and performance measures and or conditions for any remuneration forfeited by the individual in leaving a previous employer.
Where such awards had outstanding performance or service conditions which are not signicantly completed, the Company will generally impose equivalent conditions.
In exceptional cases, the Committee may relax those requirements where it considers this to be in the interest of theshareholders, for example through a significant discount to the face value of the replacement awards.
Relocation policies In instances where the new Executive Director is non-UK domiciled or needs to be relocated, the Company may provide one-off or ongoing compensation as part of the Executive Directors relocation benets to reect the cost of relocation for the Executive in cases where they are expected to spend significant time away from their country of domicile.
The level of the relocation package will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and may take into consideration any cost of living differences, housing allowance and or schooling.
Legacy arrangements Where an Executive Director is appointed from within the organisation, the normal policy of the Company is that any legacy arrangements would be honoured in line with the original terms and conditions on a prorata basis.
Similarly, if an Executive Director is appointed following the Companys acquisition or merger with another company, legacy terms and conditions on a prorata basis would be honoured.
Non-Executive Director recruitment Component Policy Fees Newly appointed Non-Executive Directors will be paid fees consistent with existing Non-Executive Directors.
Annual Report 2015 Great Portland Estates | 113 Directors remuneration report Service agreements and payments for loss of ofce The policy of the Company is to have service contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of one year.
Itis sometimes necessary when recruiting a new Executive Director to give a service contract with an initial term of up to 18 months in which case a 12 month notice period may be given no earlier than six months from the start date of the contract.
Non-Executive Directors who have letters of appointment, are subject to the provisions of the Articles of Association dealing with appointment and rotation every three years, however, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code they are subject to annual re-election and have a notice period of three months by either party.
They are not eligible for payment in lieu of notice or any other payment on termination.
The following table sets out the dates of each of the Executive Directors service agreements and their unexpired term, the dates of theNon-Executive Directors letters of appointment and the date on which the Non-Executive Director is next subject to reappointment orre-election.

The Companys policy on termination payments for Executive Directors is to consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant contractual terms, the circumstances of the termination and any applicable duty to mitigate.
It is the Committees policy not to reward poor performance.
The Committee will always seek to minimise the cost to the Company whilst seeking to reect the circumstances in place at the time.
The Committee will honour Executive Directors contractual entitlements.
Service contracts do not contain liquidated damages clauses.
If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case.
There are no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement.
There is no agreement between the Company and its directors or employees, providing for compensation for loss of ofce or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
The Company reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation : or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising on connection with the termination of an Executive Directors ofce or employment.
Base salary, benets and pension Toby Courtaulds compensation in lieu of notice payable at the Companys discretion is 12 months basic salary.
Compensation in lieu of notice to Nick Sanderson and Neil Thompson, payable at the Companys discretion, is 12months basic salary, pension allowance and the value of benets in kind provided in the previous year, or the actual provision of those benets.
