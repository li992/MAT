In this table the figures are reported in US dollar, the currency in which Mr Glasenberg received his salary in 2015.
The salary was payable in pounds sterling prior to 2014.
Therefore those figures have been translated into US dollar at the exchange rates used for the preparation of the financial statements in those years.
Mr Glasenbergs pension and other benefits are charged to the Group in Swiss Francs and these amounts are translated into US dollar on the same basis.
2 The CEO has requested not to be considered for these potential awards.
Percentage change in pay of Chief Executive Officer The UK Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013, provide for disclosure of percentage changes of the CEOs remuneration against the average percentage change for employees generally or an appropriate group of employees.
Given that the CEO has, since May 2011, waived any entitlement to any increase in salary and given that his only other unwaived benefits are those provided to all employees atthe Companys head office in Baar no such comparison has been made.
In the event the Executive Director receives anincrease in salary infuture then a suitable disclosure in respect of these regulations will beconsidered.
