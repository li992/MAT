2 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2015 The information provided in this section has been audited.
Single total figure of remuneration for each director The following tables have been prepared using the measures prescribed by The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
In accordance with the Regulations, the amounts shown in respect of pension accrual have been calculated by applying a factor of 20 to the increase in accrued pension, after adjusting for inflation, whilst the values shown for share awards vesting in the year have been calculated on the basis of the share price at the vesting date, which may not necessarily equate to the price at which the awards have been or may be exercised.
Mr Tilly received no additional remuneration on cessation of office.
Mr N Keen retired from the Board on 31 May 2014 and the remuneration shown above is in respect of his service to that date.
He received no additional remuneration on cessation of office.
Allowances and benefits include private health cover, fuel benefit and company car provision.
The company car allowance paid to executive directors 10,000 - 12,000 is also included in allowances and benefits.
Dividend is the accrued dividend paid on deferred bonuses which vested during the year.
Remuneration in respect of share awards is calculated by multiplying the number of shares vesting during the year by the mid-market closing price of the shares on the vesting date.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 89 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Corporate Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The link between pay and performance Annual bonus for the year ended 30 September 2015 The annual bonus for the year under review was based on performance against financial and risk measures: performance against each of these measures is then subject to individual scale factors according to performance against personal strategic objectives.
The performance for the year, and the resulting accrual levels, were as follows: Measure Weighting Outcome Award level Financial Adjusted operating profit 33.33% 134.7m 17% performance Future value Projected profits from lending and 33.33% Paragon Mortgages 28% of new investment activities in the year and lending 976.6m business projected residual cash flow from Idem Capital investments acquired portfolios 104.4m Paragon Bank lending 409.1m Five Arrows Leasing Group acquisition Risk The business having operated within 33.33% See below 24% the key risk tolerance levels agreed by the Board Totals 100.0% Bonus achieved for 2015 69% Of maximum under scheme, subject to individual performance scale factors of 0.5 to 1.5 times.
Financial performance Operating profit for the year exceeded the target level of 132.0 million and the consensus at 30 September 2015 of 134.5 million.
Cash generation from both the originated and acquired portfolios was also strong.
Tight control was maintained over costs, with the underlying cost:income ratio remaining broadly similar in the year.
The costs associated with the initial operations of Paragon Bank were favourable to those originally forecast.
Future value Buy-to-let volumes, at 1,326.6 million 976.6 million in Paragon Mortgages and 350.0 million in Paragon Bank, were in excess of the original target of 969.5 million, with margins broadly in line with target.
In addition to volumes completed during the year, the buy-to-let business ended the financial year with a pipeline of 713.7 million to support future growth in originations.
Acquisitions by Idem Capital, the Groups debt purchase division, were also above the target of 100.0 million at 104.4 million.
Cash flow from purchases continues to exceed the value at the point of underwriting, supporting the growth in the profit contribution by the division in 2015.
During the year a process took place leading to the announcement of the acquisition of Five Arrows Leasing Group, which was announced on 2 October 2015.
This diversifies the Groups operations and is expected to be immediately enhancing to earnings and return on capital following completion.
The enhanced diversification of the Groups funding sources, with the expansion of savings volumes, the granting of a public rating of the Groups corporate debt by Fitch, a further retail bond issue and the Groups first issuance in Euros since the credit crisis, provides the foundation for future sustainable growth.
PAGE 90 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Corporate Governance Annual Report & Accounts 2015 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Risk The Group has operated within the risk tolerance levels approved by the Board in respect of capital ratios, liquidity positions, the risk appetite for new business, the management of operational and regulatory risk and the development of plans to mitigate longer-term strategic risk.
During the year, complaint levels have been minimal, arrears levels remain below industry averages, funding sources have been further diversified, liquidity has remained comfortably in excess of policy limits and capital ratios remain highly prudent.
Target figures are not disclosed for the year ahead because the Committee believes that the disclosure of targeted margins, arrears levels, volumes, cash plans and financing assumptions is commercially sensitive.
The final level of each executive directors bonus is adjusted to reflect personal performance against strategic objectives related to each of the elements.
These individual performance scale factors are between 0.5 and 1.5 times, according to performance.
The Committees assessment of performance and delivery on objectives is noted in the Chairmans letter and the objectives for the year ended 30 September 2015 are detailed below: N S Terrington To deliver strategic leadership working within the parameters of the Groups risk appetite.

The Committee is satisfied that the level of bonus earned by each director reflects both the performance of the individual and the Group during the year.
PAGE 92 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Corporate Governance Annual Report & Accounts 2015 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Directors pensions The total amount charged to the profit and loss account of the Group in respect of pension provision for directors was 397,000 2014: 505,000.
Mr N S Terrington, Mr R J Woodman and Mr J A Heron were members of the Group defined benefit pension plan during the year.
Their entitlements under the Plan are shown below.
Director Description of entitlement Accumulated total accrued annual pension at 30 September 2015 2014 000 000 N S Terrington Entitled to 1 48.375th of final salary per year of service, payable from 174 170 age 60.

The pension accrual figure included in the single total figure of remuneration table represents the increase in the accrued pension, excluding the effect of CPI inflation, during the year multiplied by 20, in accordance with the methodology set out in the Regulations.
The entitlements shown above represent the weighted average of service years for which accrual was earned at 1 60 of final salary and those for which accrual was earned at 1 37.5.
The executive directors have each ceased pension accrual, as shown in the table above.
This was in return for a cash supplement calculated to equate to the cost of the Companys contributions towards future service benefits had each individual stayed within the Plan for his future service accrual.
These contributions in respect of further pension provision for each of the directors are shown as pension allowance in the single total figure of remuneration table.
Details of share-based awards Awards granted in December 2011 under the Groups PSP which vested during the year were subject to performance conditions measured over three financial years, comparing the Groups relative TSR performance against a comparator group of companies comprising the constituents of the FTSE-250 on the date of grant over the three years commencing on the date of grant.
The vesting percentage was then reviewed by the Committee against a financial underpin.
The Company was ranked above the upper quartile position, giving a 100% vesting percentage and the Committee determined that such level of vesting was consistent with the Companys financial performance.
Paragon Performance Share Plan Awards under this plan comprise a right to acquire shares in the Company for nil or nominal payment and will vest on the third anniversary of their grant to the extent that the applicable performance criteria have been satisfied.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 93 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Corporate Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The awards granted during the year were calculated so as to have a face value of 200% of salary, using the average closing mid-market price of the Companys shares on each of the five dealing days up to and including the day before the grant date.
Therefore the face value of the awards granted during the year being the number of shares in each case multiplied by 3.956, that being the average of the closing prices of the Companys shares at the end of each of the five dealing days ending on the day before the grant date were 905,000 for Mr Terrington, 570,000 for Mr Woodman and 482,000 for Mr Heron.
25% of the awards would vest for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
50% of these awards are subject to the TSR test, as above, and 50% are subject to an EPS test.
The EPS test provides that 25% of EPS tested awards will vest where EPS growth is equal to the increase in the retail price index plus a lower threshold, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for EPS growth equal to the increase in the retail price index plus an upper threshold or more.
In each case the testing period is the three financial years commencing with the year of grant.
For awards granted between February 2013 and December 2014 the lower threshold was 3% and the upper threshold 7%.
The thresholds applicable to grants to be made in the financial year ending 30 September 2016 will be announced at the time of grant.
The share prices at the exercise dates were 4.168 on 5 December 2014 and 4.247 on 13 February 2015.
The awards maturing during the year, granted on 21 December 2011, achieved 100% vesting after the application of the performance criteria.
PAGE 94 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Corporate Governance Annual Report & Accounts 2015 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Awards are exercisable from the date on which the Remuneration Committee determines the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied to the day before the tenth anniversary of the grant date.
Clawback provisions apply to awards granted under the PSP.
The provisions give the Committee scope to reduce awards that have been granted, but have not vested if appropriate, to zero in the event of a material misstatement of the Groups accounts or if the number of shares granted was based on any other kind of error that resulted in more shares being awarded than there should have been.
The provisions also enable the Committee to claw back amounts that have vested under the plan, in the event of a material misstatement, miscalculation as a result of an error or in the event of misconduct.
Clawback can be implemented at any time prior to the second anniversary of the vesting date.
Share option schemes Details of individual options held by the directors at 30 September 2014 and 30 September 2015 are: Award Date from Expiry Option N S Terrington R J Woodman J A Heron date which date price exercisable Number Number Number Awards outstanding at 30 September 2014 01 12 2004 01 12 2007 01 12 2014 555.34p 68,874 22,778 27,730 68,874 22,778 27,730 Awards exercised in the year: - - - Awards lapsing in the year: 01 12 2004 01 12 2007 01 12 2014 555.34p 68,874 22,778 27,730 At 30 September 2015 - - - Sharesave Plan Awards made under the Sharesave Plan are granted to directors on the same terms which are available to employees in general.
The Deferred Bonus Shares awarded during 2013 and thereafter can be exercised from the third anniversary of the award date until the day before the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
The face value of the awards granted during the year being the number of shares in each case multiplied by 3.956, that being the average of the closing prices of the Companys shares at the end of each of the five dealing days ending on the day before the grant date were 209,000 for Mr Terrington, 107,000 for Mr Woodman and 76,000 for Mr Heron.
Rights to further shares under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan are due to be granted in respect of the compulsory deferral of performance bonuses for the year ended 30 September 2015, shown in the single total figure of remuneration table above.
The number of shares to be awarded will be determined based on the average market price of the Companys shares on the five dealing days before the awards are granted.
The shares, less any clawback, which can be applied by the Remuneration Committee in certain circumstances, will be exercisable by the recipients from the third anniversary of the grant date, subject, in normal circumstances, to the recipient being employed by the Company at that time.
Clawback provisions apply to awards granted under the deferred bonus scheme.
