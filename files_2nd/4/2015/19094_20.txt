2 The following differences exist between the Companys policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors as set out above and its approach to the payment of employees generally: A lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity as a percentage of base salary may apply to employees other than the Executive Directors and certain senior executives.
Benefits offered to other employees generally comprise a car allowance where required for the role or to meet market norms.
Participation in the LTIP is limited to the Executive Directors and certain selected senior managers.
Other employees are eligible to participate in the Companys share plans, details of which are provided on page 62.
A lower level of pension rate applies to employees other than the Executive Directors and certain senior executives.
In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the various categories of roles.
They also reflect the fact that, in the case of the Executive Directors and senior executives, a greater emphasis tends to be placed on performance related pay.
3 The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflects the Committees belief that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging and aligned to the Groups strategy and the creation of shareholder value.
4 The adjusted earnings per share and comparative total shareholder return performance conditions applicable to the LTIP further details of which are provided on page 64 were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term returns to shareholders and the creation of shareholder value.
5 The Committee operates share plans in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC where relevant.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plans.
6 All employee share plans do not operate performance conditions.
7 The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
8 The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval.

Annual bonus The maximum bonus potential for the year ending 31 December 2016 will remain at 185% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 165% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
