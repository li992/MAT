Directors remuneration report As highlighted by the Chairman and Chief Executive in their annual Remuneration Committee statements on pages 12 to 16 of this Annual Report, the markets remained challenging in the year to 31 July 2015.
In this difficult Anne Quinn, CBE economic climate, the Group saw a decline in revenue of 2% but a Chair of the Remuneration Committee 5% increase in headline EPS.
Cash conversion remained strong at 95% and ROCE, which improved to 16%, remains well ahead of the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Against this backdrop, annual bonus payouts are between target and maximum but the TSR and EPS elements of 2012 LTIP awards lapsed in full following the end of the performance period on 31 July 2015.
The Groups cash conversion, however, warranted the full payout of that element of the annual bonus and a partial vesting of the LTIP.
The matching award under the CIP vested based on our sustained ROCE performance.

Existing grants or entitlements It is the Companys intention to honour all pre-existing commitments at the date of this report and to honour all future obligations entered into, consistent with the approved remuneration Policy in force at that time.
In the case of internal promotion to the Board, the Committee intends to honour any pre-existing commitments made prior to becoming a member of the Board, including where these differ from the approved remuneration Policy.
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting Annual bonus measures are selected to reflect the Companys short-term financial and non-financial priorities.
At its discretion, the Committee may vary these measures at the start of each financial year to maintain close alignment between executive incentives and the annual business plan.
The measures used in the Long-Term Incentive Plan are selected to reflect Smiths prevailing strategy.
For 2015 16 awards, the LTIP measures will continue to reinforce the four key drivers of value creation highlighted elsewhere in this Annual Report: revenue growth, operating margin which the Committee continues to advocate is best represented by EPS, cash conversion and ROCE.
Annual bonus and LTIP targets are reviewed annually, and take into account the Companys strategic plan, analyst forecasts for Smiths and its sector comparators and external expectations for Smiths key markets.
The Remuneration Committee sets targets that it considers to be challenging but attainable and aligned to the Companys business objectives over the short term, as reflected in the annual business plan, and longer term, consistent with the strategic plan.
On top of aligning strategy with incentives, targets are designed to ensure that participants are aligned with the interests of shareholders.
Difference in policy between executive director and other employees The reward policy for other senior employees is broadly consistent with that for executive directors, and the Company does not currently operate any incentive plans in which only executive directors participate.
The Remuneration Committee reviews each year the all-employee pay and incentive trends and takes these into account in setting executive director pay levels.
The principles of remuneration packages being market related, performance sensitive and driven by business needs are applied at all levels and geographies in the Group.

For the purposes of making such awards, but for no other reason, the Committee may avail itself of Listing Rule 9.4.
The Remuneration Committee may also make payments to cover reasonable expenses in recruitment and relocation, and any other miscellaneous expenses including but not limited to housing, tax and immigration support.

Any commitments made prior to an individuals promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Company may, where appropriate, seek to revise an individuals existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors and prevailing market best practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director external or internal, including details of any exceptional payments, will be disclosed in the RNS notification made at the time of appointment and in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year in which the recruitment occurred.
Non-executive directors In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on page 100.
Service contracts The Companys policy is that executive directors are normally employed on terms which include a one-year rolling period of notice and provision for the payment of a predetermined sum in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances but excluding circumstances where the Company is entitled to dismiss without compensation.
In addition to payment of basic salary, pension allowance and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the one-year notice period, the predetermined sum would include annual bonus and share awards only in respect of the period they have served, payable following the end of the relevant performance period and subject to the normal performance conditions.

A good leaver will typically remain eligible for a pro-rated annual bonus award to be paid after the end of the financial year and LTIP awards will typically vest at the normal vesting date to the extent that the associated performance conditions are met, but will normally be pro-rated on the basis of actual service within the performance period.
In cases of death or disability, individuals are automatically deemed to be good leavers under the plan rules of the LTIP.
All other good leavers will be defined at the discretion of the Committee on a case-by-case basis.
In the event of a change of control, LTIP awards will vest to the extent that each of the performance conditions is met based on the Committees assessment of performance over the performance period to the date of change of control.
For internal performance measures, the Committee may exercise its judgment in determining the outcome based on its assessment of whether or not the performance conditions would have been met to a greater or lesser extent at the end of the full performance period.
Awards will also normally bepro-rated to reflect the time that has elapsed between the grant of the award and the date of change of control.
The Committee retains discretion to vary these provisions on a case-by-case basis.
In connection with the termination of an executive directors contract, the Company may make a payment on account of accrued but untaken leave and may pay outplacement and legal fees for support provided to the individual.
External appointments Subject to the overriding requirements of the Company, the Committee allows executive directors to accept external appointments where it considers that such appointments will contribute to the directors breadth of knowledge and experience.
Directors are permitted to retain fees associated with such appointments.
Consideration of employment conditions The Committee always takes into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company.
We do not consult directly with employees regarding executive director pay.
Each year the Committee is provided with information on pay trends and ratios of the wider employee population across the Group.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee has actively consulted with major shareholders whenever there have been changes to the remuneration policy in a manner that is receptive to and respectful of shareholder views.

Advisers to the Committee During the year, the Committee received material assistance and advice from the Chief Executive, the HR Director who is also Secretary to the Committee, the Group Director of Reward, Kepler the Committees appointed independent remuneration adviser and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP.
The Company paid a total annual fee of 84,718 to Kepler in relation to remuneration advice to the Remuneration Committee during the year.

During FY2015, Kepler provided the Remuneration Committee with benchmarking analysis of executive and non-executive directors pay, information on market trends, drafting support for this and last years Directors remuneration report, and other relevant assistance on determining directors remuneration.
Kepler was reappointed by the Remuneration Committee via competitive tender in 2013.
Kepler is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and a signatory to its Code of Conduct.
Kepler does not provide any other material services to the Group, and the Committee is therefore satisfied that the advice provided by Kepler is objective and independent.

Main activities during the year During the year under review, the Committees main activities included: consideration of market trends and pay levels for executive directors and the Chairman: review of all senior executive salary and bonus payments: target setting for both the Annual Incentive Plan and Long-Term Incentive Plan: performance review of the executive directors against the targets for the financial year: determining remuneration arrangements for Mr Bowman and Mr Turner in relation to cessation of their employment: agreeing the packages and recruitment arrangements for Mr Reynolds Smith and Mr OShea: and other activities including consideration of the effectiveness of the incentive arrangements.
