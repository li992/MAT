They were briefed by the Chairman of the Board and spoke with the 20 May 2015 Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in order to understand specific factors affecting the Company.

was undertaken by Trust Associates in February 2015.
A noteworthy comment made by the consultant in their review was that their 2014 All Directors of the Company are non-executive and as such recommendations were based on comparisons with levels of there are: remuneration paid to directors of investment companies for no service contracts with the Company: company years ending between July 2012 and June 2013 and as no annual bonus or short-term incentives: disclosed in their Annual Reports and that, over the last year or so, there had been a growing tendency for boards to publish levels of no long-term incentive schemes: fees that they propose to pay directors for the year ahead, as well as no pension rights: those paid over the previous year.
Therefore, it was now possible to no options or similar performance incentives: and base their review on more current fee levels.
no expense allowance or other taxable benefits.
The conclusions of Trust Associates report were that: In accordance with Principle 8 of the AIC Code, the Remuneration Committee is tasked with ensuring that Directors remuneration: there has been a strong rise in investment company board remuneration generally since their previous review three years ago: reflects their duties, responsibility, experience, time commitment the effect of size continues to have a significant impact on the and position on the Board: level of remuneration and the Company is now one of the largest allows the Chairman, the Chairman of the Risk Committee and London-listed investment companies having grown from 1.06 Chairman of the Audit Committee to be remunerated in excess of billion market capitalisation at the time of 2012 review, to 1.6 the remaining board members to reflect their increased roles of billion at the time of the 2014 interim assessment, to 1.9 billion responsibility and accountability: at the time of the 2015 review : and includes remuneration for additional, specific corporate work the work load and time involved had increased since the last which shall be carefully considered and only become due and review driven not just by the increasing in size and complexity of payable on completion of that work: and the Company and its operations, but also regulatory changes such as the Company becoming a self-managed AIF.
H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2015 67 Section 7: Directors Remuneration Report continued Taking account of these factors and the remuneration paid to directors of investment companies of a similar size and with similar characteristics, Trust Associates recommended the following changes to remuneration for routine business: Directors fees to be increased to 38,500 for the 2015-16 year.
The Chairman of the Audit Committees fee to rise to 46,500 for the 2015-16 year, reflecting a 6,000 premium to the Directors fees for the role, inclusive of a 2,000 additional fee for the role of Senior Independent Director.
The Chairman of the Risk Committee to receive 42,000 for the 2015-16 year, a 4,000 premium to the Directors fees, to recognise the additional responsibility.
The Chairman of the Boards fee to rise to 64,000 for the 2015-16 year, reflecting a 66% premium to the Directors fees, in recognition not only of the considerably greater weight of responsibility but also his involvement in a number of meetings with shareholders and potential investors each year as well as hosting events on behalf of the Company.
In addition, Trust Associates re-affirmed that the current practice, pursuant to which each Director who also acts as a director of the two Luxembourg subsidiary company boards receives an additional 5,000 annually for such role, was appropriate and should therefore continue for the future.
It should be noted that the above fee recommendations relate to the role, and not to the individual who is currently performing the function.
This comment is made specifically in view of the expected change in roles, following the planned retirement of Mr G Picken and Mr J Hallam by no later than 30 June 2016, as communicated to shareholders in Section 6 Corporate Governance Statement.
For comparative purposes the table below sets out the Directors remuneration approved and actually paid for the year to 31 March 2015 as well Total fees Total Total fees proposed remuneration approved for year ending paid in year ended for year ended Director Role 31 March 2016 31 March 2015 31 March 2015 Mr G Picken Chairman 64,000 58,000 58,000 1 Mr J Hallam SID 46,500 42,000 42,000 2 Mrs S Evans Director 43,500 40,000 40,000 3 Mr I Russell Director 42,500 35,000 35,000 Mrs S Farnon Director 38,500 35,000 35,000 4 Mr F Nelson Director 38,500 29,167 35,000 Mr C Russell Director 38,500 35,000 35,000 TOTAL 312,000 274,167 280,000 1.
The figures proposed and paid for Mr J Hallam are based on his Chair of the Audit Committee and as SID.
The figures proposed and paid for Mrs S Evans include an additional 5,000 for work in connection with the two Luxembourg subsidiaries.
The figure for Mr I Russell is based on his Chair of the Risk Committee established in 2014.
The figure for Mr F Nelson for the year ended 31 March 2015 is based on 35,000 pro-rated for the 10-month period from 1 June 2014 to 31 March 2015.
See comment above regarding fee recommendations being based on the role performed, not on the individual per se.
In the instance where a Director resigns from his her position during the year, the successor would be entitled to the same fee level albeit on a pro rata basis to reflect the proportion of the year in service.
As in previous years, should the Company require Directors to work on specific corporate actions such as further equity raising other than scrip dividend alternative or tap issues, or should a Director undertake incremental work such as that currently undertaken by Mrs S Evans in relation to the Luxembourg subsidiaries, then this is remunerated appropriately as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
In the year to 31 March 2015, apart from the 5,000 to Mrs S Evans as noted above, no additional fees were paid.
Finally, the committee considered and then approved that if and when the Senior Independent Director is not also the Chairman of the Audit Committee, then the Senior Independent Director should receive an additional 2,000 p. a. for performing this role.
The effect of the above recommendation for the year ending 31 March 2016 is to increase aggregate Directors fees including the subsidiary company fee to a level which is approximately 0.0159% of the Companys market capitalisation as at 31 March 2015.
Trust Associates confirmed that, in percentage terms, this is towards the low end of the range of investment companies.
68 H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2015 Trust Associates also remarked that generally fees should be increased by a moderate amount each year, rather than being held steady for a few years, with the need to then increase them sharply to bring them back into line.
A further recommendation was that the Remuneration Committee should review how the sector is developing each year, including a review of the fees paid in the sector by competitors, and make decisions on fee levels in light of then-current information.
The Remuneration Committee, through the Board, will report to shareholders in the Annual Report, and seek their approval at the Annual General Meeting, in respect of proposed future rises.
A remuneration payment or payment for loss of office can only be made to a current or former Director with approval of the Remuneration Committee, subject to the Companys Articles unless approved by a separate shareholder resolution.
The total fees paid to Directors in the year were within the annual fee cap of 350,000, which was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 23 July 2013.
The Remuneration Committee is now proposing an increase to the annual fee cap to 450,000 effective from the beginning of the Companys financial year on 1 April 2015.
This higher cap is considered desirable to permit the implementation of Trust Associates recommendations, as set out above, including the moderate adjustments that may be necessary for subsequent years and to provide contingency for any additional fees associated with non-routine business.
Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in the current financial year The Remuneration Committee has considered the recommendations of the independent consultant and recommended them to the Board.
The Board has approved the proposed increase and the change to the annual fee cap, and is seeking shareholder approval for the Directors Remuneration Policy at the AGM on 21 July 2015 with a view to implementing it back-dated to 1 April 2015.
