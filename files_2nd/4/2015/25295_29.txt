Cash profit provides a link between income generation for shareholders and employee compensation, ensuring that excessive awards to employees are not made and that any awards that are made are affordable on a cash basis.
Management information is provided to the Executive Committee and Remuneration Committee on performance to ensure that financial results are put into the context of wider performance and risk appetite.
The AAP is calculated as a cumulative average of 30% of cash profit from the year ending 31 March 2012 until the year ending 31 March 2016, after which it is calculated as a five year rolling average.
The 30% cap may be exceeded in any year as long as, over a five year period, on average the AAP does not exceed 30% of cash profit.
A further adjustment is made to cash profit to reflect the remuneration cost of our in house fund distribution team.
This team can significantly reduce the cost of external placement agent fees.
The AAP is increased by the amount of this adjustment and the variable pay of all employees including the fund distribution team is awarded out of the expanded AAP.
Once the AAP has been determined, it is then distributed based on an individuals contribution and performance as determined by the annual appraisal process.
DIFFERENCE IN REMUNERATION POLICY FOR ALL EMPLOYEES All employees of ICG are entitled to base salary, benefits and, in most locations, pension.
The variable compensation mix for all employees is drawn from the Annual Award Pool and is allocated according to the framework below, by reference to role, responsibility and performance.

PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION OF DIRECTOR UNDERTAKING THE ROLE OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE The table below details how changes to the CEOs pay compare with the change in the average pay across all employees of the Group.
Each figure is a percentage change of the values between the previous financial year and the financial year under review.
The total permanent workforce has been selected as the comparator for salaries and fees and short term incentives.
The comparison of the increase in taxable benefits has been made for UK permanent employees only as their remuneration packages are most similar to that of the Chief Executive.
Salaries and fees Taxable benefits Short term incentives Chief Executive Officer 2.5% - 93.27% - 17.56% All employees 3.88% - 68.29% - 37.25% The reduction in the average short term incentives for all employees is largely a reflection of the changing underlying profile of ICGs workforce, as we move into new products and businesses and continue building our business infrastructure.

For 2015 16, the Annual Award Pool will be calculated as a percentage of cash profits which, over a period of five years, will not exceed 30% on average.
The Annual Award Pool will be calculated as described in the Directors remuneration policy.
All incentives excluding TPC and similar arrangements in respect of business acquisitions or ICG direct investment funds that do not give rise to a cost or liability to the Group payable to employees of the Group will be funded out of the Annual Award Pool.
The Managing Directors annual bonus and other incentives will be dependent on them achieving the objectives set for them in the following areas: Fundraising and growth Investment performance Risk management measures Financial performance Where applicable, the long term targets for these objectives will be consistent with those set out on page 90.
Where targets are not already stated, the Board considers that these are commercially sensitive at this point in time.
Awards made from June 2015 will be subject to both Malus and Clawback which will apply for two years post vesting.
Although Awards made to Managing Directors are made from the AAP, which is derived from realised gains, the Board felt it appropriate to increase accountability and shareholder alignment by introducing these provisions.
Forfeiture of compensation may be triggered by, amongst other things, a misstatement of the accounts, fraud, regulatory breaches and serious breaches of contract.
