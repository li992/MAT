Directors remuneration report Annual report on remuneration Remuneration policy There are no changes proposed to remuneration policy for 2016 from that approved by shareholders at the AGM on 14 May 2015.
For reference the policy is set out in full on pages 75 to 80.
Application of remuneration policy for 2016 Changes to base salaries for executive directors The base salary of the CFO is not being increased in 2016.
His salary last increased on 1 January 2014.
In respect of his role of interim CEO, Ian will receive an acting up allowance equivalent to 240,000 per annum pro-rated to reflect the months or part-months he fulfils the interim CEO role giving him an effective annualised salary as shown below.
2016 2015 % change Ian McHoul as CFO 530,000 530,000 n c Ian McHoul as interim CEO 770,000 n a n a Samir Brikho up to date of leaving 954,000 954,000 n c Annual bonus measures and targets The following bonus measures and their weightings maximum opportunity as a percentage of base salary have been agreed by the committee for 2016.
The measures for 2016 have been changed from 2015 to reflect the challenging environment in which we are currently operating and our evolving strategic priorities in this context.
The cash debt measure replaces the previous operating cash measure and has been given a significantly increased weighting to reflect the greater focus that this is being given as part of our strategic priorities for the next 12 months.
The largest part of the bonus continues to be based on EBITA reflecting the importance of a continued focus on profitability.
For the period he is fulfilling the interim CEO role Ian McHouls bonus will be at the higher maximum of 150% of base salary and will be based on his interim CEO salary.
Samir Brikho has not been included in the 2016 bonus plan.
Measure Acting CEO role CFO role EBITA 75% 62.5% Cash debt 37.5% 31.25% Other strategic objectives 37.5% 31.25% Totals 150% 125% The specific targets against these measures are commercially sensitive and may be subject to revision.
They will be disclosed retrospectively in next years report to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time.
Long-term incentive awards Awards with a face value equivalent to 250% of base salary are being made to Ian McHoul in 2016 in line with previous years.
For this purpose, base salary will not include the temporary acting up allowance.
30% of the award will be subject to a comparative TSR measure, 30% to an EPS performance measure and 40% to a strategic scorecard measure.
For each measure, 25% of that part of the award is paid for threshold achievement and 100% for maximum achievement with straight-line vesting in between.
TSR will be measured against a peer group comprising Amec Foster Wheeler and UK and international companies against which Amec Foster Wheeler competes directly.
The comparator group is the same as for the 2015 awards as described on page 71 with the exception that Akastor has been removed because its business mix was considered by the committee to be less relevant and has been replaced by Tecnicas Reunidas, a Spanish competitor.
Threshold vesting occurs at median ranking and maximum at upper quartile ranking or higher.
The EPS target range will be 67.8 pence per share in 2018 for threshold vesting and 73.8 pence per share for maximum vesting.
The targets have been set to reflect both expectations for the macro market environment, particularly for oil & gas, and our internal projections which point to a continuing downturn in 2016 but which incentivise growth thereafter.
In line with policy, the targets and actual EPS will be adjusted to reflect any corporate transactions and certain other defined items.
The strategic scorecard measure will relate to the implementation and execution of our strategy.
The exact nature of these measures and targets will be finalised following the recruitment of our new CEO.
This is to ensure that they have an opportunity to input into the chosen measures so that they are fully aligned with our strategy going forwards.
It is likely that such measures will focus on reshaping the portfolio, growing the core activity and driving efficiency and will be distinct from the short-term targets for annual bonus.
The committee intends to consult with shareholders regarding the chosen measures and details of these measures and targets will be disclosed in next years report.

Amec Foster Wheeler Annual report and accounts 2015 69 Additional information Financials Governance Strategic report Remuneration continued Directors remuneration report continued Annual report on remuneration continued Annual bonus The bonus targets and outcomes against the various performance elements, together with the proportion of overall bonus opportunity that related to each, were as follows: Measure Target range Actual Weighting EBITA 422-475m 374m 60% Cash conversion 72 85% 85% 10% Cost synergies 25-40m 40m 10% Use of High Value Execution Centre HVEC 18 21% 21% 10% Embedding new company values and behaviours n a n a 10% For bonus purposes EBITA after exceptional items which may be disallowed for bonus purposes at the committees discretion is normalised for exchange rate movements and cost of share-based payments: the target and actual figures shown above are before any such adjustments.
The target for the Use of HVEC measure was based on the percentage of addressable man-hours for company as a whole executed through the HVEC.
In the light of overall performance, the committee has determined that no annual bonus payments will be made to executive directors in respect of 2015 notwithstanding that some of the targets that were set at the start of the year, principally those relating to the successful integration of the two legacy businesses, were achieved.
Performance Share Plan The LTIP amount shown in the 2015 single total figure of remuneration is the award made under the Performance Share Plan in 2013.
Vesting is due to take place on 28 March 2016 and is subject to two performance conditions each measured over three-year periods: i earnings per share EPS growth for 2015 compared to a base of 85.7p being the adjusted EPS for 2012 and ii total shareholder return TSR relative to a comparator group based on average share prices in final quarter of 2015 compared to those in the corresponding period in 2012.
The two performance conditions operate independently on different parts of the award: half of the basic award is dependent on EPS and the other half on TSR: the matched award depends solely on EPS.
EPS for this measure means the diluted earnings per share expressed to one decimal place of Amec Foster Wheeler plc before goodwill and intangible amortisation, the charge or credits associated with executive share awards and exceptional items.
Real growth means in excess of the change in the UK Retail Prices Index for December 2015 compared to December 2012.
The performance achieved against the EPS target and the TSR outcome are as follows: 2011 awards performance measure Threshold 25% vesting Maximum 100% vesting Outcome Percentage of max achieved Real annual compound growth in EPS 5% 12% 5% 0% Total shareholder return ranking Median Upper quartile 19th out of 25 0% Accordingly no shares will vest from these awards.
Details of share awards during year Awards over a value of 250% of base salary were made on 22 May 2015 under the new Long-Term Incentive Plan approved at the 2015 AGM.
The face value of the awards is based on the share price at the date of award which was 9.38.
Awards in the form of nil-cost options may normally be exercised up to 18 months after vesting.
Face value Percentage vesting at Type of interest awarded 000 threshold performance Number of shares End of performance period Samir Brikho Nil-cost options 2,385 25% 254,264 31 December 2017 Ian McHoul Nil-cost options 1,325 25% 141,257 31 December 2017 The awards granted to Samir Brikho lapsed when he left the Company.
The award granted to Mr McHoul will vest in March 2018 subject to the outcome against the performance conditions measured over the three years 2015 to 2017 and will then be subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period in line with policy.
Half of the award is subject to a TSR performance condition and the other half is subject to an EPS performance condition.
The TSR measure is based on Amec Foster Wheelers ranking against the comparator group set out below based on the average share price over the final quarter of 2017 compared to the corresponding period in 2014.
The threshold for any vesting to occur is that Amec Foster Wheeler needs to be ranked at median or higher.
If upper quartile ranking is achieved, full vesting will occur.
Vesting is on a straight-line basis between these threshold and maximum targets.

The EPS measure is based on the compound annual growth CAGR to 2017 from an adjusted 2014 base of 76.6p which is the pro forma figure if the Foster Wheeler acquisition had been in place for the full year.
EPS for this purpose is defined as the diluted earnings per share expressed to one decimal place of Amec Foster Wheeler plc before goodwill and intangible amortisation, the charge or credits associated with executive share awards and exceptional items at the committees discretion.
Threshold 25% vesting will occur if CAGR is 5% and maximum 100% vesting will occur if CAGR is 10% or higher with straight-line vesting for a result between these targets.
The number of shares vesting as determined by the performance conditions outcomes will be increased to take account of reinvested dividends including the UK tax credit in the period between award and vesting.
Details of the specific companies included in the TSR comparator groups for both the 2013 and 2014 awards were included in the directors remuneration reports for those years and may be obtained on request from the Company Secretary.
Payments to former directors No payments including payments for loss of office were made to former directors during 2015.

The balance of the bonus is normally paid as a cash allowance following the end of the year to which the payment relates.
However, to facilitate higher levels of executive share ownership, the bonus may, at the directors option and subject to the committees agreement, be in the form of nil-cost options over company shares of equivalent value instead of cash payment.

Additionally, awards are subject to a provision that allows the committee to reduce vesting in the event of a materially adverse misstatement of results for any year of the performance period, to correct errors or for personal misconduct.
The number of shares vesting from these awards is increased to take account of reinvested dividends.
The committee will determine the applicable EPS range for each set of awards, with 25% of the relevant portion of the awards vesting if the bottom of the range is achieved and 100% if the top is achieved, with straight-line vesting between.

The committee, at its discretion, may reduce or eliminate the portion of the LTIP determined by reference to relative TSR if it is not satisfied with the underlying financial performance of the business during the performance period.
The committee may amend the performance conditions if an event happens which the committee considers to be of a genuine, exceptional nature so that amended performance condition s would be a fairer measure of performance and would be materially neither easier nor more difficult to satisfy.
In the event of a change of control and in the absence of an exchange of awards being agreed, awards will normally vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been met at that time.

Selection of performance targets Financial performance targets under the annual bonus plan are set so that the target level of bonus is paid normally for achieving the Companys short-range plan.
To achieve maximum bonus, higher targets have to be met.
In determining targets, the committee takes account of the general business circumstances including the perceived difficulty inherent in the short-range plan and the need to balance stretch against risk.
Profit is chosen as the most appropriate measure of the Companys short-term performance and the cash measures are chosen to reflect the conversion of profit to cash across the year.
Strategic targets are set to reflect other key business objectives during the year.
EPS targets under the Long-Term Incentive Plan are set to reflect the Companys longer-term growth objectives at a level where the maximum represents genuine outperformance against expectations.
EPS is chosen as the most appropriate measure of absolute growth in line with the Companys strategy.
TSR is chosen to measure relative long-term performance against a peer group comprising UK and international companies against which Amec Foster Wheeler competes directly.
Other strategic targets may be set to reflect other key business objectives during the particular three-year cycle.

Amec Foster Wheeler 78 Annual report and accounts 2015 Remuneration policy continued Policy on notice and payment for loss of office Newly appointed executive directors will be employed on contracts that include the following provisions: X the individual will be required to give six months notice if they wish to leave and the Company will give up to 12 months notice of termination other than for gross misconduct or other circumstances where employment may be terminated without notice X at the Companys discretion, the individual may be placed on garden leave for some or all of the period between the giving of notice and termination in which case the Company will continue to pay salary and benefits for the garden leave period but will not make new share or other incentive awards X at any time, at the Companys discretion, employment may be terminated before the end of the required notice period by making a payment in lieu of the balance and subject to mitigation as described more fully in the table below In the event of long-term incapacity, employment would not normally be terminated so long as the executive was entitled to payments under the Companys group income protection insurance arrangements but the executive would be required to stand down from their role and as a director.
Payment for loss of office will be determined according to the following principles set out below and, for the current executive directors, having regard to their existing contractual terms as described following the table.
Notice The executive will receive base salary, pension and other benefits for any part of the notice period worked and any period of garden leave.
On termination, the executive will be entitled to payment for any accrued but untaken holiday pay.
The Company may elect to pay a sum in lieu of notice for all or any part of the notice period, calculated by reference to the value of salary, pension and other contractual benefits excluding bonus.
In determining the payments to be made and the structure of such payments, the Company will have regard to the executives ability to mitigate their loss.
In respect of any defined benefit pension rights, an augmentation of benefits for the relevant part of the notice period may be made.
The committee has discretion to continue to provide certain benefits to the end of the notice period rather than including them in the payment in lieu.
Where the employment is being terminated by the Company for gross misconduct or other circumstances entitling the Company to treat the contract as at an immediate end termination will be immediate and no payment in lieu of notice will be made.
Annual bonus No bonus will be paid in the event of termination for gross misconduct.
In all other circumstances, the committee will consider whether it is appropriate to make a bonus payment for the year in question taking into account all relevant circumstances, including performance and conduct.
Payment will usually be determined and paid in cash at the normal time.
Deferred bonus In the event of termination due to misconduct by the individual, the Remuneration Committee may determine that some or all, from prior years at its discretion, of the deferred shares will be forfeit.
In the case of death the shares will be released in full to the estate as soon as practicable thereafter.
In other circumstances, they will continue to be subject to the deferral period and only released at the end of it providing no further claw-back applies.
Long-Term All unvested awards will lapse on leaving in the event of termination for gross misconduct or other bad leaver circumstances.
Incentive Plan An example of a bad leaver would be an individual resigning in order to take up a position with a competitor.
Awards will immediately vest in full in the event of death.
In other cases, unvested awards will be pro-rated for service, which may include any period for which payment was made in lieu.
For pre-2015 awards, provided the associated investment shares remain lodged, matched awards will normally be retained in full unless the committee decide to pro-rate for service.
A further reduction may be made at the committees discretion to take account of relevant circumstances at the time of leaving.
The retained awards will vest in the normal way, taking account of the relevant performance conditions, and at the normal time subject to the committee being satisfied at that time that the individual remains a good leaver.
Other Redundancy pay in line with statutory provisions or those applying to employees generally in the country in which the director is based will be provided in the event of termination due to redundancy.
The cost of legal, tax or other advice incurred by the individual in connection with the termination and or support with seeking alternative employment may be met up to a maximum of 100,000.
Additional payments may be made where required to settle legal disputes or as consideration for new or amended post-employment restrictions.
Where an individual is in receipt of relocation or expatriation benefits, the costs of actual expenses incurred in relation to any arrangements that are subject to term contracts may continue to be reimbursed for up to six months or, at the Companys discretion, a one-off payment made to cover the costs of premature cancellation.
The cost of repatriation will also be covered where this was part of the original expatriation terms.
Sharesave options lapse unless the director leaves because of specified good leaver reasons in which case they can be exercised for a limited period, to the extent of savings made to the date of exercise.
Amec Foster Wheeler Annual report and accounts 2015 79 Additional information Financials Governance Strategic report Remuneration continued Directors remuneration report continued Remuneration policy continued Samir Brikho and Ian McHoul are both employed under contracts dated April 2007 and September 2008 respectively with notice periods of twelve months from the Company and which require them to give six months notice of resignation.
The contracts permit for payment to be made in lieu of all or part of the required notice period at the Companys discretion but there is no prescribed methodology for calculating such payment in lieu or applying mitigation.
Should circumstances arise where notice is given and the executive is not required to work all or part of the notice period, the terms of the existing contracts would be honoured.
The individuals may be placed on garden leave for part of the notice period in which case the committee may determine that it is appropriate to pay an element of bonus for that garden leave period.
Existing directors service contracts The notice provisions for Samir Brikho and Ian McHoul are described above.
There are no specified change-of-control provisions.
The Chairmans engagement may be terminated on six months notice on either side.
The contracts of non-executive directors may be terminated by the individual at any time.
There are no specific provisions for compensation in the event of early termination by the Company.
Our practice is that all directors submit themselves for re-election on an annual basis, in line with the recommendations in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in company and shareholder views Our approach to the annual review of base salaries is to take account of personal performance, company performance, and pay levels more broadly within the Company.
External benchmarking is also taken into account, particularly for new appointments.
Any proposals to change remuneration policy are considered against the best practice guidelines produced by shareholder bodies and major shareholders are consulted directly when formulating any proposals for significant changes.
The Chairman of the Company and the chairman of the remuneration committee make themselves available at any time and also at each annual general meeting to discuss any issues raised.
Differences in policy for directors compared to other employees The structure of remuneration for executive directors is in line with other senior management.
The primary differences compared to other employees are the structure of variable pay, which for senior management is in the form of performance-related incentives and for other employees is largely in the form of overtime and allowances reflecting the different emphases of the roles, and in the level of accrual under defined benefit arrangements.
Illustrations of application of policy The total remuneration for each of the executive directors that could result from the proposed remuneration policy in 2015 under three different performance levels is shown below.
