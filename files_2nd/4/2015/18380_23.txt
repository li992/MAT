We have done this, within the parameters of Pages 10 and 11 of this Annual Report and Accounts set out our already adopted policy.
The Committee has decided Electrocomponents strategy, which is based on seven key to increase to 12 months the length of time Executive priorities.
Our success in delivering this strategy is in turn Directors will be required to hold their shares following measured by four key performance indicators KPIs : sales LTIP vesting, with effect from the award being made in growth, return on sales, return on capital employed, and free June 2015.
We have also agreed to introduce clawback on cash flow as a percentage of sales.

In considering these matters we have ensured we have adhered to our policies for loss of office We have developed our strategy to deliver long-term growth and recruitment respectively.
Our short and long-term incentives link directly to the KPIs we believe will deliver that strategy.
Other matters which we have discussed during the year The measurement benchmarks are linked to the strategy under review are set out in the table on page 79.
KPIs, and our LTIP combines measures of both absolute and relative performance.
The requirement to defer one-third of Shareholder engagement during the year any bonus earned, and the use of LTIP performance shares, I would like to thank shareholders for their support for also serve to emphasise long-term value creation through both our remuneration policy and our Annual Report on direct linkage to the share price.

com Stock Code: ECM 68 23671-04 11 June 2015 3:03 PM Proof 4 Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report Directors remuneration policy This section of the Report sets out the remuneration policy for Executive and Non-Executive Directors, which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and came into effect on 24 July 2014.
The section is unchanged from what was presented in last years report and approved by shareholders, other than to clarify our policy on forfeiture which was not included in the section on LTIP last year and to update the performance scenario charts on page 73 to reflect the new Group Chief Executives package.
Executive Director remuneration policy table This policy has been designed to support the principal objective of enabling the Company to attract, motivate and retain the people it needs to maximise the value of the business.
Component: Base salary Objective To provide broadly market median levels of fixed pay over the longer term, with increases reflecting Company and individual performance.
Operation Generally reviewed each year, with increases effective 1 June with reference to salary levels at other FTSE 250 companies of broadly similar size, sector and international scope to Electrocomponents.
The Committee also considers the salary increases applying across the rest of the UK business when determining increases.
Opportunity Salaries in respect of the year under review and for the following year are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Base salary increases are applied in line with the outcome of the annual review.
Factors that are considered include: increases for other employees, changes in role and responsibilities, market levels, and individual and Company performance.
In circumstances where an Executive Directors salary is already consistent with policy, salary increases will not normally be materially different to those given to other senior managers in the Group.
Component: Pension Objective To provide a level of retirement benefit that is competitive in the relevant market.
Operation Existing Directors, who previously participated in the Defined Benefit section of the Electrocomponents Group Pension Scheme Scheme, now receive cash in lieu reflecting the prior arrangement on a cost neutral basis to the Company.
The Defined Benefit section of the Scheme is now closed to new entrants.
Opportunity For current Executive Directors 1 Group Chief Executive: 30% of base salary Group Finance Director: 43.5% of base salary For future external hires, the level of pension contribution will be determined in the 1 context of market norms.
Base salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable.
The new Group Chief Executive receives cash in lieu of pension contributions of 20% of base salary as set out on page 87.
Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2015 69 23671-04 11 June 2015 3:03 PM Proof 4 Directors Remuneration Report Directors remuneration policy continued Component: Benefits Objective Provision of benefits in line with the market.
Operation Executive Directors are provided with a company car or a cash allowance in lieu thereof, mobile phone, fuel allowance and medical insurance.
Other benefits may be introduced from time to time to ensure the benefits package is appropriately competitive and reflects the circumstances of the individual Director.
Opportunity None of the existing Executive Directors received total taxable benefits exceeding 10% of salary during any of the last three financial years, and it is not anticipated that the cost of benefits provided will exceed this level in the financial years over which this policy will apply.
The Committee retains the discretion to approve a higher cost in exceptional circumstances for example, relocation expenses or expatriation allowance or in circumstances where factors outside the Companys control have changed materially e. g. market increases in insurance costs.
Benefits in respect of the year under review are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Component: Annual bonus Objective To focus Executive Directors on achieving demanding annual targets relating to Company performance.
Operation Performance targets are set at the start of the year and aligned with the annual budget agreed by the Board.
At the end of the year, the Remuneration Committee determines the extent to which these targets have been achieved.
For threshold performance, the bonus payout will normally be nil, but in no circumstances will exceed 10% of the maximum opportunity.
Two-thirds of the total bonus payment is paid in cash.
One-third of the total bonus payment is converted into Electrocomponents shares under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
These shares vest after two years, subject to continued employment and forfeiture in instances of misconduct or misstatement.
Opportunity Maximum opportunity: 150% of base salary Target opportunity: 75% of base salary Performance measures Sales growth Profit before tax and reorganisation costs PBTR Cash flow The weightings for these performance conditions are agreed by the Committee at the start of each year, according to annual business priorities.
No one element will be weighted less than 15%, or more than 50% of the total opportunity.
The Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic bonus outcomes including down to zero to ensure alignment of pay with performance and fairness to shareholders and participants.
Any such discretion will be within the limits of the scheme, and will be fully disclosed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
Further details, including the performance targets attached to the bonus for the year under review, are given on page 81 of the Annual Report on Remuneration.
com Stock Code: ECM 70 23671-04 11 June 2015 3:03 PM Proof 4 Corporate Governance Component: LTIP Objective To incentivise Executive Directors and senior managers to deliver long-term performance by aligning their performance with shareholders interests, and to reflect best practice.
Operation A conditional award of shares Award is made annually.
The LTIP performance period is three years.
The Award is subject both to a performance condition and, normally, to continued employment with the Group until the determination of the performance condition.
Threshold performance results in nil vesting.
Additionally, for the Award to vest the Committee must be satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance.
The Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic LTIP outcomes to ensure the pay outcome is aligned with value creation for shareholders and that the outcome is a fair reflection of the Companys performance.
The Committee has discretion to determine that awards that havent vested are forfeitable in certain circumstances which currently include misconduct and misstatement.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of the relevant performance period, awards lapse.
1 There will be a further holding period of at least six months following vesting.
Opportunity Maximum opportunity: 150% of basic salary In normal circumstances, however, the Committee would grant awards with a value below this level.
Details of actual LTIP awards in respect of each year will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
A payment equivalent to the dividends that would have accrued on the number of shares that vest will be made to participants on vesting.
Performance measures Vesting of one-half of the Awards made to Executive Directors is dependent upon Electrocomponents three-year total shareholder return TSR percentage outperformance of a benchmark.
Vesting of the other half of the Award is conditional on growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS.
Further details, including the performance targets attached to the LTIP in respect of each year, will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
For the forthcoming LTIP award, it has been agreed that the holding period will be 12 months.
Component: Save As You Earn SAYE Objective To encourage the ownership of Electrocomponents plc shares.
Operation An HMRC approved scheme where employees including Executive Directors may save an agreed amount up to the individual monthly limit set by HMRC from time to time over three or five years.
Options are normally granted at a discount of up to 20%.
Opportunity Savings are capped at an agreed amount up to the individual monthly limit set by HMRC from time to time.
Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2015 71 23671-04 11 June 2015 3:03 PM Proof 4 Directors Remuneration Report Directors remuneration policy continued Component: Share ownership Objective To align Executive Director and shareholder interests and reinforce long-term decision-making.
Operation Executive Directors are expected to retain at least 50% of any share awards that vest net of tax in order to help build up the following required personal holdings of Electrocomponents plc shares: Group Chief Executive: 200% of salary Group Finance Director: 100% of salary Only shares that are held beneficially count in the assessment of whether an Executive Director has met the required ownership level.
Notes to the policy table Payments from previous awards The Company will honour any commitment entered into, and Executive Directors will be eligible to receive payment from any award made, prior to the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this Report, i. e. before 24 July 2014.
Details of these awards are, and will be, disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting The annual bonus performance measures have been selected to directly reinforce our medium-term performance framework of 1 higher sales growth, 2 improved profitability, and 3 strong free cash flow see pages 10 and 11 for further details of our strategy.
The LTIP vests based on three-year TSR outperformance of the FTSE 250 index and achievement of three-year EPS growth targets.
The Committee selected TSR and EPS as performance measures because it felt this would provide a good balance between external and internal measures of performance, as well as absolute and relative performance.
TSR aligns performance with shareholders interests.
EPS is a measure of the profitability of the Company that also reflects management performance, and is a measure used by investors in deciding whether to invest in the Company.
EPS is measured on a fully diluted basis, as shown in the Groups financial statements, as this provides an independently verifiable measure of performance.
Targets applying to the bonus and LTIP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points.
Bonus targets are aligned with the annual budget agreed by the Board.
LTIP targets reflect industry context, expectations of what will constitute appropriately challenging performance levels, and factors specific to the Company.
Differences from remuneration policy for other employees The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as described above.
Annual salary reviews across the Group take into account Company performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in comparable companies.
All executives and senior managers are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes.
Opportunities and performance measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individuals role.
Other members of the Group Executive Committee participate in the DSBP and LTIP on similar terms as the Executive Directors, although award sizes may vary.
Below this level, senior managers are eligible to participate in the LTIP.
Grants are based on personal performance and vest after three years subject to continued employment.
All UK-based employees are eligible to participate in the Companys HMRC approved savings-related share scheme on identical terms.
Employees based outside the UK are eligible to participate in a cash-based alternative on similar terms.

For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for the year ended 31 March 2015.
It should be noted that any awards granted under the DSBP do not normally vest until the second anniversary of the date of grant, and LTIP awards do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant.
This illustration is intended to show the relationship between executive pay and performance.
Please note, however, that actual pay delivered will be further influenced by changes in the Companys share price and dividends paid.
Valuation assumptions The Minimum scenario reflects base salary, pension and benefits i. e. fixed remuneration, being the only elements of the Executive Directors remuneration package not linked to performance.
Pension contributions are 20% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 43.5% for the Group Finance Director.
The On-Target scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target bonus payout 75% of salary and LTIP threshold vesting at 0% of the maximum award level.
The Maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus full payout under all incentives 150% of salary under the annual bonus, and 150% and 80% of salary under the LTIP for the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, respectively.
The value of the LTIP assumes no increase in the underlying value of the shares.
Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2015 73 23671-04 11 June 2015 3:03 PM Proof 4 Directors Remuneration Report Directors remuneration policy continued Approach to Executive Director recruitment remuneration External appointment In cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director from outside the Company, the Remuneration Committee may make use of all existing components of remuneration, as follows: Approach to Executive Director recruitment remuneration Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and the current salary of the incumbent.
Where a new appointee has an initial base salary set below market, the Committee may make abovemarket phased increases over a period of two or three years, subject to the individuals development and performance in the role.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may include but are not limited to the provision of a company car or car allowance, medical insurance, company mobile phone, expatriation allowances and any necessary expenses relating to an executives relocation.
Pension New appointees will receive pension contributions into a defined contribution pension arrangement or an equivalent cash supplement, or a combination of both.
SAYE New appointees will be eligible to participate on identical terms to all other employees.
Annual bonus The bonus structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees.
The maximum opportunity will be 150% of salary, pro-rated in the year of joining to reflect the proportion of that year employed.
One-third of any bonus earned will be deferred into the DSBP on the same terms as other Executive Directors.
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP with a face value of up to 150% of salary per annum.
Other features of the Awards will be as described in the policy table.
In determining the appropriate remuneration structure and level for the appointee, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of our shareholders.
The Committee may also need to make an award of shares or cash payment in respect of a new appointment to buy-out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, over and above the approach and award limits outlined in the table above, availing itself of Listing Rule 9.4.
In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to the awards being bought out, and the likelihood of those conditions being met.
Any such buy-out will have a fair value no greater than the fair value of the awards forfeited, and details will be fully disclosed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
Internal promotion to the Board In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the policy will be consistent with that for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to Executive Director level, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements even if there are instances where they would not otherwise be consistent with the prevailing Executive Director remuneration policy at the time of promotion.
Service contracts and policy for payment for loss of office Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee.
Executive Directors have service agreements that operate on a 12-month rolling basis.
In line with the Committees policy, these service agreements provide for 12 months notice by the Company and by the Executive Directors.
The Company entered into an updated service agreement with Ian Mason on 1 March 2001.
This agreement replaced all prior arrangements and was amended on 24 March 2014.
The Company entered into a service agreement with Simon Boddie on 25 May 2005, and with Lindsley Ruth on 26 February 2015.
Copies of Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.
com Stock Code: ECM 74 23671-04 11 June 2015 3:03 PM Proof 4 Corporate Governance The Committees policy for directors termination payments is to provide only what would normally be due to Directors had they remained in employment in respect of the relevant notice period, and not to go beyond their normal contractual entitlements.
Any incentive arrangements will be dealt with subject to the relevant rules, with any discretion exercised by the Committee on a case-by-case basis taking into account the circumstances of the termination.
Termination payments will also take into account any statutory entitlement at the appropriate level, to be considered by the Committee on the same basis.
The Committee will monitor and where appropriate enforce the Directors duty to mitigate loss.
When the Committee believes that it is essential to protect the Companys interests, additional arrangements may be entered into for example, post-termination protections above and beyond those in the contract of employment on appropriate terms.
Simon Boddie and Lindsley Ruths service agreements provide for base salary in lieu of notice.
Ian Masons service agreement provides for base salary and contractual benefits in lieu of notice.
The table below summarises how awards under the annual bonus and LTIP are typically treated in specific circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the Committees discretion: Reason for cessation Calculation of vesting payment Timing of vesting Annual bonus Termination with cause No bonus paid.

External appointments Executive Directors are permitted to take up one non-executive position on the board of another company, subject to the prior approval of the Board.
The Executive Director may retain any fees payable in relation to such an appointment.
Details of external appointments and the associated fees received are included in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
com Stock Code: ECM 76 23671-04 11 June 2015 3:03 PM Proof 4 Corporate Governance Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Group seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodies including trade unions and works councils as part of its broader employee engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The Committee is mindful of the increases applying across the rest of the business in relevant markets when considering salaries for Executive Directors, but does not currently consult with employees specifically on executive remuneration policy and framework.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee considers shareholder views received during the year and at the AGM each year, as well as guidance from shareholder representative bodies more broadly, in shaping remuneration policy.
The vast majority of shareholders continue to express support of remuneration arrangements at Electrocomponents.
The Committee keeps the remuneration policy under regular review, to ensure it continues to reinforce the Groups long-term strategy, and aligns Executive Directors with shareholders interests.
We will consult shareholders before making any significant changes to our remuneration policy.
Non-Executive Director remuneration policy Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements, but are engaged on the basis of a letter of appointment providing for an initial three-year term.
The Chairmans letter of appointment provides a six-month notice period and for the Non-Executive Directors, a three-month notice period.
In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code guidelines, all Directors are subject to re-election annually at the AGM.
It is the policy of the Board that Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys bonus, long-term incentive or pension plans.
Details of the policy on fees paid to our Non-Executive Directors are set out in the table below: Component: Fees Objective To attract and retain Non-Executive Directors of the highest calibre with broad commercial experience relevant to the Group.
Operation The fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board of Directors as a whole.
Additional fees are payable for acting as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, and to the Senior Independent Director.
Fee levels are reviewed every two years, with any adjustments effective 1 April.
Fees are reviewed by taking into account external advice on best practice and fee levels at other FTSE 250 companies of broadly similar size, sector and international scope to Electrocomponents.
Time commitment and responsibility are also taken into account when reviewing fees.
Opportunity Aggregate ordinary fees for Directors are limited to 600,000 by the Companys Articles of Association.
The fees paid to Non-Executive Directors in respect of the year under review and for the following year are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
measures Approach to Non-Executive Director recruitment remuneration In recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will use the policy as set out in the table above.
A base fee in line with the prevailing fee schedule would be payable for serving as a Non-Executive Director, with additional fees payable for acting as Senior Independent Director, and Chairman of the Audit or Remuneration Committees.

Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board.
Its responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference which can be found on the Companys website at www.
The task of the Committee is to consider the remuneration packages needed to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and other senior employees and to ensure that they are compensated appropriately for their contributions to the Groups performance.
The Committee also considers the remuneration of the Company Chairman.

The Non-Executive Directors fees were increased from the beginning of the year under review from 45,000 to 50,000 per annum.

2012 LTIP awards vesting In July 2012, LTIP awards of 276,975 and 138,488 shares were granted to Ian Mason and Simon Boddie respectively.
Vesting of these awards was based 50% on Electrocomponents EPS growth and 50% on Electrocomponents relative TSR outperformance of the FTSE 250 index over the three financial years ended 31 March 2015.

However, as their pension benefits are greater than or equal to the lifetime allowance, they elected to opt out of the Scheme with effect from 5 April 2012, and receive a cash supplement in lieu of pension no greater than the cost of pension benefits previously provided.
The single cash supplement, which replaced all historic cash supplements and pension benefits, will be paid until the earlier of i the date employment with the Company terminates and ii the date the Executive Director reaches age 60 the normal retirement age.
The Committee recognises that the level of pension contribution is above market norms for FTSE 250 companies of similar size.
However, these levels of cash supplement reflect legacy defined benefit arrangements from which the Executive Directors opted out.
The cash supplement rates for the current Executive Directors are summarised in the policy table on page 69, and the cash supplement paid during the year under review is captured in the single figure for total remuneration on page 80.
The accrued defined benefit pensions of the Executive Directors at 31 March 2015 were as follows, including revaluation from the date they opted out of the Scheme: Ian Mason: 56,360 p. a. Simon Boddie: 29,376 p. a.
These pensions are payable from age 60 their normal retirement age under the Scheme.
If the Directors leave service before age 60, they may elect to start receiving their pension at any time between age 55 and age 60, in which case the pension will be actuarially reduced to reflect the longer period for which it is expected to be paid.
Payments to past Directors audited No payments were made to past Directors during the year under review.
Ian Mason remained a Director for the full year under review and his arrangements are therefore set out below.
Payments for loss of office audited In November 2014 it was announced that Ian Mason would be standing down as Group Chief Executive and as a Director of the Company with effect from 31 March 2015.
The payments below were agreed and paid as Ian remained fully committed to the Company in accordance with certain agreed criteria until he left on 31 March 2015.
In line with the provisions of his service contract and with the Companys remuneration policy, Ian is being paid a years salary 590,000, and the annual cash value of his contractual benefits comprising 177,000 in respect of pension contributions, and the remainder 25,596 for medical insurance, life assurance, car allowance and fuel allowance.
The value of the contractual benefits is equivalent to their value on the open market.
These payments are being made in the financial year ending 31 March 2016.
Ians contract, which was put in place in 2001, contains no provision for mitigation.
Despite this, it has been agreed that Ians entitlement to contractual benefits will be paid monthly and will be subject to mitigation.
In addition, the Company has paid 62,500 for outplacement services provided to Ian, together with an amount of 10,000 for legal services.
Both these payments were made in the year under review directly by the Company to the supplier.
These payments were agreed consistent with policy in consideration for Ian agreeing to post-termination protections above and beyond those in his service agreement.
The Committee has exercised its discretion, in accordance with the rules of the relevant plans and the Companys remuneration policy, to permit Ian to retain his LTIP and DSBP share awards shown on page 89.
These will vest in accordance with the usual leaver provisions of the plans that is, at the normal vesting date, subject to prorating to the date he ceased employment with the Company and, in the case of the LTIP awards, subject to the achievement of the performance conditions attached to each award.
Ian will receive 3,844 shares in June 2015 and 21,615 shares in July 2016 under the DSBP, and a maximum of 188,564 shares in July 2016 and 72,842 shares in July 2017 under the LTIP, less, in all cases, any shares sold to cover tax.

The fee payable for this appointment is 65,000 per annum.
In June 2014, Ian Mason became a Non-Executive Director at QinetiQ Group plc, for which he receives a fee of 43,000 per annum.
During the year he received 35,392 in total.
Both Executive Directors are permitted to retain the fees relating to these appointments.
Percentage change in remuneration for the Group Chief Executive The table below shows the percentage change in the annual cash remuneration of the Group Chief Executive comprising base salary, the value of taxable benefits and earned annual bonus, as disclosed in the single figure of remuneration table on page 80 from the prior year compared with the average percentage change for the 291 members of our Global Management Team GMT.
This group is considered more representative of the geographical footprint of the Company than a UK comparator group, and similarity of remuneration structures facilitates a more meaningful comparison than considering all employees as a whole.
The difference in percentage change in the Group Chief Executives annual bonus and total cash remuneration compared with that of other senior employees reflects differences in annual bonus design: the annual bonus for the Group Chief Executive is based 100% on financial performance, whereas for the GMT it comprises an element based on personal performance and contribution.

It is the Committees policy to align Executive Director base salaries with the market over time, and therefore the Committee approved a base salary increase of 1.7% for Simon Boddie from 393,832 to 400,527 with effect from 1 June 2015.
A salary increase averaging 2.2% across the Group was awarded at the annual pay review, effective 1 June 2015.
From 1 April 2015, when he joined the Company, Lindsley Ruth will earn a base salary of 550,000 per annum.
Pension For 2016, Simon Boddie will continue to receive a cash supplement in lieu of pension worth 43.5% of base salary.
Lindsley Ruth will receive a cash supplement in lieu of pension worth 20% of base salary.
Performance-related annual bonus The annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors will remain unchanged for the 2016 financial year.
The bonus outcome for Executive Directors will continue to be based on Group PBTR, Group sales growth and Group cash flow.
One-third of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares for a further two years under the DSBP.
Annual bonus targets are considered to be commercially sensitive and will not be disclosed in advance, but will be disclosed retrospectively in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the relevant year.
LTIP Lindsley Ruth will receive an award with a face value of 825,000 150% of his base salary, and Simon Boddie will receive an award with a face value of 315,066 80% of his base salary.
As in the year under review, awards will again vest 50% on three-year EPS growth and 50% on three-year relative TSR percentage outperformance of the FTSE 250 index performance targets remain unchanged and are as set out on page 83.
The Committee has decided this year to increase the post-vesting holding period from six to twelve months.
In addition, the Committee has decided that the awards should be forfeitable following vesting in certain circumstances.
Further details of these awards will be disclosed in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
SAYE Executive Directors will be able to participate in any SAYE contract offered to all employees, on identical terms.
Additional payments to Lindsley Ruth following recruitment Following the announcement of the Groups results for the year under review, Lindsley will be granted a conditional award a Recruitment Award over 513,784 shares in the Company.
The undertaking to make a Recruitment Award facilitated the recruitment of Lindsley as the Companys Group Chief Executive with effect from 1 April 2015.
The Recruitment Award is to compensate Lindsley for the value of remuneration forfeited by him upon leaving his previous employment to join the Company, and the value of the award was determined in accordance with the Companys approved Directors remuneration policy.
In determining the value of the arrangements forfeited, the Committee noted that there were no performance conditions attaching to the forfeited arrangements.
It considers that the fair value of the Recruitment Award will be no greater than the fair value of the arrangements forfeited by Lindsley.
The Recruitment Award will be made on broadly the same terms as the awards made under the Companys LTIP which was approved by shareholders on 24 July 2014, except that it will not be subject to performance conditions and a maximum of 50% of the award will vest on each of 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018 subject, in normal circumstances, to continued service and to the Committee being satisfied that the remuneration arrangements being replaced have been forfeited.
The Recruitment Award will not be subject to any other conditions and will not attract entitlements to dividend equivalents.
The Recruitment Award will normally lapse if Lindsley leaves the Group, except where he leaves due to a sale of the business, in which case it may continue in the normal course or vest immediately and may be pro-rated for service.
Once the Recruitment Award is made, certain terms cannot be changed to the advantage of the participant without prior approval of shareholders other than certain minor amendments.
The Recruitment Award is not pensionable and is not transferable.
No new issue shares or treasury shares will be used to satisfy the Recruitment Award.
