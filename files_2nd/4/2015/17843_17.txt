Governance | Remuneration report | 74 REMUNERATION REPORT Annual statement by the Remuneration Committee Chairman Dear fellow shareholders 2014 15 performance and incentive outcomes As you know, our range of activities is broad and our portfolio of businesses diverse.
We aim to achieve strong and sustainable positions and have a focus on the longer-term growth of the Company.
As referred to in my Chairmans statement, the two major challenges facing the group have been food commodity deflation and substantial movements in currency markets.
Against this background, earnings per share has seen a slight decrease.
This year no changes have been made to our remuneration policy, which is re-presented on the following pages for reference but is not subject to a shareholder vote.
The committee has dedicated time in two meetings in 2014 15 to considering whether incentive outcomes are a fair reflection of performance.
The conclusions that we reached are outlined below.
Short Term Incentive Plan STIP Operating results this year were significantly affected by lower sugar prices and the negative translation impact of currency movements, both factors being outside the control of management.
However, having regard to the fact that previous performance has benefited from higher sugar prices, and that the STIP has always been measured against profits translated into sterling at actual average foreign exchange rates for the year rather than at constant currency, the committee concluded that the incentive payout of 49.44% on the financial element of the STIP was a fair reflection of the performance outcome.
The original STIP targets were increased for the additional profit made by businesses acquired during the year, in line with our normal policy for acquisitions.
As previously disclosed, in November 2012, the committee reduced vesting on the 200912 Long Term Incentive Plan from 100% to 97.42% to reflect an asset impairment charge relating to the Australian meat business, Don KRC.
Continuing property development deals relating to the Don KRC site, which are not included in the annual operating profit calculation, mean that the committee now feels it is appropriate to return to the executive directors the balance of the value which was reduced in 2012.
A partial repayment was made in 2014 and the remaining balance due of 23,963 for George Weston and 16,073 for John Bason will be paid this year.
No further payments will be made in respect of this previous reduction in vesting as the aggregate outcome is now as it would have been had no impairment charge been taken.
For 2015 16 there has been no change in the setting of our STIP financial targets which are based on a performance range around budget for both the profit measure and the working capital measure.
The reasons for adoption of these financial metrics are detailed in the policy report on page 88.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP In the Chairmans statement I have noted a strong performance despite currency and commodity challenges, and that we expect currency pressures to lead to a modest decline in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings for the group for the coming year.
In view of this and having regard to the adjusted earnings per share adjusted eps performance in 2014 15, the level of growth required to achieve the performance targets on existing awards vesting in 2016 and 2017 is now extremely challenging.
The committee made no discretionary changes to the targets already set.
However, recognising that the shape of the group has changed greatly in recent years, and in view of the fact that the LTIP is designed to motivate and retain some 150 senior managers across the group, the committee has decided that it would be appropriate to undertake a complete review of the groups incentive arrangements over the course of the next year.
If this review concludes that changes are required, the committee will present a revised executive remuneration policy to investors at the 2016 AGM, one year earlier than originally anticipated.
If approved by shareholders, any changes to policy will become effective in the 2016 17 financial year.
As part of this review, we will be seeking input from our major shareholders in May June 2016.
In setting the targets for the 2015 18 LTIP, the committee has taken into account the outlook for a modest decline in adjusted eps in the 2016 financial year and the consequential implications of this for 2017.
Accordingly, the committee has decided that the LTIP targets will assume no growth for the first year of the 2015 18 LTIP.
Thereafter, the compound annual growth rates of 5% to achieve threshold, 8% to achieve target and 11% to achieve maximum will be applied.
We believe that this approach is appropriate and in the best interests of our shareholders.
Charles Sinclair Remuneration Committee Chairman Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Governance Governance | Remuneration report | 75 Remuneration policy The remuneration policy for executive directors has applied since it was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
The wording inthe policy, provided for reference below, is unchanged from that approved in 2014 except as necessary to update references andincrease clarity for the reader, for example, by changing dates and including current salary numbers in scenario charts.
For unvested share awards only, the provisions of the remuneration policy presented in the 2013 Remuneration report will continue toapply until such time as all long-term incentive awards granted under that policy have vested.
The committee reviews the approved remuneration policy annually to ensure that it remains aligned with the Companys strategicobjectives.
This year, the committee has determined that no changes should be made.
As outlined on the previous page, thecommittee expects to present a revised remuneration policy to investors for approval at the 2016 AGM and will discuss its proposalswith major shareholders before finalising the proposed policy.

Target setting Budget performance is set as the on-target performance level at the start of each financial year.
The committee sets a range around target to incentivise delivery of truly stretching performance.
Individual personal objectives are also set each year.
These may be specific short-term goals or milestones towards medium or long-term objectives, but are closely aligned to the overall strategy of the group.
Following the end of the financial year, the Chairman reviews the performance of the Chief Executive against these objectives and makes a recommendation to the Remuneration committee about theappropriate level of payout for the personal element.
Similarly, theChief Executive makes a recommendation to the Remuneration committee regarding the Finance Director following an assessment ofhis performance.
Discretion, clawback and malus In specific circumstances the Remuneration committee retains discretion, including in relation to malus and clawback, as set out inthe notes that follow this table.

A mandatory two-year holding period applies for any shares allocatedunder the LTIP from the 2014 AGM onwards.
Performance measures Group performance is measured against an absolute range of compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share eps.
This measure was chosen because it: reflects the groups objective of sustained long-term earningsgrowth: is a measure which is well understood both by participants andshareholders: is a published figure with limited adjustments: and encompasses the diverse nature of the group.
An absolute, rather than a relative measure is used, as the group is aglobal business for which UK inflation factors are of limited impact.
Other financial measures have been considered, but found to be unhelpful or inappropriate.
Target setting Targets are set by the committee at the beginning of each three-year performance period, taking into account the state of the markets in which the group operates as well as the scale of investments made inthe pursuit of long-term growth.
In determining a fair but stretching target, the committee also considers: the results of the long-term incentive plan to date: market expectations and internal forecasts for the next few years: and advice from its appointed remuneration advisors.
Discretion, clawback and malus When the Company introduced the new LTIP, approved by shareholders in 2013, malus and clawback were introduced into the plan rules.
In specific circumstances the Remuneration committee retains discretion in relation to the plan.
Further information can befound in the notes to this table.

Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Governance Governance | Remuneration report | 79 Notes to the Remuneration policy table Target-setting and commercial sensitivity The committee selected the performance conditions shown in the preceding table because these are the key measures used by theexecutive directors to manage the business.
The performance targets are set by the committee annually taking into account theviews of their advisors and management.
The committee is of the opinion that performance targets for the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them before the start of the financial year.
Achievement against financial targets will be disclosed after the end of the relevant financial year in that years Remuneration report.
Discretion, malus and clawback The committee may, at any time within two years of the vesting date of an LTIP award under the new plan or payment of an STIP award, determine that clawback shall apply if the committee determines that performance outcomes were misstated: an erroneous calculation was made in assessing the extent to which performance targets were met: or the participant is found to have committed, at any time prior to vesting payment, including prior to grant, an act or omission which justifies, or, in the opinion of the Remuneration committee, would have justified, summary dismissal.
As a condition of participating in the STIP and LTIP from the 2014 15 financial year onwards, all participants have been required to agree that the committee may cause any STIP or LTIP award in which they participate to lapse in whole or in part and may operate clawback under any share scheme or bonus scheme in which they participate operated by a group company and may operate clawback by reducing any amounts payable to the participant and or by requiring the participant to immediately transfer shares orcashback to the Company.
The committee will apply discretion, where necessary and by exception, to ensure that there are no unintended consequences from the operation of the remuneration policy.
The committee has a robust set of principles that it applies to ensure that the outcome is consistent with business performance and aligned with shareholder interests.
Any material exercises of discretion by the committee in relation to the STIP and LTIP will be in line with scheme rules or other applicable contractual documentation and will be fully disclosed and explained in the relevant years report on the implementation of remuneration policy and will not exceed scheme maxima.
Remuneration for other employees compared with that of executive directors First line reports to the Chief Executive and other senior executives are rewarded broadly within the same overall remuneration policy asexecutive directors, in order to ensure fairness and common purpose across the group.
In general, other executives therefore participate in incentive arrangements similar to those of the executive directors, but with lower levels of potential payout.
The proportion of variable pay to base salary for first line executives is around 1.2 to 1 for on-target performance and 2.25 to 1 for maximum performance.
The Remuneration committee regularly reviews the reward package for other groups of senior executives below board level to ensure that they remain at a level sufficient to attract and retain high-calibre individuals.
Associated British Foods is geographically dispersed and therefore subject to very different pay markets, so it is difficult to make sensible comparisons with all employees across the group.
The salaries of executive directors are reviewed in line with UK employees ofthe group.
In December 2014, when the salary increase for employees in the UK was between 1.75% and3.0%, including a 3% increase in the minimum wage, the Chief Executive received a salary increase of 2.6%.
In order to drive and reward performance, and to align better the interests of executives and shareholders, the executive directors havea greater proportion of their total reward package at risk than other employees.
This means that in years of very good performance, the Chief Executives package increases proportionately more than that of most other employees and conversely inyears of lower performance it may decrease.
However, the structure and principles of incentives are consistent further down theorganisation including: the belief that employees should be encouraged to do the right thing for the long-term benefit and success of the organisation: the belief that individuals should have line of sight to their performance targets: and the belief in combining profit and return measures with personal measures in the STIP.
The committee operates share-based long-term incentives for approximately 150 senior individuals across the group.
Executive directors serving as non-executive directors To encourage self-development and allow external insight and practice, the committee has determined that, with the consent of the Chairman and the Chief Executive, executive directors may serve as non-executive directors of other companies in an individual capacity andwillretain any fees earned.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Governance | Remuneration report | 80 REMUNERATION REPORT Remuneration policy consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company How pay and conditions of employees were taken into account when setting directors remuneration policy The committee considered the salary increases proposed for the employee population generally and other changes to the remuneration policy within the Company when reviewing executive salaries at its September and October meetings.
As outlined inthe policy table, the committee typically limits the range of increases for executive directors to the range of increases available toemployees unless there has been a change of role.
The design of incentives is broadly consistent across the group.
The committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure for senior management in the two tiers below executive director and uses this information to work with the Company to ensure consistency of approach.
In addition, the committee approves all share-based LTIP awards across the group.
Consideration of employees views In setting the remuneration policy, the committee seeks to act in the best interests of the Company.
Whilst the views of employees are not explicitly sought, employees are able to feed back their opinions through employee opinion surveys or directly to the Companys management.
Remuneration policy executive director contracts, recruitment, retention and loss of office Recruitment arrangements all executive directors As we may need to recruit future executive directors from outside the UK or from companies with more aggressive incentive policies than our own, and as our long-term incentive plans do not give us significant headroom to make awards to new joiners above the levels set out in the policy table, the arrangements below are intended to give us the flexibility to recruit the right individuals should weneed to.

This may, for example, be necessary if recruiting an individual from overseas.
If possible, additional incentive awards will be tied to group performance targets.
Total maximum additional incentive value will not exceed 200% of salary.
Internal appointments For internal appointments, awards in respect of the prior role may be allowed to vest according to the terms of the scheme, adjustedas relevant to take account of the new appointment.
In addition, ongoing prior remuneration obligations may continue.
Relocation If a new executive director needs to relocate, the Company may pay: actual relocation costs and other reasonable expenses relating to moving house: disturbance allowance of up to 5% of salary, some of which may be tax-free for qualifying expenditure: school fees for dependent children where there are cultural or language considerations: medical costs for the overseas family, where relevant: one business class return fare per annum each for the executive, his her partner and dependent children in order to maintain familyor other links where an executive is recruited from outside the UK: reasonable fees and taxes for buying and or selling a family home and or appropriate rental costs: and any tax due, grossed up, on any relocation related payments listed above.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Governance Governance | Remuneration report | 81 Service contracts and payments for loss of office It is the Companys policy that executive directors have rolling contracts with 12-month notice periods.
This is in accordance with theUK Corporate Governance Code and contracts are available for inspection at the Companys offices.
Contracts and service agreements are not reissued when base salaries or fees are changed.
Pension arrangements for both the current executive directorshave been amended, as described in the policy table, without reissuing their contracts.
The executive directors service contracts allow for the Company to terminate the employment by paying the director in lieu of some or all of his notice period.
The Company may determine that a payment in lieu of notice is made in monthly instalments or as a lump sum.
A payment in lieu of notice will comprise the salary, benefits and pension provision that the director would otherwise have received during the relevant period.
The Company is committed to the principle of mitigation.
If the committee determines that a payment in lieu of notice will be paid in monthly payments, it would reduce the instalments to take account of amounts received fromalternative employment.
In addition, the executive director may be entitled to a payment in respect of his statutory rights.
The committee may also determine that a contribution will be made to the directors legal fees in connection with his termination and may agree to make reasonable payments to him in respect of outplacement.
In limited circumstances, in addition to making a full payment in lieu of notice, the Company may permit an executive director to stay employed after the announcement of his departure for a limited period to ensure aneffective hand-over and or to allow time for a successor to be appointed.
It would be open to the Company to consider terminating an executive directors service agreement in breach i. e. not to make a payment to him in lieu of notice and instead to make a payment of damages to him which compensates him for the loss he will suffer as a result of the termination of his contract, taking into account his duty to mitigate his loss.
There is no automatic entitlement to accrued STIP LTIP awards on termination: the approach to determining whether or not a payment might be made is set out in the table below.
Prorated STIP and LTIP awards will not usually take account of notice periods, but the committee retains the discretion to determine that they will.
The committee would not expect to do so in the case of poor performance.

The Senior Independent Director and chairman of the Audit committee are paid anadditional fee to reflect their extra responsibilities.
Fees, paid in cash on a quarterly basis, were last reviewed on 3 September 2014.
Non-executive directors terms of appointment It is the Companys policy that all non-executive directors are subject to specified terms of appointment.
Appointment is for an initial term of three years unless terminated by either party on six months notice.
Continuation of the contract of appointment is contingent on satisfactory performance and re-election at forthcoming annual general meetings.
Non-executive directors are typically expected to serve two three-year terms, although the board may invite a non-executive director to serve for an additional period.
The Companys Articles of Association require that all directors retire from office if they have not retired at either of the preceding two annual general meetings.
In any event, at this years annual general meeting, all directors are standing for election or re-election in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, except for Lord Jay who will retire on 30 November 2015.
Where an individual retires at the annual general meeting and does not stand for re-election, they are not paid in lieu of notice.
Approach to recruitment for non-executive directors The approach to fees outlined above would apply to new non-executive directors.
We would not pay to relocate a non-executive director to the head office location but would reimburse reasonable expenses incurred intravelling on behalf of the business.
In the first year, such expenses may be higher than usual as part of the individuals induction intothe business.
Remuneration policy statement of consideration of shareholders views Each year the chairman of the committee invites our larger institutional shareholders to discuss with him their views on the groups remuneration, strategy and governance.
Ahead of the 2014 AGM, we received feedback from some investors who did not feel that our earnings per share targets were sufficiently stretching.
The committee robustly reviews targets each year, with detailed input from our advisors and from the Company.
We have satisfied ourselves, in the context of the challenges facing the sugar business, that the targets that we set for theLTIP in 2013 and 2014 were extremely challenging and that delivering this level of performance would represent a very good performance by the executive directors on behalf of shareholders.
The Chairmans statement on page 74 sets out more information on our approach to setting LTIP targets for 2015-18.
In light of the changing scale and shape of the business, we are planning to review remuneration policy in 2015 16 and seek shareholder approval for this at the 2016 AGM.
The committee chairman remains happy to discuss any remuneration matters atanytime to help shape our policy and practice.
Annual report on directors remuneration The annual report on directors remuneration sets out the elements of remuneration paid to directors in respect of the financial year 2014 15.

The conclusion was that retrospective detail on financial targets set will notbe disclosed at this stage as it is, in the opinion of the committee, commercially sensitive.
During 2016, we will consider, as part of the wider review of our approach on incentives, what further transparency we can provide toshareholders without disadvantaging the business.
Following a review of personal performance against specific objectives for the 2014 15 financial year, the committee determined that George Weston will receive 14.93% of salary in relation to performance that was slightly ahead of target against set objectives, with performance improvements in our ingredients businesses and in Australia, ongoing continuous improvement in the sugar business, astrengthened balance sheet and continuing successful growth of Primark.
John Bason will receive 15.50% of base salary for the individual element of the annual bonus, reflecting overall performance that is ahead of target with most objectives having been attained, the review of auditors having been well managed and a good focus on investor relations during the year.
Personal objectives setfor each of the executive directors were closely aligned to the overall strategy of the group but will not be disclosed because of commercial sensitivity.
In addition to the above percentages, the committee has determined to increase the personal element of the incentive payment byafurther 23,963 for George Weston and 16,073 for John Bason in relation to a previous discretionary reduction in vesting of the 200912 LTIP to reflect an asset impairment charge in our Australian meat business.
In 2014, the committee returned to the executive directors some, but not all, of the previously reduced value to recognise the value delivered from property development deals relating to the site.
These deals have continued to recapture the impaired value for the business and its shareholders this year.
No further payment will be made in respect of this previous reduction in vesting as the aggregate outcome is now as it would have been had no impairment charge been taken.
Value reduced in 2012 Amount returned to Balance to be share price of 1442.65p executives in 2014 returned in 2015 George Weston 48,011 24,048 23,963 John Bason 32,243 16,170 16,073 Long-Term Incentive Plan 20122015 The performance measures for each three-year LTIP cycle are set by the committee.
Awards are made annually, at the discretion ofthe committee, and eligible executives receive shares at the end of the performance period, subject to achievement of the performance measures.
For the 20122015 cycle the threshold level of compound adjusted eps growth was 5% per annum with on target at 8% and maximum at 11%.
The adjusted eps range, adjusted for the impact of IAS 19, was 100.1p at threshold, 109.0p at target and118.5p at maximum.
In November 2015 executive directors will therefore receive 18.54% of the conditional shares allocated in 2012 George Weston will receive 24,575 shares and John Bason 16,168 shares.
No further deferralwill be applied to these shares, as they were granted before December 2014.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Governance Governance | Remuneration report | 85 Grant policy for share plans Conditional share awards are granted each year at the end of November, following announcement of the Companys results.
Inaddition, further awards are made, following approval by the committee, between the end of November and 1 June each year tonew starters or newly promoted individuals who are eligible to participate.
The share price used to determine the number of sharesin an allocation is the average of the closing share prices on the five trading days immediately preceding the award date.
All awards are settled using shares bought in the market.
Scheme interests awarded in 2014 15 audited information The table below details the conditional share interests awarded to the executive directors during the year.
The awards made were in line with ournormal policy and are subject to performance conditions over the vesting period.

The committee believes that the range is extremely stretching over the three-year performance period given sugar profitability and foreign exchange rates.
In setting this target, the committee took into account: the volatility present in many of the markets in which the group operates: the scale of investments made in the pursuit of long-term growth: the results of the long-term incentive to date: market expectations: internal forecasts for the next few years: and advice from their appointed remuneration advisors.
As outlined in the remuneration policy, there will be a further two-year holding period in place for these shares after vesting.

TSR performance and Chief Executives pay The performance graph below illustrates the performance of the Company over the past six years from September 2009 to September 2015, in terms of total shareholder return compared with that of the companies comprising the FTSE 100 index.
Thisindexhas been selected because it represents a cross-section of leading UK companies.
In addition, the table below the graph provides a six-year summary of the total remuneration of the Chief Executive over the same period showing a breakdown of each of the elements of variable pay within the total remuneration figure.
For the purpose of calculating the value of the remuneration of the Chief Executive, data has been collated on a basis consistent with the single figure methodology as defined in the applicable UK directors reporting regulations.
During the previous 12 months, the market value ranged from 2466p to 3284p.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Value of a hypothetical 100 investment Governance Governance | Remuneration report | 87 Percentage change in remuneration of the Chief Executive Between 2014 and 2015, the increase in the Chief Executives salary was 2.6% and the average increase in salaries for our UK employees was between 1.753%.
The total reward for the Chief Executive reduced by 59%, reflecting 18.54% vesting on the LTIP, reduced from 100% vesting in the previous year as well as a reduced STIP payment.
The overall increase in expenditure on reward for all of our employees was 3%.
These numbers are based on aggregate data presented on page 111 as it is very difficult, in a decentralised group of the Companys size, to separate the increase in expenditure on incentives and benefits.
Executive directors serving as non-executive director During the year, George Weston served as a non-executive director of Wittington Investments Limited, for which he received nocompensation.
John Bason is a non-executive director and chairman of the audit committee of Compass Group PLC, for which he received a feeof 105,875 in the 2014 15 financial year.
He also served as a trustee of Voluntary Service Overseas and as chairman of the charity FareShare, but received no compensation in respect of either of these roles.

Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Governance | Remuneration report | 88 REMUNERATION REPORT Long-Term Incentive Plan 201518 The LTIP will be operated in line with the remuneration policy and with the continuing Company grant policy see page 77.
Each year the committee reflects carefully on a number of Company and external data points and on feedback from our shareholders in setting the eps targets for the LTIP.
For 201518 we have taken into account the very significant impact of sugar pricing and foreign exchange movements on the expected profitability of a number of our divisions in 2015 16.
This means that in the first year of the LTIP we anticipate a reduction in adjusted eps compared with 2014 15, as reflected in the outlook paragraph of the Chairmans statement on page 5.
In setting the targets for the 201518 LTIP, the committee has taken into account the outlook for a modest decline in adjusted eps in the 2016 financial year and the consequential implications of this for 2017.
