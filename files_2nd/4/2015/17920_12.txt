indd 66 14 07 2015 10:45 Strategic report governance FinancialS berkeley AnnuAl report 2015 governAnce Berkeleys remuneration policy aims to encourage, reward and retain the Executives and ensure that their actions are aligned with the Companys strategy.
In particular, the emphasis on performance related pay aligns the Executives with the performance of the business which is coupled with long term incentives that lock in the Executive team for up to 10 years which is far longer than is typical in most publicly listed companies.
Incentive Outcomes in 2014 15 The key incentive outcomes from the performance this year are: A W Pidgley, R C Perrins, G J Fry, K Whiteman and S Ellis earned 100% of the maximum annual contribution under the Bonus Plan: 50% of the 2009 LTIP Part B awards vested during the year.
The exercise of these awards resulted in a significant increase in shareholding for A W Pidgley, R C Perrins, G J Fry, K Whiteman and S Ellis.
Operation of Policy in 2015 16 There are no material changes to the operation of the policy for 2015 16.
The Executive Directors have received salary increases for 2015 16 of approximately 3%, compared to average salary increases across the Group of 5.2%.
In addition 2015 16 will be the first year of operation of the new Bonus Plan which formed part of the Directors Remuneration Policy approved last year at the AGM on 1 September 2014.
The Committee is comfortable that its Directors Remuneration Policy is in line with the new UK Corporate Governance Code applying for financial years beginning on or after 1 October 2014.
We provide further details on page 72.
In conclusion The Directors Remuneration Policy was subject to a binding vote at the AGM in September 2014, and will last for a period of three years from that date or until another Policy is approved in a general meeting.
The Annual Report on Remuneration together with this letter will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the forthcoming AGM in September 2015.
Details of voting at last years Annual General Meeting, where 95.88% and 91.61% of those voting supported the resolutions to approve the Directors Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration respectively, are set out on page 83 of this report.
I look forward to receiving your support for the resolution seeking approval of the Annual Report on Remuneration at our forthcoming AGM.

Benefits and Pension: No changes are proposed benefits or pension in 2015 16.
Bonus Plan: The maximum bonus potentials for the year ending 30 April 2016 first year of operation of the new Bonus Plan approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM are set out below: Executive Director A W Pidgley R C Perrins R J Stearn G J Fry K Whiteman S Ellis Maximum Bonus % 300% 300% 200% 175% 200% 220% of salary The Committee has approved an increase in K Whitemans maximum bonus potential for 2015 16, from 175% to 200%, reflecting his performance and contribution to the business.
The bonus payable to each of the Group Chairman, Group Managing Director and Group Finance Director will be determined by reference to the Group performance conditions.
For the Divisional Directors, 50% of the potential bonus payable will be determined by reference to the Group performance condition and 50% by reference to the Divisional performance condition.
It is the view of the Committee that the disclosure of these targets in advance would provide the Companys competitors with an unfair advantage.
However the Committee may in the future provide retrospective disclosure to allow shareholders to judge the level of bonus actually earned against the relevant Divisions performance.
Long-term incentives: No changes are proposed to the Companys long-term incentive arrangements in 2015 16.

The following table sets out the key elements of the revised Code and how the Companys remuneration policy for Executive Directors is in line with the Governance Code: Code Provision Company Remuneration Policy Executive Directors remuneration The 2014 Bonus Plan provides a rolling deferral in shares and an ongoing performance based risk should be designed to promote the adjustment.

long-term success of the Company.
The 2011 LTIP performance period does not finish until 2021 providing a very long-term equity based incentive plan.
It is the Committees view that the 2014 Bonus Plan and 2011 LTIP together provide a holistic approach to ensuring Executive Directors are focused on the long-term success of the Company.
Incentive Schemes should include The 2014 Bonus Plan and new grants under the 2011 LTIP include best practice malus and clawback provisions that would enable the provisions.
The circumstances in which malus and clawback could apply are as follows: company to recover sums paid or discovery of a material misstatement resulting in an adjustment in the audited consolidated accounts withhold the payment of any sum, of the Company: and specify the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to the assessment of any performance target or condition in respect of an award was based on error, or do so.
inaccurate or misleading information: the discovery that any information used to determine the number of shares subject to an award was based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information: action or conduct of an award holder which, in the reasonable opinion of the Board, amounts to employee misbehaviour, fraud or gross misconduct: events or behaviour of an award holder have led to the censure of the Company by a regulatory authority or have had a significant detrimental impact on the reputation of any Group Company provided that the Board is satisfied that the relevant award holder was responsible for the censure or reputational damage and that the censure or reputational damage is attributable to him.
The 2014 Bonus Plan has a malus period finishing on the date of each payment under the Plan with a clawback period extending for a further three years following each payment.
The 2011 LTIP has a malus period extending to the end of the Plan period in 2021 with a clawback period extending for a further two years.
The Committee believes that the rules of the Plans provide sufficient powers to enforce malus and clawback if required.
The new malus and clawback provisions in the 2011 LTIP will only apply to grants where the grant or the commitment to make the grant is made after the Committee determined to amend the rules of the 2011 LTIP on 15 June 2015.
For share-based remuneration, the The policy contains the following relevant features: Remuneration Committee should Minimum shareholding requirement of 200% of salary for Executive Directors with the Executive consider requiring directors to hold Chairman having a 400% of salary requirement: a minimum number of shares and to hold shares for a further period The Committee believes that the long-term nature of both the 2014 Bonus Plan 6 years and 2011 after vesting or exercise, including LTIP 10 years means that there is no requirement for additional holding periods.

Dilution The 2009 LTIP and 2011 LTIP were special arrangements, approved by shareholders at the EGM in April 2009 and AGM in September 2011 respectively.
In considering dilution under the 2011 LTIP the Committee took account of the long term nature of the plan which extends beyond the length of normal incentive plans.
In addition, the Committee took into account, after the priority return of 1.7 billion 13 per share, representing 183% of Net Assets at 30 April 2011, that the dilution on existing shareholders until the hurdle return has been achieved will have no effect and the dilution will only have effect on the value created above the priority return of 1.7 billion.
