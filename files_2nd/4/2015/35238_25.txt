Recruitment and promotion policy When facilitating an external recruitment or an internal promotion the Committee will apply the following principles: Remuneration element Policy Base salary Base salary levels will be set taking into account the individuals experience and skills, prevailing market rates in companies of comparable size and complexity and internal relativities.
Where appropriate the Committee may set the initial salary below this level e. g. if the individual has limited PLC Board experience or is new to the role, with the intention to make phased pay increases over a number of years, which may be above those of the wider workforce, to achieve the desired market positioning.
These increases will be subject to continued development in the role.
Benets Benets as provided to current executive Directors.
The Committee may pay relevant relocation and legal expenses in order to facilitate a recruitment.
Pension A dened contribution or cash supplement at the level provided to current executive Directors.
Annual bonus The Committee would intend to operate the same annual bonus plan for all Directors, including the same maximum opportunity at 150% of salary, albeit pro-rated for the period of employment.
However, depending on the nature and timing of an appointment, the Committee reserves the right to set different performance measures, targets and weightings for the first bonus plan year if considered necessary.
Any bonus criteria in such circumstances would be disclosed in the following years annual report on remuneration.
Long-term LTIP awards would be granted in line with the policy set out in the policy table, with the possibility of incentives an award being made after an appointment.
The maximum ongoing annual award would be limited to that of the current Chief ExecutiveOfcer.
For an internal hire, existing awards would continue over their original vesting period and remain subject to their terms asat the date of grant.
Buy-out awards Should it be the case that the Remuneration Committee considered it necessary to buy out incentive pay which an individual would forfeit on leaving their current employer, such compensation, where possible, would be structured sothat the terms of the buy-out mirrored the form and structure of the remuneration being replaced e. g. vested share awards may be replaced with shares in Derwent London while recently granted long-term incentive awards may be replaced with a performance related LTIP award.
Where possible this will be accommodated under the Companys existing incentive plans, but it may be necessary to utilise the exemption under rule 9.4.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
External appointments Executive Directors may accept a non-executive role at another company with the approval of the Board.
The executive is entitled to retain any fees paid for these services.

Benefits Taxable benets relates to car and fuel allowance, private medical insurance and life assurance.
Determination of 2015 annual bonus outcome Provision has been made for a bonus for 2015 of 74.2% 2014: 92.6% of the maximum potential.
This has been derived as follows: Weighting Threshold Maximum Actual Payable Performance measure % of bonus Basis of calculation % % % % Total return 50.0 Total return of major 20.6 25.4 23.0 30.0 real estate companies Total property return 25.0 Relative to IPD Central London 17.2 22.2 19.9 19.2 Offices Total Return Index In addition to the above formulaic result, 25% of the annual bonus is measured against performance objectives.
The factors considered by the Committee are as follows: The financing structure of the Group Measures used to assess performance in this area include the interest cover ratio KPI and two of the Groups key metrics gearing and available resources.
Rent collection and the level of arrears Tenant receipts is one of the Groups KPIs.
Delivery of projects both in terms of timing and costs This is a key driver to the Groups total property return KPI and is monitored through regular progress reports to the Board andpost completion reviews.
Health and safety performance Both the Board and the Executive Committee receive regular health and safety reports and zero RIDDORS is one of the Groups CSR targets.
Void management and letting performance Management of void space is one of the Groups KPIs and the Board receives regular reports on both these objectives.
Staff retention This is considered a good proxy for staff welfare.
Governance The Board aims to maintain a high level of governance as it considers this to be a key element in running a successful andsustainable business.
Reputation The Board considers this to be a major asset of the Company and the risk of damage to the Groups reputation is one ofthemajor risks identied on pages 72 to 77.
Design This is key to maintaining and developing the Groups brand.
The total bonus estimated for each executive is therefore: Bonus payable Deferred bonus % of % of Cash bonus % of maximum salary payable salary J. D. Burns 74.2 111.3 619,500 70,189 11.3 S. P.

Having considered a range of key financial indicators, including profits and NAV performance, the Committee concluded that, for the parts of the 2013 awards with measurement periods ending in 2015, this was the case.
Therefore, the vesting for each executive is estimated to be: Number of Value of award 1 awards on vesting Executive vesting J. D. Burns 31,330 1,160,777 S. P. Silver 26,877 995,793 D. M. A.

Silverman 16,412 608,065 Based on the average share price over the last three months of the financial year of 37.05 and the estimated vesting percentage of 65.0%.

Silverman Nil-cost option 200 34.65 22,770 788,981 22.5% If threshold performance is not achieved over the three-year performance period, none of the award will vest.
The performance conditions are described in more detail on page 103.
The weighted average exercise price of awards that eithervested or lapsed in 2015 was nil 2014: nil.
The weighted average market price of awards vesting in 2015 was 35.27 2014: 27.26.
Awards made in 2013 and previous years were made under the Groups 2004 PSP whilst those made subsequently were made underthe 2014 LTIP.
108 Governance For awards granted under either the 2004 PSP or the 2014 LTIP: half of the shares vest based on TSR performance relative to a comparator group of companies: and for awards granted up to 2013, half of the shares vest based on NAV performance compared to properties in the IPD Central London Ofces Total Return Index: for awards granted from 2014, half of the shares vest based on TPR performance compared to the properties in the IPD Central London Ofces Total Return Index.
The TSR comparator group consists of a dened group of real estate companies.
The comparator group for 2015 comprises the following Big Yellow Group plc, The British Land Company plc, Capital & Regional plc, Capital & Counties Properties plc, Great Portland Estates plc, Hammerson plc, Intu Properties plc, Land Securities plc, StModwen Properties plc, Segro plc, Shaftesbury plc and Workspace Group plc.
Under the 2004 PSP 25% of awards subject to the TSR target vest for median performance over the three-year performance period increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
Median performance under the 2014 LTIP results in 22.5% of the award subject to the TSR target test vesting with full vesting still requiring upper quartile performance.
For awards granted up to 2013 if the Groups NAV performance matches that of the median performing property in the Index over the three-year performance period 25% of awards subject to the NAV target vest.
Vesting increases on a sliding scale to full vesting for out-performing the median performing property by 5% per annum.
For awards granted in 2014 and beyond median performance results in 22.5% of the award subject to the TPR target vesting.
This increases to 75% vesting for outperforming the median by 2.5% per annum with full vesting being achieved for 5% per annum outperformance of the median.
The Committee has discretion to reduce the extent of vesting in the event that it feels that performance against either measure ofperformance is inconsistent with underlying financial performance.
For awards granted under the 2014 LTIP in 2014 and beyond, as a minimum, the after tax number of vested shares must be retained for a minimum holding period of two years.
