36 Corporate governance Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholder I am delighted to present our Directors remuneration report for the financial year ended 30 September 2015 which comprises this statement and the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 37 to 43.
Our remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at our 2015 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee the Committee has continued to operate in accordance with that policy during the 2015 financial year.
The Committee is satisfied that the policy remains appropriate, and no changes to the policy are proposed for 2016.
The Policy is provided on pages 44 to 50 for information only.
Key decisions and pay outcomes for the year ended 30 September 2015 Following a review in the year, our Executive Directors base salaries were increased by 2% effective 1 June 2015, in line with the average salary increases awarded to UK employees who are paid on a monthly basis.
This resulted in base salaries of 765,000 for Kate Swann and 408,000 for Jonathan Davies.
The Group delivered a strong financial performance in the year with good like-for-like sales, net gains and improvement in operating margin.
There was continued progress against the Groups strategic objectives, with new contract openings across the globe and the continued successful implementation of the programmes of operational improvements.
Further information regarding the Groups performance during the year can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 25.
Based on a combination of the financial performance of the business and personal performance achieved in the financial year, the Committee awarded an annual bonus of 200% of salary to Kate Swann and 100% of salary to Jonathan Davies.
As a reminder, no awards under long-term incentive awards were due to vest in the year.
Remuneration for the year ending 30 September 2016 The Committee will continue to apply the current remuneration framework during the year ending 30 September 2016.
- The current salaries of Executive Directors will continue to apply from 1 October 2015 and we will review salaries with effect from 1 June 2016, in line with our usual timetable.
- The annual bonus plan will operate on the same basis as in 2015.
Awards will be primarily based on underlying Group operating profit performance, and will be subject to a multiplier based on individual performance.
- As mentioned in our previous Directors remuneration report, other than new joiners, we did not grant any awards last year under the SSP Performance Share Plan as an award post IPO was made in July 2014.
This year, we intend to grant a PSP award in November 2015 of 200% of salary to Kate Swann and 125% of salary to Jonathan Davies.
These awards will be subject to performance over the three financial years to 30 September 2018.
The performance measures for these awards will continue to be 75% EPS growth and 25% relative TSR performance.
The TSR comparator group for awards to be made under the SSP Performance Share Plan in 2015 will largely be consistent with that for awards made in 2014, except to reflect the merger of companies in the TSR comparator group.
- As mentioned last year, the UK Corporate Governance Code was revised in 2014.
Malus and clawback provisions are now required on all performance-related components of pay.
Our approved policy includes clawback and malus provisions for bonus and PSP awards to Executive Directors.
We are therefore compliant with this aspect of the Code.
I hope very much that shareholders will support the Committees continuing overall approach to remuneration and, on behalf of the Committee, I commend our report to you.

Statement of Directors shareholding and share interests Directors shareholdings and share ownership guidelines Shareholding guidelines require Executive Directors to build up over time a personal shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to 200% of salary for the CEO and 125% of salary for the CFO.
Executives are encouraged to retain vested shares earned under the Companys incentive plans until the shareholding guidelines have been met.
The Chairman and each Independent Non-Executive Director are expected to build and then maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to 100% of their annual gross fee.
The period over which the minimum shareholding must be built up is a three-year period, either from the date of admission 15 July 2014, or from the date of appointment if later.

25% of these awards may vest based on Relative TSR performance.
SSPs TSR will be calculated using the IPO offer price of 210p as the starting value.
For constituents of the peer group a three-month average from 16 June 2014 will be used.
TSR performance will be measured to the three months after the announcement of results for the financial year ending 30 September 2017.

40 Corporate governance Annual report on remuneration continued Historical TSR performance As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE 250, the FTSE 250 Index provides an appropriate indication of market movements against which to benchmark the Companys performance.
The chart below summarises the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index over the 63-week period from admission on 15 July 2014 to 30 September 2015.

Percentage change in remuneration of the Chief Executive Ocer and other employees The required disclosure of the remuneration of the Chief Executive Ocer in the table on page 37 does not provide meaningful information to calculate the percentage change in remuneration between financial years, as the Chief Executive Ocer was appointed as a Director of SSP Group plc on 16 June 2014, part-way through the previous financial year.
As stated in the 2014 annual report we have therefore provided additional information in order for the required comparison to be made.
On the annual salary review date of 1 June 2015, the Chief Executive Ocers base salary increased by 2%, compared with average annual salary increases of 2% awarded to UK employees who are paid on a monthly basis.
This population was chosen as a suitable comparator group because it is considered to be the most relevant in terms of employment location and remuneration structure.
In addition, there were no changes made to the benets provided to the Chief Executive Ocer in the year.

Implementation of remuneration policy in the year ending 30 September 2016 This section provides an overview of how the Committee is proposing to implement our remuneration policy in the year ending 30 September 2016.
Base salary The Remuneration Committee considers a number of factors when reviewing the base salaries, including: the individuals skills, experience and recent performance: business performance: affordability: market practice for comparable roles at companies of a similar size and complexity: and pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group.
The table below shows base salaries at 1 October 2015.
Base salary at 1 October 2015 Kate Swann 765,000 Jonathan Davies 408,000 Benefits The benefits received by each Executive Director will continue to include private healthcare for the executive and their family, life insurance, car allowance or a company car, company fuel card and travel to and from work including associated tax paid.
Pension allowance The current Executive Directors will receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension.
The table below shows the expected cash allowances for the year ending 30 September 2016.
Cash allowance in lieu of pension % of salary Kate Swann 35% Jonathan Davies 21% Annual bonus The maximum annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors for the year ending 30 September 2016 will remain 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 125% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
The structure of the annual bonus performance measures will remain unchanged.
Bonuses for the year ending 30 September 2016 will use underlying Group operating profit as the primary financial target, with a multiplier based on the individual performance assessment.
The Group operating profit targets are considered commercially sensitive so have not been disclosed.
The Company will disclose the targets retrospectively when they are considered no longer commercially sensitive.

However, given the international nature of SSPs used for awards made in 2014 apart from to reflect the merger of business, in order to ensure that management performance during Carphone Warehouse Group and Dixons to form Dixons Carphone the performance period is appropriately rewarded, the Committee as set out below.
may make an adjustment upwards or downwards where there have been exceptional movements in foreign exchange rates during the performance period.
