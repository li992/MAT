ROCE on the above basis was 13% for the year ended 30 April 2015.
As outlined in last years Remuneration Report, the maximum potential bonus for the CEO was increased from 100% to 150% of basic salary but with a higher performance target to achieve that level of bonus.
The maximum potential bonus for the FD remained at 100% of basic salary.
For the CEO, the bonus is paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares up to 100% of salary.
Any bonus earned in excess of this is paid wholly in shares.
For the FD the bonus is paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares.
The shares are deferred for three years, subject to continued employment.
Both the cash and share elements are subject to clawback, further details of which are given on page 54.
The matrix of target PBT levels and the percentage of the maximum available for this element was as follows: Lower Plan Upper CEO stretch Target PBT - m 76.1 80.1 84.1 85.7 CEO 16.67% 41.67% 83.3% 100% FD 25% 50% 100% Group PBT for the year was 85.0m.
The Committee determined that the most important non-financial strategic objective for the year was to position the Group for future growth with the right IT and reporting systems.
The FDs objectives were centred on designing and implementing financial reporting systems and the CEOs on the broader reporting system and planning a world class IT system.
The Committee assessed the performance against these objectives and felt that the FD had fully met the objectives and the CEO had partially met the higher level of stretch inherent in his bonus arrangements.
The resulting bonuses for 2015 were as follows: Strategic Maximum Achievement Cash Shares PBT objectives Total 000 000 000 000 RL Contreras 69.50% 20.83% 90.33% 600 542 200 342 CJR Muir 75% 25% 100% 250 250 125 125 Vesting of EPSP awards The EPSP award granted on 17 August 2012 was based on performance over the three years ended 30 April 2015.
As disclosed in previous annual reports, the performance condition for this award was as follows: Performance Threshold target Stretch target End measurement Condition 25% Vesting 100% Vesting point Actual Adjusted % Vesting 31.5p 31.5p Final year of the 51p 44.2p 47.9 EPS CPI 3% p. a.

This change increased EPS by 6.8p which has been excluded.
No adjustment to the ROCE result has been calculated, as the actual resulted in a nil award.
It is the Committees intention to make adjustments in future years to financial targets to reflect the change in depreciation policy.
