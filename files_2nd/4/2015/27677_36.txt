Governance 135 Annual Report on Remuneration The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out the payments made and awards granted to the directors in 2015 and how the Company intends to implement the Directors Remuneration Policy in 2016.
This, along with the Chairmans Annual Statement, is subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM.
Market benchmarks The primary peer group for benchmarking executive remuneration comprises large European insurers and, for 2015 and 2016, includes Prudential plc, Aviva plc, RSA Insurance Group plc, Legal & General Group plc, Standard Life plc, Allianz Group and Axa Group.
For non-executive directors, benchmarking is performed against non-executive directors remuneration in FTSE100 companies using the whole of the FTSE100 population as well as an extract of companies by market capitalisation.
Figures for 2015 represent remuneration paid for the period from that date 2 Paul Hanratty and Ingrid Johnson joined the Board on 1 July 2014.
Figures for 2014 represent remuneration paid in 2014 for the period from that date 3 Julian Roberts ceased to be an executive director of the Company on 31 October 2015.
Figures for 2015 represent remuneration paid for the period up to that date including the full STI payable for 2015.
Element Description Taxable benefits These amounts represent the gross value of benefits that are paid for by the Company and are chargeable to UK income tax.
They cover such items as tax advice, spouses travel, use of a car and driver and, for Bruce Hemphill and Ingrid Johnson, relocation costs from South Africa to the UK.
In accordance with the approved Directors Remuneration Policy, the Company paid for certain costs of relocating, such as a settling-in allowance, relocation agents costs, moving costs, transport of household items, temporary housing and transaction costs, indirect costs of purchasing a house in the UK and, for Bruce Hemphill, cost of travel for his family.
The committee applied caps to certain elements of Bruce Hemphills relocation package to ensure that controls were in place to manage the total costs incurred.
The total value of the costs covered was 825,931 in 2015 for Bruce Hemphill and 709,338 in 2014 for Ingrid Johnson.
The Company accounted for the tax due on these costs directly, resulting in gross costs of 1,467, 310 2015 and 1,272,793 2014 respectively.
It is these values that are included in the single total figures.
STI STI awarded in relation to performance in the year, including 50% that is deferred for three years in the form of a share award.
In accordance with the payment structure agreed when Ingrid Johnson was appointed as Group Finance Director, an amount equal to 50% of her total 2014 STI, inclusive of the amount paid for service with Nedbank up to 30 June 2014, was deferred for three years in the form of a share award.
As part of Bruce Hemphills recruitment arrangements in relation to the buy-out of existing awards, it was agreed that for 2015, Bruce Hemphill will receive a guaranteed STI award to the value of 950,000, 50% of which will be deferred for three years in the form of a share award.
Vesting of the share awards is not subject to the achievement of performance targets but requires the director to remain in office during the vesting period.
Malus applies to the shares held under award prior to vesting and claw back applies to the cash element.
LTI The 2014 Directors Remuneration Report reflected the value of LTI vesting based on the average Old Mutual plc share price over the final quarter of 2014 188.3p, as the options granted in 2012 had not vested at the time of publication.
The values have been updated to reflect the actual market value of 50% of the award that vested in April 2015, namely 236.8p per share, while the balance of 50% which is due to vest in April 2016 is valued as it was in 2014 The 2015 LTI value has been calculated using the average Old Mutual plc share price over the final quarter of 2015 198.04p and, for the 50% of the options that are due to vest in April 2016, the value will be restated in the 2016 Directors Remuneration Report.
Malus and claw back apply to the shares held under option In respect of Ingrid Johnson, the LTI value for 2014 has been updated to reflect the actual market value of the awards that vested or were matched in 2015 namely R253 per share in respect of the Nedbank Restricted Share Award over 9,365 Nedbank shares, and R239.42 per share in respect of the matching award of 5,239 Nedbank shares converted to sterling using the exchange rate for each vesting date namely R18.27 and R17.
75 to 1 respectively In respect of Ingrid Johnson, the 2015 LTI value represents the value of her Nedbank awards which are due to vest in 2016, calculated using the average Nedbank share price over the final quarter of 2015 R213.37, converted to sterling using the average exchange rate over the final quarter of 2015 R21.90 to 1.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Governance 136 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Element Description Pension-related This represents the benefit allowance of 35% of base pay less any amounts sacrificed for the purchase of other benefits benefits.
The Company currently contributes 9% up to the Annual Allowance of the 35% to the Old Mutual Group Personal Pension Plan.
Items in the nature of This includes: i non-taxable benefits, including those paid for through the sacrifice of pension-related benefits, remuneration which are not considered to be significant in value: ii the value of the discount applied to Ingrid Johnsons tax-advantaged share option granted under the Old Mutual plc 2008 Sharesave Plan: and iii the face value, at the time of award, of Bruce Hemphills buy-out awards not subject to performance conditions, as described in detail later in this report.

The adjustment was proportionate to each of the executive directors relative accountability for the project.
Details of Bruce Hemphills guaranteed STI for 2015 can be found in the section of this report entitled Appointment of executive director during 2015.
Outcomes for LTI awards over Old Mutual plc shares granted in 2013 for the performance period 2013 to 2015 The award made to Paul Hanratty, before he became an executive director of the Company, had a face value of 200% of base pay inclusive of the TSR multiplier at the time of grant.
Vesting is due to occur 50% on the third anniversary of the date of grant 8 April 2016 and 50% on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant 8 April 2017.
As the option had not vested at the date of this report, the average share price for the final quarter of 2015 198.04p has been used to determine the value for the purposes of the single total figure.

Over the period, the Company successfully delivered on a number of strategic objectives identified as key priorities by the committee at the beginning of the performance period, namely: A significant restructuring of the Groups South African entities to align to the requirements of South African regulators Significant progress in managing down the exposure to closed-book businesses in Europe through successful sales of these businesses Excellent progress in building an asset management brand and market share in the UK Preparing the US asset management business for IPO.
Throughout the period, management continued to manage down the risk in the Old Mutual Bermuda business effectively, and completed the sale of Old Mutual Bermuda Ltd in December 2015.
The Company monitors culture through a number of KPIs, which were stable or improving over the period.
The committee noted that, although the Groups culture survey scores compared favourably to stretching external benchmarks, a small number of businesses within the Group had not achieved the target ranges set.
The committee received input from the Board Risk Committee, which confirmed that the Group had achieved its objectives within the risk policies and risk appetite limits established for the period.
However, the committee exercised its discretion in one important area in order to ensure that it maintained its overriding objective to align reward with performance.
The committee determined that it was appropriate to make a downward adjustment to the outcome of this component of the long-term incentive, to take consideration of the projected time and cost overruns of the Old Mutual Wealth initiative for outsourcing technology and administration to IFDS.
TSR multiplier A TSR multiplier was used to adjust the outcome of the LTI scorecard in the tables above.

These figures do not reflect the fact that the option due to vest in 2017 will be pro-rated as a result of Paul Hanrattys cessation of employment with the Group in September 2016.
Outcomes for LTI awards over Nedbank shares granted in 2013 for the performance period 2013 to 2015 A restricted share award over 42,126 Nedbank shares was granted to Ingrid Johnson when she worked for Nedbank in March 2013.
The shares held under award were subject to forfeiture provisions during a three-year vesting period, which required her to remain in employment with Nedbank and, for 50% of the award, the achievement of Nedbank corporate performance targets.
It was agreed with Nedbank that Ingrid Johnson would retain eligibility in relation to the employment condition provided she remained in employment with the Old Mutual Group.

OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Governance 140 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Scheme interests awarded during 2015 audited The following tables show share incentive awards granted to the executive directors during 2015.
STI and LTI awards were granted in accordance with the grant policies set out above and, other than in respect of Bruce Hemphills buy-out awards, the number of shares under award or option was calculated using the middle market quotation MMQ of Old Mutual plc shares on the business day preceding the date of grant.
The Sharesave exercise price was set at a 20% discount to the average Old Mutual plc share price over a three day period immediately preceding the invitation date.
The Directors Remuneration Policy on recruitment of an executive director states that, where it is necessary to buy out an individuals unvested awards from a previous employer, the committee would seek to match the expected value of the awards by granting awards that vest over a time frame similar to those given up, with a commensurate reduction in quantum where the new awards will be subject to performance conditions that are not as stretching as those applicable to the awards given up.
The committee assessed the outstanding awards and options from Bruce Hemphills previous employment, and the timescale and likelihood of vesting, and determined that the buy-out awards shown below represented appropriate replacement to those being forfeited.

The committee will apply its discretion in determining the final outcomes in relation to the 2015 LTI, and in this regard: It will receive a report from the Chief Risk Officer to confirm whether the performance of the Group has been achieved within the stated risk appetite.
Where the risk appetite has been breached, the committee will have discretion to reduce the level of vesting accordingly It will exercise its discretion to make adjustments where there is a significant negative impact on underlying financial performance which is not adequately reflected in AOP results for example, where LTIR adjustments create any inconsistency between AOP and IFRS basic earnings.
Where the Group undergoes a significant change, such as a large disposal, acquisition or restructuring, the committee will review the targets to assess whether they need to be adjusted to reflect the change, or whether they should be replaced altogether.
1 TSR multiplier A TSR multiplier will be used to adjust the weighted average outcome of the LTI scorecard in the table shown above.

Shares in trust and shareholder dilution At 31 December 2015, there were 109,765,947 shares held in employee share ownership trusts ESOTs for the purposes of collaterising some of the obligations under the Groups employee share incentive schemes.
The usual strategy is to ensure that, with the exception of Black Economic Empowerment-related ESOTs, at least sufficient shares are held to satisfy restricted share forfeitable shares awards.
In calculating dilution limits, any awards that are satisfied by transfer of pre-existing issued shares such as shares acquired by market purchase through ESOTs and any shares comprised in any share option or share award that has lapsed or has been cash-settled are disregarded.
At 31 December 2015, the Company had 4.52% of share capital available under the 5%-in-10-years limit applicable to discretionary share incentive schemes and 8.63% of share capital available under the 10%-in-10-years limit applicable to all share incentive schemes.
The Company has complied with these limits at all times.
Directors shareholdings and share interests audited Within a period of five years of appointment to the role, the Group Chief Executive is required to build up a holding of shares in the Company equal in value to 200% of base pay, and the equivalent figure for other executive directors is 150% of base pay.
Unvested share awards or share options and vested but unexercised share options are excluded for the purposes of the calculations.
There is no requirement for executive directors to hold shares or share interests in the Company once they have ceased employment with the Group.
The current and former executive directors interests in Old Mutual plc shares are set out in the table below.
Shares have been valued for these purposes at the year-end price, which was 178.9p per share, other than for Julian Roberts, whose shares have been valued at the date he ceased to be a director of the Company 212.3p per share.
There have been no changes to the directors shareholdings between 31 December 2015 and 11 March 2016: however, certain of the nil-cost share options granted in 2013 lapsed on 11 March 2016 due to the partial achievement of performance targets.

At the time of the transaction, this did not result in his holding falling below the requirements: however, the subsequent reduction in the Old Mutual plc share price has resulted in him not meeting the shareholding requirement at 31 December 2015.
He retains a substantial interest in the Companys share price performance through his remaining holding, and his unvested forfeitable shares awards and nil-cost share options, as set out in the tables above and below.
In respect of the exercise of the Sharesave option, the value of Old Mutual plc shares on the date of exercise was 210.2p per share 3 The market value per share at grant represents the exercise price of the options granted under the Old Mutual plc 2008 Sharesave Plan, which were set at a 20% discount to the average Old Mutual plc share price over a three day period immediately preceding the dates of invitation.

The committee has selected employees in the UK, as the executive directors are employed in the UK and have a similar remuneration structure to those employees.

While a base pay and annual STI structure will generally remain appropriate, the committee is of the view that a conventional LTIP structure with rolling annual awards no longer aligns with the Group strategy, and does not incentivise the most timely and cost-effective execution of the strategy.
Instead, the committee intends to grant one-off LTIP awards during 2016, replacing normal and future annual awards, to key individuals, including Bruce Hemphill and Ingrid Johnson, with metrics relating to execution of the new strategy, performance of our four constituent businesses, and unlocking of value for shareholders.
The committee will grant LTIP awards to Bruce Hemphill and Ingrid Johnson on an exceptional basis in line with the current Directors Remuneration Policy in March 2016, at the maximum level of 400% of base pay, and also commence a period of consultation with the Companys major shareholders, with a view to presenting a new Directors Remuneration Policy to shareholders for approval in General Meeting later in 2016.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Governance Claw back and malus 149 In response to the implementation of the revised UK Corporate Governance Code, the Company has updated its malus provisions and introduced claw back on cash STI and vested LTI awards in respect of performance periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015, as follows: Awards impacted and period applicable Criteria net of statutory deductions basis for claw back Misleading or misstated financial results Cash STI during the period between the end of the performance period and the payment date Loss due to failure to observe risk management policies Unvested deferred STI awards during the three-year Gross misconduct Malus performance period Actions leading to reputational damage Unvested LTI awards three or four years matching the vesting period Misleading or misstated financial results Cash STI for a three-year period following the payment date Loss due to failure to observe risk management policies Claw back Vested LTI awards for two years, if three-year vesting, Gross misconduct and for one year, if four-year vesting Retirement share incentive awards The committee decided that, in view of regulations in the UK relating to age discrimination, retirement would no longer be an automatic good leaver provision for share awards granted to employees based in the UK from 2015 onwards.
The committee accordingly amended the rules of the Old Mutual plc Share Reward Plan Restricted Shares and the Old Mutual plc Performance Share Plan Restricted Shares prior to the grant of awards in 2015.
Retirement may still qualify for good leaver status if the committee exercises its discretion accordingly.
Post-employment holding periods The committee has chosen not to require executive directors to hold shares for a period after vesting or exercise, or after leaving the Group.
However: i the committee has introduced the shareholding guidelines described earlier in this report: and ii the long-term incentive awards vest 50% three years after the date of grant and 50% four years after the date of grant: are subject to malus and claw back as described above: and will not normally vest before their prescribed vesting dates, irrespective of whether the executive remains in employment with the Group until vesting.
The committee believes the combination of these requirements to be sufficient to ensure that the remuneration of executive directors remains substantially linked to Old Mutual plc share price performance, both before and for a sufficient period of time after cessation of employment with the Group.
Non-executive directors fees The annual fees payable to the Chairman and to the other non-executive directors in 2015 and 2016, by role, are set out below: 2016 2015 Role Chairman 380,000 380,000 Senior Independent Director 17,500 15,000 Board fee 60,000 59,000 Chairman of the Board Risk Committee 30,000 30,000 Member of the Board Risk Committee 10,000 10,000 Chairman of the Group Audit Committee 30,000 30,000 Member of the Group Audit Committee 10,000 10,000 Member of the Nomination and Governance Committee 7,000 5,000 Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 30,000 30,000 Member of the Remuneration Committee 10,000 10,000 Average payment per non-executive director excluding the Chairman based on the Board and Board committee structure in place at 31 December 2015 87,000 85,000 OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Governance 150 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Consideration by the directors of matters relating to directors remuneration Committee meetings and members The following, all of whom are or were at the relevant time independent non-executive directors of the Company, served as members of the committee during the year: Meetings Meetings Non-executive director Position Period on the committee attended not attended 1 Danuta Gray Chairman March 2013 to date Chairman since May 2014 6 1 Zoe Cruz Member January 2014 to date 6 1 Alan Gillespie Member November 2010 to date Chairman from May 2013 to May 2014 7 Roger Marshall Member May 2013 to date 7 Nkosana Moyo Member January 2014 to date 6 1 1 Danuta Gray was taken ill on the morning of the meeting held in December 2015, and was therefore unable to attend.
