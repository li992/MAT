COM Annual bonuses Each year, the Remuneration Committee reviews the annual bonus, to ensure the performance measures and targets remain appropriate and aligned with the Companys short-term strategy, while remaining within the appropriate risk profile.
Under the terms of the annual bonus arrangements for 2016, Colin Day is potentially entitled to a maximum bonus of up to 150% of basic salary and Stefan Schellinger is potentially entitled to a maximum bonus of up to 125% of basic salary.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, the performance criteria will be as follows: Performance criteria Weighting % Balanced growth revenue and operating profit 80 10 Working capital 10 Personal objectives The Remuneration Committee believes that revenue, profit and working capital targets are commercially sensitive, although targets will be set so as to provide alignment with the goals of Drive for 2020.
Therefore, the Remuneration Committee will not disclose the targets on a prospective basis.
The targets and actual performance against them will be disclosed on a retrospective basis where possible.
In addition to the financial measures, the Remuneration Committee has also set the personal performance measures for Colin Day and Stefan Schellinger, which are designed to deliver further progress by the Company towards the objectives associated with its Drive for 2020 strategy.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion, within a three-year period after the determination of the bonus, to withhold or recover annual cash bonuses or DASB awards through malus and clawback provisions in specified circumstances.
These circumstances take into account where the original bonus was paid to a greater extent than it should have done, due to a material misstatement in the Companys Financial Statements or due to an error in assessing the applicable performance conditions or if there has been serious misconduct by an individual or if there has been serious reputational damage to the Company or a relevant business unit.
Essentra Long-Term Incentive Plan 2015 LTIP 2015 An award granted under LTIP 2015 consists of a conditional right to receive shares in the Company, subject to satisfaction of performance conditions.
As outlined in the Remuneration Policy Report, the Remuneration Committee has fixed the size of grants to the current Chief Executive and Group Finance Director for the three-year period of the Policy.
Therefore, the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director will receive awards in 2016 over the same number of LTIP shares as were awarded to the holders of these positions in April 2015 as set out below: Colin Day Stefan Schellinger 1 2 Number of shares to be granted in 2016 203,109 74,222 1 At the time of the April 2015 grant, these shares were worth 300% of Colin Days 2015-17 annual salary 675,000 2 At the time of the April 2015 grant, these shares were worth 200% of the former Group Finance Directors average 2015-17 annual salary 370,000 A share award under LTIP 2015 will not normally be exercisable before the third anniversary of its award, and may only be exercised to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied.
The awards are structured as nil cost options.
For awards to be granted to the Executive Directors in 2016, one half of the awards will be subject to a TSR performance condition and one half of the awards will be subject to an adjusted EPS performance condition.
The Remuneration Committee believes that these conditions provide appropriate alignment with the strategic priorities outlined in Drive for 2020.
The TSR performance condition assesses Essentras TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts index.
Performance is measured over three years from the time of grant.
25% of the TSR element vests for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% vesting for upper quartile performance or above.
COM DIRECTORS REPORT | ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION The adjusted EPS performance condition for these awards requires the Companys EPS growth adjusted to exclude items which did not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance and intangible amortisation over three financial years to be in excess of 8% per annum for 25% of the EPS element to vest.
The proportion of the awards vesting will increase on a straight line basis, and for 100% of the EPS element to vest the adjusted EPS growth must be in excess of 15% per annum.
The 15% per annum upper target is consistent with the aspiration of Drive for 2020, namely to double the size of the Company by 2020.
Awards granted under the LTIP 2015 are subject to malus and clawback provisions for a period of up to three years following the vesting date of the award.
Potential circumstances in which the malus and clawback provisions may be applied are consistent with those applying to annual bonus awards as described above.
Non-Executive Director fees The fees for the Chairman are set by the Remuneration Committee, while fees for the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole.
