Directors Remuneration Report REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMANS STATEMENT On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for the year to 25 January 2015, which sets out the Directors Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by a binding vote at the 2014 AGM and became effective for three years from the close of that meeting.
For ease of reference, we are including the Policy in this years Directors Remuneration Report.
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details of the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 25 January 2015 and how the Policy will be operated for the year commencing 26 January 2015.
I am delighted to report on the strong level of support received from shareholders, as evidenced by the voting outcomes at the 2014 AGM.
The resolutions seeking approval of the new 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan, the Directors Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration were supported by over 96% of the votes cast.
During the year the Company appointed the Groups new Finance Director, Stuart Lorimer.
In order to fully integrate Stuart within the business and align his interests with those of his peers, the Committee proposes to bring Stuart into the existing LTIP awards, although scaled back to reflect his reduced period of employment over the performance periods.
Details of the recruitment award are set out on page 59.
I was appointed Chairman of the Group on 1 January 2015.
At the request of the Board, I agreed to continue to chair the Remuneration Committee until the recruitment of a new independent non-executive director with the capability to replace me in this capacity could be completed.
In this regard, I am delighted to confirm that David Ritchie, CEO of Bovis Homes plc, will join the Board on 1 April 2015 and replace me as chair of the Remuneration Committee with effect from 1 July 2015.
2014 15 key decisions and pay outcomes The Remuneration Committee remains committed to a responsible approach to executive pay.
As described in the Strategic Report, the Group has continued to grow revenue and volume ahead of the U. K. soft drinks market, with revenue for the year to 25 January 2015 of 260.9m, an increase of 2.7% on the prior year.
Underlying pre-tax profit increased by 10.0% to 41.9m compared to the prior year.
Against this background and taking into account executive directors performance against strategic objectives, an annual bonus of 75.5% of salary was paid to R. A.
White, J. D. Kemp and A. L. Memmott in respect of the year to 25 January 2015.
Details of the pro-rated annual bonus paid to A.
B. C. Short to reflect his period in office and his contribution to the business during the 2014 15 financial year are set out on pages 57 and 58.
S. Lorimer joined the Board on 5 January 2015 and accordingly was not paid a bonus in respect of the year to 25 January 2015.
Average EPS growth for the three years to 25 January 2015 exceeded the average EPS for the three years preceding that period both being adjusted for Retail Price Index by 13.4%.
As a result, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards granted in April 2012 vested at 31.9%.
Further detail in relation to the annual bonus payment and LTIP vesting are included on pages 56 to 58.
Proposed changes in executive director remuneration for 2015 16 The Remuneration Committee has continued to monitor executive remuneration policy to take account of evolving market practice and its alignment with the strategic direction of the business see the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37 for further details, whilst also seeking to ensure that there is continuity to the structure of executive pay.
In line with the range of salary increases across the Group, an increase of 3% will be made to the executive directors base salaries with effect from 1 April 2015.
The performance metrics for variable pay are unchanged.
For the annual bonus the performance metrics will continue to be a combination of a key financial performance metric of the business and strategic measures.
Growth in EPS will continue to be used as the performance measure for awards granted under the 2014 LTIP in 2015 16.
Further details are included on page 59.
A malus provision was included in the LTIP rules which were approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee intends to review the operation of malus and clawback provisions for all variable pay during 2015 16 in light of the changes in the 2014 edition of the U. K. Corporate Governance Code.
The Remuneration Committee will consider emerging market practice before a decision is made and reported to shareholders next year.

Annual bonus The maximum annual bonus award opportunity for each executive director in respect of the year to 25 January 2015 was 100% of salary.
80% of the bonus was assessed against the year on year increase in profit before tax, excluding exceptional items, and 20% was based on non-financial strategic measures.
White, J. D. Kemp and A. L. Memmott received a total of 637k as annual bonus for the year, representing 75.5% of each directors salary.
The target for the proportion of the annual bonus based on the year on year increase in profit before tax and performance against that target is set out in the table below.
50% of this element of the bonus could be earned for on-target performance and this increases on a linear scale for performance against the set target up to a maximum of 80% of salary.

The Remuneration Committee considers that detailed strategic targets are commercially sensitive and should remain confidential to the Company.
However, in summary the measures related to certain revenue growth targets by brand and geography, successful execution of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games sales and marketing campaign, and certain targets related to Company change programme projects.
An excellent performance against these measures by each of the executive directors resulted in 20% of the annual bonus vesting.

B. C. Short received an annual bonus equal to 104k.
In line with the Groups policy on payments for loss of office, the award was pro-rated to reflect his time in service during the bonus period.
Annual bonus for 2015 16 For the 2015 16 financial year, an element of the annual bonus 20% of basic salary will continue to be assessed against strategic measures to align our reward structure with key strategic priorities and to encourage behaviours which facilitate profitable growth and the future development of the business.
The remainder of the annual bonus will continue to be assessed against growth in Group profit before tax.
Performance targets will be set at the challenging levels of previous years.
50% of the annual bonus will be earned for on-target performance.
The actual performance targets are not disclosed as they are considered to be commercially sensitive at this time and should therefore remain confidential to the Company.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to disclose how the bonus pay-out delivered relates to performance against the targets on a retrospective basis.
No changes are proposed to the maximum annual bonus opportunity which will remain at 100% of salary.
Long term incentives audited information Awards vesting in respect of the financial period LTIP awards granted in April 2012 were subject to the achievement of an average EPS growth performance condition over a three year period ending 25 January 2015.
Awards vest if the average EPS for the three years running up to and including the year of calculation exceeds the average EPS of the three years preceding that period, both being adjusted for Retail Price Index RPI, by 10% or more.
EPS is calculated on the basis of profit before tax, adjusted to exclude exceptional items and other significant non-recurring items which the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate.
No part of an award vests if EPS growth is less than 10% above RPI over the three year period.
20% vests where EPS growth exceeds RPI by 10%: 100% of an award vests where EPS growth exceeds RPI by 32.5% or more, with straight line vesting between the two.
The maximum value of any award of shares is 100% of basic salary.

If the ESOS awards are exercised at a gain then LTIP awards will be scaled back to the same value to ensure that the total pre-tax value delivered to participants remains unchanged.
The performance condition for these LTIP awards is as described above for LTIP awards granted in April 2012, with the exception that the average EPS growth target is adjusted for CPI and is calculated on the basis of profit after tax not profit before tax.
The salary used in the calculation of the award is the individual directors salary at 1 April 2014.
Long term incentives 2015 16 The previous LTIP the 2003 LTIP was approved by shareholders in May 2003 and expired in May 2013.
The Remuneration Committee took the opportunity to review the remuneration policy for the executive directors, including the LTIP.
After engagement with major shareholders, shareholders approved a new LTIP the 2014 LTIP at the 2014 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee is keen to ensure that the 2014 LTIP uses appropriate measures consistent with the Companys strategic objectives, including the long term delivery of sustainable growth.
The Remuneration Committee has therefore concluded that EPS growth should continue to be used as the performance measure for the 2014 LTIP.
The detailed performance metrics proposed are as follows: Threshold vesting at 20% Maximum vesting at 100% % linked to award of the maximum award of the maximum award EPS growth 100% 10% 32.5% There is straight-line vesting between the points and no reward below threshold performance.
EPS this is a key measure of the Companys profitability.
Awards vest if the average EPS for the three years running up to and including the year of calculation exceeds the average EPS of the three years preceding that period, both being adjusted for CPI, by at least 10%.
EPS is calculated on the basis of profit after tax, adjusted to exclude exceptional items and other significant non-recurring items which the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate.
No part of an award vests if EPS growth is less than 10% above CPI over the three year period.
20% vests where EPS growth exceeds CPI by 10%: 100% of an award vests where EPS growth exceeds CPI by 32.5% or more, with straight line vesting between the two.
Awards made to the executive directors in 2015 16 will equate to 125% of salary.
However, as referenced in the Chairmans statement, in addition to S. Lorimers normal 2015 16 LTIP award, the Board proposes to grant S. Lorimer a performance related recruitment award in two tranches as follows: An award equal to 25% of salary which will be subject to growth in EPS over the three financial years ending 2015 16, which will vest in April 2016.
An award equal to 50% of salary which will be subject to growth in EPS over the three financial years ending 2016 17, which will vest in June 2017.
The two tranches will be subject to the same growth in EPS targets as the existing LTIP awards granted to executive directors during 2012 13 and 2013 14.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee may also reduce the amount which would vest if it does not consider it to be a fair reflection of S. Lorimers contribution to the business during the performance periods.
If S. Lorimer leaves within two years of being appointed, the Remuneration Committee will require S. Lorimer to pay back any of the recruitment award that has vested.
Full disclosure will be provided in next years Directors Remuneration Report.

Statement of directors shareholding and share interests audited information In order to further align the executive directors long term interests with those of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee introduced new share ownership guidelines applicable from 2017 18.
The guidelines require that, with effect from 2017 18, when the first awards granted under the 2014 LTIP are due to vest, executive directors retain all shares acquired under Company sponsored share plans and retain up to half of any bonus pay-out after tax to purchase shares in the Company until the value of their shareholding is equal to 125% of gross basic salary.
Until this shareholding is acquired, the executive directors may not, without Remuneration Committee approval, sell shares other than to finance any tax liabilities arising from the vesting of LTIP awards.
Prior to 2017 18, executive directors are required to retain all shares acquired under Company sponsored share plans until the value of their shareholding is equal to 100% of gross basic salary.
White, J. D. Kemp and A. L. Memmott met the 100% of gross basic salary requirement applicable for the year to 25 January 2015.
S. Lorimer was appointed to the Board on 5 January 2015 and is to build up a shareholding equal to 100% of his gross basic salary in accordance with the shareholding guidelines.

In the opinion of the Board, the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts is the most appropriate index against which the TSR of the Company should be measured because it represents a broad equity market index of which the Company is a constituent member.

level that reflects market conditions and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and expertise.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Fees are set at a level which reflects the skill, knowledge and experience of the individual, whilst taking into account appropriate market data.
The Board is responsible for setting the fees of the other nonexecutive directors.
Fees may include a basic fee and additional fees for further responsibilities for example, chairmanship of board committees.
Fees are set taking into account several factors, including the size and complexity of the business, appropriate market data and the expected time commitment and contribution for the role.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Companys share schemes or bonus schemes nor do they receive any pension contributions.
Non-executive directors may be eligible to receive benefits such as the use of secretarial support, travel costs or other benefits that may be appropriate.
Actual fee levels are disclosed in the Directors annual remuneration report for the relevant financial year.
Explanation of performance metrics chosen and the target setting process Performance measures are selected that are aligned to the Companys strategy.
Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual bonus and long term incentive awards.
When setting these performance targets, the Remuneration Committee will take into account a number of different reference points, which may include the Companys business plans and strategy and the market environment.
Full vesting will only occur for what the Remuneration Committee considers to be stretching performance.
The annual bonus performance targets have been selected to provide an appropriate balance between incentivising directors to meet financial targets for the year and achieving strategic and or personal objectives.
The LTIP performance targets reflect the Companys strategic objectives and therefore the financial and strategic decisions which ultimately determine the success of the Company.
The LTIP performance measures will be based on financial measures, including but not exclusively Earnings Per Share growth, which is a key measure of the Companys profitability, and or comparative total shareholder return related measures.
The Remuneration Committee retains the ability to adjust or set different performance measures if events occur such as a change in strategy, a material acquisition and or a divestment of a Group business or a change in prevailing market conditions which cause the Remuneration Committee to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that they achieve their original purpose.
Awards and options may be adjusted in the event of a variation of share capital in accordance with the scheme rules.
Policy for the remuneration of employees generally Remuneration arrangements are determined throughout the Group based on the same principle that reward should be achieved for delivery of the business strategy and should be sufficient to attract and retain high calibre talent.
Under the rules of the ESOS and the 2014 LTIP, certain managers are eligible to participate in the ESOS and the 2014 LTIP: however there has been no such participation to date and there is no current intention to invite managers to do so.
Senior managers were not eligible to participate in the 2003 LTIP.
The annual bonus arrangements for the senior management team are similar to those for the executive directors in that targets are set annually dependent on financial and or non-financial performance metrics.
The key principles of the remuneration philosophy are applied consistently across the Group below this level, taking account of the seniority of employees.

The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust the performance targets and measures where it considers it appropriate to do so.
Approach to recruitment remuneration The policy aims to facilitate the appointment of individuals of sufficient calibre to lead the business and execute the strategy effectively for the benefit of shareholders.
When appointing a new director, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of the Company and in line with market practice.
The Remuneration Committee will take into consideration a number of relevant factors, which may include the calibre of the individual, the candidates existing remuneration package, and the specific circumstances of the individual including the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited.
The Remuneration Committee will typically seek to align the remuneration package with the Companys remuneration policy as set out in the policy table.
The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted excluding buy-out awards referred to below is 300% of salary in line with this policy.
Subject to this overall maximum variable remuneration, incentive awards will only be granted above the normal maximum annual award opportunities where the Remuneration Committee considers there to be a commercial rationale, which may include but is not limited to circumstances where an executive director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or long-term incentive award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance.
The quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may be transferred to the subsequent year so that reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis.
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that any such awards are linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance targets and will be forfeited if performance or continued employment conditions are not achieved.
The individual will usually move over time onto a remuneration package that is consistent with the normal maximum annual award opportunities set out in the policy table.

A An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt a t an nd A d Ac cc co ou un nt ts 2 s 20 01 15 5 73 Directors Remuneration Report Continued The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to include other remuneration components or awards which are outside the specific terms of the policy but subject to the limit on variable remuneration to facilitate the hiring of candidates of an appropriate calibre, where the Remuneration Committee believes there is a need to do so in the best interests of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee would ensure that awards within the 300% of salary variable remuneration limit are linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee does not intend to use this discretion to make a non-performance related incentive payment for example a golden hello.
In some circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may make payments or awards to recognise or buy-out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
The Remuneration Committee will normally aim to do so broadly on a like-for-like basis taking into account a number of relevant factors regarding the forfeited arrangements which may include the form of award, any performance conditions attached to the awards and the time at which they would have vested.
These payments or awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above, however the Remuneration Committees intention is that the value awarded would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under the Companys existing share plans.
If necessary, and subject to the limits referred to above, recruitment awards may be granted outside of these plans as currently permitted under the Listing Rules which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, the recruitment of an executive director.
Where a position is fulfilled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue according to the original terms.
Fees payable to a newly-appointed Chairman or non-executive director will be in line with the fee policy in place at the time of appointment.

Service contracts Executive directors contracts are on a rolling basis and may be terminated on 12 months notice by the Company or on 6 months notice by the executive.
Service contracts for new directors will generally be limited to 12 months notice by the Company.
The service contracts for R. A.
White, J. D. Kemp and A. L. Memmott provide for a notice period of 12 months except during the six months following either a takeover of or by the Company or a Company reconstruction.
Under these conditions and certain circumstances these directors are entitled to a liquidated damages payment equal to the directors basic salary at termination plus the value of all contractual benefits for a two year period.
In the event this liquidated damages payment is triggered, the director will also be deemed to be a good leaver for the purposes of the Companys share schemes.
Given the size of the Company and the sector dynamics at the time these directors were recruited, the Remuneration Committee considered this provision appropriate in order to attract and retain high calibre executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee is cognisant of the fact that these provisions do not reflect best practice.
It has therefore considered the alternatives available to exit these contractual arrangements, including contractual buy-out.
However, the Remuneration Committee concluded that it was not feasible to place a value on these rights, in order to remove them from the contracts, which would be acceptable to both parties.
It therefore determined that the most appropriate approach would be to maintain the legacy provisions, however for all future appointments these provisions would not apply.
The service contract for S. Lorimer does not contain these provisions.
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders in accordance with the Code.
Their appointments are terminable by either the Company or the directors themselves upon three months notice without compensation.

Annual bonus This will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an individual basis and the decision as to whether or not to award a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon a number of factors, including the circumstances of the individuals departure and their contribution to the business during the bonus period in question.
Any bonus amounts paid will typically be pro-rated for time in service to termination and will, subject to performance, be paid at the usual time.
2014 LTIP The extent to which any award under the 2014 LTIP will vest would be determined based on the leaver provisions contained within the 2014 LTIP rules.
The Remuneration Committee shall determine when awards vest in accordance with those provisions.
Awards will normally lapse if the participant leaves employment before vesting.
However, awards may vest in good leaver circumstances, including death, disability, ill-health, injury, sale of the participants employer, or any other reason determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Any good leaver awards will vest at the date of cessation of employment unless the Remuneration Committee decides they should vest at the normal vesting date.
In either case, the extent to which an award vests will be determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, the period of time that has elapsed from the date of grant to the date of cessation of employment.
The Remuneration Committee may vest the award on any other basis if it believes there are exceptional circumstances which warrant that.
Options are exercisable for six months from leaving employment or six months from the normal vesting date as appropriate.
Change of control Awards under the 2014 LTIP will generally vest early on a takeover, merger or other corporate reorganisation.
The Remuneration Committee will determine the level of vesting taking account of performance conditions and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, pro-rating for time, where applicable.
Alternatively, participants may be allowed or required to exchange their awards for awards over shares in the acquiring company.
Awards under all employee share schemes will be expected to vest on a change of control and those which have to meet specific requirements to benefit from permitted tax benefits will vest in accordance with those requirements.
Mitigation The executive directors service contracts do not provide for any reduction in payments for mitigation or for early payment.
Other payments Payments may be made under the Companys all employee share plans which are governed by HMRC tax-approved plan rules and which cover certain leaver provisions.
There is no discretionary treatment of leavers under these plans.
In appropriate circumstances, payments may also be made in respect of accrued holiday, outplacement and legal fees.
Where a buy-out award is made under the Listing Rules then the leaver provisions would be determined at the time of the award.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a directors office or employment.
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will recognise and balance the interests of shareholders and the departing executive director, as well as the interests of the remaining directors.
Where the Remuneration Committee retains discretion it will be used to provide flexibility in certain situations, taking into account the particular circumstances of the directors departure and performance.

A An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt a t an nd A d Ac cc co ou un nt ts 2 s 20 01 15 5 76 Directors Remuneration Report Continued Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company The Remuneration Committee generally considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company when considering the executive directors remuneration.
When considering base salary increases, the Remuneration Committee reviews overall levels of base pay increases offered to other employees.
Employees are not actively consulted on directors remuneration.
The Company has regular contact with union bodies on matters of pay and remuneration for employees covered by collective bargaining or consultation arrangements.
Existing contractual arrangements The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office outside the policy in this report: where the terms of the payment were agreed before the policy came into effect: where the terms of the payment were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the payment was not in consideration of the individual becoming a director of the Company: or to satisfy contractual commitments under legacy remuneration arrangements.
For these purposes, the term payments includes the satisfaction of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Remuneration Committees discretion includes discretion to determine matters in accordance with the rules of the 2003 LTIP, including the extent to which awards under that plan may vest on the fulfilment of performance conditions, in the event of the voluntary winding up of the Company, on a change of control, on the death of a participant, and in good leaver circumstances.
The Remuneration Committee may make minor changes to this policy which do not have a material advantage to directors, to aid in its operation or implementation, taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek shareholder approval.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views The Remuneration Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with shareholders and welcomes feedback on executive and nonexecutive directors remuneration.
Prior to the 2014 LTIP being formally put to shareholders, the Remuneration Committee engaged with major shareholders and institutional investor bodies setting out the proposals and the detailed thinking and planning behind them.
