BACKGROUND TO REMUNERATION POLICY The Companys remuneration policy can be summarised as providing the median of market levels of xed pay but with the opportunity to earn upper quartile levels of remuneration if the executives deliver superior returns for shareholders.
Executive remuneration packages are structured so that they: are aligned to the Companys strategy to promote its long-term success: are aligned with the interests of shareholders: are competitive and provide a very clear bias to variable pay with stretching and rigorous performance measures and conditions: do not promote unacceptable behaviours or encourage unacceptable risk taking: include robust malus clawback provisions and holding periods which permit the recoupment of variable pay either if the payout was based on a material error or if the recipient commits gross misconduct: and take into account Company-wide pay and employment conditions.
The key changes being proposed are: increase the formal salary cap from median to 110 per cent of median of the top half of the FTSE 250 reecting the 25 per cent increase in the Companys market cap over the last year: and the introduction of the new LTIP.
THE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY The Remuneration Committee presents the Directors remuneration policy, which will be put to a binding vote at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 27 January 2016 and, subject to shareholder approval, will take immediate effect.

The starting point for the Committee will be to look at the general policy for executive directors as set out above and Group CEO Stephen Clarke structure a package in accordance with that policy.
Although the 000 Regulations provide that, technically, the caps on xed pay 3,562 Long-term Incentives 3,424 within the general policy will not apply on the recruitment of an 56% Annual Incentive Plan 54% executive, the Committee would seek not to exceed those caps in Total Fixed Pay practice.
