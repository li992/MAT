Introduction 74 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Report Annual Report on Remuneration Implementation of the Directors Remuneration Policy in 2016 A summary of how the Directors Remuneration Policy will be applied for the year ending 31 December 2016 is set out below.
Salaries While the normal base salary review date is 1 January, the Committee determined that the 2016 salary review date should be deferred until 1 April 2016 to better align it with the Groups financial results.
Executive Directors were not compensated for this three month deferral to the effective date.
It is intended that this change to the salary review date will apply going forward and be incorporated permanently and formally into the Directors Remuneration Policy at the 2017 AGM i. e. the end of the original three year policy period.
Current Executive Director salary levels are as follows: Increase 2016 2015 awarded from Salary Salary 1 April 2016 000 000 % R. Sharma 535 522 2.5 M. Waldner 317 317 - M. Anderson 254 248 2.5 Both Rakesh Sharma and Mark Anderson will receive an inflationary base salary increase of 2.5% from 1 April 2016, in line with the average increase awarded to the workforce as a whole.
As Mary Waldner announced her resignation from the Company, her salary would remain unchanged.
Directors pension entitlements The Group will continue to operate a defined benefit pension scheme arrangement for Rakesh Sharma until 5 April 2016 when the defined benefit scheme will close with provision based on a calculation by the scheme actuary.
A full review of pension provision for Rakesh Sharma will be carried out in advance of the next Directors Remuneration Policy review prior to the 2017 AGM.
Mark Anderson and Mary Waldner will continue to participate in the defined contribution scheme, receiving annual company contributions of up to 18% of salary with Mary Waldners contribution pro-rated up to cessation.
Non-Executive Directors fees The Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors fees will increase by 2.5% from 1 April 2016, in line with inflation and the average increase awarded to the workforce.
Annual bonus for 2016 The maximum bonus for Executive Directors in 2016 will continue to be 100% of base salary.
Consistent with the prior year, a maximum of 20% of salary will be payable for the achievement of an agreed profit target, a maximum of 60% payable for achievement of an agreed operating cash flow target, and a maximum 20% of salary will be payable for the achievement of strategic non-financial measures.
No bonus will be paid in respect of the non-financial element of the bonus if the Committee considers the Companys financial performance to be unsatisfactory or there is an exceptional negative event during or just after the relevant financial year.
As the Committee considers that commercial sensitivities restrict the disclosure of forward-looking annual bonus targets, retrospective disclosure of the targets will be provided in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
Long-term awards to be granted in 2016 Consistent with the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee intends to grant annual LTIP awards to Executive Directors in the form of shares worth 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for other Executive Directors during 2016 with the exception of Mary Waldner who is due to leave the company in 2016.
As per last years grant, 20% of awards will vest at median TSR ranking, increasing to 100% vesting for an upper quartile TSR ranking, measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
In addition to the TSR target, there is an underpin requiring an average growth of EPS after adjustments to exclude gains or losses on financial instruments and the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition.
For the 2016 awards, this will be reduced from 15% over the three-year performance period to 9% over the three-year performance period to reflect the challenging economic environment.
From 2016 onwards, all awards granted to Executive Directors will also be subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period, whereby net of tax awards vesting cannot normally be sold until at least the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.

4 The 2012 LTIP award which had been due to crystallise in 2015 did not vest and the aggregate gain made by the Directors under the LTIP during the year was nil.
Annual bonus for year under review Audited Annual bonuses in relation to 2015 were based upon the achievement of a sliding scale of underlying profit before tax and operating cash flow targets, as well as individual strategic objectives.
Financial targets were derived from the annual budgets approved by the Board.
They were adjusted where appropriate to provide an appropriate degree of stretch challenge and incentive to outperform.
Profit and cash are two of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured.
Please refer to pages 28 and 29 for details.
The bonus targets set by the Committee for 2015 were a maximum of 20% of salary subject to the achievement of 111.8m profit before tax and loss on fair value movements on derivatives and amortisation of intangibles on acquisition, and a maximum of 60% of salary subject to achieving an operating cash flow of 77.7m after capitalised development costs, capital expenditure, purchase of long-term incentive plan shares and the Committee exercising its discretion on movements in working capital to ensure working capital management throughout the financial year was in the short and long term interests of the Company.
The remaining 20% of the bonus potential reflected strategic goals.
Introduction 76 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Report Annual Report on Remuneration continued Annual bonus for year under review Audited continued The Committee assessed the achievement of performance against each target as follows: Actual Bonus Threshold Maximum achieved payable 000 000 000 % Underlying profit before tax 100,620 111,800 112,425 20% Operating cash flow 49,500 77,700 81,314 51% Both threshold profit and operating cash flow targets must be exceeded for any payment In addition, the Committee assessed performance against the strategic goals which were based on the: i completion of an organisational efficiency review: ii implementation of the segment re-organisation, iii key contract negotiations: iv enhancement of investor relations: v review of the Business Continuity Plans: vi book to bill ratio: and vii performance of sales and marketing.
The Committee determined that bonuses of 17.2%, 17.0% and 10.1% of salary max 20% should be payable to Rakesh Sharma, Mary Waldner and Mark Anderson respectively.

Total defined benefit pension entitlements Audited Under the defined benefit scheme, a pension equal to two-thirds of salary at retirement is provided at the normal retirement age of 63 years.
Where pensionable service is less than 20 years, the pension is calculated at one-thirtieth of the retirement salary for each year of service.
With the Groups consent, Executive Directors may retire from age 55.
After age 58, Group consent to early retirement is not required.
The pension is reduced in the event of early retirement.
In the event of death-in-service, a spouses pension of 33% of pensionable earnings is payable, together with an allowance for dependent children up to a maximum of 33% of pensionable earnings where relevant.
On the death of a retired Executive Director, a spouses pension of 50% of the Executive Directors pension is payable.
Once the pension is in payment, the part of the Executive Directors pension above the Guaranteed Minimum Pension will be increased each year in line with the increase in the retail price index, capped at 7.5% for service prior to 1 April 2008 and at 5% thereafter, above which increases are at the Trustees and the Groups discretion.
No Executives accrued direct benefits under defined benefit schemes during the year.
As Rakesh Sharma ceased accruing a direct benefit from 6 April 2014, his pension provision is currently determined on an annual basis by the scheme actuary such that it is equivalent in value to the value of defined benefits formerly accrued.
The defined benefit scheme will close from 5 April 2016.
Payments to past Directors Audited There were no payments made to past Directors during 2015.
Loss of office payments Audited There were no loss of office payments made to Directors during 2015.

The graph shows the value at the end of 2015 of 100 invested at the start of the evaluation period, in Ultra and in the Index.
