Disclosure also details outstanding awards to Directors.
Benefits: Taxable value of benefits received in the year by Executive Directors includes Company mobile phone, a car allowance, private health insurance and death in service cover.
Annual bonus: This is the total bonus earned in respect of performance during the relevant year.
For 2014 15 and 2013 14, the Committee set a minimum deferral requirement of 25% of the bonus earned.
For 2014 15, this deferral was equivalent to 122,144 for Mr Hopkins and 76,343 for Mr Clement.
For 2013 14, this was equivalent to 119,880 for Mr Hopkins and 74,925 for Mr Clement.
Further details of annual bonus awards for 2014 15 can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 89 and 90.
LTIP: The 2014 15 figure includes the estimated value of 2012 LTIP shares that vested on performance to 31 March 2015: 100% of the 2012 LTIP awards vested on performance.
The share price is the trailing three-month average share price to 31 March 2015 of 816.4 pence.
This will be reported in the 2015 16 Remuneration Report based on the share price on date of vesting.
Further details of the 2012 LTIP awards vesting can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 92.
The 2013 14 figure for Mr Clemett includes the value of 2011 LTIP shares at vesting.
As described in last years Remuneration Report, the value has been updated based on the share price on the date of vesting 3 August 2014 of 607.5 pence.
The value of LTIP awards vesting is higher than the value shown in the pay scenario charts on page 86 due to the impact of share price appreciation between grant and vesting.
Mr Clemett was awarded 1,960 SAYE options on 25 July 2014, and the value is the embedded value at grant, based on an exercise price of 4.59 set at 80% of the market value of a share at the invitation date.

88 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Overview 01-15 Strategy and performance 16-53Governance 54-104 Financial statements 105-147 Additional information 148-153 Base salary and pension In line with the remuneration policy, the Committee reviews base salaries annually with any changes normally taking effect from 1 April.
As foreshadowed in the Chairmans statement, during the year the Committee conducted a detailed review of the base salaries of the CEO and the CFO taking into account a wide range of factors including the external economic environment, Company and individual performance, experience, rates of salary for similar jobs in companies of a similar sector and size and overall impact on total remuneration.
Following its review and consultation with major shareholders and shareholder bodies, the Committee increased the CEOs salary from 419,020 to 450,000 a c. 7% increase and the CFOs salary from 261,890 to 275,000 a 5% increase from 1 April 2015.
The next salary review date for Executive Directors will be 1 April 2016.
For the year under review, the CEO and CFO received an employers pension contribution equal to 15% and 16.5% of basic salary respectively.
Following its review and consultation with shareholders the Committee increased the CEOs pension contribution from 15% to 16.5% of salary from 1 April 2015, consistent with that for the CFO.
Since April 2014, no further pension contributions have been made to Mr Clemett, but he receives instead an equivalent cash allowance of 16.5% per annum in lieu of pension.
For Mr Hopkins, the Company will make pension contributions up to the Annual Allowance and provide a cash allowance above this, up to 16.5% of salary.
The average salary increase across the Group for the year commencing 1 April 2015 is 5%.
Additionally all employees participate in annual bonuses and during the year LTIP awards were granted to a wider group of employees to further reinforce the strong performance culture.
Annual bonus scheme audited The Group operates an annual bonus scheme which provides for a capped variable performance-related bonus.
For 2014 15, the maximum bonus potential for the Executive Directors was set at 120% of basic annual salary.
The Committee sets a minimum deferral or investment each year into Workspace shares: for 2014 15 the Committee set a minimum deferral requirement of 25% of the bonus earned.
The preferred mechanism for meeting this deferral requirement is participant investment in the LTIP.
However, the Committee retains the discretion to mandate deferral of 25% of bonus earned which will vest after two years, subject to continued employment or allow executives to make an equivalent investment in the LTIP.
For 2014 15 the Committee allowed Executive Directors to make an equivalent investment in the LTIP.
The performance measures, targets and outcomes for 2014 15 Executive Director annual bonuses are shown below.
Against each measure the bonus starts to be paid on the achievement of a threshold performance, increasing on a straight-line basis until stretch performance is achieved, at which point the full bonus potential for that measure is earned.

25% of earned bonuses will be invested in the LTIP.
2015 16 annual bonus framework The framework for 2015 16 is unchanged from 2014 15.
The Committee intends to disclose incentive targets retrospectively at the time that bonuses are paid provided that they are not considered to be commercially sensitive at that time.
