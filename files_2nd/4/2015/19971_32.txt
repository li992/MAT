However, there will be full disclosure of the original targets set and the extent to which they have been achieved on a retrospective basis at the end of the performance period.
The Committee will also provide a broad update on progress in these areas after each year of the four-year performance period see page 90 of this report for an overview of progress to date against these three BPMs for up to 25% of the 2014 and 2015 PSP awards.

A holding period provides further alignment between executives and shareholders and is ahead of current market practice in this area.
Annual bonus and LTIP metrics On pages 20 and 21 of the Annual Report we set out the Companys indicators of strategic progress and KPIs.

For a ranking below median none of this element will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting of this element for a ranking at or above the upper quartile.
One quarter of this award is based on EPS compound annual growth as measured on a point to point basis by comparing the EPS for 2017 against 2013.
None of this element will vest if growth is less than 4% p. a. growth and 100% will vest for 8% p. a. growth or better and one quarter on BPMs, all measured over four financial periods.
The Committee has the power, under the approved remuneration policy, to adjust the PSP vesting outcome if it considers this is inconsistent with the Groups overall performance, see page 83 for more detail.
