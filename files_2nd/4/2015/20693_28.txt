As a result, the Remuneration Policy has been drafted on the basis that the cap will not be legally applicable to the Company.
In practice though, the Company has applied this cap since IPO on a voluntary basis, and will continue to do so as appropriate.

86 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices Long-term incentives The Company introduced the PSP in 2015.
The first awards under this plan were granted on 2 March 2015, subject to IPO.
On this date, the Company granted awards in the form of nil-cost options which are subject to a three-year performance period and a further two-year holding period.
In addition, Pre-IPO Awards in the form of conditional awards were granted to the Executive Directors and certain other senior managers on the same date in recognition of their contribution to the Group prior to the IPO.
These latter awards are subject to a performance period to 31 December 2016.
The awards were granted on the basis that the participants bear employers NICs up to the current rate of 13.8 per cent.
The awards were also subject to a condition that they would lapse if the participant, or any connected person, sold or otherwise disposed of any shares held by them at IPO within 12 months of that date.
Details of the performance measures and targets in respect of awards made during 2015 are set out below and on the next page: Awards made during the year 2015 audited Holding % vesting at Performance Performance period 1 2 3 4 Name Type of award Date of grant No of shares Face value threshold measures period ends ends 50% based on absolute TSR PSP award Phillip Monks 02 03 2015 351,562 674,999 10% 31 12 17 02 03 20 5 nil-cost option 50% based onEPS Pre-IPO Award 100% based on Phillip Monks conditional 02 03 2015 684,163 1,313,593 20% 31 12 16 N A absolute TSR award 50% based on PSP award absolute TSR James Mack 02 03 2015 218,750 420,000 10% 31 12 17 02 03 20 5 nil-cost option 50% based onEPS Pre-IPO Award 100% based on James Mack conditional 02 03 2015 613,828 1,178,550 20% 31 12 16 N A absolute TSR award 1 Shows the maximum number of shares that could be received, before any dividend equivalents, if the awards vested in full.
2 Face value has been calculated using the final offer price of the Companys shares at IPO 192p, which has been multiplied by the maximum number of shares that would vest if all performance measures and targets were met.
Actual value at vesting will depend on actual share price at the time of vesting, and any dividend equivalents if any payable on vested shares.
3 In the case of the nil-cost options, assumes that either the TSR or EPS performance measure threshold is met in respect of one half of the award, and that the other half of the award lapses.
4 Vesting is also subject to underpin performance conditions.
Further detail on performance conditions is provided at pages 88 and 89.
5 Nil-cost options will lapse on 2 March 2025.
In addition to the awards noted above, 51.37 per cent of the award made under the 2015 AIP will be deferred into shares.
This is a blended rate based on 15 per cent of the amount earned in the period up to IPO being deferred, and 60 per cent of the amount earned in the period following IPO being deferred.
The number of shares comprising the deferred element will be calculated on the basis of the average share price shortly prior to grant, and will be disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.

The result was achieved consistent with the Groups risk appetite.
How will growth be measured?
The offer price for the Companys shares at IPO 192p will be compared to the two-month average TSR for the final two months of 2017, with compounding applying to the mid-point of the averaging period.

The offer price for the Companys shares at IPO 192p will be compared to the two-month average TSR for the final two months of 2016, with compounding applying to the mid-point of the averaging period.
PSP awards to be made in the current year 2016 In 2016, the Remuneration Committee intends to make PSP awards in the form of nil-cost options to Phillip Monks and James Mack with a face value at the time of the award of 135 per cent of base salary.
With the exception of changing the absolute TSR performance measure to a relative performance measure, the awards will be made on the same basis as in 2015.
The move to a relative TSR measure was considered appropriate by the Remuneration Committee as this reduces the exposure of participants to re-ratings both within the sector and of companies more generally.
On that basis, half of the award will be subject to a relative TSR condition with 20 per cent of that part vesting at median versus the constituents of the FTSE 350 excluding Investment Trusts and the Company itself rising to full vesting of that part for upper quartile performance.
The other half of the award will again be subject to an EPS scale with 20 per cent of that part vesting at an EPS of 30p rising to full vesting of that part for an EPS of 37p.
In both cases, the same underpins will apply as for the 2015 PSP awards nilcost options.

Further detail is provided at page 84.
2 Awards made under the SIP are also included under Taxable benefits.
Consistent with other employees, a one-off award was made under the SIP to both Executive Directors following IPO in recognition of their contribution to the business.
This has been valued at the share price on the date of grant 2.41.
These awards vested immediately on grant and are included in the share interests table on page 93.
3 Details of Phillip Monks participation in the Sharesave Plan 2015 invitation can be found on page 89.
As the average closing share price over Q4 2015 2.51 is lower than the option price of 2.52, the option granted to Phillip Monks has not been included under Taxable benefits.
4 Taxable benefits also includes the write-off of loans to Phillip Monks and James Mack of 108,317 and 31,279 respectively which was approved by the Remuneration Committee in February 2015.
These loans were made originally to settle the tax payable by each of the Directors in respect of equity incentives awarded to them prior to the IPO.
5 Pension is the cash value of defined contribution or cash equivalent.
6 The Market adjusted allowance became payable following IPO.
7 The Annual bonus figure represents the value of the total bonus.
A proportion of the bonus will be deferred into shares under the Deferred Share Plan.
This will be at a blended rate based on 15 per cent being deferred into shares for the part of the bonus earned in the period up to IPO, and 60 per cent being deferred into shares for the part of the bonus earned for the period following IPO.
See page 86 for detail on the bonus outcome.
8 The Directors held certain shares pre-IPO which converted into ordinary shares on IPO.
The reported gains have been calculated on the market value of shares held at IPO 1.92 less the actual cost of any shares bought pre-IPO, regardless of whether such shares were acquired as an investment or an incentive.
As part of the IPO, the Directors were subject to certain lockup arrangements in respect of their shares, as set out in the IPO Prospectus.
The lock-up in respect of two-thirds of each Directors holding will expire on the first anniversary of the IPO, whilst the remaining one-third will expire on the second anniversary of the IPO.
