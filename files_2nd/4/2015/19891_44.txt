Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Governance 81 Value of hypothetical holdin g DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION OF DIRECTOR UNDERTAKING THE ROLE OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER The table below shows the percentage change from 2014 to 2015 for base salary, bonus and benefits excluding pension for both the CEO and all UK and Dutch management in Unilever.
The subset of UK and Dutch management has been used as a fair representation of our dual listing status.
Benefits not including % change from 2014 to 2015 Salary Bonus pension a b CEO 11.3% 55.8% 14.5% c UK and Dutch management 10.3% 77.8% 3.8% a Calculated using the data from the Executive Directors single figure table on page 71. b It is noted that although the CEOs salary has increased by 11.3% in the above table, this is due to currency movements, rather than a change in base salary which was 1,010,000 in both 2014 and 2015.
Currency movements also had a similar impact on benefits and bonus.
c In addition to the above, while the table shows that the average base salary costs for all employees increased by 10.3% for the subset of UK and Dutch Management, this is driven by a proportionately larger increase in the total headcount during the year.
The average increase was approximately 12.3% if the 2014 UK and Dutch management population remain constant.
The same applies for both benefits and bonus numbers where, on a constant basis, the average benefit provision increased by 78.9% rather than 3.8% and the bonuses increased by 108.4% rather than the 77.8% disclosed.
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SPEND ON PAY The chart below shows the relative spend on pay compared with dividends paid to Unilever shareholders and core earnings.
Core earnings represent the net profit attributable to Unilever shareholders, adjusted for non-core items.
Over time, both core earnings and core earnings growth provide a good reference point to compare spend on pay.

THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code requirement D. 2.1, the Committees terms of reference state it shall be comprised of three Non-Executive Directors other than the Chairman, who may be appointed as an additional member.
The quorum for a meeting of the Committee is two Non-Executive Directors.
During 2015 the Committees membership changed significantly, due to directors choosing not to put themselves forward for re-election, and being appointed.
In April 2015, Kees Storm and Paul Walsh chose not to put themselves forward for re-election as Non-Executive Directors.
Ann Fudge succeeded Paul Walsh as chair of the Committee and Nils Andersen joined the Committee as a member at this time.
From 30 April 2015 until 1 July 2015 the Committee comprised three Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman, Michael Treschow.
Vittorio Colao joined the Committee on 1 July 2015, immediately upon his appointment as a Non-Executive Director becoming effective.
The Committee reviewed its terms of reference during the year.
The Committees revised terms of reference are contained within The Governance of Unilever, and are also set out on our website.
com corporategovernance Pursuant to the Committees self-assessment carried out in 2014, a specific remuneration module was added to the induction programme for Non-Executive Directors in 2015.
As part of the internal Board evaluation carried out in 2015, the Boards evaluated the performance of the Committee.
The Committee also carried out an assessment of its own performance in 2015.
Whilst overall the Committee members concluded that the Committee is performing well, the Committee has agreed to further enhance its effectiveness and that of the Boards by keeping the Boards informed of the progress of the Committees review of the executive remuneration framework in 2016, including any consultations with shareholders, in a timely manner so as to further enhance the Boards decision-making around proposals to extend or modify the Remuneration Policy.
82 Governance Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2015 ADVISERS While it is the Committees responsibility to exercise independent judgement, the Committee does request advice from management and professional advisers, as appropriate, to ensure that its decisions are fully informed given the internal and external environment.
The Committee appointed Tom Gosling of  PwC to provide independent advice on various matters it considered.
The wider PwC firm has also provided tax and consultancy services to Unilever including tax compliance, transfer pricing, R&D and grant claims, other tax related services, contract compliance reviews, finance controllers training, internal audit advice and secondees, third party risk and compliance advice, sustainability assurance and consulting, and financial due diligence.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK, which is available at www.
com The Committee is satisfied that the PwC engagement partner and team, which provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with Unilever N. V. or Unilever PLC that might impair their independence.
The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.
The fees paid to PwC in relation to advice provided to the Committee in the year to 31 December 2015 were 30,000.
This figure is calculated based on time spent and expenses incurred for the majority of advice provided, but on occasion for specific projects a fixed fee may be agreed.
During the year, the Committee also sought input from the CEO Paul Polman, the Chief Human Resources Officer Doug Baillie and the SVP Global Head of Reward Peter Newhouse on various subjects including the remuneration of senior management.
No individual Executive Director was present when their own remuneration was being discussed to ensure a conflict of interest did not arise.
The Committee also received legal and governance advice from the Group Secretary Tonia Lovell.
CLARIFICATION STATEMENT After publication of our Directors Remuneration Report 2013 the Committee issued a clarification statement at the request of The Investment Association previously: IMA and ABI.
The statement is available on our website.
The statement confirms that we will not make share awards higher than the maximum awards stated in our Remuneration Policy for existing and newly hired Executive Directors without prior shareholder approval.
It further clarifies that awards to newly hired Executive Directors to buy out remuneration items on leaving the previous employer as provided in the new hires policy will be done under the GSIP.
Consequently, under such exceptional circumstances, the aggregated GSIP share awards for a newly hired Executive Director may be higher than the maximum annual award set out in the Remuneration Policy.
As stated in the Remuneration Policy in relation to new hires, we will inform shareholders of any such buyout awards when announcing the appointment.
