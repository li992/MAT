DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT ANNUAL STATEMENT Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to provide an introduction to the Remuneration Committee report which appears on pages 51 to 71.
There have been no material changes to the Remuneration Policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting.
However, the Committee continues to keep the Policy under review to ensure that it remains appropriate to the Companys circumstances.
It is important that remuneration packages are competitive but not excessive.
Accordingly, we would not expect total remuneration to fall within the upper quartile relative to comparable organisations over the long term.
The Committee reviews executive directors salaries annually.
Charles Wigoder received an increase of 13.5% to 420,000 per annum largely to compensate for the cessation of company pension contributions after reaching the limit of lifetime allowance under current HMRC rules.
After consulting research on current salary levels amongst FTSE 250 chief executives the Committee awarded Andrew Lindsay an increase of 16.7% to 455,000 per annum.
Both gentlemen will receive the Companys standard increase of 1.5% for the year to 31 March 2016.
Nick Schoenfeld joined the Board on 7 January 2015 as Chief Financial Officer following a thorough search using independent consultants.
We are confident, therefore, that his salary of 400,000 per annum represents a fair reflection of current market conditions.
At present executive directors do not receive annual bonuses in either cash or shares.
The Committees view is that the grant of market price share incentives at periodic intervals provides long term commonality of interest between executives and shareholders.
In line with current practice, such grants are valued for illustrative purposes in the accounts at one-third of face value although in reality at date of grant their economic value is much lower.
Andrew Lindsay was granted options over 300,000 shares at 13.37 vesting in three tranches over seven years.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the length of exercise period is sufficient to deal with any claw back issues that may arise.
Nick Schoenfeld was granted options over 300,000 shares at 12.62 on his appointment.
In the light of recent events, and to ensure that his compensation fairly reflects future performance, the Remuneration Committee, exceptionally, intends to reissue these options following the announcement of the 2015 results.
Finally, I should like to thank our shareholders for their support and constructive engagement over the past year.
Julian Schild Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 22 June 2015 50 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements REMUNERATION POLICY REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding the policy relating to the total remuneration paid to the executive directors and members of senior management of the Company.
It meets regularly to review and set all elements of the remuneration paid to the executive directors of the Company, including pension rights, and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for other senior management of the Company.
It also exercises all the powers of the Board in relation to the operation of the Companys share incentive schemes, including the grant of options and the terms of those grants.
The Committee met formally five times during the year and details of attendance at this meeting are provided in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 38.
The Committees principal activities during the year included: reviewing and approving executive remuneration packages, including for the new Chief Financial Officer: monitoring senior management remuneration packages: reviewing and approving the issue of share options to the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, certain employees and independent distributors of the Company: and determining the performance conditions attached to the issue of share options.
REMUNERATION POLICY INTRODUCTION The Companys overall remuneration policy remains to ensure that the executive directors and other senior managers are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their individual contribution to the overall long term performance of the Company, in a manner that ensures that the Company is able to attract, motivate, and retain executives of the quality necessary to ensure the successful management of the Company.
The Companys current remuneration policy is based on the principle that the fortunes of the directors and senior management should be directly aligned with those of external shareholders, and this is predominantly achieved through the use of share incentive plans.
The Remuneration Committee currently believes that share incentive awards granted at market value provide a far more transparent method by which to align directly each directors interests with all shareholders when compared to the payment of regular annual cash bonuses based on short-term performance measures and or the granting of free shares with little or no downside risk to the participant.
In the light of the focus on share incentive awards rather than cash bonuses the Remuneration Committee believes it continues to be appropriate to grant meaningful share awards in blocks rather than using a phased approach as set out in the Corporate Governance Code.
The outstanding awards made under share incentive schemes prior to the approval of the Companys remuneration policy at the AGM in July 2014 were broadly consistent with that policy and, for the avoidance of doubt, will remain in place until exercise.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 51 REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED The remuneration policy described in this part of the report was prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 8 of the Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended in August 2013.
The policy was duly approved by the Companys shareholders at the AGM on 15 July 2014 and it is intended to apply for the three years beginning on that date.
However, the Committee will continue to review the remuneration policy annually to ensure it remains appropriate for the Companys requirements and consistent with market practice.
The Committee determined that no amendments to the policy were required during the current year.

CHOICE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES The Committee chose the performance measures described in the table above as these are deemed to align directly the executive directors interests with those of all shareholders in an easily understood and transparent manner.
The performance measures comprise a combination of relative total shareholder return TSR, Adjusted EPS excluding share incentive scheme charges and amortisation of intangible assets and service number growth measures.
Adjusted EPS is considered appropriate as a key strategic objective of the Company if it is to drive profitable growth in each year.
It also provides a balance to relative TSR, which considers shareholder value creation and reflects market expectations of future performance, and absolute service number growth which, when achieved responsibly, will also drive long-term value creation.
The use of relative TSR and Adjusted EPS growth measures provides a combined focus on the Companys financial performance and shareholder value creation.
Targets for Adjusted EPS are set by reference to internal budgeting plans and external market expectations.
TSR targets are set on a standard practice, median to upper quartile ranking range.
Only 30% of share incentive awards vest for threshold levels of performance.
The Committee wishes to retain the ability to change the composition of performance conditions for future grants to directors should this be required in order to reflect appropriately the strategic responsibilities of the particular director concerned.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 55 REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY The bar chart below seeks to illustrate the potential rewards available under the proposed remuneration policy for the coming financial year under varying levels of performance.
For the purposes of the illustration the values assume the maximum grant of share incentive awards during the year and no annual cash bonuses are paid.
However, as outlined in the above table, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to bring or carry forward any unused annual share incentive scheme allowances.
Therefore, share incentives might not be awarded during a particular year, and or share incentive awards may be larger than 200% of base salary in any one year.
The amounts included for share incentive awards are based on one third of the market value of the shares under option, although the awards have no realisable value inherent at the date of grant.
The amounts for pensions and benefits included in the fixed remuneration figure have been calculated on the same basis as payments made for the year ended 31 March 2015.
The potential rewards available for ontarget performance under share incentive schemes have been based on 30% vesting of share incentive awards.
All performance measures or targets for share incentive scheme awards relate to more than one financial year.

The Committee considers it unlikely that such discretion would be used in the event of a participant ceasing to be employed by the Company as a bad leaver.
In relation to unvested awards made under the Joint Share Ownership Plan JSOP for a good leaver, the Remuneration Committee will specify the extent to which such awards should vest having regard to the length of time since the award was acquired and the directors performance to that date.

58 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION The Committees approach to recruitment is to pay a sufficient amount necessary to attract the best candidates to the particular role.
In determining these amounts the Committee will be mindful of, inter alia, prevailing market rates, the chosen candidates skills, knowledge and experience, and their existing location and position.
Where the candidate has variable remuneration arrangements with a previous employer that will be lost on leaving employment, the Company will consider offering a sign-on award in compensation for the value foregone, either as an award under an existing share incentive scheme or a bespoke award under the Listing Rules exemption available for this purpose.
The face and or expected values of the award s offered will not materially exceed the value ascribed to the award s foregone, and would normally follow the same vesting timing and form i. e. cash or shares save that the Committee may award the whole of the value in shares, at its discretion.
The application of performance conditions would be considered and, where appropriate, the awards could be made subject to claw-back in certain circumstances.
For material amounts the Committee would, where practicable, consult with key institutional shareholders ahead of committing to make any such sign-on awards, and in any event a full explanation of any amounts awarded, an explanation of why it was necessary and a breakdown of the awards to be made will be announced to the markets at the time of granting.
For the avoidance of doubt, should a new director be internally promoted from the Companys senior management team they will not be expected to give up or amend any element of remuneration granted to them prior to becoming a director which is inconsistent with the remuneration policy set out above.
Any new executive directors remuneration package would include the same elements, and be subject to the same constraints, as those of the existing executive directors as outlined in the above policy table.

Non-executive directors fees are periodically reviewed by the Board in the light of any changes in role and prevailing market rates for Non-executive directors in similarly sized listed companies.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 59 REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS The Chairman of the Committee engages with certain of the Companys largest shareholders who have expressed an interest in being consulted in relation to remuneration matters to understand their expectations and monitor any changes in their views.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP The Committee considers pay levels across the organisation when setting remuneration for all directors both executives and non-executives.
However this review is undertaken against a background of ensuring that the prevailing market rates for all levels of employee in the organisation are taken into account in order to attract, retain and motivate the best employees at each level.
In relation to directors, specific account is taken of any change in the level of responsibility of the director whether through a change in role or the increased size of the Company or an increase in experience and knowledge of the Company and its markets which may not be relevant to roles elsewhere in the Company.
The Company does not deem it appropriate to formally consult with employees regarding the determination of the directors remuneration policy as the broad remuneration structure for directors mirrors that of all employees, i. e. the payment of a base salary, benefits and share incentive scheme awards at market price.
However, employees have the opportunity to make comments on any aspect of the Companys activities through an employee survey and any comments made which are relevant to directors remuneration would be considered by the Committee.
60 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION This report, which has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012 and Schedule 8 of the Large and MediumSized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended in August 2013 the Regulations, has been approved by the Board of directors for submission to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The sections under the headings Single Total Figure of Remuneration, parts of Share Incentive Schemes and Pension Schemes have been subject to external audit.
SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION The Committee recommended increases to the annual base salaries of Executive Chairman Charles Wigoder and Chief Executive Andrew Lindsay during the year.
Mr Wigoder received an increase of 13.5% to 420,000 per annum.
This increase primarily reflected the fact that the Company would no longer be making pension contributions on behalf of Mr Wigoder as he reached the limit of the lifetime allowance for pension contributions under current HMRC rules during the year.
Mr Lindsay received an increase of 16.7% to 455,000 per annum reflecting his strong personal performance and the incremental responsibility resulting from the significant increase in the size and profile of the Company during the previous year following the entering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013.
Nick Schoenfeld joined the Board on 7 January 2015 as Chief Financial Officer with a base salary of 400,000 per annum.
In determining the level of Mr Schoenfelds base salary the Committee was mindful of the need to attract a high calibre candidate through an open-market recruitment process who would successfully contribute to driving the Company through the next stage of its development.
In addition, share options with performance conditions attached were issued to Mr Lindsay and Mr Schoenfeld during the year, details of which are set out below in this report.
The non-executive directors receive fees for their services, the details of which are described below.
The level of these fees was unchanged during the year.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 61 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015 AUDITED Audited details of directors remuneration for the year are as follows: TAXABLE PENSION SHARE SALARY & FEES BENEFITS CONTRIBUTIONS INCENTIVES TOTAL DIRECTOR 000 000 000 000 000 Charles Wigoder 420 5 19 - 444 Julian Schild 35 - - - 35 Andrew Lindsay 455 4 40 1,676 2,175 Nick Schoenfeld 94 1 9 - 104 Melvin Lawson 12 - - - 12 Michael Pavia 21 - - - 21 Chris Houghton 153 2 15 - 170 TOTAL 1,190 12 83 1,676 2,961 The amounts relating to benefits received relate principally to the provision of private health insurance and Company motor vehicles to the directors.
Mr Lindsay holds share incentive awards under the Companys Joint Share Ownership Plan JSOP where final vesting was determined as a result of the achievement of performance conditions relating to the financial year to 31 March 2015.
However, it should be noted that as at 31 March 2015 Mr Lindsay had not exercised his right to realise the gain made under the JSOP as the vesting period for the award commenced on 1 April 2015.
Details of the calculation of the theoretical gain included in the table above are set out below in this report.

62 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES The Company has two share option plans and a Joint Share Ownership Plan the JSOP.
The first share option plan and the JSOP are available to employees, and the second share option plan is available to the Companys independent distributors.
The Employee Share Option Plan Subject to serving the requisite probationary period, all employees are eligible to participate in the Companys employee share option plan and be issued with market price options over shares in the Company, the number of shares being related to their seniority and length of service.
The Committee recognises that the collective contribution of all employees is critical to the success of the Company and continues to believe that the granting of share options at all levels within the organisation generates employee loyalty and helps to ensure that staff turnover is kept to a minimum and below the levels seen across the industry for employees passing their probationary periods.
The Joint Share Ownership Plan Awards made through the JSOP provide participants with a joint interest in tranches of shares which are held until vesting by an independent employee benefit trust the JSOP Share Trust.
The trustee of the JSOP Share Trust is Barclays Wealth Trustees Guernsey Limited.
The value to participants of awards made under the JSOP is based upon the growth in the value of the Companys shares from the date of grant in a similar manner to the value achieved through participation in the conventional share option scheme.
However, participants in the JSOP only receive value to the extent that the share price increase exceeds a compound annual growth rate of at least five per cent the Hurdle Rate.
On vesting, participants receive any gain over the Hurdle Rate on the tranche of shares in which they hold a joint interest, with all the gain below the Hurdle Rate being retained by the JSOP Share Trust.
In addition, awards made under the JSOP to executive directors will only vest to the extent applicable performance conditions relating to the financial and trading performance of the Company are met.
It is currently considered unlikely by the Committee that further awards will be made under the JSOP.
The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide incentives and rewards to those distributors who have been most successful in gathering new Members for the Company.
These distributors, whilst not being employees of the Company, are nevertheless essential to its future growth, and it is the opinion of the Committee that this plan can in some cases be an important factor in their motivation.
During the year options were issued to 36 distributors under a share option promotion scheme which requires the participants to achieve performance conditions in order for the options to vest.
These performance conditions will involve distributors consistently gathering Members throughout the three-year vesting periods of the options.
Statement of Directors Shareholding and Share Interests audited Details of the directors shareholdings are set out in the Directors Report on page 72.
As set out in the Future Remuneration Policy Table of the Companys Remuneration Policy, a target level of share ownership is not stipulated for directors, however, subject to personal circumstances and existing shareholdings they are encouraged to retain a proportion of shares issued as a result of the exercise of share incentive awards.

The performance conditions in relation to the JSOP award were all fully achieved as at 31 March 2015 and therefore Mr Lindsay at the time of exercise will receive any increase in value of the 500,000 shares over the share price on the date of grant 4.55 plus an annual compound growth rate of five per cent.
The table below sets out the compound annual growth rates that were required to be achieved during the vesting period across the three performance conditions.
1 PERCENTAGE OF EPS GROWTH TSR GROWTH SERVICE NUMBER 500,000 SHARES GROWTH 100% 7.5% 7.5% 7.5% 50% 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% 2 50%-100% 5.0%-7.5% 5.0%-7.5% 5.0%-7.5% NIL 5% 5% 5% 1 compound annual share price growth assuming 22p annual dividend 2 percentage of shares to be calculated on a straight line basis The average annual EPS growth achieved during the vesting period was 13.0%, the average annual TSR growth 21.1% and the average annual Service number growth 15.9%.
The total unrealised gain in relation to the JSOP award as at 31 March 2015 was therefore approximately 1.7m being the increase in value of the 500,000 shares over the 553p exercise price given the closing share price on 31 March 2015 of 888.22p.
In practice had Mr Lindsay been in a position to exercise his right under the JSOP on 31 March 2015, 188,703 shares would have been transferred to Mr Lindsay in settlement of the JSOP Share Award.
A further 300,000 share options were awarded to Mr Lindsay on 1 July 2014 under the terms of the Employee Share Option Scheme.
These options will vest in three discrete tranches of 100,000 options over three, five and seven year periods, each representing shares with a face value of 1.3m equating to approximately 294% of Mr Lindsays annual base salary.
However, it should be noted that as market price options their value to Mr Lindsay rests solely on the increase in the Companys share price from the point of grant.
In accordance with guidance in the FRCs Lab Project Report: Reporting of pay and performance issued in March 2013, the value of market price share options can be measured as one third of the market value of the shares under option.
The value of each tranche of these options granted to Mr Lindsay under this measure would therefore represent approximately 98% of his annual base salary.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 65 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED The extent to which these options will vest will depend on the average growth, weighted 40% by reference to adjusted EPS growth, 40% by reference to relative TSR growth and 20% by reference to service number growth, achieved across the three annual performance measures summarised in the table below: PERCENTAGE OF ADJUSTED RELATIVE SERVICE NUMBER 1 OPTIONS VESTING EPS GROWTH TSR GROWTH GROWTH 100% CPI 12.5% Upper quartile 10.0% 30% CPI 5.0% Median 5.0% 2 30%-100% CPI 5.0%-12.5% Median Upper quartile 5.0%-10.0% Nil CPI 5.0% Below median 5.0% 1 Company TSR performance relative to the FTSE 350 excluding Investment Trusts 2 Percentage of shares to be calculated on a straight line basis The base year for the Adjusted EPS performance measure will be the Adjusted EPS for the year ended 31 March 2014.
Mr Nick Schoenfeld Options over 300,000 ordinary shares were granted to new Chief Financial Officer Nick Schoenfeld on his appointment to the Board on 7 January 2015 under the terms of the Employee Share Option Scheme.
These options will vest in five discrete tranches over three, four, five, six and seven year periods as set out in the table above.
The largest tranche of options represents shares with a face value of 1.3m equating to approximately 315% of Mr Schoenfelds annual base salary.
However, it should be noted that as market price options their value to Mr Schoenfeld rests solely on the increase in the Companys share price from the point of grant.
The value of these options granted to Mr Schoenfeld under this measure would therefore represent approximately 105% of his annual base salary for the year.
Under this measure the value of each of the other four tranches of options represents approximately 53% of Mr Schoenfelds annual base salary.
However, in the light of the fall in the Companys share price following the release of the Trading Update on 16 April 2015, which set out details of certain issues related to historical accounting estimates predating Mr Schoenfelds appointment to the Board, the Committee has decided to cancel the options issued to Mr Schoenfeld on 7 January 2015 and proposes to re-issue a similar number of options to him following the announcement of the Companys results for the year ended 31 March 2015.
It is expected that the new award will comprise market value options over 300,000 shares and will follow the same vesting profile as the cancelled options issued to Mr Schoenfeld on 7 January 2015.
The new options will be made subject to performance conditions which will be broadly similar to the structure of those attached to the options issued to Andrew Lindsay on 1 July 2014 described above.
66 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Mr Chris Houghton The share options granted to former Finance Director Chris Houghton on 10 December 2008 and 26 June 2009 were fully exercised on 4 August 2014.
In accordance with the rules of the Employee Share Option Plan, the Company elected to satisfy the exercise of 91,200 of these options by transferring 71,521 shares to Mr Houghton, representing the value of the gain made on these options at the prevailing market price for the shares.
Following the exercise of these options, Mr Houghton sold 71,521 Ordinary Shares on 4 August 2014 at 1400p per share.
In addition to the above transactions, on 4 August 2014 Mr Houghton also exercised the remaining options over the 8,800 shares and acquired the shares at an exercise price of 340p per share.
The 50,000 options issued to Mr Houghton on 26 June 2012 and 50,000 on 16 December 2013 lapsed without being exercised on 3 October 2014 as a result of Mr Houghton leaving the Board of the Company.
At the year end the Companys share price was 888.22p and the range during the financial year was 888.22p to 1790.20p.
Details of all the directors interests in the shares of the Company are set out in the table in the Directors Report on page 72.
DIRECTORS CONTRACTS OF SERVICE There are Service Contracts or Letters of Appointment for Charles Wigoder 5 May 2011, Andrew Lindsay 5 May 2011, Nick Schoenfeld 9 October 2014, Julian Schild 25 May 2010, Melvin Lawson 27 September 2006, and Michael Pavia 13 December 2006.
These provide notice periods of three months on either side for the non-executive directors and the following notice periods for the executive directors: Mr Wigoder twelve months on either side and Mr Lindsay and Mr Schoenfeld each with six months on either side.
PENSION SCHEMES AUDITED The Company makes no contributions to the pensions of any current directors except to Mr Wigoder, Mr Lindsay and Mr Schoenfeld, details of which are shown within the table on page 62.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH SHOWING TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN The following graph shows the Companys performance measured by total shareholder return compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Telecommunications Index and the FTSE 350 for the period 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2015.
As noted in previous years, the FTSE All Share Telecommunications Index was initially selected at a time when a larger proportion of the Companys revenues related to the supply of telephony services: only approximately 16% of the Companys revenues are now generated from such telephony services.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 67 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED The FTSE 350 Index is included as a further comparator in the light of the fact that there are no sector specific indices containing directly comparable quoted companies supplying a broad range of services similar to that provided by the Company.
TABLE OF HISTORICAL DATA The following table shows the total remuneration, as defined by the Regulations, and the amount vesting under share incentive schemes as a percentage of the maximum that could have been achieved, in respect of the Chief Executive.
The Chief Executive was Mr Andrew Lindsay in all years shown in the table.
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Single figure of total remuneration 000 473 1,150 399 432 2,175 Percentage of maximum of share 100 100 N A N A 100 incentives vesting in year % The gains on share incentive schemes vesting in the years ended 31 March 2011, 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2015 represent the gains on share incentive awards based on the prevailing share price as at the earlier of the date of exercise of the share options and the year end in which the awards vested.
No share incentive awards vested to the Chief Executive in the years ended 31 March 2010, 2013, and 2014.
68 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE REMUNERATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE The following table shows the change in certain aspects of the remuneration of Mr Lindsay.
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015 2014 CHANGE 000 000 % Salary 455 390 16.7 Benefits 4 3 33.3 The Companys pay review for the year ended 31 March 2015 which took effect on 1 April 2014 awarded average percentage increases in salaries to employees of 2.0%.
The size of the increase awarded to Mr Lindsay reflected his strong personal performance and the incremental responsibility resulting from the significant increase in the size and profile of the Company during the previous year following the entering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013.
In addition the Committee was mindful of the prevailing market rates for remuneration packages of Chief Executives at similarly-sized companies.
At other levels within the Company increases of a comparable relative proportion to Mr Lindsays were made where appropriate to similarly reflect increases in responsibility for certain individuals.
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPEND ON PAY The Regulations require an illustration of the significance of the Companys expenditure on pay in the context of its operations.
Set out below is a summary of the Companys levels of expenditure on pay and other significant cash outflows to key stakeholders.
CASH OUTFLOWS TO KEY STAKEHOLDERS 2015 2014 CHANGE 000 000 % Wages and salaries 23,698 20,666 14.7 Dividends paid 30,230 23,921 26.3 Corporation tax and social security costs paid 11,506 10,140 13.5 STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR Base Salaries The Committee recommended that increases to the base salaries of the executive directors for the forthcoming year ended 31 March 2016, with effect from 1 April 2015, be made as described below.
Executive Chairman Charles Wigoders annual base salary was increased from 420,000 to 426,300, the annual base salary of Chief Executive Andrew Lindsay was increased from 455,000 to 461,825, and Nick Schoenfeld the new Chief Financial Officer was increased from 400,000 to 406,000, these increases broadly reflecting the average increase in the base salaries of the majority of the Companys employees.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 69 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED Share Incentive Schemes Following the recent fall in the share price, the Committee feels that it is important to ensure that employees and distributors at all levels remain motivated and committed to the Company.
It therefore believes that it is in the best interests of the Company to offer all employees and distributors with existing options that currently have an exercise price above the current market price the chance to have their existing options cancelled and to receive new options in their place.
The maximum number of options that could therefore be cancelled and replaced is 712,950 excluding the 300,000 share options being reissued to the new Chief Financial Officer as set out above.
Irrespective of when the original options were granted, none of these replacement options will be exercisable earlier than three years from the new date of grant, thus helping to retain the employees concerned.
Full details of the proposed award will be set out in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2016.
Other benefits Directors remuneration in relation to pension contributions and other benefits for the year will be made in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
SHAREHOLDER VOTE AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT As set out in the Remuneration Policy, the Committee encourages dialogue with the Companys major shareholders regarding remuneration matters and will endeavour to consult with these shareholders ahead of any significant future changes to the remuneration policy.
Details of the votes cast in relation to the remuneration policy and report at last years AGM are set out below: 2014 AGM % To approve the Remuneration Policy Votes cast in favour & Chairman discretion 36,373,789 79.76 Votes cast against 9,230,504 20.24 Total 45,604,293 100.00 To approve the 2014 Remuneration Report Votes cast in favour & Chairman discretion 43,226,678 98.71 Votes cast against 563,317 1.29 Total 43,789,995 100.00 In addition to the above there were 838,888 votes withheld in relation to the approval of the Remuneration Policy and 2,653,186 votes withheld in relation to the approval of the 2014 Remuneration Report.
The Committee understands that a significant factor in relation to the relatively high number of votes cast against the Remuneration Policy related to concerns raised around the flexibility perceived to be inherent in the policy itself, particularly in relation to there being no specific upper award limit in place for share incentive scheme awards in any one year.
70 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The Committee recognises that the Remuneration Policy allows for larger one-off share incentive scheme awards than might normally be expected.
However, the Committee would like to take the opportunity to reassure shareholders of its intention to use this inherent flexibility only after the careful consideration of shareholders best interests.
The Committee would also like to highlight that whilst individual awards to directors in any one year might be considered large, unlike other listed companies, there is no expectation that awards will be made automatically on an annual basis.
Furthermore, awards made will typically have longer than normal vesting periods of up to seven years.
As has been offered in previous years, the Chairman of the Committee would be pleased to meet with shareholders to discuss any particular issues and discuss the Committees overall approach to remuneration.
Shareholders are also able to attend the Companys AGM in order to ask any questions they have around remuneration and other matters.
THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE The Committee acknowledges the new requirement set out in the Corporate Governance Code issued by the FRC in September 2014 the new Code for companies to put in place arrangements that will enable them to recover or withhold variable pay when appropriate to do so.
The new Code applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2014.
The Committee does not currently propose to amend the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the last AGM within the three year period of application originally envisaged in order to reflect these new requirements.
Nonetheless, the Committee will remain mindful of the requirements of the new Code in this area when making future share incentive awards to directors.
It is therefore likely that provisions to withhold or recover such share incentives in the event of fraud or malus committed by the director concerned will be included in the terms of such awards in future.
