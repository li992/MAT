Shire Annual Report 2015 81 Directors remuneration report continued Part 2 Annual Report on Remuneration a Implementation of Directors Remuneration Policy in 2016 In 2016, the Executive Director and Non-Executive Director remuneration policies will be implemented as follows: Executive Director remuneration policy Fixed elements Base salary Base Salary as at April 1 2015 2016 % change 1 Flemming Ornskov $1,350,000 $1,688,000 25% 2 Jeff Poulton $575,000 $592,000 3% 1 Effective July 1, 2015.
2 Effective from the date of his appointment April 29, 2015.
CEO: In light of Dr. Ornskovs exceptional performance since his appointment as CEO, the increased size and complexity of the business and the need for Dr. Ornskovs compensation package to be positioned competitively against Shires peer groups, the Committee awarded a 25% increase in Dr. Ornskovs salary from $1,350,000 to $1,688,000 effective from July 1, 2015.
Dr. Ornskovs salary will be frozen at this level for three years and he will not be eligible for a further salary increase until July 1, 2018.
The Committee recognizes that the 25% increase to Dr. Ornskovs salary is atypical when considered in the context of normal market practice and, to reflect this, the Committee has committed to freezing Dr. Ornskovs salary at this level for the next three years including in the event that the Baxalta deal is successfully completed.
CFO: Following the year end review, the Committee made the decision to award Jeff Poulton a base salary increase of 3%, to give himan annual base salary of $592,000 effective April 1, 2016 in line with the salary increase effective date for all other employees.
Thisdecision reflected strong corporate performance and excellent leadership.
Fixed elements Retirement and other benefits The implementation of policy in relation to pension and benefits is unchanged and in line with the disclosed policy in the Appendix of thisreport.
Short-term incentives EAIP There is no change to the level of EAIP award opportunity for Executive Directors maximum of 180% of base salary for the CEO and 160% of base salary for the CFO.
A scorecard approach will continue to be used for the 2016 EAIP and this will be comprised of 75% financial and 25% non financial performance measures.
This weighting recognizes the critical importance of financial results to our shareholders, bonus affordability andthe important role that non financial performance plays in the success and growth of the Company.
These measures are aligned with and support our four key strategic drivers for 2016 of Growth, Innovation, Efficiency and People.
The targets themselves are considered to be commercially sensitive on the grounds that disclosure could damage the Companys commercial interests.
However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next years Annual Report on Remuneration to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time.
Financial and non financial targets are set at the start of the performance year and are approved by the Committee, which believes the targets are suitably challenging, relevant and measurable.
As and when the proposed combination with Baxalta closes, revised targets for the remainder ofthe performance period will be presented to the Committee for approval.
The revised targets will be challenging in the context of the combined entity.
Thefinal outcome for the year will be assessed on performance against the targets up to the close of the combination with Baxalta andsubsequent performance against the revised targets post combination.
The 2016 corporate scorecard is set out below: Strategic Drivers Weighting Financial KPIs weighting Financial 75% Net Product Sales 25% 1 Non GAAP EBITA 30% 1 Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC 20% Strategic Drivers Weighting Non Financial KPIs Pipeline & Pre-commercial 15% Growth Innovation Optimize In-line assets Develop early portfolio Progress pipeline and acquire Obtain Topline data core adjacent assets Organizational Effectiveness 10% Efficiency People Enhance Supply Robustness Assess and monitor employee engagement Achieve targeted reductions in Develop top talent and ensure robust externalspend succesion plans are in place Achieve pre-established integrationmetrics 1 This is a Non GAAP financial measure.
82 Shire Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Long-term incentives LTIP Following the year end review, the Committee made the following 2016 LTIP award decisions which are in line with the disclosed policy in the Appendix of this report.
Face value of threshold vesting Face value of maximum vesting Face value of maximum vesting 1 1 2016 LTIP award Award type % of 2016 salary % of 2016 salary 000s SAR 83% 414% $6,996 Flemming Ornskov PSU 62% 311% $5,247 SAR 77% 384% $2,209 Jeff Poulton PSU 58% 288% $1,657 The face value allocation between SARs and PSUs is estimated as it is determined on an expected value basis upon grant.
20% of the award will be payable for threshold performance.
There is no vesting below this performance level.
100% of the award will be payable for maximum performance, which would result in the total award vesting, with straight line vesting within this performance range.
In all cases, awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the vesting of the award.
The 2016 LTIP awards will continue to be tested against two independent measures at the end of a three year performance period: 50% 2 2 Product Sales targets and 50% Non GAAP EBITDA targets.
The Committee will also use a Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin at the end of the performance period to ensure vesting levels reflect the sustainability of revenue and profit growth.
2 The 2016 LTIP targets for Product sales and Non GAAP EBITDA are based off the Companys 2018 forecast and are considered appropriately challenging by the Committee.
The weightings, threshold and maximum target figures are provided in the table below.
Performance measures Weighting Threshold 20% of award vesting Maximum 100% of award vesting Product Sales 50% $8,184m $9,480m 2 Non GAAP EBITDA 50% $3,928m $4,696m 2 Product Sales and Non GAAP EBITDA targets are expressed as absolute dollar values for consistency between the measures.
2 The Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin will be set at a minimum of 10.625% for the 2016 LTIP award.
If Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC over the performance period is below this level no vesting will occur under the LTIP, subject to Remuneration Committee discretion.
This will ensure awards only pay out for a return in excess of Shires Weighted Average Cost of Capital and maintain focus on quality of earnings and sustainable returns both in the existing core business and from any future M&A activity.
The Committee has determined that the calibration of these proposed targets is sufficiently challenging without incentivizing inappropriate risk-taking by management, taking into account both Shires long range plans as well as brokers forecasts.
As and when the proposed deal with Baxalta closes, revised targets will be presented to the Committee for approval, based on the long range plan of the combined entity.
The revised targets will be challenging in the context of the combined entity and will ensure maximum payout only occurs in the event that significant value from the combination is delivered to shareholders.
The revised targets will be disclosed to shareholders when they have been determined, as well as subsequently in the 2016 Directors Remuneration Report.
A two year holding period will apply following the three year vesting period for both PSUs and SARs, making a total vesting period of five years before shares can be sold.
Clawback and malus arrangements are in place for awards to cover situations where results are materially misstated or in the event of serious misconduct.
Chairman and Non-Executive Director remuneration policy 2016 fee levels for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors remained unchanged from 2015.
Basic fees 2016 2015 Chairman inclusive of all committees 450,000 Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director inclusive of Non-Executive Director fee 98,000 Non-Executive Director 93,000 The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors will continue to receive 25% of their total fees in the form of shares.

EAIP 2015 outcomes In determining EAIP awards for the Executive Directors, the Committee considers performance against each of the financial and non financial performance measures within the Shire corporate scorecard, as well as personal performance during the year.
Corporate scorecard The EAIP outcome is calculated by way of a weighted average of the corporate scorecard outcomes of the financial and non financial performance measures.
For each performance measure, outperformance or underperformance is measured as a percentage of target which is then converted into the corporate scorecard multiple.
If the weighted average across all the measures falls below 85% then none of the award pays out.
If the weighted average across all the measures is 120% or more of target, then the maximum opportunity of the award may pay out, subject to personal performance.
As such, there are not actual threshold and stretch performance values for the independent measures as the assessment takes into account performance across all the measures in determining the scorecard outcome.
However, for illustrative purposes, indicative threshold and stretch performance values are shown for each of the financial measures to serve as a guide to the performance range.
Target performance is considered by the Committee to require an excellent level of performance.
Details of actual corporate scorecard outcomes against the 2015 performance measure targets are set out in the table below.
2015 performance results in a weighted average corporate scorecard multiplier of 137%.

EAIP award outcomes The corporate scorecard multiplier determines the bonus funding for all individuals within the plan.
Once agreed, each individuals bonus including Executive Directors is then determined based on their individual performance over the course of the year, which results in anadjustment to the corporate scorecard outcome based on an agreed matrix.
As a result, bonus outcomes of 180% of salary for Dr. Ornskov and 106% of 2015 salary for Mr. Poulton were determined by the Committee.

88 Shire Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information f Directors shareholdings and scheme interests subject to audit The Committee believes that employee share ownership is an important means to support long-term commitment to the Company and the alignment of employee interests with those of shareholders.
The interests of the Executive Directors and other senior executives are closely aligned with those of other shareholders in this regard through the operation of the Companys long-term incentive plan and, for Executive Committee, the deferral of one quarter of any EAIP award into shares for a period of three years.
These remuneration elements constitute a significant proportion of their individual remuneration packages.
In addition, to ensure that there are appropriate tools to retain Executive Directors and to encourage alignment with shareholders over the long-term through increased shareholding and ownership, a two year holding period post the three year performance period which applies to both PSUs and SARs, is in place.
The CEO, CFO and other members of the Executive Committee are encouraged to own shares in the Company equivalent to 200%, 150% and 100% of base salary, respectively, within a five year period following their appointment.
All shares beneficially owned by an executive or deferred under the EAIP count towards achieving these guidelines.
The Committee reviews share ownership levels annually for this group.
Current shareholding levels for Directors are set out in the table below and show that the shareholding guideline for the CEO has been achieved.
The CFO is new in role and so has not yet met the requirement but has five years in which to do so.

TSR is calculated as the change indexed between the fourth quarter TSR in the relevant year and the base year.
The FTSE 100 Index reflects the 100 largest quoted companies by market capitalisation in the United Kingdom and has been chosen because the FTSE 100 represents the broad market Index within which the Companys shares are traded.

In particular, the long-term incentive figures relate to any awards that vest shortly after the end of the relevant financial year.
Note Dr. Ornskov did not have any long-term incentive awards vest until 2015. h Percentage change in CEO remuneration The following table shows the percentage change in the base salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus of the CEO between the current and previous financial year compared to the average percentage change for all other employees.
Percentage change between 2014 to 2015 1 Salary and fees Taxable benefits Short-term incentives 2 CEO 17% -49% 17% 3 All other employees 10% 136% 20% 1 Due to timing of the 2015 year-end process, the actual short-term incentive figures for all other employees had not been finalized by the date of this report.
Therefore, the 2015 short-term incentive figures represent target figures multiplied by the 2015 Corporate Bonus Modifier score approved by the Committee in early February, which represents the Companys best estimate of actual bonus outcomes.
2 Reflects the 2014 and 2015 remuneration for Flemming Ornskov as reported in the single total figure of remuneration table in Part 2 b.
3 Reflects the average change in remuneration for all other employees globally that were annual bonus eligible.
To help minimise distortions in the underlying data, certain adjustments have been made.
In particular, the figures have been prepared on the basis of permanent employees who have been employed with the Company for the two preceding calendar years to provide for a consistent employee comparator group.
This approach is consistent with the disclosure presented in the 2014 Annual Report on Remuneration.
CEO As previously explained in Part 1 of this report, the increase in the CEOs salary is due to the 25% increase in his salary from $1,350,000 to $1,688,000, effective July 1, 2015.
This increase was awarded in light of Dr. Ornskovs exceptional performance since his appointment as CEO, the increased size and complexity of the business and the need for Dr. Ornskovs compensation package to be positioned competitively against Shires peer groups.
The decrease of 49% in the CEOs taxable benefits is because the CEO was provided with temporary living support and associated tax assistance in 2014 under the Companys mobility policy, which he is no longer eligible for.
The increase in the CEOs short-term incentive is due to his short-term incentive being calculated as a percentage of his higher base salary.
Shire Annual Report 2015 91 Directors remuneration report continued All other employees The increase in salary and fees from 2014 to 2015 is primarily due to annual merit increases, as well as multiple inflationary increases inLatin American countries.
The significant increase in taxable benefits is due to a much greater number of employees being eligible to receive bonuses under the Companys retention program in 2015 than in 2014, in order to retain key personnel during the uncertainty ofthe AbbVie deal.
The difference in the short-term incentives figure is due to actual short-term incentive payments in 2014 being compared to target figures multiplied by the 2015 Corporate Bonus Modifier score in 2015. i Relative importance of spend on pay The Company considers employee remuneration costs in the context of the general financial performance and position of the Company, including when determining the annual salary increase budget, the annual equity grant budget and annual bonus funding for the organization.
The following graphs set out for 2014 and 2015 the overall spend on pay, shareholder distributions dividends and share buybacks and 1 for further context, Non GAAP EBITDA from continuing operations.

The complete remuneration policy as approved by shareholders can be found within the 2014 Directors Remuneration Report.
The overall remuneration package for the Executive Directors is designed to provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable, performance-related components, with a significant element of long-term variable pay given the long-term nature of the business.
In determining the positioning of overall remuneration, the Committee takes into consideration pay levels against a Global Biotech peer group and a US BioPharma peer group.
These peer groups reflect the need for Shire to be aligned with the Biotech and BioPharma sectors in which the Company operates, the markets in which the Company competes for talent, and the geographies in which the Company operates.
In addition, the FTSE 50 excluding financial services is used as a secondary reference point, given Shires position as a UK listed company.
The Committee is satisfied that the composition and structure of the remuneration package is appropriate and does not incentivize undue risk taking.

In addition, awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the underlying financial performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the vesting of the awards.
Malus and clawback arrangements are in place for past awards to cover situations where results are materially misstated or in the event of serious misconduct.
Where an individuals employment terminates, the PSP rules provide for unvested long-term incentive awards to lapse except as set out below.
Under PSP rules, where an individual is determined to be a good leaver, unvested long-term incentive awards vest upon termination subject to performance against applicable performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, pro rating for time.
Any Committee determination will take into account a number of considerations, in particular performance and other circumstances relating to their termination of employment.
Good leaver reasons include retirement in accordance with the Companys retirement policy, ill health, injury or disability, and redundancy or in other circumstances that the Committee determines.
Pro rating for time will be calculated on the basis of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period during which the executive was employed or would have been employed had the executive remained in employment throughout the notice period as a proportion of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period.
The PSP rules provide that unvested awards will normally only vest on a change in control to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied, unless the Committee determines otherwise, and would be reduced where less than two years have elapsed from the relevant grant date.

c Recruitment remuneration policy The following table sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the appointment of an Executive Director and the approach to be adopted by the Committee in respect of each component.
Area Policy and operation The Committees approach when considering the overall remuneration arrangements in the recruitment of amember of the Board from an external party is to take account of the Executive Directors remuneration package in their prior role, Overall the market positioning of the remuneration package, and to not pay more than necessary to facilitate the recruitment of the individual in question.
Fixed elements The salary level will be set with reference to the Companys Global Biotech and US BioPharma peer groups, with a FTSE 50 excluding financial services group used as a secondary reference to ensure the positioning is appropriate.
Base salary, retirement and The Executive Director shall be eligible to participate in Shires employee benefit plans, including coverage under all otherbenefits executive and employee pension and benefit programs in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans, as may be amended by the Company in its sole discretion from time to time.
The Company may meet certain mobility costs, including but not limited to relocation support, expatriate allowances, temporary living and transportation expenses in line with the prevailing mobility policy and practice for senior executives.
Short-term incentives The appointed Executive Director will be eligible to earn a discretionary annual incentive award in accordance with the rules and terms of Shires Executive Annual Incentive Plan.
The level of opportunity will be consistent with that stated in section a of this policy.
Long-term incentives The Executive Director will be eligible for performance based equity awards in accordance with the rules and terms of Shires Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The quantum will be consistent with that stated in section a of this policy.
Replacement awards The Committee will consider what replacement awards if any are reasonably necessary to facilitate the recruitment of a new Executive Director in all circumstances.
This includes an assessment of the awards and any other compensation or benefits item that would be forfeited on leaving their current employer.
The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards such that overall they are not significantly more generous in terms of quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited.
In determining quantum and structure of these commitments, the Committee will seek to provide broadly equivalent value and replicate, as far as practicable, the timing and performance requirements of remuneration foregone.
The Committee will seek to ensure that a meaningful proportion of the replacement awards which are not attributable tolong-term incentives foregone will be delivered in Shire deferred shares, released at a later date and subject to continued employment.
If the Executive Directors prior employer pays any portion of the remuneration that was deemed foregone, the replacement payments shall be reduced by an equivalent amount.
Replacement share awards, if used, will be granted using the Companys existing long-term incentive plan to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of this plan if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding awards made in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to their original terms.
If promotion is part way through the year, an additional top up award may be made to bring the Executive Directors opportunity to a level that is appropriate in the circumstances.
98 Shire Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information d Service contracts and termination arrangements Executive Directors The Committees policy on service contracts and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below.
As an overriding principle, it is the Committees policy that there should be no element of reward for failure.
The Committees approach when considering payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for termination, performance, contractual obligations of both parties as well as share plan and pension scheme rules.
Notice period The Committees policy is that Executive Directors service contracts should provide for a notice period of 12months from the Company and the Executive Director.
The Committee believes this policy provides an appropriate balance between the need to retain the services of key individuals for the benefit of the business and the need to limit the potential liabilities of the Company in the event of termination.
Flemming Ornskovs contract does not have a fixed term but provides for a notice period of 12 months in line with this policy.
His contract is dated October 24, 2012.
Contractual payments Executive Directors contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination by way of payment in lieu of notice, at the Companys discretion.
Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
Payments in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months base salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months pension contributions, car allowance and other contractual benefits.
There is no contractual entitlement to annual incentive payments in respect of the notice period any award is at the Committees absolute discretion, performance related and capped at the contractual target level.
Payment in lieu of notice would be made where circumstances dictate that the Executive Directors services are not required for the full 12 months of their notice period.
Contracts also allow for phased payments on termination, which allow for further reduction in payments if the individual finds alternative employment outside of the Company during the notice period.
Retirement benefits Normal treatment to apply as governed by the rules of the relevant pension plan: no enhancement for leavers will be made.
Short-term incentives Where an Executive Directors employment is terminated after the end of a performance year but before the payment is made, the executive will remain eligible for an annual incentive award for that performance year subject to an assessment based on performance achieved over the period.
Where an award is made the payment may be delivered fully in cash.
Noaward will be made in the event of gross misconduct.
Where an Executive Directors employment is terminated during a performance year, a prorata annual incentive award for the period worked in that performance year may be payable subject to an assessment based on performance achieved over the period.
The Committees policy is not to award an annual incentive for any portion of the notice period not served.
The relevant plan rules provide that any outstanding deferred shares will vest in accordance with the regular vesting period, except for where an Executive Directors employment is terminated for cause in which case they will lapse.
In the event of a variation in the equity share capital of the Company, demerger, a special dividend or distribution, or any corporate event which might affect the value of an award, the Committee may make adjustments to the number or class of stock or securities subject to the award.
Long-term incentives The treatment of unvested long-term incentive awards is governed by the rules of the relevant incentive plan, as approved by shareholders.
Where an individuals employment terminates, the LTIP rules provide for unvested long-term incentive awards to lapse except as set out below.
Under the LTIP rules, where an individual is determined to be a good leaver, unvested long-term incentive awards will vest at the normal vesting date subject to performance against applicable performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, prorating for time.
Prorating for time will be calculated on the basis of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period during which theexecutive was employed as a proportion of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period.
Where an executive does not work during their notice period, the Committee may apply prorating by reference to the date the notice period would have expired.
Where an Executive Directors employment is terminated or an Executive Director is under notice of termination for any reason at the date of award of any long-term incentive awards, no long-term incentive awards will be made.
In the event of a variation in the equity share capital of the Company, demerger, a special dividend or distribution, or any corporate event which might affect the value of an award, the Committee may make adjustments to the number or class ofstocks or securities subject to the award and, in the case of an option, the option price.
Change in control In relation to unvested deferred annual bonus awards, the Deferred Bonus Plan rules provide that unvested awards will normally vest on a change in control.
In relation to unvested long-term incentive awards, the LTIP rules provide that unvested awards will normally only vest on a change in control to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied and would be reduced where more than a year remains until the relevant vesting date, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
The Committees policy is that contracts of employment should not provide additional compensation on severance as aresult of change in control.
Shire Annual Report 2015 99 Directors remuneration report continued External appointments Executive Directors are permitted to hold one fee-paying external non-executive directorship, subject to prior approval by the Board.
Anyfees received from such appointments are retained by the Executive Director.
During 2015, there were no external non-executive directorships held by the Executive Directors.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment and are appointed by the Board ordinarily for a term of two years.
Their initial appointment and any subsequent re-appointment are subject to election, and thereafter annual re-election by shareholders.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to compensation for loss of office.
All Non-Executive Directors are subject to a three month notice period.
All service contracts and letters of appointments are available for viewing at the Companys registered office.
e Shareholder engagement The Committee takes the views of shareholders very seriously and is committed to ongoing dialogue with the Companys shareholder base, which has a significant transatlantic element.
This can take a variety of forms including meetings with major shareholders to consider significant potential changes to policy or specific issues of interest to particular shareholder groups, other dialogue to update shareholders and receive their feedback on planned refinements to arrangements, and annual voting on the DRR.
f Remuneration of other employees The Committee recognizes that remuneration has an important role to play in supporting the implementation and achievement of the Companys strategy and ongoing performance.
When making remuneration decisions in respect of the Executive Directors, the Committee is sensitive to pay and employment conditions across the Company, in particular in relation to base salary decisions where the Committee considers the broader employee salary increase budget.
The Committee approves the overall annual bonus funding for the Company each year and has oversight over the grant of all LTIP awards across the Company.
In addition, annual performance for theExecutive Directors is measured against the backdrop of the same corporate scorecard that is appropriately used to assess performance 1 across the organization.
This assessment of corporate scorecard performance includes a review of Non GAAP EBITA, Non GAAP 1 Adjusted ROIC and product sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of the annual bonus corporate modifier on the full year results.
Given Shires diverse employee base, employing over 5,500 people in 50 locations, the Committee does not consider it appropriate to consult with employees over the remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
However, many of the Companys employees are shareholders through the Companys all employee share plans, and are therefore able to express their views on director remuneration ateach general meeting.
The Company also periodically carries out an employee engagement survey which provides employees the opportunity to feedback their views on a variety of employment related matters, including remuneration.
The diagram set out on the following page illustrates how our remuneration policy and arrangements reinforce the achievement of Shires success and ensures that executives and employees are focused on delivering the same core objectives.
