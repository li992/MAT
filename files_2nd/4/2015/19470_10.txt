Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2015 Directors remuneration report Annual statement Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to provide the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 27 December 2015.
As we are not making changes to the Directors remuneration policy there will not be a vote on this at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting AGM.
The annual statement and annual report on remuneration, which provide details of the remuneration earned by Directors in the year to 27 December 2015 and how the policy will be implemented for the 2016 financial year will, however, be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the AGM.
Tony Hughes Remuneration outcomes in 2015 For the year under review, and reflecting the strong financial performance of the Group in challenging market conditions, the annual bonus paid out at 69% of the maximum for each of the executive Directors.
The long-term incentive awards granted in 2013 which are due to vest in March 2016 are based on earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR performance targets over the three years to 27 December 2015, these will vest at 100% in respect of the EPS element and 85% in respect of the TSR element.
Remuneration policy for 2016 The Remuneration Committee Committee continually reviews the executive remuneration policy to ensure it promotes the attraction, retention and incentivisation of high calibre executives to deliver the Groups strategy.
It is equally important that the policy reflects shareholders views and the changing landscape in which the Group operates.
In light of the changes made to the remuneration policy last year made largely as a result of the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP reaching the end of its 10 year life which were approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM, the remuneration policy will remain unchanged for 2016.
I hope that you will be supportive of the resolution to approve the annual statement and the annual report on remuneration at this years AGM.

45 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2015 Directors remuneration report continued Annual bonus payments audited The annual bonus for the year under review for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer was primarily based on profit before tax PBT performance.
The structure of the targets and the actual performance against the targets was as follows: 23% of maximum potential bonus was payable for achieving target PBT, increasing to 100% for achieving 106% of target PBT.
The actual result was 102% of target PBT.
The full details of the targets have not been disclosed on the grounds of commercial sensitivity.
Although the Committee had committed to disclose bonus targets only when the numbers ceased to form a comparative PBT result i. e. the 2013 targets would be disclosed in the 2015 Remuneration Report, the Committee has decided to accelerate this disclosure so that targets for the prior year are also presented.
As such, for this year only, targets for the last two years i. e. 2013 and 2014 are set out below and going forward, targets for the prior year only will be disclosed.
Annual bonus payments for the year ended 28 December 2014 The annual bonus targets and outturn based on Group PBT, excluding exceptional or non-trading items for the year ended 28 December 2014 were as follows: Group PBT targets % of maximum Threshold 75.5m 0% Threshold 75.5m 23% 77.5m 68% 78.5m 82% Maximum or 80.5m 100% pro-rata payout between the targets.
The actual trading PBT of 78.1m amounted to 75% of maximum bonus payable.
Annual bonus payments for the year ended 29 December 2013 As per the approach to disclosing annual bonus targets retrospectively detailed above the annual bonus targets and outturn based on Group PBT, excluding exceptional or non-trading items for the year ended 29 December 2013 were as follows: Group PBT targets % of maximum Threshold 64.3m 0% Threshold 64.3m 23% 66.3m 68% 67.3m 82% Maximum or 69.3m 100% pro-rata payout between the targets.
As the actual PBT 72.7m exceeded the maximum target, the maximum annual bonus was payable.

Consistent with best practice, the LTIP enables award holders to benefit from the payment of dividend equivalents but only to the extent that the underlying share awards vest.
The accounting charge for these amounts are spread over the relevant vesting period as part of the IFRS 2 Share-based payments charge see note 20.
As disclosed above, and consistent with past practice, dividend equivalents on the 2013 awards, to the extent they vested, will be settled by way of cash payments.
