Fidessa group plc 26 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Directors and corporate governance report continued Annual report on remuneration Membership, meetings and evaluation During the year the Committee comprised Ron Mackintosh Committee Chairman, Elizabeth Lake, John Worby and Ken Archer.
All members of the Committee are independent non-executive directors.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder, to the extent disclosed in this report, conflict of interest arising from cross-directorships, or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Chairman and executive directors may attend Committee meetings by invitation.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
As announced by the Company on 11th January 2016, Ron Mackintosh stepped down as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee with Ken Archer assuming that role and also becoming a member of the Nominations Committee, both with effect from 8th January 2016.
The performance of the Committee was evaluated as part of the Board evaluation process during the year and the conclusion was that the Committee was functioning effectively.
Responsibilities The Committee operates within its terms of reference, which are reviewed and, if necessary, updated annually and are available at www.
The Committee is responsible for determining the policy and application for remuneration, other benefits and terms of employment, including performance-related bonus schemes and oversight of share plans, for executive directors, senior management and the Chairman.
Remuneration consultants During the year, the Committee took independent advice from its retained remuneration advisers, New Bridge Street NBS, an Aon Hewitt company.
NBS is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and has signed up to its Code of Conduct, which requires its advice to be objective and impartial.
NBS provided advice on general remuneration matters.
NBS does not provide other services to Fidessa.
The Aon group provides other services to Fidessa, namely insurance broking and pensions provision, but the Committee continues to believe that this does not create a conflict of interest The Committee regularly reviews the effectiveness of the advice received from NBS and the Committee is satisfied that the advice given during the year under review is objective and impartial.
The Committee maintains appropriate contacts with potential alternative remuneration advisers should a change be required.
For the year under review, NBS received fees of 9,000 in connection with its work for the Committee.
Remuneration details In accordance with the Regulations, the tables below set out the remuneration for each director.

He is entitled to the same benefits as other executive directors and for a limited period was eligible to a relocation allowance subject to a maximum of 20,000 gross related to rent and removal costs.
Andy participates in the annual bonus from the date of appointment, on similar terms as his predecessor with the entitlement for 2015 pro-rated to reflect his period of service.
50% of the annual bonus is payable in the form of deferred shares using the DABP.
In addition he received a DABP award in compensation for pay foregone from his previous employer.
The specific details of each component are set out over the following sections of the report.
Andy Malpass ceased to be the Chief Financial Officer on 26th October 2015 but remained an executive director for the full financial year and was assessed on a consistent basis throughout.
His bonus for 2015 will be payable on the normal payment date.
In addition to the above, Andy Malpass received fees from Kainos Group plc of 33,000 during the financial year for his role as a non-executive director of Kainos Group plc.
Fidessas approach to annual bonuses for 2015 was consistent with the remuneration policy approved by shareholders and the approach used since 2013.
The benefits received by the executive directors are life insurance, ill health income protection and private medical insurance.
The item in the column headed other comprises the matching shares awarded under the SIP.
The table below sets out the bonus thresholds and percentages for the directors.
Percentage Operating profit payable above Annual bonus 000 Operating profit threshold the threshold amount Chris Aspinwall 2015 37,034 19,500 2.15% 377 2014 38,147 18,100 2.2% 441 Andy Malpass 2015 37,034 19,500 0.8% 140 2014 38,147 18,100 0.8% 160 Andy Skelton 2015 37,034 19,500 0.8% 26 Pro-rated for period of service The executive directors annual bonus was a flat percentage above a threshold of the operating profit as presented to the Operating Board as disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, excluding items that the Committee considers to be exceptional or inappropriate.
When setting both the threshold and the flat line percentage the Committee took into account the directors on target earnings i. e. salary and bonus for the year and the projected operating profit for the year.
The 2010 EGRIP awards reached the end of their measurement period in September 2015 and failed to vest.
The performance targets for the EGRIP are as set out in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
Vesting of the awards would have required three performance conditions to be satisfied but none succeeded.
The total shareholder return target was very narrowly missed whilst both the cumulative diluted earnings per share target and the requirement to outperform the techMARK All-Share Index were materially missed.
There are no further awards outstanding under the EGRIP.

This award was to replace remuneration he forfeited upon leaving his previous employment on a broadly similar basis in terms of expected value, but with a longer timeframe.
In addition, certain directors received awards to equally match shares purchased under the SIP.
The tables below set out the details of those awards.

Directors shareholdings The executive directors shareholding guidelines have been structured to encourage executive directors to acquire and maintain a meaningful shareholding in Fidessa.
For executive directors this is a minimum value equal to 100% of salary.
The values of Chris Aspinwalls and Andy Malpass shareholdings have been substantially greater than the guideline throughout 2015 and several multiples of their respective salaries.
Andy Skelton, having only recently been appointed as Chief Financial Officer, will be building his shareholding so that he satisfies the guideline over the coming years through the retention of vested incentive awards net of tax and market purchases.
There is no shareholding guideline for the non-executive directors.

The Board believes that the techMARK All-Share Index, of which Fidessa is a constituent, provides the best benchmark for comparison.

As a software business with a strategy focused on organic development, its primary costs are related to its employees.
The strategy also delivers a stable margin and strong cash flows.
The cash generation has allowed Fidessa to distribute the majority of profit after tax to shareholders in the form of annual and special dividends.
The profit and corporation tax figures have been included to provide greater context to employee remuneration and the total distributions to shareholders.

The Committee also takes into account sensitivities in relation to the salary increases across the wider workforce.
Salary increases may also include use of the DABP.
Any increase will be set out in the 2016 Annual Report.
Benefits The benefits received by the directors will remain substantially unchanged from 2015, being life insurance, ill health income protection and private medical insurance.
The remainder of Andy Skeltons relocation allowance will be paid in the initial months of the year.
Annual An annual bonus will be paid to the executive directors in accordance with the directors remuneration bonus policy and the operation method followed in 2015.
The threshold operating profit and the percentage payable on operating profit greater than the threshold will be set to provide a similar overall outcome for on target earnings and material adjustments to these parameters are unlikely.
An interim bonus payment will be made after the half year results are announced.
The performance measure for, and the operation of, the annual bonus for 2016 is not being disclosed in this report as that information is deemed to be a forecast and therefore commercially sensitive.
That information will be disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report.
Long-term It is proposed that the Committee may approve the granting of awards to the executive directors incentives under the PSP no greater than the maximum permitted under the approved Directors Remuneration Policy and the terms of the relevant share plan.
The performance targets for awards made under the PSP will be based on the satisfaction of an earnings per share growth performance condition, as described in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, or such other parameters as may be agreed with major shareholders as part of the five year review.
Pension The current directors will continue to not participate in the pension scheme.
Other The directors will continue to be awarded matching shares as a result of their participation in the SIP.
In relation to the Chairman and non-executive directors, it is proposed that their fees will be reviewed to take into account fees paid by listed companies with a similar market capitalisation and also their time commitment and responsibilities.
Finally, as previously announced, it was agreed that Andy Malpass will retire from the Board in February 2016 having remained on the Board after the appointment of his successor to enable a well-managed handover of responsibilities to his successor.
Andy Malpass is not expected to work full-time until his retirement in February 2016 and will receive a salary only for days worked during that period and that salary will be unchanged from the day-rate equivalent of his 2015 salary.
He will continue to receive his usual benefits until his retirement but will not receive a bonus for the time worked during 2016.
Payments will be made on the normal payroll dates.
Unvested share incentive awards under the SIP will be forfeited.
Approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by Ken Archer Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 12th February 2016
