In coming to this decision, consideration was given by the Remuneration Committee of the salary settlement for the general UK workforce and also the overall performance of the Company.
As explained in last years remuneration report, salaries of those Directors who were relatively newly appointed to their role Andy Parker as Chief Executive and Nick Greatorex as Group Finance Director were set deliberately below the market lower quartile by the Committee on the understanding that, subject to their performance in role, their salaries would move closer to the market lower quartile in future years.
The Board has been pleased with the performance of both Andy Parker and Nick Greatorex and this is reflected in the salary decisions for 2016.
Nick Greatorexs salary has been increased to 410,000: this will be reviewed again at the end of 2016.
Andy Parkers salary has been increased to 600,000 and the Committee believes that this is now appropriately positioned in line with our remuneration policy.
As illustrated in the charts below, Andy and Nicks salaries remain at the lower end of similar sized FTSE companies.
The increases for Andy and Nick were communicated with our top shareholders and the feedback received was supportive and positive.

The comparison of 2014 and 2015 are based purely on Andy Parkers remuneration.
As explained in our report in 2014, the salary of Andy Parker was set deliberately below the market lower quartile by the Committee on the understanding that, subject to his performance in role, his salary would move closer to the market lower quartile in future years.
Andy Parkers salary remains at the lower end of similar sized FTSE companies.
Andy Parkers salary has been increased by 10% in 2015 to 550,000 and 9% to 600,000 for 2016.
The Committee believes that Andy Parkers salary is now appropriately positioned.
