The remuneration committee The remuneration committee is appointed by the board.
Themembers are Lynne Weedall chairman, Mike Coupe, and IanDurant.
JohnBrady was a member of the committee until his retirement in July 2014 and, following the year end, Rob Rowley was appointed asanadditional member of the committee on 5May2015.

During the year there were three scheduled meetings of the committee.

Advisers to the remuneration committee The committee seeks advice on general remuneration matters and comparator information from New Bridge Street, part of Aon plc.

For the chief executive, the financial performance measures were based on PBTE and free cash flow, whilst the chief financial officer had an additional financial target based on return on investments.
The committee has decided that it will not disclose specific short-term financial targets as these are still considered to be commercially sensitive although they will be disclosed next year.
Both PBTE and free cash flow are among the groups KPIs, details of which are on page 27.
The awards to be made are as follows: Bonus outcome Maximum Actual percentage percentage of bonus of bonus Rooney Anand PBTE 75.0 35.0 Free cash flow 15.0 15.0 1 Personal targets 10.0 10.0 Total 100.0 60.0 Kirk Davis PBTE 50.0 24.0 Free cash flow 15.0 15.0 2 Personal targets 35.0 35.0 Total 100.0 74.0 Notes: 1.

The award details for the executive directors are therefore as follows: Dividend equivalent Total Number Number Number Estimated on shares estimated 1 2 of shares of shares of shares value to vest value Director at grant to vest to lapse 000 000 000 Rooney Anand 117,000 117,000 993 95 1,088 3 Matthew Fearn 74,000 59,611 14,389 506 44 550 Notes: 1.
The estimated value of the vested shares is based on the average share price during the three months to 3 May 2015 849 pence.
As explained in the single remuneration table above, a significant proportion of the estimated value of the LTIP award derives from the increase in the share price from which all shareholders have benefited.
