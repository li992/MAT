ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2015 plc REMUNERATION REPORT This report sets out the remuneration of NEXTs directors for the year to January 2015 and is in three parts: 1 Remuneration Committee Chairmans statement, 2 annual report on remuneration, and 3 the directors remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
Each part is prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 the new regulations, UK Listing Rules and UK Corporate Governance Code.
PART 1: REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMANS STATEMENT The approach of NEXTs Remuneration Committee has remained consistent with previous years: executive directors receive a mix of annual and long term incentives which reward strong business and financial performance in line with the Companys strategy and which are measured against robust benchmarks.
We place special importance on rewarding consistently strong performance over longer periods and, therefore, the balance of incentives is tilted towards the Long Term Incentive Plan, with its 3 year performance period and 2 year holding period following vesting.
During the past year NEXT has achieved record profit before tax of 782.2m and record Earnings Per Share EPS of 419.8p both measured before exceptional disposal gains representing annual growth of 12.5% and 14.7% respectively: over the past 3 years EPS has grown by a compound annual average of 18% and profit before tax by 11%.
Ordinary dividends have grown by a compound annual average of 19% and a further 223m was paid as special dividends.
The Committee considers that the remuneration arrangements promote the long term success of the Company within a suitable risk framework, are suitably aligned to enhancing shareholder value and that the actual remuneration earned by the executive directors continues to be a good reflection of their and NEXTs overall performance.
The Committee has addressed the following matters this year: Remuneration Policy Our remuneration policy was approved at the 2014 AGM with 98% of votes cast in favour.
The Committee gave full consideration to the operation of the policy prior to proposing it to shareholders at the AGM and considers the level of support obtained to be a strong endorsement.
The Committee is not proposing changes to the current policy.
Base salaries Base salaries for executive directors were increased in February 2015 by 1% having increased by 2% in both 2013 and 2014, in line with the wider company award.
Earlier in the year, the Committee determined that the base salaries for Michael Law and Jane Shields would be reappraised.
Michael and Jane were promoted to the Board in July 2013 but did not receive salary increases at that time.
The Committee agreed that from August 2014 their base salaries should increase from 306k to 400k due to their development and contribution as executive directors since their promotion.
This progression reflects the Committees belief that salary increases should be timed to reflect performance and contribution rather than simply promotion, and is consistent with the approved remuneration policy.
Annual bonus As has been the case for many years at NEXT, annual bonus is calculated with reference to pre-tax EPS, including the impact of share buybacks.
In last years Remuneration Report we set out the basis on which we would ensure that executive directors are not incentivised to recommend share buybacks to the Board in preference to special dividends, or vice versa.
This is achieved by making a notional adjustment to EPS growth for special dividends, on the basis that the cash distributed had instead been used to purchase shares at the prevailing share price on the day of the special dividend payment.
Had no adjustment been made, this years performance would have resulted in a bonus of 98%.
After adjustment, the bonus increased to the capped maximum potential of 100% of salary 150% for Lord Wolfson, with 50% payable in shares deferred for two years.
It should also be noted that we have excluded exceptional gains of 12.6m from this EPS calculation.
Details of the targets set for last year are on page 50.
47 23849.04 8 April 2015 7:29 AM Proof 4 Additional information Parent Company accounts Consolidated accounts Governance Business reports ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2015 plc REMUNERATION REPORT Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Share Matching Plan SMP As set out in the Remuneration Report last year, the Committee simplified the overall structure of longer term incentives for executive directors.
They are now granted only LTIP awards and no longer receive SMP awards.
We believe that a single award is appropriate and in line with our philosophy of clarity to shareholders.
LTIP awards are granted twice a year each at 100% of base salary for executive directors and, therefore, during the year, the Committee approved two grants and two awards matured.
Over the performance periods for the maturing awards, i. e. August 2011 to January 2015, NEXTs share price rose from 23.36 to 71.50 and its market capitalisation grew from 4.0 billion to 10.9 billion.
792m was paid to shareholders in ordinary and special dividends and a further 778m was returned to shareholders through share buybacks.
The LTIP for the three year performance period to July 2014 vested 100% as NEXTs TSR ranked first out of 21 companies in the comparator group and the LTIP for the period to January 2015 also vested 100% as NEXTs TSR ranked fourth.
Details of the comparator group are set out on pages 60 to 61.
The estimated value of these matured awards is substantial see the Single Total Figure of Remuneration table on page 52 : as there was no change in the basis of grant, this is largely due to the 206% rise in NEXTs share price over the performance periods.
As disclosed last year, since executive directors are no longer granted SMP awards, the Committee removed the self-imposed 2.5m cap on the maximum value of LTIPsvesting for any participant in any one year for LTIP awards granted after January 2014.
The cap will remain in force for LTIPs with performance periods ending in the financial years to January 2015 and 2016.
Accordingly, the cap will be applied again this year and, as a result, Lord Wolfsons LTIP payments are expected to be reduced by an estimated 1,402k 2014 reduction 1,457k.
During 2014 the Committee reviewed the LTIP to ensure that it continues to operate as intended, and as a result made a modification to the rules to ensure that the Committee has the ability to reduce or withdraw awards where a person is subject to disciplinary processes.
Taking into account the successful operation of the current LTIP, the Committee agreed to recommend to shareholders at the 2015 AGM to support a resolution to renew the LTIP rules for a further 10 years.
The rules are the same as for the current LTIP and are consistent with best practice: the principal terms are set out in the Notice of Meeting Appendix 1 on page 124.
SMP While the Committee decided last year that executive directors should no longer participate in the SMP, legacy awards will run their course.
The 2012 SMP met its performance condition and will vest in full in April 2015, subject to the continued employment of participants.
Lord Wolfson did not participate in the 2012 SMP.
The SMP remains open to a small number of senior executives below Board level.
EPS and performance measurement The Committee reviews each year the basis and performance measures used for the annual bonus and LTIP.
The performance measure for the annual bonus continues to be based on growth in pre-tax EPS.
The principal reasons for using the EPS measure have been set out in previous Remuneration Reports.
They are: it is consistent and transparent to participants and shareholders: NEXT is predominantly a single business selling products through a number of channels under the NEXT and third party brands.
No significant earnings are derived from uncorrelated businesses and, therefore, a group metric such as EPS is logical and consistent with strategy: EPS continues to be the core financial measure by which the Board assesses overall performance: and the use of EPS is complemented by the application of TSR and consideration of the general economic underpin condition for the LTIP.
48 23849.04 8 April 2015 7:29 AM Proof 2 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2015 plc As set out in previous years, we consider it right that the impact of share buybacks on EPS should be included in performance measurement as, for more than a decade, share buybacks have been one of NEXTs primary strategies in generating value for shareholders.
Share buybacks are regularly considered by the Board and are subject to prior approval as to timing, price and volume.
Shares are only bought when the Board is satisfied that the ability to invest in the business and to grow the ordinary dividend will not be impaired.
Similarly, the Board sets the minimum return required from share buybacks and makes special dividend payments where that return cannot be achieved.
As I explained last year, the Committee concluded that the basis of calculation for this purpose should incorporate an appropriate adjustment to reflect the benefit to shareholders from special dividends paid in the period.
This ensures there is no unintentional reward or penalty for management arising from buybacks or special dividends as a means of returning value to shareholders.
The Board will maintain the same robust discipline over the level of special dividends as it does with regard to share buybacks.
Recommendation Each year the Committee reviews the level of performance-related pay earned by the executive directors.
The Committee considers that the remuneration earned continues to be a fair reflection of NEXTs operating and financial performance and is aligned to shareholders experience over the past 3 years.
We believe that the simplicity and transparency of our remuneration arrangements and their consistent application have contributed positively to NEXTs strong management team continuing to deliver resilient performance.
We focus on maintaining an appropriate balance between annual and long term incentive elements and also between cash and share-based elements, with the aim of ensuring that remuneration drives the right behaviours and rewards the right outcomes.
We believe that weighting rewards towards the long term ensures proper shareholder alignment, which is illustrated by the significant proportion of directors performance-related pay derived from growth in NEXTs share price.
There are no proposed changes to the remuneration policy approved last year by shareholders and accordingly this year there is only an advisory vote on the implementation of the policy together with a separate resolution to renew the LTIP.
The Committee believes that last years remuneration has been in line with both the approved policy and its spirit.
Therefore, on behalf of the Committee, I commend the report and the renewal of the LTIP to you for approval.
This is my final report to shareholders as Remuneration Committee chairman as I retire from the Board in May after the AGM.
It has been a great privilege serving on the Board.
I have the highest confidence in NEXT and all of its employees and I wish the Company every success in the future.

IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY The Committee has operated the remuneration policy in accordance with the policy approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2014.
The table below sets out the way that the policy was implemented in 2014 and any significant changes in the way the policy will be implemented in 2015.
Element of Remuneration Changes for 2014 and 2015 Salary The Committee determined that the base salaries of Michael Law and Jane Shields would be reappraised after their appointment to the Board.
Michael and Jane were appointed in July 2013 but did not receive an increase in base salary at that time.
The Committee agreed that from August 2014 their base salaries should increase from 306k to 400k due to their growing experience and contribution over the year.
These increases reflect the Committees belief that salary increases should reward performance and contribution rather than simply promotion.
While the Committee does not place significant emphasis on benchmark data, it is worth noting that the increased salaries remain below a median level for directors of equivalent companies.
Base salaries of the executive directors increased by 1% in February 2015, in line with the wider company award.
Base salaries for the executive directors from February 2015 are: 000 Lord Wolfson 751 David Keens 501 Michael Law 404 Jane Shields 404 Annual Bonus No change.
Annual bonus is calculated on pre-tax EPS and we ensure that the executive directors are not incentivised to recommend share buybacks in preference to special dividends, or vice versa.
This is achieved by making a notional adjustment to EPS for special dividends, on the basis that the cash distributed had instead been used to purchase shares at the prevailing share price on the day of the special dividend payment.
For the year to January 2015, performance targets were set requiring pre-tax EPS growth on the prior year, adjusted for special dividends and excluding exceptional gains, of 5% before any bonus became payable being pre-tax EPS of 483p.
Maximum bonus of 100% and 150% of salary for the executive directors and Chief Executive respectively was payable if pre-tax EPS exceeded growth of 15% being pre-tax EPS of 529p.
Pre-tax EPS growth achieved in the year excluding exceptional gains was 14.7%, which became 16.9% after making the prescribed adjustment for special dividends and was well in excess of the 15% EPS growth at which point bonus reached its capped level.
Accordingly, a bonus of 100% of salary for the executive directors and 150% of salary for the Chief Executive was earned.
Bonus performance targets for the year ahead have been set but are not disclosed in advance for reasons of commercial sensitivity.
The targets and performance will be disclosed in next years Remuneration Report.
50 23849.04 8 April 2015 7:29 AM Proof 2 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2015 plc Element of Remuneration Changes for 2014 and 2015 LTIP No change.
See Single Total Figure of Remuneration table, note 5 for details of LTIP vestings in the year.
Claw-back & holding The Committee previously introduced malus claw-back provisions in the service periods contracts of all executive directors to cover the bonus and LTIP, and a 5 year from grant holding period comprising a 3 year vesting period and a 2 year holding period under the LTIP for executive directors.
They reconsidered these matters following the introduction of the new Corporate Governance Code and concluded that these provisions remain appropriate.
SMP No change to policy and with effect from 2014 executive directors are no longer eligible to receive grants.
Chairman and nonThe fees of the Chairman and non-executive directors were increased by 1% in February executive director fees 2015, in line with the wider company award.
The basic non-executive director fee is 54,086 2014 15: 53,550, with a further 10,817 2014 15: 10,710 paid to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, and to the Senior Independent Director.
Save As You Earn No change.
Had he not done so, Lord Wolfsons total remuneration would have been 8,947,000 for 2013 14.
Christos Angelides stepped down from the Board in June 2014 and continued in his role as Group Product Director until he left the business in September 2014.
The table shows his remuneration only for the period he remained on the Board.
Similarly, Andrew Varley stepped down from the Board in May 2013 and continued in his role as Group Property Director until he retired from the business in May 2014: LTIP remuneration of 631,000 and 842,000 for the three year performance periods ending July 2013 and January 2014 respectively was paid to him after he stepped down from the Board and prior to his retirement.
During this time his 2011 SMP award also vested at a value of 2.1m.
Christine Cross stepped down from the Board in May 2014.
No compensation for loss of office was paid to these directors.
Michael Law and Jane Shields joined the Board in July 2013.
The 2013 14 values disclosed for salary, benefits and salary supplement relate only to the period of their executive directorship in that financial year.
Performancerelated remuneration includes pay relating to the period before they became executive directors but paid after their appointment.
Total emoluments paid to directors salary fees, benefits, salary supplements and annual bonus for the year to January 2015 were 5,440,000 2014: 5,828,000.

The Committee also assessed earnings growth against the comparator Pension values are calculated using the method required by remuneration regulations, i. e. the total pension group of 21 retailers and concluded that NEXT had performed favourably.
The Companys performance also accrued at January 2015 less the total pension accrued at the end of the previous year, adjusted for inflation compared favourably against its principal retail competitors and FTSE 100 companies.
The Committee confirmed and multiplied by a factor of 20.
It does not necessarily represent the economic value of the pension rights that the economic underpin performance condition had been satisfied and, as a consequence, 100% of the accrued and this benefit is not immediately available to the director.
Consistent with other staff participating award vested.
in the plans, directors salaries are frozen for pension purposes at October 2012, but directors may continue to accrue pensionable service.
LTIP values for the January 2015 single figure table comprise the actual value of awards that have vested and In summary, the pension entitlements of the directors are as follows: been paid for the performance period ending July 2014 plus the estimated value of awards that will vest for the performance period ending January 2015 based on the average NEXT share price over the final three months of Change in 66.66.

PENSION ENTITLEMENTS AUDITED In 2013 all active members of the NEXT Group Pension Plan the NEXT Plan, were transferred to the new 2013 NEXT Group Pension Plan the 2013 Plan so that pensioners of the NEXT Plan could be issued individual policies with Aviva.
Most deferred pensioners and pensioners who had not previously been subject to a buy-in through Aviva were also transferred to the 2013 Plan.
Benefits within the 2013 Plan mirror those in the previous NEXT Plan.
Executive directors are now members of the 2013 Plan which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs and consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The trustee of both Plans is a limited company, NEXT Pension Trustees Limited the Trustee.
The Board of the Trustee includes members of the 2013 Plan, a pensioner member and a Chairman who is independent with no other connection to NEXT.
Two of the directors are member nominated directors and cannot be removed by NEXT.
The other directors, including the independent director, are appointed by and can be removed by NEXT.
All directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of NEXT.
No director of the Company is a director of the Trustee.
The Plans investments are kept separate from the business of the NEXT Group and the Trustee holds them in separate trusts.
Responsibility for investment of the Plans funds has been delegated to professional investment managers.
The Group operates a salary sacrifice scheme whereby members from either section can elect to receive a reduced gross salary in exchange for enhanced employer pension contributions.
The participation of members in the salary sacrifice scheme does not result in any overall increase in costs to the Group.
Defined contribution section Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the 2013 Plan.
Members elect to pay either 3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.
For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of three times the members base salary at the previous April is payable along with the current value of the members fund.
54 23849.04 8 April 2015 7:29 AM Proof 2 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2015 plc Defined benefit section The defined benefit section was closed to new members in 2000.
Since 2012 the accrual of pension benefits has been based on pensionable salary frozen at October 2012, rather than final earnings.
In addition, those employees can elect to receive up to a 15% salary supplement or additional contributions to the defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section now provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth depending on the members chosen contribution rate of pensionable earnings at October 2012 for each year of pensionable service.
Lord Wolfson and a small number of senior employees, on completion of at least 20 years pensionable service at age 65, receive a retirement benefit of two-thirds of pensionable earnings at October 2012, which accrues uniformly throughout their pensionable service.
The deferred pensions for Christos Angelides, David Keens, Jane Shields and Michael Law are based on their pensionable earnings at the time they became deferred pensioners and accrued uniformly throughout their pensionable service.
The defined benefit section provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependants pensions on death in service or following retirement.
Pensions are only payable to deceased members children after death in service.
In the case of ill-health retirement, only the accrued pension is payable.
All benefits are subject to 2013 Plan limits.
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post-1997 is subject to limited price indexation.
From 2006, sales and profit related bonuses were excluded from pensionable earnings and the normal retirement age under the Plan was increased from 60 to 65.
There are no additional benefits payable to directors in the event of early retirement.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company currently makes contributions at the rate of 17.5%.
The last full triennial valuation of the NEXT Plan was carried out as at March 2013, and the first triennial valuation of the 2013 Plan was carried out as at October 2013.
As calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, the net pension surplus at January 2015 was 37.9m: further details are given in Note 21 to the financial statements.
Certain members including Lord Wolfson whose accrued or projected pension fund value exceeds their personal lifetime allowance are provided with benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement.
The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by a payment of 5% on all pensionable earnings.
Since April 2011, where existing members have reached either the annual or lifetime pension contributions limits, the Company has offered those members the choice of leaving the defined benefit section and either joining the defined contribution section with an enhanced Company contribution or taking a salary supplement, in both cases equal to 10% or 15% of their salary depending on their existing contributions and benefits.
