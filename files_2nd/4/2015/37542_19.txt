The starting point required by the remuneration regulations was close to the bottom of the property cycle where a number of property companies launched rights issues while the Company did not.
The Companys share price had not fallen as much as the average share price of the FTSE Real Estate sector prior to this starting point, thereby setting a higher initial base price for this graph.

Last year LTIP awards were made at levels below the normal anticipated grants set out as caps within the Remuneration Policy.
The individual caps are below the 200% of salary limit within the policy.
LTIPs granted last year reflected the development of the business and the individuals at that time.
During the year certain key strategic objectives have been achieved, including but not limited to increasing the dividend cover from 60% of EPRA earnings to 94% and recycling capital into the core portfolio which now represents 90% of the total.
Reflecting these developments, the Committee concluded that awards should be made at the normal levels for all Directors.
