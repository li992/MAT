86 Vesuvius plc Section Four Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Payments to Past Directors audited There were no payments made to a past Director of the Company during the year ended 31 December 2015.
Loss of Office Payments audited There were no payments made to any Director for loss of office during the year ended 31 December 2015.
Base Salary and Fees In the year under review, the Chief Executive received a base salary of 550,000 per annum and, while employed by the Company, Chris OShea received a base salary of 357,000 per annum and Guy Young received a base salary of 325,000 per annum.
Non-executive Directors fees were set at 45,000 per annum.
Supplementary fees of 15,000 p. a. were paid to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees respectively.
A supplementary annual fee of 5,000 was also paid to the Senior Independent Director.
The Chairman was paid an annual fee of 185,000.
Neither the Chairman, nor the other Non-executive Directors are members of the Groups pension plans, nor do they participate in the Groups incentive schemes.
As reported in our 2014 Remuneration Report, there was an increase to the base salary of Chris OShea from 1 January 2015, but there were no other increases to the Directors base salary or fees in 2015.
Franois Wanecqs base salary was reviewed in late 2015 in line with the Groups longer-term approach of reviewing the salaries of Executive Directors and senior executives every two to three years.
This was the first time his base salary had been reviewed since demerger and, following this review, it was resolved that his salary in 2016 should be increased by 7.2%, up to 590,000 per annum, in recognition of his leadership of the Group over the three years since demerger and during the current tough trading environment being experienced.
In considering this increase the Committee also took into account the fact that over the past three years the salary increase for the UK salaried employee workforce has been 7.6%.
There is no change to Guy Youngs base salary.
Pension Arrangements audited In accordance with his service agreement, Franois Wanecq is entitled to a pension allowance of 30% of base salary as was Chris OShea.
Guy Young is entitled to a pension allowance of 25% of base salary.
This amount can be used to participate in Vesuvius pension arrangements, be invested in their own pension arrangements or be taken as a cash supplement or any combination of these alternatives.

Chris OShea left the Companys employment on 17 September 2015.
Guy Young joined the Companys employment on 1 November 2015.
Annual Bonus The Executive Directors are eligible to receive an annual incentive calculated as a percentage of base salary, based on achievement against specified targets.
There is no deferral of annual bonuses for Executive Directors.
Each year the Remuneration Committee establishes the financial performance criteria for the forthcoming year.
These criteria are set by reference to the Companys financial budget.
The target range is set to ensure that maximum bonuses are only paid for significantly exceeding performance expectations.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the setting and attainment of these targets is important in the context of achievement of the Companys longer-term strategic goals.
The annual incentive has a threshold level of performance below which no award is paid, a target level and a maximum performance level at which a maximum award is earned.
Franois Wanecqs maximum annual incentive potential is 125% of base salary and his target annual incentive potential is 62.5% of base salary.
Chris OSheas maximum annual incentive potential was 100% of base salary and his target annual incentive proposal was 50% of base salary.
This is the same for Guy Young.
Governance 87 For the financial year 2015, as in previous years, the Executive Directors annual incentives were based on Vesuvius Group Headline earnings per share, with an adjustment based on Vesuvius working capital performance to focus greater attention on cash flow.
As set out in the Remuneration Policy, the effect of this is to reduce the level of pay-out that could be achieved by up to 10% if specified working capital targets are not attained.
This kicker can also increase the level of pay-out by up to 10%, but not above the stated plan maximum.
The 2015 Vesuvius Group Headline earnings per share performance targets set out below were set at the December 2014 full year average foreign exchange rates, being the rates used for the 2015 budget process: Threshold: 35.0 pence On target: 37.4 pence Maximum: 39.7 pence In order to achieve the working capital target, the Groups working capital as a percentage of sales had to be between 22.7% to 23.7% of sales.
In assessing the Groups performance against these targets, the Committee uses a constant currency approach.
Thus, the 2015 full year EPS performance was retranslated at December 2014 full year average foreign exchange rates to establish performance.
This is consistent with practice in previous years.
In 2015 Vesuvius retranslated EPS performance was 28.6 pence, and working capital was 26.3%.
Consequently, no payment was made under the Annual Incentive Plan to any Executive Director.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that for 2016 Franois Wanecq and Guy Youngs annual incentives will again be principally focused on Group Headline earnings per share, with the same adjustment based on the Groups working capital performance.
However the Committee resolved that in 2016, 80% of the bonus will be based on this financial target and 20% of the bonus will be based on the achievement of personal objectives.
This structure is consistent with that applicable to senior executive management.
In 2016 there will be four measures set by the Committee for Franois Wanecq and five for Guy Young, that comprise each Executive Directors personal objectives.
Franois Wanecqs and Guy Youngs maximum annual incentive bonus potential for 2016 remain unchanged at 125% and 100% respectively.
The Company will not be disclosing the objectives set until after the relevant performance period has ended because of commercial sensitivities.
The personal objectives are all non-financial or job-specific in nature and track performance against key strategic, organisational and operational goals.
Malus Clawback Arrangements in 2016 Vesuvius has had clawback arrangements in respect of Executive Directors variable remuneration since 2012.
The existing structure of those arrangements is outlined in our Remuneration Policy.
As reported in our 2014 Remuneration Report, the Committee decided to strengthen these clawback arrangements by adding, in 2015, malus provisions, which provide the Committee with the flexibility, if required, to withhold or recover payments made to Executive Directors under the Annual Incentive Plan and or to withhold or recover share awards granted to Executive Directors under the Vesuvius Share Plan.
The circumstances in which the Committee could potentially elect to apply malus and clawback provisions include a material misstatement in the Companys financial statements: an error in the calculation of the extent of payment or vesting of an incentive: gross misconduct by an individual: or significant financial loss or serious reputational damage to Vesuvius plc resulting from an individuals conduct, a material failure of risk management or a serious breach of health and safety.
These malus and clawback provisions apply for a period of up to three years after the end of a performance period.
88 Vesuvius plc Section Four Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Outstanding Longer-term pay audited Performance Share awards are allocated to the Executive Directors under the Vesuvius Share Plan.
In accordance with the Remuneration Policy and the rules of the Plan, they are eligible to receive, on an annual basis, a Performance Share award with a face value of up to 200% of salary.
Vesting of 50% of shares awarded is based upon the Companys three-year TSR performance relative to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts, and 50% on Headline EPS growth, as compared with the compound annual growth in global GDP over a three-year period.
The level of compound Headline EPS growth specified in the targets is set by the Remuneration Committee each year, taking into account the Groups prospects and the broader global economic environment.
The two measures operate independently.
The use of these performance measures is intended to align executive remuneration with shareholders interests.

In February 2016, the Committee reviewed the performance conditions proposed for the award of Performance Shares in 2016 and resolved to simplify and amend the EPS performance measure by removing the reference to global GDP.
Removing the reference to global GDP ensures that the arrangements are simplified and are more understandable for all participants.
The Committee has set a schedule of EPS targets that is designed at the maximum to be highly challenging, whilst remaining an effective incentive for the management team in the current difficult market conditions.

The TSR performance during this three-year performance period was assessed against the comparator group and it was determined that the Companys performance was below median and as a result no Performance Share awards will vest under the TSR performance element.
There will also be no Performance Share awards that vest under the EPS performance element of the performance condition as the annual compound Headline EPS growth above GDP for the period was 1.46%.
The applicable Performance Share award will therefore lapse on the third anniversary of the grant.

The Performance Shares that were allocated in 2013 had a performance condition to be tested over the financial years 2013, 2014 and 2015.
Chris OSheas awards lapsed when he left employment with the Company on 17 September 2015 and the award to Franois Wanecq will lapse on the third anniversary of grant in April 2016.
In 2014 Franois Wanecq and Chris OShea received potential maximum allocations of Performance Shares worth two times their base salaries, being 253,748 shares and 156,862 shares respectively.
Chris OSheas award lapsed when he left employment with the Company on 17 September 2015.
In 2015 Franois Wanecq received a potential maximum allocation of Performance Shares worth two times his base salary, being 221,533 shares.
This allocation was made on 1 April 2015 and was calculated based upon the average closing mid-market price of Vesuvius shares on the five dealing days before the award was made, being 4.9654 pence.
The total value of Franois Wanecqs award on the date of grant was therefore 1,100,000.
12.5% of this award would vest if the threshold level of one of the two performance targets were met.
In 2015 Chris OShea received a potential maximum allocation of Performance Shares worth two times his base salary, being 143,795 shares.
This allocation was calculated based upon the average closing mid-market price of Vesuvius shares on the five dealing days before the award was made, being 4.9654 pence.
The total value of his award on the date of grant was therefore 714,000.
This award, like those he received in 2013 and 2014, lapsed when he left employment with the Company on 17 September 2015.
These awards have been made in the form of nil cost options with no exercise price.
The Remuneration Committee also has the discretion to award cash or shares equivalent in value to the dividend that would have accrued during the vesting period on any awards that vest.
The mid-market closing price of Vesuvius shares ranged between 316.6p and 520.0p during 2015 and on 31 December 2015 was 333.1p.
90 Vesuvius plc Section Four Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Cookson LTIP allocations Following the demerger of Cookson Group plc, Franois Wanecq retained an entitlement to allocations of Performance and Matching Shares made under the Cookson Long Term Incentive Plan.
His entitlement to shares in Cookson Group plc was rolled over into Vesuvius plc shares.
The vesting of these awards was based 50% upon relative TSR performance and 50% on headline EPS performance.
Performance was measured by reference to Cookson performance up to the demerger effective date 19 December 2012 and Vesuvius performance thereafter.
The performance period applicable to the awards made in 2012 ended on 31 December 2014.
The details of the testing and achievement in part of the performance conditions for that performance period were set out in our 2014 Remuneration Report and the vesting of the applicable Performance Share award and Matching Shares took place on 7 April 2015, the first trading day after the third anniversary of the grant of the award.

The performance period for the LTIP awards made in 2012 ended on 31 December 2014.
In accordance with the Companys achievement of the specified performance conditions, 26.9% of Franois Wanecqs Performance Share awards vested on 7 April 2015, and his Matching Shares vested at a ratio of 0.586:1.
In addition the Remuneration Committee determined that Mr Wanecq receive a cash payment of 29,000 which is equivalent to the value of the dividends that would have been paid on the number of shares that vested in respect of dividend record dates occurring during the period between the award date and the date of vesting.
The mid-market closing price of the Companys shares on the date of vesting was 517.0p and the total value of the 56,309 shares that Franois Wanecq received on the date of vesting was therefore 291,117.
Restricted Share award On Guy Youngs appointment as Chief Financial Officer, the Committee resolved, in compliance with the Groups Remuneration Policy on recruitment, that it would partially compensate him for the long-term incentives awarded by his previous employer that he forfeited as a result of joining Vesuvius.
Those awards were subject to no further performance conditions and would have vested at 1 February 2016 dependent only on Guy Youngs continued employment until that date.
As partial compensation, the Committee resolved that Guy would receive a one-off Restricted Share award under the Vesuvius plc Share Plan over Vesuvius plc shares to a maximum value of 150,000 with the number of shares under the Restricted Share award being calculated with reference to the closing market price on 2 November 2015 the first trading day after Guy began employment at Vesuvius which was 3.659 pence.
Shortly after his appointment Guy Young received a proportion of his long-term incentives from his former employer and thus, in line with the agreement made at the time of his appointment, his Restricted Share award was reduced pro rata for this receipt to an amount of 62,625.
Based on the above share price this amounts to a Restricted Share award over 17,115 shares.
The Restricted Share award will vest in equal instalments on the date falling six months following his date of commencement of employment and the second anniversary of the date of his commencement of employment.
In order to be consistent with the terms of the forfeited long-term awards, vesting of the Restricted Share award will be subject to him remaining employed by the Company and not being under notice of termination on the vesting dates set out above.

None of the other Directors, nor their spouses nor their minor children, held non-beneficial interests in the ordinary shares of the Company during the year.
Executive Directors shareholdings audited As at 31 December 2015, the Executive Directors shareholdings against the current shareholding guidelines using the Companys share price averaged over the trading days of the period 1 December to 31 December 2015 of 332.99p were as follows: Actual share ownership as a percentage of salary Policy share ownership Director at 31 December 2015 as a percentage of salary Policy met?
Franois Wanecq 800% 200% Yes Guy Young 0% 100% Yes in the build-up period Having enhanced the application of the Executive Directors shareholding policy during 2014, by increasing the required holding of the Chief Executive to 2x salary, in 2015 the Committee further clarified its interpretation of the policy, whilst remaining in line with the policy overall.
This change was to clarify that, not only are Executive Directors required, not just encouraged, to retain at least 50% measured as the value after tax of any shares received through the operation of share schemes, but also permission to sell shares held whether acquired through the operation of share schemes or otherwise will not be given, other than in exceptional circumstances, if, following the disposal, the shareholding policy is not still met.
It was also clarified that as set out above compliance with the policy will be tested at the end of each year for application in the following year using the average of the closing prices of a Vesuvius ordinary share for the trading days in that December.

For the benefit of shareholders, we have reprinted the Policy below.
The Restricted Share award section in the table below setting out Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors is now historic and relates to the former Chief Financial Officer.
Any ongoing Restricted Share awards are now made under the Vesuvius Share Plan.
The Legacy Cookson Group Share Scheme section is also no longer relevant in 2016.
The Selection of Performance Measures section sets out our policy and the way it was implemented into 2015.
For details of its proposed implementation in 2016 see page 88.
The clawback arrangements set out in the Policy have since been expanded to include the malus provisions as set out on page 87 and the shareholding policy set out on page 101 has since been enhanced and clarified as set out on page 91.
To ensure that the Policy is relevant to the 2016 financial year, we have made minor textual changes to refer to the applicable financial year in the following sections: Illustration of the Application of the Remuneration Policy for 2016 which also contains, as described, 2016 data : and Consideration of Shareholder Views.
We have amended the Service contracts section to refer to the terms of the current Executive Directors and the Terms of service section to refer to the dates of appointment of the current non-executive directors.
Directors Remuneration Policy As reported on in 2014 and 2015, the overarching philosophy for remuneration within Vesuvius is to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the calibre necessary to successfully implement our business strategy.
In particular, we ensure that incentives are appropriate to encourage enhanced performance and to avoid underperformance being rewarded.
In reviewing and setting Vesuvius Remuneration Policy, the Committee seeks to balance the interests of our employees and those of our long-term shareholders, to support Company strategy and foster a high-performance culture, where a meaningful portion of remuneration is performance-linked and subject to clawback.
In setting our policy for Executive Directors and senior managers the Committee seeks to emphasise pay for performance and to account for the broad international scale and nature of the Companys operations.
We also consider the approach taken to the pay and employment conditions of other Company employees, together with UK governance requirements and developments in governance practice issued by leading shareholders and shareholder advisory bodies.
The Committee reviews information on the remuneration of comparable roles at similar companies to provide a point of reference for determining remuneration levels.
Given that there is not a clear comparator group of companies for Vesuvius, this is judged in the context of other FTSE 250 companies and other relevant international sector-specific companies to reach a rounded judgement and deliver remuneration that is competitive.
Although Vesuvius is in its early stages as an independent company, the Committee is satisfied that the flexibility within the policy, and the ability to exercise discretion and judgement, will allow the Committee to ensure that an appropriate balance between the interests of employees and shareholders is maintained.
