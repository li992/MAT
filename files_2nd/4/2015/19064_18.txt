The performance measures and weightings for awards to be granted in 2016 will be the same as for the awards granted in 2015: Cumulative 3-year EPS 62.5% of award : Comparator Gross Profit 12.5% of award : and Strategic measures 25% of award.
Between 25% to 100% of the shares subject to the EPS performance condition will vest for three-year cumulative EPS in between 66p and 80.5p.
The target range for the 2016 LTIP award is based on cumulative EPS.
The threshold target is set to reward management for generating a significant level of absolute growth whilst taking into account the prevailing economic circumstances.
Given the current uncertain economic outlook, the Committee believes it appropriate to maintain the threshold target for LTIP awards at 66p.
To reach this target would require cumulative EPS growth of 5.7p over 2015 EPS, which is equivalent to 4.6% per annum growth and is considered sufficiently challenging in the prevailing climate.
The maximum target has been set so that awards only vest for delivering a high level of growth.
As a result, the maximum target is 80.5p which is equivalent to growth of 15.2% per annum on top of the 2015 EPS in each year of the performance period.
The comparator gross profit growth measure will be the same as for those Long-Term Incentive Plan awards granted in 2015.
The Committee currently considers the targets for the strategic measures to be commercially sensitive and will disclose the performance targets once the final vesting outcome has been determined.

The FTSE 250 index and the FTSE Support Services indexes have been selected as the Company was a member of each index throughout the period.
Prior to 2012 the Company operated uncapped incentives which, by definition, did not have the concept of maximum.
As a result it is not possible to provide this information historically.
However, following the changes in 2012 it is possible to provide this information for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015.
