STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 63 Remuneration Report On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committees report for 2015.
OVERVIEW In April 2015, we asked shareholders to approve our new Remuneration Policy as well as the new Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for Executive Directors Executives.
We were pleased to receive votes in support from over 91% of our shareholders for both of these resolutions.
