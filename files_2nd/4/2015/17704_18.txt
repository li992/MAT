STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION REMUNERATION REPORT We have not made any significant changes toour compensation practices in 2015 and throughout the year we have continued to act within the parameters of the approved remuneration policy, which garnered strong support from our shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
As regards 2015 corporate governance developments, we note the increasing prevalence of bonus deferrals and the introduction of holding periods for long-term incentives, such that overall performance and holding periods for LTIP awards is no less than five years.
The Committee continues to believe that it would be inappropriate to introduce these practices at this stage, in light of the overall structure of our compensation packages.
In making this assessment we have taken into account that our current Michael Kenyon practices remain consistent and in line with practices adopted by Compensation Committee Chairman international mining companies and that the structure of our packages already ensure that executive compensation is heavily weighted towards at risk components, with bonus and long-term incentive Dear shareholders, award weightings being equivalent to approximately 70% of the We have continued to transform the business over the course of the CEO package.
The Committee will continue to monitor best practice year and although we are pleased with the overall progress made at in these areas, and in the area of malus provisions, and will consider a difficult time for our industry overall, we did not realise our primary the appropriateness of these practices again in time for the next aim of generating free cash flow in 2015.
In addition and as a result of vote on Acacias Remuneration Policy at the 2017 AGM.
challenges faced primarily in the third quarter of the year, our production and cost levels did not meet the expectations we set out at the beginning As required under the Large and Medium-sized Companies and of the year.

managements and the Boards commitment to the business and to driving long-term value for our shareholders.
The Company will review the suitability of reinstating prior base salaries and Director fees at an appropriate time in the future.
With respect to the 2015 bonus assessment, Company-wide performance was assessed as 12% overall, an unsatisfactory outcome.
Whilst all members of the Board and the management team are disappointed with this outcome, we nevertheless achieved improvement in our overall performance when compared to 2014 and we had already begun to see noticeable improvements in performance in Q42015.
Further details as regards the CEOs 2015 bonus assessment are provided on page 74.
We will continue to adopt strenuous executive performance requirements for the vesting of bonus awards in 2016 to ensure that vesting levels remain focused on the achievement of target and above target performance.

Short-Term Incentive STI Purpose To reinforce the delivery of key short-term operational objectives on an annual basis in order to promote performance as regards business priorities for each financial year in the context of individual and Company performance.
Operation Performance measure weightings and targets are set at the start of the year and weighted to reflect business priorities.
At the end of the year, the Compensation Committee determines the extent to which targets have been achieved, taking into account Company-wide performance and the individual performance of each Executive Director.
STI payments are delivered in cash: clawback provisions apply to any STI payment made to an Executive Director in the event of individual misconduct or financial misstatement misreporting.
Opportunity The STI provides Executive Directors with an annual bonus opportunity in the range of 0% to 150% of base salary, with target bonus opportunity of up to 75% of base salary.
Performance measures Bonus outcomes are assessed by the Compensation Committee on a scorecard assessment, based on the achievement of the targets set for each performance measure and the Committees broad assessment of Company performance.
Performance measures are based on challenging budget and stretch targets for Company-wide financial and operational performance and, where appropriate, individual performance.
Performance measures may include financial, operational, growth, production, cost and capital expenditure control and sustainability metrics.
Performance measures are selected annually to reflect key strategic initiatives and matters underpinning the key financial and non-financial performance indicators used to manage performance across the Acacia Group.
Performance measures will be weighted appropriately each year according to the business plan.
Weightings of performance measures may vary, typically up to 10% and 50%, with the range of performance required under each measure calibrated to reflect the Companys annual published guidance range, particularly as regards production, cash costs and capital expenditure.
For threshold performance, the STI is anticipated to be up to 75% of Executive Director base salary, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee.
Whilst performance measures, weightings and targets for any given year will not be disclosed on a prospective basis due to commercial sensitivities, the Compensation Committee aims to provide such details retrospectively as part of the Annual Report on Remuneration, unless ongoing commercial sensitivities discourage such disclosures.
64 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Purpose To reinforce an enterprise culture that promotes and protects shareholders long-term interests, so as to reward long-term decision making and performance that support the delivery of shareholder returns and drive shareholder value over the long term.
Operation Awards of conditional shares, options or restricted stock units RSUs may be granted annually, with the maximum value that may be awarded to each Executive Director defined as a percentage of base salary at the date of grant.
Vesting is based on Acacias corporate performance over a three-year period.
There is no retest provision.
Clawback provisions are included in the LTIP for Executive Directors, whereby an award is subject to clawback for one year from the vesting date or exercise date, if relevant in the event of exceptional circumstances of individual misconduct or financial misstatement misreporting.
Opportunity The LTIP permits a maximum award with a value equal to 200% of base salary at the time of grant to be made each year under normal circumstances.
The Committee may exceed this limit in exceptional circumstances only.
Such circumstances would include, for example, specific recruitment or retention scenarios.
The exercise of this discretion would be assessed in each case on the circumstances in question.
The level of LTIP awards granted to Executive Directors each year is determined by the Committee, within the limits set out above, with reference to a range of factors including individual performance ratings.
Maximum performance, which will be assessed as 35% outperformance of the median TSR over the three-year performance period going forward, can deliver vesting of up to 2x the value of the award granted, e. g. an award with a value of 150% of base salary at the time of grant would, if maximum performance were achieved, vest at a value equal to 300% at the time of vesting.
Additional RSUs are credited to reflect dividends paid on Acacia Ordinary Shares prior to the vesting date.
Such RSUs are subject to the same vesting provisions as the underlying awards.
Performance measures Subject to continued employment and Acacias relative TSR performance over a three-year performance period when compared to the constituents of the Euromoney Global Gold Index, TSR performance must be at least equal to that of the TSR comparator group in order to receive any payment under LTIP awards, at which level 50% of the target award will vest.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of a three-year performance period, awards will lapse.
The Compensation Committee reviews the comparator group of international gold miners against which TSR performance is measured from time to time to ensure it remains appropriate.
The Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine the treatment of comparators in the event of their delisting or otherwise in any event which, in the opinion of the Committee, compromises the suitability of a company as a comparator for Acacia.
Additionally, the Committee may, at its discretion, reduce the number of awards vesting in the event that the achievement against the performance condition is not a genuine reflection of the underlying performance of the Company.
More generally, the performance measures applied to LTIP awards are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain aligned with shareholder interests and, in this regard, the Committee retains discretion to employ performance measures other than TSR to the LTIP in order to allow for performance assessments to evolve over time.
Share Option Plan SOP Purpose To reinforce an enterprise culture that promotes and protects shareholders long-term interests, so as to reward long-term decision making and performance that support the delivery of shareholder returns and drive shareholder value over the long term.
Operation Whilst the LTIP is expected to be used as the main long-term incentive for Executive Directors going forward, the Committee retains the ability to grant stock options under the SOP where appropriate, such as in recruitment or retention scenarios.
The Compensation Committee will set a vesting period for SOP awards appropriate to the circumstances at the time of grant.
Historically, this has included vesting in equal parts over four years or vesting after three years.
All awards expire seven years from the date of grant.
There are no clawback provisions included under the SOP.
Opportunity The SOP permits a maximum share option award with a value equal to 200% of base salary at the time of grant to be made each year under normal circumstances.
In the event that a stock option award was used for annual incentive purposes, such awards would ordinarily be granted at a target level equal to 150% of base salary at the time of grant.
In this regard, the Committee would look to use an appropriate valuation model, for example, the Black-Scholes model, for purposes of ascertaining the fair value of any award made.
Performance measures The Compensation Committee determines the performance metrics applying to share option awards as appropriate to the circumstances at the time of grant, based on the purpose of making such award, i. e. whether for recruitment, retention or as a matter of annual performance incentive.
Generally, in the event that the Committee were to grant an SOP award as an incentive, it would look to apply an appropriate performance condition.
ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 65 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Shareholding guidelines Purpose To align the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders through the building up of a significant shareholding in the Company.
Operation Executive Directors are required to establish a minimum shareholding equivalent to two times base salary over a period of five years.
Shareholding requirements may be satisfied by interests under LTIP awards.
Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis Use of Compensation Committee discretions The chart below provides an estimate of the potential future reward Generally, it is not possible for any remuneration policy to pre-empt every opportunity for the CEO, and the potential split between the different possible scenario and for this reason the Compensation Committee has elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: been provided with the ability to apply various discretions and judgements Minimum, On-target and Maximum.

66 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Approach to recruitment of Executive Directors When determining the remuneration package for a new Executive Director the Compensation Committee aims to offer a package that is sufficiently competitive, to attract, motivate and retain candidates of the calibre and experience required to run our business.
This will generally be determined in each case not only in the context of the skills required for a position and those of each candidate, but will also be determined on the basis of recruitment trends within the global mining industry and any additional considerations relevant to the recruitment of executives.
In addition, our approach to recruitment will also depend on whether we use external recruitment or internal promotion routes.
External recruitment In determining appropriate remuneration for an external candidate, the Compensation Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, the nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction the candidate was recruited from to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
For such purposes, the Compensation Committee may make use of all of the existing components of the Remuneration Policy as follows: Maximum annual Component Approach grant value Fixed Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, N A remuneration experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and their current basic salary.
Where new appointees have initial basic salaries set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period of two to three years subject to their development in the role.
Pension New appointees will receive pension contributions or an equivalent cash supplement, which is N A equivalent to that received by existing executives and in line with market norms.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may include but are not limited to the N A provision of a company car or cash alternative, private medical insurance and any necessary relocation expenses.

Targets for the individual element will be tailored towards the executive.
1 LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other executives, 200% of salary as described in the Summary Table for Executive Directors Remuneration Policy.
1 SOP New appointees may be granted awards under the SOP, as described in the Summary Table for 200% of salary Executive Directors Remuneration Policy.
1 B ased on target level: award can be higher in circumstances deemed by the Committee to be exceptional, i. e. where it is necessary to buy out incentive arrangements or make offers equivalent to sign-on bonuses.
The Compensation Committee may also make an award under the terms for example, a sign-on payment.
In connection with this, and as explained of one of the Companys incentive plans outlined above in respect of in assurances given at the time of publishing the 2013 Annual Report, a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on the Compensation Committee confirms that, following discussions with leaving a previous employer.

ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 73 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Executive Director salaries The CEO base salary for 2015 was 475,000.
As explained in the Committee Chairmans letter, Mr Gordon has elected to waive a proportion of base salary 10% for 2016, which will result in his 2016 base salary being 427,500.
This adjustment took effect as of 1 January 2016.
This continues to be noticeably below peer group market average for the industry in which Acacia operates.
The Committee will review the suitability of reinstating prior base salary levels at a suitable time in the future.
Non-Executive Director fees For the year ending 31 December 2015, no fees were paid to Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, appointed by Barrick pursuant to its nomination rights under the Relationship Agreement.
Non-Executive Director fees are assessed in April each year.
The table below reflects fees payable in respect of 2015, effective as of 1 April 2015.
Fee component Amount Base fee 85,000 Senior Independent Director fee 25,000 Chair of Audit Committee fee 20,000 Chair of Compensation Committee, EHS&S Committee, and Nomination & Governance Committee fee 15,000 Board Committee membership fee 5,000 As explained in the Committee Chairmans letter, all independent Non-Executive Directors have elected to waive 10% of their base fee for 2016, such that the base fee for 2016 purposes will be 76,500.
This adjustment will apply as of 1 April 2016.
All other fee components remain unchanged.
Executive Directors Short-Term Incentive awards For the year ending 31 December 2015, Executive Director STI awards were earned on the basis of Company-wide performance 80%, this being representative of the overall leadership, management and performance of an individual holding this position and also includes a component to assess individual performance 20%.
Company-wide performance measures continue to focus on the core metrics which we use to assess performance as regards safety, production, cost control and profit generation.
These performance metrics were assessed on the basis of individual weightings and in line with a range of performance targets to provide for threshold, target and maximum performance, as outlined in the table opposite.
The Committee has given careful consideration to the retrospective disclosure of 2015 annual bonus targets and considers that these remain commercially sensitive at this time.
It is intended that targets will be disclosed at the earliest opportunity in the next three years, provided they are no longer commercially sensitive at that time.
As regards the 2015 bonus assessment, Company-wide performance was assessed as 12% overall, an unsatisfactory outcome equivalent to 7% of the CEOs salary following application of the Company STI weighting.
This is due to the Companys underperformance against the production, free cash flow and AISC targets that we set at the outset of 2015.
Whilst all members of the Board and the management team are disappointed with this outcome, we had already begun to see noticeable improvements in performance in Q4 2015.
As regards the CEOs individual performance, whilst Company-wide performance was not as we had hoped when we started 2015, Brad Gordons commitment to the business has been unwavering and he has continued to show strong leadership of the Company to drive core initiatives and programmes, notably through progressing Bulyanhulus mechanisation, transitioning North Mara into a combined open pit and underground operation and the implementation of the wide-ranging right-sizing of our workforce in the last quarter.
Taking into account his personal achievements and commitment this year, the Board has assessed his personal performance levels as equivalent to 18% of base salary overall.
When combined with the assessment of Company-wide performance, this equates to a bonus rating of 25% of base salary, compared to a target of 75%, which is equal to a payment of 119,700 for the year.
For 2016, the CEOs STI opportunity will be 75% of base salary and will be assessed against his 2015 base salary level i. e. excluding the 10% of base salary waived for target performance with a maximum opportunity of 150% for maximum performance.
Broadly, performance measures for 2016 will continue to focus on production, costs, safety and profitability and will be assessed on the same basis as 2015, Company performance 80% with an element of individual performance 20%.

The market value of an Acacia Ordinary Share at the time of the award was 2.27, the award is subject to a three-year performance period and the vesting date is 15 February 2019.
As explained in the introduction to this report, in the event that maximum performance is achieved, the TSR performance condition operates so as to deliver up to two times the value of the initial award at the date of vesting.
For all awards, additional RSUs are granted to reflect dividends paid on Acacia Ordinary Shares prior to the vesting date.
ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 75 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Awards made in respect of 2015 performance are subject to the assessment of the Companys TSR performance against the constituents of the Euromoney Global Gold Index.
The TSR performance against the Euromoney Global Gold Index constituents will be assessed over the performance period as follows: Acacias TSR % outperformance of comparator group median over three years % of target level of award 35% 200% 12% 100% 0% 50% Below 0% 0% Executive Directors interests under the SOP Stock Options only audited As at 31 December 2015 the following awards were outstanding under the SOP: Shares over Shares over Exercised Market Shares over which awards which awards lapsed price at which awards held as at granted during Exercise during date of Earliest Final held as at Award date 01 Jan 2015 the year price the year exercise Expiry date vesting date vesting date 31 Dec 2015 Brad Gordon 21 August 2013 841,308 1.60 N A 20 August 2020 20 August 2014 20 August 2017 841,308 As part of his recruitment package Brad Gordon received a stock option award equal to 841,308 Acacia Ordinary Shares on 21 August 2013, representing an award with a fair market value at the time of grant equal to one year of base salary 425,000.
The fair market value of the award was ascertained using the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation 31.5% of the market value of an Acacia Ordinary Share.
The market price of Acacia Ordinary Shares at the time of this award was 1.60, assessed on the basis of the average of middle market quotations from the Daily Official List of the LSE for the day of grant and the following two dealing days.
The award vests in equal parts over four years and expires seven years from the date of grant.
Vesting is subject to the satisfaction of a TSR performance condition similar to that outlined above for the RSU award made to Mr Gordon in 2013.
No SOP awards were granted in respect of 2015.
As disclosed in last years report, the first tranche of Mr Gordons 2013 SOP award was tested for performance as at 20 August 2014.
Over the relevant period, Acacia TSR of 101.3% exceeded the weighted mean of comparators by 109.4%, which resulted in 100% of this tranche vesting.
Consequently, 210,327 options became exercisable to Mr Gordon on 20 August 2014.
The second tranche of Mr Gordons 2013 SOP award was tested for performance as at 20 August 2015.
Over the relevant period Acacia TSR of 92.9% exceeded the weighted mean of comparators by 142.8%, and consequently a further 210,327 options became exercisable to Mr Gordon on 20 August 2015.
As at 31 December 2015, Mr Gordon had not exercised any of these vested awards.
Percentage change in CEO remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in remuneration for ELT members.
Given that the Company operates across a number of diverse economies with pay levels and structures reflecting local market conditions, the Compensation Committee believes that using the ELT as a subset for purposes of comparing CEO remuneration, provides a more meaningful comparison than using pay data for all employees.
The CEOs remuneration includes base salary, taxable benefit and STI payments and for 2015 includes the sum of payments made to Brad Gordon.
ELT data is based on a consistent set of employees, i. e. the same individuals appear in the 2014 and 2015 populations.

Executive Director exit arrangements audited As noted in the 2013 and 2014 Annual Remuneration Reports, due to a number of commercial sensitivities, the Board took the decision to place Greg Hawkins on garden leave following his departure from the Company in August 2013, in accordance with the flexibilities provided to address exit arrangements under Executive Director service contracts.
As such Gregs official termination date was 20 August 2014.
During this period Greg continued to receive a monthly salary and the benefits afforded under his service contract as regards permanent health insurance, life assurance and the use of a company car payment of a car allowance.
The exit arrangements also provided for the following: The determination of outstanding LTIP awards on a good leaver basis to allow for vesting in accordance with existing vesting schedules, subject to satisfaction of applicable performance conditions at the end of each performance period Relocation arrangements, up to a maximum amount of 100,000, given his status as an international employee and country of origin and the payment of certain legal fees in relation to the execution of exit arrangements The cancellation of all outstanding stock options ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 77 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED As a result, during the year, Mr Hawkins remaining and outstanding LTIP award continued to subsist, subject to being pro-rated to reflect time of employment during the relevant performance periods.
Vesting is assessed against the TSR performance condition in place at the time the awards were granted.
The applicable TSR performance condition provides for the assessment of the Companys TSR performance on a weighted mean average against a comparator group of international gold mining companies.
The comparator group and basis of assessment under the structure of this performance condition is as follows: Comparators Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. IAMGOLD Corp. AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. Kinross Gold Corporation Buenaventura Mining Company Petropavlovsk PLC Centamin plc New Gold Inc Centerra Gold Inc. Randgold Resources Ltd. Eldorado Gold Corp. Semafo Inc. Gold Fields Ltd.

The RSU award granted to Greg Hawkins in February 2013 vested post year end in February 2016.
Over the relevant three-year performance period, the Companys TSR was -56%, which was 13.4% above the weighted mean of the applicable comparator group.
As a result 167% of the original interests awarded were due to vest, subject to pro-rating as a percentage made to reflect Mr Hawkins official termination date of 20 August 2014, as follows: RSUs held at Time pro-rating Interests vesting Market price 31 December 2015 for employment following pro-rating RSUs vesting Date vested on vesting Value Greg Hawkins 254,762 50.5% 167% 215,251 12 February 2016 2.45 526,721 This is the last payment to be made to Mr Hawkins and no further payments will be made going forwards.
Directors interests in Acacia Ordinary Shares and shareholding requirements audited Executive Directors are required to acquire a minimum holding in Acacia Ordinary Shares equivalent to two times base salary over a period of five years.
For these purposes, LTIP awards are taken into account but stock options awards made under the SOP are not taken into account when assessing whether or not shareholding requirements have been satisfied.
Independent Non-Executive Directors are required to acquire a minimum holding equivalent to their annual base fee within five years of election to the Board, which may be satisfied via the acquisition of Acacia Ordinary Shares or by the receipt of DSU awards under the Acacia DSU Plan.
The table opposite shows the shareholding of each Director against their respective shareholding requirement as at 31 December 2015 along with the form of their interests in Acacia Ordinary Shares.

b T he Companys DSU Plan for Non-Executive Directors provides Non-Executive Directors with the option to receive some or all of their annual fees in return for a deferred right to a cash payment, payable only after a participant ceases to hold office with the Company.
Broadly, cash payments under this plan are calculated by reference to the fair market value of Acacias Ordinary Shares at the time of payment and remain subject to market fluctuations in the context of Acacias share price until the time of payment.
c A s regards Executive Directors this is calculated by reference to annual base salary at the time of the relevant individuals appointment against the value of relevant awards at the time of grant.
As regards existing Independent Non-Executive Directors, this is calculated by reference to either: i the annual Non-Executive Directors base fee at the time of adopting the guidelines, if appointed to the Board at that time: or ii the annual Non-Executive Director base fee at the time of appointment, assessed against the higher of: i the number of shares multiplied by the mid market price on the last trading day before the valuation date: or ii the number of shares multiplied by the share price on the date of acquisition of each relevant interests during the applicable five-year acquisition period.

Subsequent to year end, Brad Gordons interests in RSUs were increased to reflect the 2015 LTIP award, taking his aggregate unvested RSUs to 1,539,940RSUs.
Details of this award are provided on page 75 of this report.
There have been no other changes in Directors shareholdings between 31December 2015 and 8 March 2016.
Summary of shareholder voting at the 2015 AGM The following table shows the results of the advisory vote on the 2014 Remuneration Report at the 2015 AGM: Total number of votes % votes cast Directors Remuneration Report 2014 For 354,352,718 94.27 Against 21,527,052 5.73 Votes cast excluding withheld votes 375,879,770 Votes withheld 1,879,299 Total votes cast including withheld votes 377,759,069 In the context of shareholder voting, the key area of concern focused on the CEO salary increase for 2015, which represented an increase of 11.5% on a year on year basis.
However, when taking into account the fact that this represented one increase over a two-year period, this represented an increase of only 5.7% per annum since appointment.
As noted above, there will be no CEO salary increase for 2016 and as a result of the CEOs election to waive 10% of base salary, the 2016 salary will remain below market norms.
The Directors Remuneration Policy was last subject to a binding vote at the 2014 AGM, when 98.37% of shareholders voted in favour of the relevant resolution.
