It became effective from immediately after the AGM on 23 April 2014 and binding upon the Group until the close of the 2017 AGM.
There are no planned changes to the policy over the three-year period to which it relates.
The core principles of the remuneration policy are to: give effect to existing remuneration commitments in accordance with directors contracts of employment: pay market rates of total remuneration: ensure that there is an appropriate link between performance and reward: award annual bonuses which are linked to the delivery of the annual Business Plan targets including the achievement of strategic objectives and personal performance: ensure that long-term incentives are linked to TSR and to the delivery of Business Plan strategic objectives: ensure that payments on termination of employment are linked to performance and the exercise of good faith: and allow the Committee an element of discretion to enable recruitment or termination situations to be managed in the best interests of the Group.

Differences between the policy and that of the remuneration of employees generally The following differences apply between the remuneration of directors and the policy on the remuneration of employees generally: executive directors and a number of senior employees are eligible for BMP.
However, there are differences in terms of levels of grant: annual bonus levels vary across the workforce, and the requirement to defer a portion of annual bonus applies only to executivedirectors: employees in the collective bargaining unit have a contractual right to receive an annual bonus subject to Company performance and continued employment, whereas directors and all other UK-based employees participate in a discretionary bonus scheme: and hourly paid employees qualify for overtime payments.
