We concluded that the CEO and CFOs salaries were competitive and accordingly decided to increases both by 2%, mirroring the increase generally awarded to colleagues in the Support Centre.
2014 15 ANNUAL BONUS Annual Bonuses for FY15 for Executive Directors were based 80% on Group PBT and 20% on the delivery of key strategic initiatives crucial to the delivery of the Companys strategy.
Annual Bonuses reported in the table on page 63 and payable in June 2015 for the FY15 financial period were calculated as follows: Bonus Performance Bonus Opportunity awarded % of total % of total Measure award Threshold Target Stretch Performance delivered award PBT 80% 97% of budget 100% of budget 106% of budget PBT for the year was in excess of 80% 106% of budget and therefore this proportion of the annual bonus is payable in full.

Achieved 4% Total Bonus 95% The annual bonus outturn was reviewed in the context of the performance of the underlying business during the year and delivery against strategy.
In that context, we assessed the level of bonus to be appropriate however, due to the resignations of Matt Davies and Andrew Findlay prior to the payment of bonus, each ceased to be eligible and, therefore, did not receive a bonus in respect of the period.
We are committed to providing the greatest possible transparency in relation to retrospective achievement against the objectives that form part of the bonus measures.
Clearly, some of those measures are commercially sensitive and to disclose them could reveal information about our business planning and budgeting to competitors, which could be damaging to our business interests and, therefore, also to shareholders.
Of the FY15 metrics against which bonus outturn has been assessed, we are able to disclose the following: FY15 Measure Threshold Maximum performance Engagement index 81% 82% 79% Retention of store colleagues 11% 10% 9% FY15 performance against 1 Measure FY14 outturn Net promoter score 5%pts Value added sales 8.2% 1 50:39 Store delivery was a new metric for FY15.

SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES AUDITED The Committee believes that it is important that Executive Directors interests are aligned with those of our shareholders to incentivise them to deliver the corporate strategy, thus creating value for all shareholders.
Executive Directors are encouraged to acquire and retain shares with a value equal to 100% of their annual base salary.
Executive Directors have a five-year period to build this shareholding following their appointment.

There was no change in these beneficial interests between 3 April 2015 and 4 June 2015.
OUTSIDE APPOINTMENTS Halfords recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies.
Such non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge which can benefit Halfords.
Subject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are allowed to accept non-executive appointments and retain the fees received, provided that these appointments are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest.
Matt Davies received fees of 38,993.18 as a non-executive director of Dunlem Group plc in the period, having resigned from the post on 8 January 2015.
LOSS OF OFFICE PAYMENTS AUDITED No loss of office payment was made to a Director during the year.
PAYMENTS TO FORMER DIRECTORS AUDITED As stated in the prior year, Paul McClenaghan left the business on 12 April 2013 with Good Leaver status and, therefore, retained a pro-rated portion of his Performance Share Plan PSP award that had been granted in 2012.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the performance conditions attached to the 2012 PSP and determined that 15% of the awards will vest, which translates to a pro-rated vesting of 11,320 shares for Paul.

The Committee reviews the goals included in the strategic objectives portion of the bonus to ensure that they remain appropriate.
In determining whether any bonuses are payable, the Committee retains the discretionary authority to increase or decrease the bonus to ensure that the level of bonus paid is appropriate in the context of performance.
Bonus targets are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive as they could reveal information about Halfords business plan and budgeting process to competitors which could be damaging to Halfords business interests and therefore to shareholders.
SHARE PLANS We have adopted four share plans: The Halfords Sharesave Scheme: the Halfords Company Share Option Scheme CSOS, a market value share option plan: the Halfords Performance Share Plan PSP : and the Halfords Co-Investment Plan it is intended that no further awards will be made under this plan.

We are committed to providing the greatest possible transparency and will, therefore, provide retrospective disclosure of achievement against bonus metrics wherever possible, as further described on page 64.
While committed to the use of equity-based performance-related remuneration as a means of aligning Executive Directors interests with those of shareholders, we are aware of shareholders concerns on dilution through the issue of new shares to satisfy such awards.
Therefore, when reviewing remuneration arrangements, we take into account the effects such arrangements may have on dilution.
Halfords intends to comply with the Investment Association guidelines relating to the issue of new shares for equity incentive plans.
