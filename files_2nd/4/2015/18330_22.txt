As detailed last year, the PSP award levels this year will be 200% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 175% of base salary for the Group Finance Director.
These award levels reflect the discontinuation of the SMP.
Under the PSP, the Committee has the power to vary the metrics used each year and their relative weightings.
It also has the power to review the specific targets for each award to ensure that they remain appropriate, but the new targets must be at least as challenging in the circumstances as the original targets were when they were set.
In the event of an acquisition in the three year performance period, the Committee will assess whether the financial performance of the acquired business should be included and targets adjusted accordingly.
The financial performance of a business being disposed of may be excluded from the Group's financial performance and the targets adjusted accordingly.
Adjustments to targets will continue to be disclosed in the relevant year's Directors' Remuneration Report.

Share Matching Plan The awards made in 2012, 2013 and 2014 to the Executive Directors were in respect of 75% of salary calculated based on the maximum matching ratio of 1.5:1 on the first 50% of salary worth of shares awarded under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
No further awards will be made under the SMP.
Matching awards normally vest three years after grant, to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied and the related DSBP award has not lapsed, and provided the participant is still employed within the Group.
