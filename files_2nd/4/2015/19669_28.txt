I am happy to confirm that the implementation of Executive Director remuneration in 2015 complied fully with our Remuneration Policy, approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2014.
We also comply with the Large and Medium Sized Companies and groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 on Directors Pay, introduced in October 2013.
In this letter I will provide a summary of business performance during the year and the resulting awards made under our performancebased incentive plans, along with details of the major decisions made by the Committee.
The balance of this report is split into two sections: our 2015 Annual report on remuneration, which explains how the Remuneration Policy was implemented during the year ended 31stDecember 2015 followed by a copy of the approved Remuneration Policy.
Business performance and pay outcomes As noted in the Chairmans statement on pages 2 and 3, the Company made further progress in 2015 with Group revenue up 2% and pretax profit up 4%, both at constant currency, contributing to earnings per share EPS growth of 6% at constant currency, or 2% at reported exchange rates, and a Return on Capital Employed ROCE of 45.3% as determined under the annual bonus plan rules.
Over the threeyear period ending in 2015, the Company delivered a total shareholder return TSR of 58.8%.
The Board is recommending an increase in the final dividend of 7.1% to 48.2p per share for the year, extending our dividend record to 48 years.
Our Remuneration Policy is designed to ensure that a significant percentage of Executive Director pay is based on the achievement of demanding performance targets and is, therefore, at risk.
A maximum payout under the annual bonus plan and Performance Share Plan PSP is only available as a result of significant outperformance by the business.
The Committee considers that the remuneration paid to Executive Directors in 2015 given as a single figure for each Director on page 90 reflects the progress made by the Company during 2015, as well as over the last three years.
Annual bonuses are based on adjusted operating profit and ROCE targets.
The Group profit achievement of 152,195,000 as determined under the annual bonus plan rules was 0.6% below the plan target and the ROCE achieved of 45.3% was 0.83 percentage points above the 44.5% plan target.
These achievements resulted in a 61.39% bonus award for the Group Chief Executive and Finance Director.
Other Executive Directors targets have an additional divisional profit element and details of their bonus targets and level of achievement can be found on pages 91 and 92.
Shares awarded in the PSP vest based on relative TSR and EPS growth over the three-year plan period.
Performance on the EPS measure resulted in a vesting of 50.8%.
Strong TSR of 58.8% in the three years to 31st December 2015 exceeded the majority of our peers and triggered a 100% award for the TSR element.
As a result, the 2013 PSP awards vested at a rate of 80.33% of the total shares awarded.
Details of bonus and PSP awards can be found on pages 92 and 93.
Changes to the Group Chief Executives remuneration On his promotion to Group Chief Executive, Nicholas Andersons overall remuneration package was consciously positioned below both that of his predecessor and levels observed in the market.
The Committee has kept this under review with a view to better aligning his remuneration to market median over a period of time.
As disclosed in our report last year, in 2015 the Committee approved a salary increase of 4.2%, slightly above the average of the other Executive Directors 2.8% and the average increase for our UK employees 2.0%.
This reflected both excellent performance in the role, contribution to the Group and the Committees intention to better position salary relative to market norms.
Following a further review in December 2015, the Committee has increased the Group Chief Executives salary to 515,000 4.1% on 2015 and bonus opportunity to 125%, with effect from 1st January 2016.
Similar to last year, these changes reflect both the strong performance in role and of the Group, and progression over time to market norms.
This increase in bonus opportunity is permitted by the existing Remuneration Policy.
112.5% of this bonus opportunity will be measured against financial performance and 12.5% against individual strategic objectives linked to five of the Groups key strategic themes.
The other Executive Directors will also have a portion of their bonus based onindividual strategic objectives, as explained on page 89.
In addition, the Committee approved a commensurate increase in the minimum shareholding to 125% of salary 100% in 2015.
The Committee was also cognisant of the Policy which requires the Group Chief Executive to use that part of his bonus over 60% of base salary net of tax to buy shares until the minimum shareholding requirement has been satisfied.
Remuneration for the new Group Finance Director During the year David Meredith announced his wish to retire from the Group with effect from 10th May 2016.
On 11th May 2016 Kevin Boyd will take over as Group Finance Director and Executive Director.
Kevin Boyds remuneration package will be composed of a market median salary of 335,000, a cash contribution in lieu of pension of 25% of salary, a bonus entitlement of up to a maximum of 100% of salary and a PSP award of 100% of salary.
No sign-on or buy-out payments were provided in respect of this recruitment.
Mr Boyd will offer himself for election to the Board by shareholders at the AGM in 2017.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 88 Annual Report 2015 Changes for 2016 The Committee has determined that from 2016, the payment of up to 10% of an Executive Directors bonus will be based on individual strategic objectives, alongside the current financial measures.
These strategic objectives will be tailored to an individuals areas of responsibility and communicated at the start of each year.
Each measure will be subject to three possible achievement levels: fully achieved, partially achieved and not achieved.
Under the PSP, for awards made from 2016, the EPS element will be based on outperformance of global industrial production rates.
This is the basis by which we forecast growth in our long-term strategic plan and aligns with the market dynamics of our global industry.
Further information on these changes can be found on page 99.
It is within this context that during the course of 2016 the Committee will review the Remuneration Policy, which expires in 2017 and consider changes.
We will take account of the Groups long-term strategic plan, feedback from shareholders, market trends and the changing economic environment.
Following our review, the Policy will be put to shareholders for approval at the AGM in 2017.
Thank you for your engagement and continued support.
We were pleased that the 2014 Annual Report on Remuneration received support of 97.5% at our AGM in May 2015.
As a Committee we remain focused on setting demanding incentive targets to ensure pay and performance are appropriately aligned, while fully disclosing details on performance and objectives each year.
At this time the Committee is satisfied that the Remuneration Policy continues to reflect the interests of shareholders and aligns Executive Director remuneration with Company strategy, while allowing the Group to attract and retain motivated and talented individuals.

In June 2015 at an off-site meeting the Board reviewed the Strategic Plan approved in 2014, to ensure it reflected the changing economic environment.
This Strategic Plan is used to set individual strategic objectives for the Executive Directors and, from this, bonus targets are agreed and approved by the Committee.
This process forms part of the annual Board calendar, with the bonus targets approved in the early part of the financial year.
The Groups strategic themes are set out on page 22.

Annual bonus Executive Directors participate in the annual bonus plan, which rewards Executive Directors for financial performance both at Group level and, where appropriate, the division for which they are responsible.
Targets are reviewed annually to ensure continuing alignment with strategy and are agreed at the start of the year.
Resulting awards are determined following the end of the financial year by the Committee, based on performance against these targets.
Achievement of target performance results in a bonus of 60% of salary, increasing to 100% of salary for maximum performance.
Bonus payments are subject to clawback for up to three years following payment.
Circumstances that may result in a clawback include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct.
The table below sets out the performance measures that each of the Executive Directors bonus awards were subject to: Executive Directors 2015 Measures N. J. Anderson Group operating profit 65% D. J.

Whalen Group ROCE 35% Divisional operating profit 30% The performance measures are adjusted to reflect certain non-operating items including the amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets and exceptional reorganisational costs and to exclude any profit contribution and the impact of the start-up company in India.
2015 was a good year for the Group which delivered earnings growth, increased operating profit margin and dividend to shareholders.
The annual bonus payments to Executive Directors ranged between 61.39% and 77.40% of salary.
The bonus is payable in cash where the relevant Executive Director has met the share ownership requirement, otherwise that part of the bonus over 60% of base salary net of tax must be used to buy shares until the shareholding requirement has been met.
This is the case with the Group Chief Executive whose shareholding requirement has now been increased to 125% of base salary.

Prior to award, the Committee reviews the performance targets for each measure to ensure they remain sufficiently stretching.
For financial measures this includes a review of analysts forecasts.
PSP awards are subject to malus reduction in the amount of deferred and as yet unpaid compensation and clawback reimbursement of compensation that has already been paid for up to three years following the award, and can be applied during a holding period.
In normal circumstances, the maximum award under the PSP is 100% of base salary but, in exceptional circumstances, this may be increased to 150% of base salary.
Vesting is based on two performance conditions measured over a three year period, which have been chosen as they are aligned with our strategy: TSR performance relative to a comparator group Aggregate EPS relative to target aggregate EPS.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Executive Directors excluding Jay Whalen who is a USA citizen are eligible to participate in an HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan known as the ESOP.
The maximum annual investment in shares is 1,500 per Executive Director which can be matched by the Company on a one-for-one basis for each share that is purchased by an Executive Director and dividend shares can be reinvested.
No shares acquired under the ESOP are subject to performance measures as the aim of the ESOP is to encourage increased shareholding in the Company by all eligible UK employees.

The benefit paid under normal retirement from the USA defined benefit plan is a single life annuity equal to the number of years of service multiplied by the sum of 1.0% of pensionable salary up to social security covered compensation, plus 1.45% of pensionable salary in excess of social security covered compensation.
Final average salary is the average of the highest pensionable pay for any five consecutive years prior to retirement up to a ceiling.
Jay Whalens final average salary is higher than the salary ceiling as at 31st December 2015.
Jay Whalens defined benefit plan arrangements are as follows: 2 Change Change Change in the value of accrued Accrued Accrued in accrued in accrued pension over the year net of 1 Age attained at pension at pension at pension during pension during inflation and Directors own 1 3 31.12.15 31.12.14 31.12.15 the year the year contributions J.

Inflation was negative this year so this has been limited to zero.
2 T his year the value of pension has been calculated based on a factor of 20 in line with that required under the disclosure regulations.
3 This is a non-contributory plan so J. L. Whalen paid zero contributions into the defined benefit plan over the year.
The following additional information is provided: Upon death in service: a spouses pension equal to one-half of the members pension, based on pensionable service to the date of death, is payable.
After payment of the pension commences the accrued pension shown has no attaching spouses pension.
However, at retirement there is an option to reduce the members pension to provide for a spouses pension after death.
Early retirement rights: after leaving the service of the Company, Jay Whalen has the right to draw his accrued pension at any time after his 65th birthday with no reduction.
In addition, he has the right to commence his pension earlier if he meets the age and service requirements, with the pension being reduced.
The annual reductions for early retirement are 3% for each year from age 65 to age 60 and 5% for each year from age 60 to earliest retirement age.
Pension increases: the pension has no guaranteed increases.
Spirax Sarco Inc. has the discretion to provide increases.
Other discretionary benefits: additionally, Jay Whalen benefited from Company contributions to a USA defined contribution pension plan and to a 401k plan.
The total amount contributed by the Group was $89,330.
David Meredith became a deferred member of an HMRC registered, contributory defined benefit scheme, the Spirax-Sarco Executives Retirement Benefits Scheme on 27th February 2015 and, therefore stopped accruing any pension benefits within the defined benefit scheme at that date.
The benefit paid under normal retirement is a pension based on 1 60th of final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service to 31st March 2011 and 1 80th of final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service after 31st March 2011 to 27th February 2015, with final pensionable salary defined as basic annual salary over the last 12 months of service.
David Meredith accrued pro-rata additional service at a rate which would have given a further two and a half years of service at age 62 based on 1 60th accrual if he had remained in service until age 62.
David transferred his pension benefits out of the defined benefit scheme in April 2015, extinguishing his benefits under the defined benefit scheme, so his actual accrued pension at 31st December 2015 was zero.
Below is shown the amount he would have had if he had stayed a deferred member until 31st December 2015.
Details of David Merediths pension are as follows: 2 Change Change Change in the value of accrued Accrued Accrued in accrued in accrued pension over the year net of 1 Age attained at pension at pension at pension during pension during inflation and Directors own 1 3 31.12.15 31.12.14 31.12.15 the year the year contributions D.

The increase in inflation was larger than the increase in benefits to 27th February 2015.
The calculation has been limited to zero.
3 D. J. Meredith paid zero contributions into the defined benefit scheme over the year having elected in 2011 to reduce the accrual rate from 1 60th to 1 80th.
In lieu of pension benefits, David Meredith now receives 25% of his basic salary in cash, which in the period 1st March 2015 to 31stDecember 2015 amounted to 68,021.
Neil Daws became a deferred member of an HMRC registered, contributory defined benefit scheme, the Spirax-Sarco Executives Retirement Benefits Scheme, with effect from 31st December 2012, and is, therefore, no longer accruing any pension benefits within the defined benefit scheme.
In lieu of pension benefits, Neil Daws now receives 25% of his basic salary in cash, which in the year ended 31stDecember 2015 amounted to 73,438.
In lieu of benefits, Nicholas Anderson receives 25% of his basic salary in cash, which in the year ended 31st December 2015 amounted to123,750.

Increases for the broader UK employee population were on average 2%, increasing in accordance with internal guidelines for top performers.
The increases for Executive Directors, like those for the broader UK employee population, took account of both individual performance and market data, toensure that salaries remain competitively positioned in the market.
Base salaries: N. J. Anderson: 515,000 4.1% D. J. Meredith: 336,500 3.1% N. H. Daws: 302,500 3.1% J. L. Whalen: 282,000 5.0% As noted in the Chairmans statement, the Group Chief Executive will receive an increase in his annual bonus opportunity, moving to 125% of base salary, with effect from 1st January 2016.
This change, in combination with the increase in salary, reflects the strong individual performance demonstrated by Nicholas Anderson since his appointment two years ago and the performance of the Group as a whole.
There are no changes to the bonus opportunity for the other Executive Directors.
Bonus targets for 2016 are not disclosed because they are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive.
The targets will be retrospectively reported in the Annual report on remuneration next year.
From 2016, the payment of up to 10% of an Executive Directors bonus opportunity will be based on individual strategic objectives, alongside the current financial measures.
These individual strategic objectives will be tailored to an individuals areas of responsibility and agreed at the start of the year.
Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees Effective from 1st January 2016, the Non-Executive Director basic fee was increased in line with the average UK employee salary increase of 2%.
The fee for Committee chairmanship was increased by 300 to 9,000 and the Senior Independent Directors fee from from 2,000 to 5,000.
The Chairmans fee was increased by 5%.
Spirax-Sarco Performance Share Plan PSP EPS growth calculation From 2016, the EPS element of the PSP will be based on growth in excess of global industrial production growth rates, often referred to in our industry as Global IP rather than UK RPI.
Global IP is a measure that the Board and management have used for some time as there is well documented evidence that it is the best predictor of the global and industrial markets within which Spirax Sarco operates.
For these reasons, IP was used in the formulation of the long-term strategic plan and targets for EPS growth approved by the Board.
As a result, the Committee is of the view it makes sense to incorporate Global IP into our Long-Term Incentive Plan, as a means of better aligning the assessment of performance against our long-term strategic plan and market dynamics within our industry.
The Committee has reviewed the historical and projected data 2007-2020, including Spirax Sarcos own performance, market benchmarks and analysts consensus to determine a performance range associated with this new benchmark growth rate that remains sufficiently challenging across various market environments.
Accordingly, threshold vesting will occur for exceeding IP by 2% per annum, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for exceeding IP by 8% per annum.
The IP data source will be the CHR Metals Global IP index providing data, incorporating over 90% of global industrial output.
Other aspects of remuneration There are no other planned or implemented changes of note for remuneration in 2016.

All incentive awards granted prior to this Policy coming into force will continue on their existing terms including the exercise of discretion toamend such awards.
2.2 ii Remuneration Policy for other employees The Companys approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, level of experience, responsibility, individual performance and market pay levels.
The most senior managers in the business approximately 80 people globally participate in bonus arrangements with similar targets, measures and relative weightings to the Executive Directors.
Target and maximum potential values are lower and determined by the grade of the managers role.
Performance targets are based on an appropriate combination of Group, divisional and local operating company financial measures.
Contractual terms and benefits for the wider workforce are subject to local employment legislation and best practice.
2.2 iii Measure selection and the target setting process Measures are selected taking into account the key strategic priorities of the Company, shareholder expectations and factors that sit within an individuals span of control.
Targets are set with reference to internal and external forecasts to ensure that they are realistic, yet sufficiently stretching.
An appropriate mix of long and short-term targets will be used, informed by the nature of the measure.
2.3 External directorships Directors are permitted to hold external directorships in order to broaden their experience, to the benefit of the Company.
Such appointments are subject to approval by the Board and the Director may retain any fees paid in respect of such directorships.
The Board ensures compliance by Directors with Code provision B.
2.4 Approach to recruitment and promotion remuneration When appointing external hires or when promoting executives, or an Executive Director, internally, the Committee will continue to act in the best interests of shareholders when determining remuneration, in line with the stated policy.
The main elements of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Director appointments are: Base salary will be set on appointment taking into account the factors set out in the policy table, but also the individuals experience.
Depending on an individuals prior experience, the Committee may set salary below market norms, with the intention that it is realigned over time, typically two to three years, subject to performance in the role.
In this situation, the Committee is permitted to exceed the normal rate of annual salary increase set out in the policy table.
On-going annual incentive pay opportunity will not exceed 275% of salary, in line with the maximums stated in the policy table up to 125% of salary for annual bonus and an award of up to 150% of salary under the PSP.
In the year of appointment an off-cycle award under the PSP may be made by the Committee to ensure an immediate alignment of individual interests.
In addition to the standard elements of remuneration, on the appointment of an external candidate, the Committee reserves the right to buy-out incentive awards that the individual has foregone by accepting the appointment, if appropriate.
The terms of such awards would be informed by the amounts being forfeited and the associated terms for example the extent to which the outstanding awards were subject to performance, the vehicles and the associated time horizons.
It is the intention of the Committee that on an expected basis, the value of the awards being made would not exceed those being forfeited.
Awards would be made either through the existing share plans or in accordance with the relevant provisions contained within the Listing Rules.
When an internal appointment to the Board is made, any pre-existing obligations may be honoured by the Committee and payment will be permitted under this Remuneration Policy.
For Executive Director internal promotions, salary will be capped at that of the incumbent Group Chief Executive.
The Committee shall have discretion to grant one-off cash or share-based awards to Executive Directors pursuant to the Listing Rules.
The Committee will exercise this discretion only in exceptional circumstances, where it determines that such an award is necessary to secure the recruitment or retention of an Executive Director and where the Committee determines that it is in the best interests of the Company to do so.
Any one-off award will be subject to a maximum of 100% of salary and will be performance-related.
In such circumstances, the Company will disclose a full explanation of the detail and rationale for the one-off award.
The Committee does not expect to have to make any one-off awards as a matter of course, and this power has been included in the policy to cater for any exceptional and genuinely unforeseen circumstances, such as a grant to a key individual where it is vital to retain them in the business.
Details of the remuneration for any new Chairman or Executive Director appointed to the Board will be disclosed on a timely basis on theGroups website, www.

Service agreements aredesigned to reflect the interests of the Company, as well as the individual concerned.
Executive Directors service agreements are kept atthe Companys headquarters in Cheltenham.
In accordance with the Code and guidelines issued by institutional investors, Executive Directors have service agreements that are terminable by either the Company or the Executive Director on 12 months notice.
In the event of termination or resignation, and subject tobusiness reasons, the Company would not necessarily hold the Executive Director to his or her full notice period.
All Directors are subject to election if newly appointed in the year or re-election at the AGM.
Service agreements set out restrictions on the ability of the Executive Director to participate in businesses competing with those of the Group or to entice or solicit away from the Group any senior employees or to solicit deal with clients of the Group or interfere with supply, inthe 12 months following the cessation of employment.
Salary, pension and benefits are included in the agreements and are treated as described in the policy table on pages 75 to 77.
There is no contractual entitlement to payment of an annual bonus or granting of an award under the PSP, until individual participation, level of award, measures and targets have been set for a particular year.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but serve the Company under letters of appointment, for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election at the AGM.
Group Chief Executive and new appointments from 1st January 2013 The details of the service agreements of the Group Chief Executive and for new appointments to the Board are outlined below.
The Group Chief Executives service agreement has been updated to reflect latest best practice.
In the event of a material change in role, function or responsibilities, Executive Directors agreements will be reviewed and will be expected to be updated to meet the requirements outlined below.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 105 Annual Report 2015 Corporate Information Financial Statements Governance Report Strategic Report Governance Report Remuneration: Remuneration Policy report 2015 continued While the Executive Directors service agreements include a provision to deal with termination on a change of control, in the event of an offer being made, shareholders have discretion to accept the offer or not.
The decision to recommend acceptance, or not, is a matter for the Board and the Committee is of the clear view that the change of control provision within the Executive Directors service agreements would have no influence on the voting pattern of those Executive Directors.
Executive Directors legacy agreements are summarised in the table below.
Notice Period 12 months by the Executive Director and 12 months by the Company Termination No payment if Executive Director commits a repudiatory breach of the service agreement or for gross misconduct or in certain circumstances No additional termination payment if notice worked If notice only part worked part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice Otherwise 12 months base salary, the value of other benefits, plus the cost of pension credits or contributions for the period plus the average of the prior three years annual bonus payments, with Committee discretion to reduce the amount of the bonus that would otherwise be calculated, to reflect performance on the part of the Executive Director that is considered by the Committee to be below the required standards, provided that termination by the Company does not occur within 12 months of a change of control Committee discretion to pay in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control when a lump sum will be paid If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits excluding long-term incentives, earned in new paid employment in that period No automatic entitlement to payments under the current annual bonus or PSP.
See below Garden leave clause Robust post-termination restrictions on confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and non-interference with customers or suppliers Clawback Bonus payments and PSP awards are subject to clawback for up to three years following award Circumstances include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct Treatment of leavers under the incentive plans Whilst it is not an entitlement, it is expected that where an Executive Director is a good leaver ie where the cessation of employment is due to death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company business in which he she works being disposed of where the ending of employment is instigated by the Company and is not for cause, payments will be made under the annual bonus plan if performance targets are met subject to, and in accordance with, the plan rules.
If the Executive Director is not a good leaver it is expected that no bonus will be paid.
The treatment of leavers under the PSP is determined in accordance with the shareholder approved PSP rules.
Any awards granted within six months prior to termination or the giving or receiving of notice will lapse.
Any awards granted six months or longer prior to termination of employment but prior to the end of the performance period will lapse unless the Executive Director is considered to be a good leaver.
In the case of a good leaver the award will vest on the termination date, or the normal vesting date, at the Committees discretion.
This is subject to the satisfaction of the performance targets at that date and a pro-rata reduction in the number of shares to take account of the shortening of the performance period.
For awards granted on or after 1st March 2012, if the Executive Director is a good leaver where the ending of employment is not for cause, the number of shares vested may be reduced including to zero by the Committee in its absolute discretion.
If an Executive Director ceases employment or notice is given on or after the end of the performance period but prior to the date on which the Committee has determined the extent to which the award has vested, if the Executive Director is a good leaver, his her award will be preserved and will be treated in the same way as if his her employment had continued, whereas if the Executive Director is not a good leaver, his her award will lapse on the earlier of his her cessation of employment and the giving of notice.
Change of control Bonus: if termination occurs within 12 months of a change of control, the Executive Director is entitled to i a lump sum payment in lieu of notice and ii receive a full bonus payment calculated by reference to the average of the preceding three years bonus payments without any reduction for performance.
PSP: the rules provide that in the event of a change of control, outstanding share-based awards will vest to the extent that performance targets are met at the date of the event.
Any such vesting would generally be on a time pro-rated basis.
The Committee may, at its discretion, increase the level of vesting if it believes that exceptional circumstances warrant such treatment.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 106 Annual Report 2015 2.6 Illustrations of application of the Remuneration Policy Under the Remuneration Policy, a significant portion of remuneration is variable and depends on the Companys performance.
Below we illustrate how the total pay opportunity for the Executive Directors varies under three performance scenarios: maximum, on target, and below threshold.
The scenarios, informed by the current application of our pay policy, are defined as follows: Element Fixed pay, benefits and ESOP Fixed pay and ESOP does not vary with performance and comprises: Base salary effective 1st January 2014 Benefits value based on 2013 disclosure Pension value DB 2013 as reported: cash allowance: rate applied to 2014 salary ESOP participation of up to 1,500 1:1 matching shares for eligible Executive Directors Percentage of base salary Below threshold On target Maximum Annual bonus % of salary 0% 60% 100% 1 PSP % of salary at award 0% 25% 100% 1 A l evel of 25% vesting for on target performance is equivalent to threshold performance under the PSP, which the Committee believes to be a fair assumption foron target performance given the approach taken to setting performance targets.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 107 Annual Report 2015 Corporate Information Financial Statements Governance Report Strategic Report Governance Report Remuneration: Remuneration Policy report 2015 continued 2.7 Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group When determining the remuneration of Executive Directors, the Committee considers the pay of employees across the Group.
When conducting the annual salary review, the average base salary increase awarded to the UK workforce and senior managers across the Group provides a key reference point when determining levels of increase for Executive Director remuneration.
The Remuneration Policy was drawn up by the Committee without the need for any consultation with employees.
The Committee also determines the principles and policy of remuneration which shall apply to the Groups senior managers.
The responsibility for determining precise compensation packages that meet local practice and performance targets lies with the Group Chief Executive and the responsible Executive Director.
To ensure consistency in Remuneration Policy across the Group and to encourage a performance culture, senior managers participate in the PSP.
The Board believes that share ownership is an effective way of aligning the interests of managers and shareholders and to strengthen the development of the business.
2.8 Statement of consideration of shareholder views In developing and reviewing the Companys Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and other senior executives, the Committee seeks and takes into account the range of views of shareholders.
The Committee Chairman actively engages with institutional shareholders when appropriate and takes into account their views when reviewing and implementing the Companys Remuneration Policy.
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during the year at meetings with shareholders, is considered as part of the Companys annual review of Remuneration Policy.
At the AGM in 2013, the advisory vote on the 2012 Directors remuneration report received 96.3% in favour.
The views of shareholders have been helpful and constructive and assisted in the development of a pro-forma Executive Director service agreement which has been applied to Nicholas Anderson on his appointment as Group Chief Executive and which will apply to all new appointments.
Specifically in relation to the termination arrangements, the revised service agreement restricts any termination payment to 12 months base pay.
This applies to the new Group Chief Executive service agreement and, in the event of a material change in the role, function or responsibilities, existing Executive Directors service agreements will be reviewed and changed to meet the new standard.
