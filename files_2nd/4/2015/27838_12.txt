STATEMENT FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION AND NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The Remuneration and Nominations Committee considers the appropriate level of Directors fees.
The Directors of the Company are all non-executive and receive an annual fee per annum which is currently 35,000 for the Chairman and 30,000 for the other Directors.
The Chairman is entitled to a higher fee to reflect the additional work required to carry out the role.
Directors receive an additional fee of 5,000 per annum for taking on the responsibility of Chairmanship of a Committee.
During the year under review, the Committee met four times and it has: n considered market remuneration trends against a comparison of its peer group: n reviewed the policy on the re-election of Directors at the AGM: n reviewed the size, composition and structure of the Board, time commitment required of the Directors and leadership needs of the Company: and n received a proposal from the Investment Manager on revisions to the Directors fees and receipt of one-off payments.
The Remuneration and Nominations Committee has reviewed the composition of the Board and in consideration of the size and complexity of the business agreed to recommend to the Board that a fourth non-executive director be appointed.
Post the year end, the Committee engaged an external search agency, HPA Advisory, to identify candidates to fill this Board position.
It is expected that the Company will be in a position to make an appointment in the near future and a notification will be made in due course.
Pursuant to the proposal from the Investment Manager, which was based on the time commitment to the Companys affairs and a comparison against its peer group, the Board approved an increase of 5,000 in the annual fee of the non-executive Directors and Chairman and an increase of 2,000 for each position of Committee Chairman with effect from 1 October 2015.
In addition, as permitted under the Articles of Association, the Board approved an additional ad hoc payment of 10,000 to the Directors in recognition of the additional work completed in relation to the successful additional share issues undertaken by the Company in the year.
None of the Directors were eligible to vote on the approval of their own fee increase.
Following this review of the Directors fees, no further changes to fees are expected and there will be no significant changes in the way the current, approved Remuneration Policy will be implemented in the course of the next financial year.
The Board have also considered and agreed upon a formal policy for the approval of Directors expenses.
The appointment of an external remuneration consultant was considered and it was agreed that it was not necessary at this time.
