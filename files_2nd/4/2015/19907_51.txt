INCENTIVE OUTCOMES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 AUDITED Performance related annual bonus in respect of 2015 performance The 2015 annual bonus consists of two elements, corporate and individual.
The corporate element of the bonus is calculated on a sliding scale up to a maximum of 120% of base salary, in accordance with which on target performance by the Group results in a corporate bonus of an amount equivalent to 70% of base salary.
To determine the actual bonus payment to an Executive Director, a multiplier being the individual element of the scheme, ranging between zero and 1.2 is applied against the corporate bonus.
Applying the maximum individual multiplier of 1.2, against the maximum corporate bonus of 120% of base salary, results in a maximum annual performance related bonus opportunity of 144% of base salary.
However, bonus payments at that level would only be made subject to the achievement of extremely stretching corporate performance targets and exceptional individual performance by the relevant Director.
Target performance typically requires meaningful improvement on the previous years outturn, and for financial measures, targets are typically in line with the upper end of market consensus.
