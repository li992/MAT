2015 annual bonus award audited Executive directors had the potential to receive an annual bonus of up to 120% of base salary.
Group EBITDA targets up to 80% of salary The primary driver of the award was based on Group EBITDA performance relative to targets set at the start of the financial year.
In assessing the final award, the required Group EBITDA isadjusted up or down dependent upon the actual market size relative to the plan.
The market size is measured based on the independent Land Registry data as at the end of October 2015 plus full-year indicative estimates after considering all relevant information on the size ofthe market, including Bank of England mortgage approval levels, in the final two months of the year.
Group EBITDA is also adjusted for anysignificant benefit and costs associated with major unplanned initiatives such as acquisitions.
In determining the 2015 annual bonus award, the Committee considered: Group EBITDA of 113.0 million, which represents underperformance of the target Group EBITDA of 136.2 million in the plan: and a market size estimated to be 3% down on the prior year.
Whilst performance against the original plan would have triggered a bonus of 33% of the maximum under this part of the bonus i. e. 26% of salary, the lower than expected market size and adjustment for acquisitions resulted in a flexing upwards of the annual bonus awardto37.5% of the maximum i. e. 30% of salary.
62 Countrywide plc Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements The following table illustrates the performance measures and Group targets, their significance in terms of value and the respective outcomes: Performance required Measure Weighting Threshold On-target Maximum Actual Payout Flexed Group EBITDA 66.7% 106.2m 132.7m 146.0m 113.0m 30% of salary Strategic targets up to 40% of salary The remaining third of bonus potential was dependent upon an assessment of progress against: the growth strategy: embedding performance measurement across the organisation: implementing a new organisation structure aligned with strategy: and enhancements to operational excellence, including IT architecture.
After assessing performance, the Committee acknowledged progress in most areas and determined abonus of 20% of salary, 50% of the maximum award.
Total award Performance against the flexed EBITDA targets for up to 80% of salary resulted in 37.5% of the maximum award under this element 30% of salary while performance against the strategic targets for up to 40% of salary resulted in 50% of the maximum payable under this element 20% of salary.
Therefore the total bonus payable was 41.6% of the maximum 50% of salary.
In line with the deferral policy, one-third of the bonus award will be deferred into Company shares for a period of three years.
