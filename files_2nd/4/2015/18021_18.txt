Remuneration may include: An award made in respect of a new appointment to buy out existing incentive awards forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In such cases the compensatory award would typically be a like-for-like award with similar time-to-vesting, performance conditions and likelihood of those conditions being met.
The fair value of the compensatory award would not be greater than the awards being replaced.
To facilitate such a buyout, the Committee may use an award under a different structure or an additional award under the PSP or MSP.
A relocation package, should this be required.
In the event that an employee is promoted to the Board, the Company would honour any existing contractual arrangements.
Awards are subject to performance conditions.

It is the Companys policy that termination payments should not exceed the Directors current salary and benets for the notice period.
Where a Director may be entitled to pursue a claim against the Company in respect of his her statutory employment rights or any other claim arising from the employment or its termination, the Committee will be entitled to enter into a settlement agreement with the Director.
The Company may pay a Directors legal fees in relation to any settlement agreement.
When considering exit payments, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and participants.

Any other reason Awards lapse An individual would generally be considered a good leaver if they left the Groups employment by reason of injury, ill-health, disability approved by the Committee, redundancy or retirement with the agreement of the employing company.
The table above summarises how MSP and PSP awards are typically treated in specic leaver circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the Committees discretion, for example an individual may be considered a good leaver for any other reason at the absolute discretion of the Committee, and the vesting of awards may be reduced for good leavers.
There are no obligations on the Company contained within the existing Directors service contracts which would give rise to payments not disclosed in this report.
The service contracts of any future-appointed Directors will provide for mitigation in the event of termination.
