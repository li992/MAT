Benefits for the Non-executive Directors are for reimbursement of taxable travel expenses grossed up for the tax payable thereon.
ii As explained on page 97, half of the annual bonus is paid in cash, with the other half being used to purchase St. Jamess Place shares which are subject to forfeiture for 3 years under the terms of the Deferred Bonus Scheme.
iii The value of the long term incentives is the value of shares for the award where the performance period ends in the year together with the value of the dividends that would have been received during the three year performance period.
The figures for 2015 have been calculated using the average of the SJP share price in the 3month period to 31 December 2015, being 9.52, as the actual vesting date of the PSP award is on 21 March 2016.
The figures for 2014 have been updated from the 3 month average figures used in last years report being 1,847,115 for David Bellamy and 1,229,315 for Andrew Croft, Ian Gascoigne and David Lamb to take into account the SJP share price on the date of vesting on 15 March 2015, being 9.45. iv Pension contributions, being 20% of base salary, for all Directors were capped by legislation and so a non-pensionable salary supplement was paid to the Executive Directors in full for David Bellamy, Andrew Croft and Ian Gascoigne and for the balance for David Lamb, who had a 40,000 contribution to the money purchase Group pension scheme.
v The value of the SAYE options exercised by David Bellamy on 4 August 2015 when the mid-market price of St. Jamess Place shares was 9.735, by Andrew Croft on 27 May 2015 when the mid-market price of St. Jamess Place shares was 9.335 and by David Lamb on 2 November 2015 when the mid-market price of St. Jamess Place shares was 9.64. vi David Lamb was a non-executive director of the Henderson Smaller Companies Investment Trust plc during the year and was paid a fee of 21,750 in 2015 in connection with that role 2014: 19,375. vii Mike Wilson, a former Director of the Company, was paid 200,000 in 2015 200,000 in 2014 in respect of his role as Chairman of the St. Jamess Place Foundation, assisting the Academy and mentoring various members of the St. Jamess Place Partnership.
ST. JAMESS PLACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 86 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Details of Variable Pay Earned in the Year Annual Bonus for 2015 Performance The performance conditions which applied to the bonus and the resulting payout were as follows: Weighting Weighting Maximum Payout Payout Measure % of salary % of maximum Threshold value Actual % of salary % of maximum EEV operating profit 75% 50% 513m 569m 660.2m 75% 50% Strategic business plan objectives 75% 50% Assessment by the Committee of the 65% 43.3% performance of the Executive Directors Total payout 140% 93.3% In setting the operating profit target for the year it was assumed that the combined operating experience variance and operating assumption changes would have a neutral impact on the outcome for the year.
The actual outcome for the year included a combined positive impact to the operating profit from these two items of 122.2 million.
The Committee concluded that this positive outcome was as a result of management action during the year and should therefore be included when assessing the bonus payout for the year.
Annual Bonus Strategic Targets Performance Assessment As described in other parts of the Report and Accounts, the Company delivered strong performance in 2015 for our clients, shareholders and other stakeholders.
The Committee considered these three groups when setting the strategic targets for 2015, together with other objectives set out in the 2015 business plan.
In serving our clients well, developing our employees and the Partnership for the future and striving to improve the effectiveness of our organisation, we will be best placed to meet our long-term business objectives, and create additional value for our shareholders.
We also focus on the importance of safe and sustainable growth through prudent management of risk and the highest standards of regulatory compliance.
The Committee assessed how well the Executive team had performed in relation to the objectives set at the start of the year.
The Committee did not place fixed weightings on the factors assessed, but made a judgement based on the Committees view of the relative importance and impact of those factors over the course of the year.
For some factors the Committee put in place quantitative metrics, and for others qualitative judgements were made, depending on the nature of the strategic objective.
As regards client satisfaction, the Committee took into account the following objectives: The Annual Wealth Account Survey results for 2015 were very strong with 95% of clients saying they would recommend SJP to friends or contacts and 58% of those surveyed confirming they have done so already: Clients continued to benefit from above average performance across the majority of funds and portfolios over a range of time periods.
Across all ten year periods, the equity fund managers outperformed their benchmark, on average, 82% of the time.
Over the three and five year periods, the equivalent average outperformance rate was 75% and 74% respectively.
For the range of eight Growth and Income portfolios available to clients, outperformance compared to the relevant Asset Risk Consultants ARC Private Client Index peer group occurred in 85% of all three year periods on average: The Group won a number of industry awards, further details of which are set out on page 49, many of which were voted on by clients: and The above factors, together with strong service levels, generally contributed to excellent retention of funds under management, with 95% of existing funds being retained see page 16 for further details.
In terms of strategic objectives designed to ensure the success of the business in the future, the Committee took into account: The growth in the size of the Partnership of 6.2% in 2015: The success of the Academy in attracting suitable candidates to the courses run in 2015, the establishment of a new Academy based in Solihull and 71 advisers graduating from the Academy and joining the Partnership in 2015: The high levels of retention for both employees and members of the Partnership, assisted by additional training and development opportunities for the senior management team, the Partnership and the workforce generally: and The continued improvements in the standard of documentation in relation to new business submitted by the Partnership.
03183415 Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information 87 In addition to the above, the Committee assessed and noted the satisfactory completion of the various strategic objectives set out in the business plan, including: Continuing the integration of the Henley Group in Asia with a 60% increase in the number of advisers in Asia: Acquisition of Rowan Dartington: Continuing positive engagement with the Groups regulators and implementing Solvency II: The completion of various objectives designed to enhance and strengthen the monitoring and mitigation of key regulatory risks impacting the Group: The introduction of the new administration platform for certain aspects of the business, although it was acknowledged that there had been some initial challenges with implementation: Launching the new Money Management Account: The continuing development of the Groups range of funds, the range of fund managers available to clients and the strengthening of the Investment Committee: and The ongoing success of the Groups CSR objectives, including raising a record 7 million for the Foundation and expanding the volunteering opportunities available to employees.
Taking all the above strategic objectives into account, the Committee awarded a bonus of 65% of salary 87% of the maximum under the team performance element of the annual bonus scheme, recognising that a high proportion of the strategic objectives were graded as outstanding or above stretch and that nearly all of the major business plan objectives had been satisfactorily completed.
Notes: i The Committee has the discretion to scale back the annual bonus payable in respect of the strategic measures if it considers it inappropriate in the context of the overall financial results of the Group.
The Committee reviewed the Groups performance and agreed that no scale-back was appropriate.
ii The Committee retains the discretion to amend each element of the bonus, up or down, within the overall cap of 150% of salary, to take into account other relevant factors such as the Groups performance compared to competitor organisations or, for instance, an exceptional positive or negative event which impacts the Group.
The Committee reviewed the Groups performance as well as competitors and the external market at the end of the performance period and agreed that no adjustment was required.
iii Half of the bonus is paid in cash, with the remainder being invested in the Companys shares and deferred for three years, under the Groups deferred bonus plan.

These will vest on 21 March 2016, being the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The performance conditions which applied to the 2013 PSP awards, and the actual performance achieved against these conditions, are set out in the table below: Average annual adjusted EPS growth Average annual adjusted EPS growth including the unwind of the excluding the unwind of the TSR relative to the FTSE 250 discount rate in excess of RPI discount rate in excess of RPI % of one % of one % of one third of third of third of award award award Performance level hurdle Performance required vesting Performance required vesting Performance required vesting Below threshold Below Median 0% Below 5% 0% Below 5% 0% Threshold Median 25% At least 5% 25% At least 5% 25% Stretch or above Upper Quartile or above 100% 16% or above 100% 16% or above 100% Actual achieved 23 out of 172 companies 100% 26% 100% 26% 100% Above Upper Quartile FTSE 250, excluding investment trusts and companies in the FTSE oil, gas and mining sectors.

Note 2: Up to 744 shares can be exercised by each Executive Director via a linked award under an approved share option scheme, with an exercise price of 5.155.
If such linked award is exercised, a number of shares equivalent to the gain achieved upon such exercise will be lapsed from the number of Performance Share Plan shares noted, and the overall value of shares vesting is therefore unchanged from the number set out above.

The face value of the award figure is calculated by multiplying the number of shares awarded by the average share price figure of 9.8125.
PSP awards are structured as nil cost options and there is therefore no exercise price payable on exercise.
Dividend equivalents accrue to the Executive Directors between the date of grant and exercise of the award up to a maximum of five years from date of grant, but are released only to the extent that awards vest.
Further details of the performance conditions which apply to the awards are set out in Notes 1 and 2 on page 95.

03183415 Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information 95 Annual Bonus for 2016 The Executive Directors maximum bonus opportunity for 2016 will be the same as for 2015, being 150% of salary.
Half of the annual bonus will be determined by EEV operating profit and half by key strategic targets.
50% of the annual bonus earned for performance in 2016 will be paid in cash and the remaining 50% will be deferred in SJP shares for a three year period and subject to continued service.
The EEV operating profit target set by the Committee is based on a sliding scale to progressively reward incremental performance.
The EEV result is calculated based on best estimate assumptions and any deviation or changes from these assumptions are reported as an experience variance or an operating assumption change.
In setting the operating profit target for the year it is assumed the combined operating experience variance and operating assumption changes will have a neutral impact on the outcome for the year.
In setting the 2016 EEV Operating Profit target, the Committee maintained the new business and expense growth objectives at the same level as in previous years.
However, it was recognised that, in comparison to the 2015 operating profit target, the 2016 contribution to operating profit from the unwind of the discount rate will be impacted positively, but marginally, by the higher discount rate, due to the 0.2% increase in the UK ten-year Government gilt yield from 5.0% to 5.2% during 2015.
The Board considers that the performance targets for the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and is not disclosing them at this time.
The performance metrics and performance against them will be disclosed in the 2016 Remuneration Report to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time.
The team element of the 2016 annual bonus will be assessed by reference to key strategic targets based around the 2016 business plan, including elements relating to clients, shareholders and other key stakeholders.
Specific objectives include: the delivery of excellent service to the Groups clients as measured by surveys and other client feedback: enhancing the range of investment funds and maintaining strong investment performance: the successful recruitment and retention of high quality new Partners: successfully implementing the next phase of the new administration system and transferring certain existing assets onto the new system: successfully controlling and mitigating the material risks that could impact the Group: and maintaining the Groups good relations with its shareholders and regulators.
Performance Share Plan Awards for 2016 The Executive Directors will each receive a PSP award in 2016 of 190% of salary, except for David Bellamy who will receive a PSP award of 200% of salary.
Awards will be subject to a relative TSR performance condition for one-third of the award and earnings per share growth targets for two-thirds of the award as follows: Average annual adjusted EPS Average annual adjusted EPS growth including the unwind of the growth excluding the unwind of the discount rate in excess of RPI discount rate in excess of RPI TSR relative to the FTSE 51 to 150 Note 1 Note 2 Note 2 % of one % of one % of one third of third of third of Performance level hurdle Performance required award vesting Performance required award vesting Performance required award vesting Below threshold Below Median 0% Below 5% 0% Below 5% 0% Threshold Median 25% At least 5% 25% At least 5% 25% Stretch or above Upper Quartile or 100% 16% or above 100% 16% or above 100% above Note 1: FTSE 51 to 150, excluding investment trusts and companies in the FTSE oil, gas producers and mining sectors.
Straight line vesting occurs in between threshold and maximum vesting.
Note 2: T he first EPS performance condition is calculated by reference to adjusted consolidated profit after tax on the EEV basis of accounting for both the life and unit trust businesses on a fully diluted per share basis.
The effect of the adjustment to the consolidated after tax figures will be to strip out the post tax EEV investment variance and any economic assumption change in the final year of the performance period as these factors are not within the control of management and can produce wide variations to reported earnings due to stock market fluctuations.
However, this measure of EPS is still impacted by stock market movements in the prior year due to the impact of any such movements on the unwind of the discount rate in the current year.
T he second EPS performance condition is calculated in a similar way to the first EPS condition, save that a further adjustment is made to strip out the impact of the unwind of the discount rate.
This adjustment eliminates any direct impact of stock market volatility and changes in the economic assumptions throughout the whole three-year period of the performance condition.
