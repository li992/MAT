During the year, the Committee completed a review of executive remuneration and the Committee proposes to make a number of changes to the Policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
This Remuneration Policy will be put forward for shareholder approval at the AGM on 9 June 2016 and if the revised Policy is approved, it will take effect from the date of the AGM.
There will also be a separate resolution at the AGM to approve a new Long Term Incentive Plan.
Details of how the Company will implement the Policy are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration section starting on page 56.
Overview of Remuneration Policy The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will: Align rewards with the interests of shareholders: Motivate and encourage superior performance: Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy: Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management: and Ensure that the overall package for each Director is linked to strategic objectives of the Group.
As a result of the 2015 remuneration review, the key policy changes being proposed to our remuneration policy for Executive Directors are: Pension While there is no change to the previous policy, going forward, the intention is to provide the Finance Director and the Operations Director with a pension contribution of 15 per cent of salary which is in line with the other Executive Directors, backdated to 1 January 2016: Annual bonus To provide an opportunity closer in line with market levels, it is proposed that the bonus maximum is increased to 135 per cent for the Chief Executive and 125 per cent for other Directors.
Whilst the maximum is being increased, the current bonus target of 70 per cent of salary will remain and, therefore, the higher bonus potential will only be payable for above target performance and nothing is payable for achieving less than the target.
Any bonus in excess of 100 per cent of salary must be deferred in shares for 2 years.
Bonuses will continue to be subject to recovery and withholding provisions and will now be based on demanding EBIT rather than EPS targets: and Long-Term Incentive Plan It is proposed to increase the individual limit award from 125 per cent to 150 per cent of salary to ensure that there is appropriate incentivisation and sufficient shareholder alignment through equity ownership.
Awards will continue to be subject to recovery and withholding provisions.
The share ownership guideline will be increased from 100 per cent to 200 per cent of salary.
Holding periods A two year holding period will apply for Executive Directors' vested LTIP awards for the 2016 award and thereafter.
The Remuneration Committee is confident that this revised policy will appropriately incentivise and retain the Dignity management team and that the increased focus on variable pay will provide greater alignment between executives interests and those of shareholders.

Until the guideline is met, the executive is required to retain 50 per cent of shares acquired under the Companys share plans after allowing for tax and national insurance liabilities.
Recovery and withholding provisions apply to variable pay, to enable the company to recover amounts paid under the annual bonus and LTIP in the event of a restatement of the accounts or an error in calculation leading to an over-payment.
Payments may be recovered for up to two years after payment vesting or two external audit cycles.
The amount to be recovered would generally be the excess payment over the amount which would otherwise be paid, and recovery may be satisfied in a variety of ways, including through the reduction of outstanding deferred awards, reduction of the next bonus or LTIP vesting and seeking a cash repayment.
Annual bonus metrics will be determined at the start of each year, based on the Company's priorities for the coming year.
Measures may include profit such as operating profit, PBT or EPS which is one of the key financial measures of growth.
LTIP performance metrics will be determined at the time of grant and based on the Company's long-term strategy.
Total Shareholder Return is an important benchmark of the success of the business and provides a strong alignment with the returns received by shareholders.
The EPS measure ensures a focus on long-term profitability which the Committee believes is a driver of shareholder value.
The Committee is made aware of pay structures across the wider Group when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary review for the Executive Directors.
An annual bonus plan operates across all employees in the Group and all permanent employees are eligible to participate in the SAYE scheme.
Overall, the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees.
This ensures that there is a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration received by the Executive Directors given it is the Executive Directors who are considered to have the greatest potential to influence Company value creation.
Dignity plc 54 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Governance Report on Directors remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2015 Bonus Plan and LTIP discretions The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and LTIP according to their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
A copy of the LTIP rules is available on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of these plans.
These include but are not limited to the following albeit with the level of award restricted as set out in the policy table on page 53 : Who participates in the plans: The timing of grant of award and or payment: The size of an award and or a payment: Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction: Determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate treatment chosen: Adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends : and The ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose whilst being no less stretching.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed previously to shareholders.
Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors The Company's policy results in a significant portion of remuneration received by Executive Directors being dependent on Company performance.
The graph below illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the Executive Directors for 2016 vary under three performance scenarios: minimum, on-target and maximum.

On-target comprises fixed pay and assumes a bonus of 70 per cent of salary is paid and 50 per cent of the LTIP vests.
Maximum comprises fixed pay and assumes full bonus payment and LTIP vesting.
No account has been taken of any changes in the Company's share price since the end of the period.
Recruitment and Promotion policy The remuneration package for a new director will be established in accordance with the Company's approved policy subject to such modifications as are set out below.
Salary levels for Executive Directors will be set in accordance with the Company's remuneration policy, taking into account the experience and calibre of the individual and their existing remuneration package.
Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, a series of increases to the desired salary positioning may be made over subsequent years subject to individual performance and development in the role.
Benefits will generally be provided in line with the approved policy, with relocation or other expenses provided for if necessary.
A pension contribution or cash in lieu of up to 15 per cent of salary may be provided or continued participation in the defined benefit pension scheme for a promoted employee who currently participates in the plan.
Minimum On-target Maximum Minimum On-target Maximum Minimum On-target Maximum Minimum On-target Maximum Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 55 The structure of variable pay elements will be in accordance with the Company's approved policy detailed above.
The maximum variable pay opportunity will be as set out in the remuneration policy table, being 150 per cent of salary under the annual bonus plan and awards with a face value of 150 per cent of salary under the LTIP.
Different performance measures may be set initially for the annual bonus in the year of joining, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial year that he or she joined the Board.
In the case of external recruitment, if it is necessary to buy out incentive pay or benefit arrangements which would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer, this may be provided, taking into account the form cash or shares, timing and expected value i. e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria of the remuneration being forfeited.
Replacement share awards, if used, may be granted using the Company's existing share plans to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the LSE Listing Rules.
The aim of any such award would be to ensure that as far as possible, the expected value and structure of the award will be no more generous than the amount forfeited.
In the case of an internal recruitment, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms of grant or adjusted as considered desirable to reflect the new role.
Fees for a new chairman or non-executive director will be set in line with the approved policy.
Service contracts and payments for loss of office The Company's policy is to have service contracts for Executive Directors that continue indefinitely unless determined by their notice period.
Under the Executive Directors' service contracts and in line with the policy for new appointments, 12 months' notice of termination of employment is required by either party.
Service contracts are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of two years, subject to annual re-appointment at the AGM.
Appointments may be terminated with three months' notice.
The appointment letters for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors provide that no compensation is payable on termination, other than accrued fees and expenses.
In accordance with the terms of the UK Corporate Governance Code all Directors submit themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting each year.
Service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.
Details of the service contracts with all Executive Directors and letters of appointment with Non-Executive Directors are as follows: Unexpired term of contract or letter of appointment Name Contract date Notice period at period end Mike McCollum 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract Andrew Davies 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract Richard Portman 1 November 2006 12 months Rolling Contract Steve Whittern 1 January 2009 12 months Rolling Contract Peter Hindley 7 December 2013 3 months 12 months David Blackwood 1 October 2015 3 months 21 months Alan McWalter 1 January 2015 3 months 12 months Jane Ashcroft 1 April 2014 3 months 3 months Martin Pexton 1 April 2014 3 months 3 months For Executive Directors, the Company may in its absolute discretion at any time after notice is served by either party, terminate a Directors' contract with immediate effect by paying an amount equal to base salary for the then unexpired period of notice plus the fair value of contractual benefits subject to the deduction of tax.
An Executive Director's service contract may be terminated without notice for certain events such as gross misconduct or a serious breach of contract.
No payment or compensation beyond salary and the value of holiday entitlement accrued up to the date of termination will be made if such an event occurs.
There are no special provisions relating to change of control.
The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations and the Committee ensures that there are no unjustified payments for failure.
Any statutory payments required by law may be made.
The Group allows Executive Directors to hold a Non-Executive position with one other company or organisation, for which they can retain the fees earned.
Mike McCollum was appointed a non-executive director of CVS Group plc on 2 April 2013 and received remuneration of 43,000 per annum including an allowance for his role as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Dignity plc 56 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Governance Report on Directors remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2015 Treatment of incentives At the discretion of the Committee, for certain good leaver circumstances such as death, illness, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, their employing company ceasing to be a Group Company or the undertaking business or division for which he or she works being sold out of the Company's Group, or any other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, a pro rata bonus may become payable at the normal payment date for the period of employment and based on full year performance.
Should the Committee decide to make a payment in such circumstances, the rationale would be fully disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The treatment of share-based incentives previously granted to an Executive Director will be determined based on the plan rules.
The default treatment will be for outstanding awards to lapse on cessation of employment.
However, an executive will be treated as a 'good leaver' under certain circumstances such as death, illness, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, their employing company ceasing to be a Group Company or the undertaking business or division for which he or she works being sold out of the Company's Group, or any other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee.
Under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, if treated as a good leaver, awards will normally vest on the original vesting date and will not normally be subject to a pro rata reduction unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Under the LTIP, if treated as a good leaver, awards will vest at the normal vesting date subject to the extent to which performance targets have been achieved.
The number of LTIP awards that would vest will be reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the three year period actually served.
How shareholder views are taken into account The Remuneration Committee is committed to ensuring an open dialogue with our shareholders and therefore, where changes are being made to the remuneration policy or where there is a material change in which we operate our policy, we will consult with major shareholders in advance.
The Remuneration Committee adopted such an approach in putting together this revised policy by consulting the Company's largest shareholders and shareholder advisory bodies beforehand.
In addition, the Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Company does not actively consult with employees on Directors' remuneration.
However, when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of other employees in the Group.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION The Annual Report on Remuneration set out below and the Chairman's Annual Statement will be put to a single advisory shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM.
The information below includes how we intend to operate our revised policy in 2016 and the pay outcomes in respect of the 2015 financial year.
The information from the single total remunerations figures for Directors on page 58 to the end of the section on loss of office payments on page 61 has been audited.
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2015 The Committee carried out a comprehensive review of executive remuneration in the last quarter of 2015.
Reflecting the strong performance of the Company and its increased size and complexity, the Committee has decided to make a number of changes to the Directors' remuneration policy to ensure executive directors are appropriately incentivised and rewarded.
The Committee is satisfied that the Directors' revised packages are commensurate with their present roles, experience and pay levels more generally in the FTSE 250.
Subject to shareholders' approving our remuneration policy, details of how we will operate our policy in 2016 are provided below.
Salaries Following the review of Executive Directors' base salaries during the last quarter of the financial period ending 25 December 2015, the Committee decided to increase the Executive Directors' salaries as shown in the table below with effect from 1 January 2016.
The proposed salaries as at 1 January 2016 are: 2016 2015 Increase Mike McCollum 510,300 486,000 5% Andrew Davies 325,500 310,000 5% Richard Portman 246,750 235,000 5% Steve Whittern 315,000 300,000 5% Reflecting the strong performance of the Company, its increased size and complexity and the Committees desire to retain and motivate this proven management team, the Committee decided to increase the Executive Directors salaries by five per cent.
The Committee is conscious of shareholders calls for pay restraint and took into account the views of its largest shareholders and shareholder bodies when determining the 2016 increase.
The Committee is aware of the dangers of over-reliance on market data but it believes the above increases are appropriate in light of each individual's performance and responsibility alongside Company performance.
For information, the resulting salaries will be positioned up to eight per cent below the median of the FTSE 250 and around 25 per cent below median for the Corporate Services Director.
Future salary increases for the duration of the policy are expected to be around those awarded to the wider workforce subject to good personal and company performance except where there are material revisions to the current roles and responsibilities.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 57 Chairman and Non-Executive Directors' fees As set out in the Policy Report, the Company's approach to setting Non-Executive Directors' remuneration is with reference to market levels in comparably sized FTSE companies, levels of responsibility and time commitments.
The Senior Independent Director receives an additional fee of 9,500 and the Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration Committees receive additional fees of 9,200 and 6,200 respectively.
The fees have been increased by 2 per cent from 2015.
David Blackwood was appointed to the Board on 1 October 2015.
His fees for 2015 are shown on an annualised basis to allow comparison with 2016.
Pension and Benefits In order to ensure a fair and consistent pension policy, from 2016 all Executive Directors receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 15 per cent of their basic salary.
Benefits will be provided in line with the approved remuneration policy.
If the new remuneration policy is approved, the Finance and Operations Directors will receive contributions of 15 per cent of salary per annum for the period from 1 January 2016.
Annual bonus The annual bonus will operate as detailed in the Policy Report.
For 2016, the annual bonus will be solely based on stretching underlying EBIT targets instead of EPS.
The Committee believes that EBIT is a better measure of trading performance and it provides a good balance with EPS and TSR which continue to be used in the LTIP.
As in previous years, nothing will be payable for performance below a target level of performance, up to 70 per cent of salary is payable for achieving the target and full bonus 135 per cent of salary for the CEO and 125 per cent of salary for the other Executive Directors for achieving a second, more demanding, target.
The bonus is payable on a pro rata basis for performance between the first and second targets.
The EBIT targets themselves are deemed to be commercially sensitive and have not been disclosed prospectively.
However, full retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year's remuneration report.
In accordance with the new policy, any bonus payable in excess of 100 per cent of salary will be deferred in shares.
The deferred shares will vest after two years subject to continued employment.
Longterm incentives The intention is to make awards under the LTIP to Executive Directors with a face value of up to 150 per cent of salary.
Half of the 2016 awards will be subject to a relative TSR measure which will be measured against the constituents of the FTSE 350 as at 29 December 2015 and the other half subject to EPS growth targets.
The performance period for both tranches will be the three financial years, 2016-2018.
TSR No part of this award vests if performance is below median, 25 per cent vests for achieving median, with 100 per cent vesting for upper quartile performance with straight line vesting in between.
For this part of the award, no vesting can occur unless the Committee considers that the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory.
EPS No part of this award vests if underlying EPS in 2018 is lower than 128.1p, 15 per cent vests for EPS of 128.1p, 50 per cent vests for EPS of 134.8p with 100 per cent vesting for EPS of 144.9p.
Straight line calculations are made to calculate the vesting percentage between each point.
As set out in the Chief Executives overview, 2015 was an exceptional year following unusually high death rates in the UK.
While the Committee generally intends to set financial targets based on the 10 per cent medium term target and market earnings expectations where appropriate, the 2016 EPS target recognises the high 2015 EPS performance however, it is considered challenging in the circumstances.
It should be noted that the above target range produces a 50 per cent vesting for achieving 134.8p which represents current consensus for that year.
In future years the Committee will set targets annually having regards to market expectations at the time of grant and the 10 per cent medium term EPS growth target.
Unlike previous years, the Committee wishes to add a requirement for Executive Directors to be subject to a post-vesting holding period of two years on this award and all awards thereafter.
This requires Executive Directors to hold on to the net of tax number of vested shares for a period of two years following vesting.

b Pension includes a cash contribution for Mike McCollum and the value of participation in the Groups defined benefit pension scheme for Richard Portman to 31 March 2014 and a cash contribution for the remainder of 2014 and all of 2015. c The bonus refers to performance in the 2015 financial year and is due to be paid in cash in March 2016. d The LTIP value relates to the award that was granted 19 March 2013.
The performance period for this award ends on 29 December 2015.
The value shown is calculated by reference to the 28 day average share price on 25 December 2015.
The comparative number is the 2012 LTIP that was exercised in 2015.
The gain shown is based on the price each Director sold his shares.
e Ishbel Macpherson resigned from the Board on 30 September 2015 and David Blackwood was appointed to the Board on 1 October 2015.
Determination of 2015 annual bonus outcome The targets for the 2015 annual bonus were based on the achievement of set earnings per share growth targets.
70 per cent of the maximum bonus being 100 per cent of salary for Executive Directors was payable for achieving a first demanding underlying EPS target of 96.3 pence per share and 100 per cent for a second, more demanding underlying EPS target of 99.2 pence per share.
Target for Stretch for Cash bonus which 70% of which 100% of payable out of maximum maximum 100% of salary Weighting payable payable 2015 achieved maximum Earnings per share 100% 96.3pence 99.2pence 114.8pence 100% The strong growth in underlying EPS over the year of 34 per cent meant that the first and second EPS targets were met.
Accordingly, the Committee awarded Executive Directors full bonuses in respect of the 2015 financial year, being 100 per cent of base salary.
None of the annual bonus is deferred.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 59 Determination of LTIP awards with performance periods ending in the year Half of the LTIP awards made 2013 were subject to a relative TSR condition and half subject to EPS, both measured over the three year period which ended on 31 December 2015.

2012 LTIP award In last year's report, an estimate for TSR of 100 per cent was provided based on performance to 26 December 2014.
Following the end of the performance period on 28 March 2015, the final calculation was performed and Dignitys actual TSR over the three year period was 137.4 per cent placing Dignity 40 out of the 337 companies in the TSR peer group.
Therefore the 100 per cent assumption was correct.
LTIP awards granted in the year LTIP awards granted in the form of nil cost options to Executive Directors on 5 March 2015 were as follows: Face maximum value Number of LTIP of awards % of award vesting at Executive awards at grant date threshold and maximum Performance period Mike McCollum 34,874 607,505 Threshold: 15% for EPS and 6.3.
2018 Based on a face value grant of 125 per cent of salary and using a 28 day average share price to 26 December 2014 of 1,742 pence.
Half of the 2015 award will vest subject to a relative TSR measure measured against the constituents of the FTSE 350 as at 29 December 2014 and the other half subject to EPS growth targets.
The performance period for both tranches will be measured over the three financial years, 2015-2017.
EPS No part of this award vests if compound annual growth in underlying EPS above RPI is less than six per cent p. a.
15 per cent vests for six per cent p. a. real growth, 50 per cent vests for nine per cent p. a. real growth with full vesting for 11 per cent p. a. real growth or better.
Vesting is on a straight line basis for performance in between these points.
Clawback and malus provisions apply.
Awards will only be released if the Groups comparative TSR performance is equal or greater than the median level of performance over the performance period at which point 25 per cent of the award will be released with full vesting occurring for an upper quartile performance.
Vesting occurs on a straight line basis between these points.
Half of the awards made in 2013, 2014 and 2015 are subject to a relative TSR condition as described above with the other half based on EPS growth targets.

The Committee considers the performance of the Executive Directors as a prelude to recommending their annual remuneration, bonus awards and share awards to the Board for final approval.
The Committee met four times during the year.
At those meetings basic salaries of Executive Directors and senior managers were reviewed, the targets and quantum of annual performance related bonuses for Directors were also agreed, as were awards granted under the Groups Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The meetings also approved the payment of the 2014 performance related bonus and dealt with the vesting of the shares awarded in 2012 under the LTIP scheme.
In the last quarter of 2015, the Committee carried out extensive work in forming a new remuneration policy for approval by shareholders at the AGM in 2016.
The Committee also receives advice from several sources, namely: The Chairman and the Chief Executive who attend the Remuneration Committee by invitation or when required and the Company Secretary, who is also the Corporate Services Director, attends meetings when required as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
No Executive Director takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benefits.
