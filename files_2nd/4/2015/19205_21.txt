In July 2015 salaries were increased by 2% for the chairman of the Board and the chief financial officer and by 3.38% for the chief executive, effective July 2015.

Currently, the bonus year runs from 1 January to 31December each year with bonus amounts being determined in July of each year.
Going forward and in order to facilitate better reporting and transparency in relation to the remuneration of executive directors, the committee intends to review performance and determine annual bonus entitlements at the end of each year.
In accordance with the Companys remuneration policy the maximum annual bonus opportunity is 40% of base compensation and is assessed against financial and operational objectives.
Refer to page 99 of the remuneration policy formore information in relation to the Companys bonus policy.
All bonuses are discretionary and can be reduced from the maximum annual bonus opportunity level for reasons such aspoor performance by the employee or due to disappointing financial performance of the Group as a whole.

Payments to past directors No payments were made to past directors of the Company during the year ended 31 December 2015.
