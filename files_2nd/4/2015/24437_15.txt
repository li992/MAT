With this in mind, our annual bonus provides a strong link to the operational delivery of the business strategy.
The Performance Share Plan focuses the Executive Directors on the longer-term outputs of that strategy, by rewarding sustained improvements in earnings per share and long-term return on capital employed.
As outlined in the Chairmans statement and Chief Executives report, 2015 was another strong year operationally for Greggs with continued good progress against the longer-term strategic plan.
Although 2016 will be another busy year, we have started the year well and I believe this remuneration policy will support the business in delivering continued progress in a competitive and fast-moving market.

We look forward to receiving your continued support Decisions taken by the Committee in 2015 at this years AGM.
During 2015 the business conducted by the Committee related primarily to the more usual standing agenda items, including the determination of base salary levels and performance Sandra Turner conditions for the annual bonus and the 2015 Performance Chair of the Remuneration Committee Share Plan awards.
1 March 2016 Approach for 2016 The Committee has reviewed the operation of our remuneration policy for 2015 and has concluded that the policy should be implemented on an unchanged basis.
The Chairmans fee has been reviewed and will be increased in line with that of the base increase for the workforce generally.
The salary increase for both the Chairman and Executive Directors was 2.75 per cent.
Increases to salaries and fees took effect from 1 January 2016.
Targets for the 2016 annual bonus have been set in line with the financial plan for the business for the year and the rolling five-year strategic plan.
Due to the commercial sensitivity of these they are not disclosed within this report, but will be disclosed retrospectively in next years report.
Under the Performance Share Plan the Committee has considered the performance conditions and has determined that the EPS and ROCE performance conditions should continue to apply with an equal weighting given to each.
Following a review of our business performance against the strategic plan, the EPS and ROCE target ranges have been increased for the 2016 awards, so as to ensure that they remain appropriately stretching.
50 Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Directors Report Accounts Regulatory framework The policy report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 the Act and The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 the Regulations.
It also meets the requirements of the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules.
The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 and the views of our major shareholders.
The policy was subject to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM, and took formal effect from that date.
The annual statement by the Chair of the Remuneration Committee and the annual report on remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2016 AGM.
The Regulations also require our auditor to report to shareholders on the audited information within this remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, the relevant sections have been prepared in accordance with the Act and the Regulations.
The auditors opinion is set out on pages 67 to 69 and we have indicated appropriately the audited sections of this remuneration report.
Remuneration policy report as approved by shareholders on 1 May 2014 Our Directors remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at our AGM on 1 May 2014 and became effective for three years from that date.
We have set out our policy again in this years report to enable cross-reference against its implementation during the year.
The Companys remuneration policy is to continue to provide competitive remuneration packages that will incentivise Executive Directors to achieve sustainable long-term growth and value that will best serve the interests of the Company, its shareholders, its employees and customers.

Any bonus paid in excess of 50% of the maximum will be payable in shares, deferred for two years with vesting subject to continued service.
The dividends payable on deferred bonus shares are paid to the individual as they fall due.
Recovery and withholding provisions allow the Company to recoup annual bonus payments within three years in the event of misstatement of performance, error or misconduct, where this has led to an overpayment in the view of the Committee.
There is a flexible mechanism which allows the Company to withhold outstanding deferred or future remuneration, or recover the overpayment direct from the individual concerned.

This is achieved through vested awards granted via the PSP and deferred bonus shares.
Executive Share Option Scheme The Committee is responsible for overseeing the operation of all the share-based incentives deployed in the Company.
The 2014 Company Share Option Plan and the 2014 Executive Share Option Scheme were approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
Choice of performance measures and approach to target setting The annual bonus is based on performance against a range of financial and strategic performance measures.
This range of metrics measures achievement of the Companys key operational objectives.
The Committee reviews the Key Performance Indicators KPIs each year and varies them as appropriate to reflect the priorities for the business in the year ahead.
Where appropriate a sliding scale of targets is set for each KPI to encourage continuous improvement, or sustained high levels of performance.
The PSP is based on an equal split of EPS and ROCE performance.
EPS, which is a direct measure of profit performance, is our primary long-term KPI.
ROCE is considered to be particularly relevant at the current time as this will focus Executives on redeploying capital efficiently through the planned investment programme, whilst continuing to create returns well above the WACC.
The relative mix of the performance measures may be altered for future awards.
52 Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Directors Report Accounts A sliding scale of challenging performance targets is set for each measure.
The Committee will review the choice of performance measures and the appropriateness of the performance targets prior to each PSP award.
The Committee has discretion to set different targets for future awards.
The targets for awards granted under this remuneration policy are set out for shareholder approval in the annual report on remuneration.
Policy discretion The Committee will operate incentive plans in accordance with their respective rules, the Listing Rules and the HMRC rules where relevant.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plan rules.
These include but are not limited to the following: who participates: the timing of the grant of award and or payment: the size of an award up to plan policy limits and or a payment: the result indicated by the relative TSR performance condition may be scaled back potentially to zero in the event that the Committee considers that financial performance has been unsatisfactory and or the outcome has been distorted due to the TSR for the Company or any comparator company being considered abnormal: discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction: determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes and the treatment of leavers: adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends : and the ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports.
Details of any of these payments to former Directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.
Non-Executive Directors In order to ensure that no Director is involved in deciding his her own remuneration, the fees payable to Non-Executive Directors are set, after consultation with the Chairman, by a committee of the Board consisting only of the Executive Directors.
The fees payable to the Chairman are set by the Remuneration Committee.
These fees are reviewed and set annually in December and implemented from 1 January.

Non-Executives Directors are paid a basic fee and the Chairs of the Main Board Committees and the Senior Independent Director SID are paid an additional fee to reflect their additional responsibilities.
Where the SID role is combined with that of chairing a Committee then only one fee is paid.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for pension scheme membership, bonus or incentive arrangements.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed subject to the Companys articles of association, retiring and seeking election at the first AGM after appointment.
Thereafter, every Director will be subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
The Nominations Committee advises the Board as to whether Directors should be nominated for re-election.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to compensation for early termination of their appointments prior to the date on which they would next be due to offer themselves for election or re-election, or if not re-appointed at such time.

Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 53 Directors remuneration report continued Difference in remuneration policy across the Group The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is designed having regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole.
There are differences in salary levels and in the levels of potential reward depending upon seniority and responsibility, although a key reference point for executive salary increases is the average increase across the general workforce.
A higher proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration package is delivered through performance-related pay and in share-based form, which provide a good link to long-term Company performance.
All employees, with one years service or more, may participate in the SAYE schemes and in the Share Incentive Plan SIP that are run annually.
Under the SAYE scheme, at the end of a three-year saving period, employees can buy Greggs shares at a discounted rate.
With the SIP, all employees may purchase Company shares from pre-tax salary subject to HMRC limits.
After six months service all employees are eligible to participate in the profit sharing scheme in which all employees share ten per cent of our profits.
The Committee does not currently consult with employees on Directors pay policy, although the Committee will keep this under review.
Policy on recruitment remuneration The Committee will aim to set a new Executive Directors remuneration package in line with the Companys approved policy at the time of appointment.
The Committee will take into account, in arriving at a total package and in considering the quantum for each element of the package, the skills and experience of the candidate, the market rate for a candidate of that experience as well as the importance of securing the best available candidate.
Annual bonus and PSP awards will not exceed the policy maxima not including any arrangements to replace forfeited deferred pay.
Participation in the annual bonus plan and PSP will normally be pro-rated for the year of joining.
The Committee may make one-off additional cash and or share-based awards as it deems appropriate, and if the circumstances so demand to take account of deferred pay forfeited by an Executive on leaving a previous employer.
Awards to replace deferred pay forfeited would, where possible, reflect the nature of awards forfeited in terms of delivery mechanism cash or shares, time horizons, attributed expected value and performance conditions.
Other payments may be made in relation to relocation expenses and other incidental expenses as appropriate.
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according to its terms and any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment would continue.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy at that time.

Details of the circumstances in which the Committee has the ability to exercise discretion with regards to termination payments are set out below.
The Companys policy is that current Executive Directors service contracts do not have a specific duration but may be terminated with 12 months notice from the Company and six months notice from the Executive Director.
Any future Executive Directors service contracts will be terminable on 12 months notice served by either party.
Under their service contracts the Executive Directors are entitled to salary, pension contributions and benefits for their notice period save where a payment in lieu is to be made.
The Company would seek to ensure that any payment is mitigated by use of phased payments and offset against earnings elsewhere in the event that an Executive Director finds alternative employment during his notice period.
There are no contractual provisions in force other than those set out above that impact any termination payment.
Areas where the Committee can exercise discretion with regards to termination payments: annual bonus may be payable pro-rated for that part of the year worked: any unvested awards held under the deferred annual bonus will normally lapse at cessation unless the individual is leaving for certain reasons defined under the plan as death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement, his office or employment being with either a company which ceases to be a Group member or relating to a business or part of a business which is transferred to a person who is not a Group member, a change of control or any other reason the Committee so decides.
In these circumstances unvested awards will normally vest at the cessation unless the Committee decides they should vest at the normal vesting date : any unvested awards held under the PSP will lapse at cessation, unless the individual is leaving in the circumstances set out above for the deferred annual bonus.
In these circumstances, unvested awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date unless the Committee decides they should vest at cessation subject to performance conditions being met and scaling back in respect of actual service as a proportion of the total vesting period unless the Committee decides that scaling back is inappropriate : and the Committee may agree to payment of disbursements such as legal costs and outplacement services if appropriate and depending on the circumstances of cessation.
The table below sets out the details of the Executive Directors service contracts: Director Date of contract Roger Whiteside 4 February 2013 Raymond Reynolds 18 December 2006 Richard Hutton 7 April 2006 The service contracts are available for inspection during normal business hours at the Companys registered office, and are available for inspection at the AGM.

This feedback is then considered as part of the Companys annual review of remuneration policy.
The Committee engages pro-actively with shareholders, and takes their views seriously.
When any material changes are made to the remuneration policy, the Committee Chair will inform major shareholders of these in advance, and will offer to attend a meeting with those shareholders to discuss any concerns they may have.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years remuneration report during the year are provided in the annual report on remuneration.
External appointments Executive Directors may take up one Non-Executive Directorship outside of the Company subject to the Boards approval and provided that such an appointment is not likely to lead to a conflict of interest.
It is recognised that this can support a Directors development and enhance experience as well as benefit the Company.
Executive Directors will be entitled to retain the fees of such an appointment.
Annual report on remuneration Implementation of our policy in 2016 The section below summarises the implementation of our Remuneration Policy for 2016.
Base salaries The annual base salaries for the Executive Directors are: Salary as at Salary as at 1 January 1 January Director 2015 2016 % Increase Roger Whiteside 507,187 521,135 2.75% Richard Hutton 289,734 297,702 2.75% Raymond Reynolds 258,531 265,641 2.75% Increases are in line with the base increase of the workforce.
In addition in 2016 we awarded 13,500 of our hourly paid retail employees a five per cent pay award 2.25 per cent above the base increase and 2,700 shop managers and assistant shop managers will receive a four per cent pay award 1.25 per cent above the base increase.
Pension contribution The pension contribution rates all of which are cash in lieu are: Roger Whiteside 22.5% Raymond Reynolds 14% Richard Hutton 13% Annual bonus For 2016 the performance conditions will provide a strong link between bonus payments and our business strategy.
Bonus metrics Profit Sales Strategic Objectives 50% of total 20% of total 30% of total This will be based on meeting and Based on Company-managed shop like-for-like Detailed below exceeding budget for the year sales excluding any additional shops opened during the bonus year The strategic objectives for each bonus cycle will be based on measures which will provide a strong link to future value creation.
For the 2016 bonus the three strategic objectives, each relating to ten per cent of the bonus opportunity, will be: i customer transaction percentage growth: ii cost savings: and iii specific project delivery within our change programme regarding processes and systems with four elements measured independently, each element being worth 2.5 per cent.
Sliding scales will be set where possible.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 57 Directors remuneration report continued There will be an underpin to the sales and strategic objectives elements of the bonus whereby any payment under these elements may be scaled back potentially to zero at the discretion of the Committee, in the event that the profit performance for the year is judged to be running significantly below that required for the achievement of the long-term strategy.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include items which the Committee considers to be commercially sensitive.
Retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be made in next years annual report on remuneration.
2016 PSP Award Performance conditions will be based on an equal split of two different financial measures, EPS and ROCE for discrete parts of an award.
Targets have been set for each metric which reflect the strategic plan and business outlook over the performance period.
The EPS and ROCE ranges have been increased to ensure that they remain appropriately stretching in light of our business strategy and higher profitability outlook, without encouraging undue risk taking.
For the 2016 awards the target ranges will be as follows: The EPS performance condition will require average annual growth of RPI two per cent to eight per cent over three years from the 2015 financial year end.
The ROCE condition will require average annual ROCE over the three year performance period 2016, 2017 and 2018 to be in the range 22 per cent to 27 per cent.
In both cases 25 per cent of an award will vest on achieving threshold performance and thereafter straight-line sliding scales will apply until stretch performance is achieved.
In order to improve alignment of interest between Executives and shareholders further, a holding period will be attached to vested PSP awards granted in the policy period, requiring the vested shares to be held net of tax for a further two years.
EPS and ROCE are measured excluding exceptional items.
Non-Executive Directors fees The Chairmans fee for 2016 is 159,263.
The Non-Executive Directors are paid an annual base fee which is currently 42,457 and additional responsibility fees of 6,299 for the role of Senior Independent Director SID or for chairing a Board Committee.
Where the SID role is combined with the role of chairing a Committee then only one fee of 6,299 will be paid.
Details of the fees being paid to Non-Executive Directors in 2016 are set out below: Ian Durant 159,263 Chairman Allison Kirkby 48,756 Chair of the Audit Committee Helena Ganczakowski 42,457 Non-Executive Director Peter McPhillips 42,457 Non-Executive Director Sandra Turner 48,756 SID & Chair of the Remuneration Committee 58 Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Directors Report Accounts Remuneration payable for 2015 for each Executive Director Audited The following table presents the remuneration payable for 2015 showing the equivalent figures for 2014 for the Executive Directors: Pension Annual contribution incentives including salary Taxable including Long-term Total Salary in lieu benefits profit share incentives remuneration Roger Whiteside 2015 507,188 114,118 12,397 594,043 1,357,891 2,585,637 2014 495,300 111,442 12,381 619,125 1,238,248 Richard Hutton 2015 289,736 37,233 13,659 244,334 493,628 1,078,590 2014 282,944 52,508 11,491 254,650 141,043 742,636 Raymond Reynolds 2015 258,530 31,804 13,949 218,019 440,465 962,767 2014 252,472 31,060 12,433 227,225 125,858 649,048 Pursuant to evolving best practice following the introduction in 2013 of the Remuneration Reporting Regulations, the basis on which the long-term incentives vesting values have been determined has been changed for 2015.
The 2015 long-term incentive vesting values are based on the forecast value of the awards due to vest on 27 March 2016 50 per cent of the award is based on EPS performance measured over the three financial years to 2 January 2016 and 50 per cent of the award is based on relative TSR measured over the three years to 27 March 2016.
The EPS performance measured to 2 January 2016 exceeded the maximum performance conditions and 100 per cent of this part of the award is due to vest and forms part of the 2015 long-term incentive value.
Relative TSR performance based on an assessment of performance measured to 2 January 2016 is forecast to exceed the maximum performance requirement and the 2015 long-term incentive value therefore assumes 100 per cent of this part of the award is due to vest.
The share price for the purposes of valuing the award is the three-month average share price to 2 January 2016 11.99.
This value will be trued up in the 2016 report to reflect the actual level of vesting and share price at the vesting date.
The 2014 long-term incentive value has been restated and reflects the actual value of the awards that vested in April 2015.
Appointed 1 May 2014 and appointed SID and Chair of Remuneration Committee.
No detailed disclosure has been provided for Non-Executive Directors other than that relating to their fee, as this is the only form of remuneration they receive.
