Remuneration outcomes for 2015 The base salaries of the Executive Directors had previously remained unchanged since 1 January 2012.
Following the completion of a benchmarking exercise by the Committee, with input from the Companys remuneration consultant, Mercer, it has been decided to increase the basic salary of the CEO and FD by 5.0 per cent and 4.6 per cent respectively.
This will result in the salary of the CEO increasing from Philip Yea 500,000 to 525,000, and the FDs salary increasing from 325,000 Chairman of the Remuneration Committee to 340,000.
Both increases are with effect from 1 January 2016.

The Chairman of the Board receives a fixed fee.
Other Non-Executive Directors receive a basic fee and additional fees are payable for the Chairmanship of the Board Committees and for the additional responsibility of being the Senior Independent Director.
Travel expenses and hotel costs are also paid where necessary.
2016 fee levels for the incumbents are as follows: Non-Executive Chairman: 195,000 Non-Executive Director Base Fee: 50,000 Supplementary Fee for Senior Independent Director: 6,000 Fee for: Audit Committee Chair: 16,000 Remuneration Committee Chair: 10,000 Share Ownership Guidelines Levels are set in relation to annual base salary, and are normally required to be n a To strengthen alignment built over a three-year period.

Options which have vested unconditionally, but are as yet unexercised, will be included on a net basis, for the purposes of calculating shareholdings, as will shares held by an Executives spouse or dependants.
The Committee will regularly review the minimum shareholding guidelines.
There is no maximum, but minimum levels have been set at 200 per cent of Base Salary for the CEO and 100 per cent of Base Salary for other Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors are not required to hold shares in the Company.
Statement of consideration of employment elsewhere in the Group and shareholder views When setting executive remuneration, consideration is given to pay and employment conditions of employees of the Group and policies elsewhere in the Group.
When it considers potential changes to Executive Director remuneration, the Committee is provided with comparative employee information, such as average salary reviews across the Group.
The average annual salary increase of Computacenter Executive Directors in 2015 was 0 per cent compared to a possible range of increases between 0 per cent and 4.5 per cent for other full-time employees.
The salary of the CEO and FD remained unchanged between 1 January 2012 and end of the reporting period.
Whilst only Executive Directors and senior executives participate in the PSP plan, other full time employees in the UK and Germany can participate in the Groups All Employee SAYE scheme.
This plan is not subject to performance conditions, but requires the employee to remain employed at the end of the term of the scheme which they have joined.
This plan has been extremely successful, and over the previous three-year period, the number of employees participating in the scheme has increased by 102 per cent.
Whilst the Company does not feel it appropriate to consult directly with employees when drawing up the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee has considered any informal feedback received via employee staff surveys or other channels and updates provided to it by the Group HR Director, Barry Hoffman.
The Remuneration Committee takes very seriously the view of shareholders when making any changes to executive remuneration arrangements.
The Directors Remuneration Policy of the Company is due to be put before shareholders at its 2017 Annual General Meeting.
As a result, the Company intends to undertake a consultation with shareholders during the second half of 2016 in order to seek feedback on the terms of the existing policy and any changes to it proposed by the Remuneration Committee.
The Chairman of the Board and the Remuneration Committee have made themselves available to meet with the Companys largest shareholders in March and April 2016, prior to the Companys 2016 Annual General Meeting, to discuss both the contents of this report and the Groups 2015 performance.
Feedback from these meetings will be provided back the Committee, so that it may be factored into the Committees decisionmaking in 2016.
74 GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 ANNUAL REMUNERATION REPORT Responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee The key responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are to determine on behalf of the Board: the Companys general policy on executive remuneration: and the specific remuneration packages of the Executive Directors, the Chairman of the Board and Senior Executives of the Group including, but not limited to, base salary, annual performance-related bonuses and long-term share incentive awards.
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors.
All Directors are subject to the overriding principle that no person shall be involved in the process of determining his or her own remuneration.
The full responsibilities of the Committee are contained within its terms of reference, which are available on our website at www.
Membership and attendance The Remuneration Committee is made up of the Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Board, who was considered to be independent on appointment.
Details of the membership of the Committee and attendance of the members at Committee meetings during the year, is provided below.
Member Role Attendance record Current Members 1.
Philip Yea Chairman Senior Independent Director 2 2 2.
Greg Lock Non-Executive Chairman of the Board 5 5 3.

Brian McBride Non-Executive Director 3 3 The CEO attends meetings by invitation, as does the Groups HR Director and Group Head of Financial Reporting where financial information provided requires additional background or explanation to facilitate the considerations of the Committee.
The Group Company Secretary is the secretary to the Committee.
The principal adviser to the Committee is Mercer Limited Mercer, who was first selected by the Committee in 2010 by way of a tender process.
During the year, Mercer provided advice to the Company in respect of the incentive awards made to the Executive Directors in 2015, a benchmarking exercise of fees paid for positions on the Companys Board of Directors and its Committees, and the contents of the Directors Remuneration report as set out on pages 71 to 84.
The total fees paid by the Company to Mercer in 2015 in respect of this advice was 27,500.
The Committee considers the advice that it receives from Mercer to be independent considering, amongst other things, that Mercer provided no other services to the Company during the year other than those outlined above.
Mercer is a founder member of the Remuneration Committee Group, and adheres to its code.
The Committee considers comparative practice in the European technology sector, FTSE techmark 100 companies and FTSE 250 companies.
However, such market data is used by the Committee to inform, rather than drive, policy and decision making.
Audited information The audited tables and related notes are identified within this report, using an A key.
Brian McBride stepped down from his role as Senior Independent Director and Remuneration Committee Chairman with effect from 18 May 2015.
John Ormerod stepped down from his role as a Non-Executive Director of the Board and Audit Committee Chairman with effect from 1 April 2015.
Minnow Powell was appointed as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 January 2015, and as the Audit Committee Chairman with effect from 1 April 2015.
Philip Yea was appointed as the Senior Independent Director and the Remuneration Committee Chairman with effect from 23 June 2015.
Included within this benefits figure is the cost to the Company of providing a driver service for Mike Norris which he uses for business and personal use.
This relates to the 2013 LTIP awards, which will be paid out in March 2016, and had a performance period of 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015.
The relevant performance criteria was partially achieved and therefore 71.5 per cent of this award vested in each of the Executive Directors.
This calculation is based upon the value of a Computacenter plc share at the time of vesting, being 8.52 on 31 December 2015.
A full explanation of the applicable performance measures for the 2015 bonus award can be found on page 77.
Remuneration paid in 2015: Executive Directors 2015 base salary The annual salaries of the Executive Directors were unchanged in 2015.
Executive Directors Annual Bonus The maximum bonus opportunity in 2015 was 190 per cent of base salary for the CEO and 192.3 per cent of base salary for the FD.
The 2015 Standard Annual Bonus and 2015 Additional Annual Bonus, as referred to below, are each subject to clawback provisions for a period of two years from the date of vesting, in the event that the Group misstates its financial results for the reporting period or in the event of misconduct by the Executive Director.
2015 Standard Annual Bonus This portion of the 2015 annual bonus opportunity is driven by the financial performance of the business and individual targets for each Director.
For the year ended 31 December 2015, 80 per cent of this award was conditional on the achievement of criteria linked to the financial performance of the Group.
These targets are set by the Committee with reference to the Groups strategic and financial plans, as approved by the Board of Directors.
Further detail on these can be found within the table on page 77 of this report.
This approach is consistent with the Committees view that variable pay for the Executive Directors should be primarily linked to the transparent and measurable delivery of value to the Companys shareholders.
The non-financial Personal Objectives set for the Executive Directors are based principally on delivery against the Groups strategic objectives and certain governance-related objectives, including people development and succession planning.
As is reported in more detail in the Operating Performance Review from pages 30 to 38, the Group performed well in 2015, and this is reflected in the level of Standard Annual Bonus awards vesting in the Executive Directors.
76 GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 The Standard Annual bonus criteria applied for each of the Executive Directors during 2015, were as follows: Mike Norris CEO Tony Conophy FD 2015 2015 Pro t Group pro t before tax Pro t Group pro t before tax up to 50% up to 50% Services contribution growth Services contribution growth up to 15% up to 10% Average cash balance Cost savings up to 15% up to 10% Personal objectives Average cash balance up to 20% up to 10% Personal objectives up to 20% A The table below sets out details of performance against the FY 2015 Standard Annual Bonus Targets: As apercentage of Performance required Maximum Bonus Actual % Opportunity Threshold On-target Maximum achieved Payout Measure CEO FD CEO FD CEO FD CEO FD CEO FD CEO FD Financial criteria Group Profit Before Tax m 50% 50% 15% 15% 32.5% 32.5% 50% 50% 33.55% 33.55% 218,075 109,037.5 Services Contribution Growth m 15% 10% 7.5% 5% 15% 10% 15% 10% 14.86% 9.91% 96,590 32,207.5 Cash Balance m 15% 10% 7.5% 5% 15% 10% 15% 10% 15% 10% 97,500 32,500 Cost Savings m 10% 10% 10% 10% 10% 32,500 Non-Financial criteria Personal Objectives 20% 20% 1% 1% 15% 15% 20% 20% 14% 14% 91,000 45,500 Total 100% 100% 31% 36% 77.5% 77.5% 100% 100% 77.41% 77.46% 503,165 251,745 The specific financial targets for the Standard Annual Bonus in 2015 are still considered by the Committee to be commercially sensitive, although the Committee keeps this position under review and will disclose such targets as soon as they are deemed to no longer be so.
As a result of this approach, the actual bonus targets for the 2014 full year are disclosed on page 79 of this report, and the Committee currently anticipates that the actual bonus targets for 2015 will be disclosed in the Groups 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
2015 Additional Annual Bonus As set out in the Companys 2014 Directors Remuneration report, the Remuneration Committee decided to increase the 2015 bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors on a one-off basis, following the divestment of RDC by the Group and the significant value that this generated for shareholders.
This one-off bonus opportunity equated to a maximum of 300,000 each for the CEO and FD, which represented 60 per cent of base salary for the CEO and 92.3 per cent of Base Salary for the FD.
As part of the divestment of RDC, the Group entered into an Operating Agreement with RDC under its new ownership, pursuant to which the Group had to meet targets relating to the ongoing business relationship between the parties, or make compensatory payments to the commercial counterparty to the extent that these were not achieved.
The Group was required to achieve a minimum commercial services spend amount of 6.75 million with RDC during the first 12 months of the agreement.
It has achieved this target and therefore this part of the performance criteria was fulfilled.
Vesting of the 2015 Additional Annual Bonus was also subject to the satisfactory financial performance of the Group during the 2015 financial year.
Following significant discussion, the Committee agreed that the performance of the Group in 2015 was in line with the Boards expectations, which had themselves been increased at the time of the Groups 2015 Interim Results.
Therefore, the performance of the Group was deemed by the Committee to be satisfactory and the 2015 Additional Annual Bonus was paid out in full to each of the CEO and FD.
LTIPs PSPs During the year, there was a pay-out of 71.5 per cent of those awards granted to the Executive Directors, pursuant to the 2013 PSP Scheme as the relevant performance criteria threshold was partially achieved.
77 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Vesting of these awards to each Executive Director was dependent upon the achievement of the following performance measures over a threeyear period, as follows: The compound annual growth rate of the Groups adjusted fully diluted earnings per share EPS Performance level Company EPS Maximum 100 per cent vesting 20% In line with expectations 50 per cent vesting 10% Threshold 25 per cent vesting 7.5% Vesting occurs on a straight-line basis on between these thresholds.
Actual Company EPS achievement during the period 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 was 14.3 per cent.
Accordingly, 71.5 per cent of the PSP awards granted to the Executive Directors will be paid out in March 2016.
Remuneration awards granted in 2015: Executive Directors A Share scheme interests awarded during the year The table below details awards of conditional shares made during 2015 under the PSP scheme.

Note 2: This is based on the mid-market price share price of Computacenter plc on 25 March 2015, being 7.20.
Vesting of these awards to each Executive Director will be dependent upon the achievement of the following performance measures over a threeyear period, as follows: The compound annual growth rate of the Groups adjusted fully diluted earnings per share EPS Performance level Company EPS Maximum 12.5% In line with expectations 8.33% Threshold 5% The compound annual growth rate of the Groups Services Revenue GSR Performance level GSR Maximum 7.5% In line with expectations 5.5% Threshold 3.5% Vesting occurs on a straight-line basis on between these thresholds.

In respect of the Non-Financial Criteria for the FD, these included Personal Objectives related to the following: Supporting the continued roll out of Group-wide operating model: Supporting the Groups strategic initiatives through the provision of appropriate investment advice: Improving the working capital management of the Groups German and French business.

Minimum shareholding requirements In accordance with the Groups minimum shareholding guidelines, the CEO is required to build up a shareholding that is equal to 200 per cent of his her gross salary.
In respect of the Finance Director, the threshold that is expected to be achieved is 100 per cent of his her gross salary.
It is additionally expected that the Executive Director will achieve these levels within three years of appointment.
For the purposes of these requirements, options which have vested unconditionally, but are as yet unexercised, will be included on a net basis, for the purposes of calculating shareholdings, as will shares held by an Executives spouse or dependants.
There is no requirement for the Non-Executive Directors of the Company to hold shares.

There are no conditions relating to the performance of the Company or individual for the vesting of this scheme.
There are performance conditions for this scheme as set out below the table on page 80.
Based on the Companys closing share price as at 31 December 2015, being 8.52.
Executive Directors are deemed to be interested in the unvested shares held by the Computacenter Employee Benefit Trust 1,999,249 ordinary shares held as at 31 December 2015.
Dilution limits Computacenter uses a mixture of both new issue and market purchase shares to satisfy the vesting of awards made under its Option, PSP and Sharesave plans.
In line with best practice, the use of new or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under all share schemes, is restricted to 10 per cent in any 10-year rolling period, with a further restriction for discretionary schemes of 5 per cent in the same period.
The Companys current position against its dilution limit is therefore under each of these thresholds.
The Company regularly reviews its position against the dilution guidelines and, should there be insufficient headroom within which to grant new awards which could be satisfied by issuing new shares, it is the intention of the Company to continue its current practice of satisfying new awards with shares purchased on the market.
Payments to past Directors and Payments for loss of office There have been no payments made to past Directors and no payments made for loss of office during the period.

During 2015, Mike Norris served as a Non-Executive Director of Triage Holdings Limited and received a fee of 16,000.
Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment The Non-Executive Directors have not entered into service contracts with the Company.
They each operate under a letter of appointment which sets out their terms, duties and responsibilities.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial term, which runs to the conclusion of the third Annual General Meeting following their appointment, which may be renewed at that point for a further three-year term.
The letters of appointment provide that should a Non-Executive Director not be re-elected at an AGM before he is due to retire, then his or her appointment will terminate.
The Board has agreed that all Directors will be subject to re-election at the AGM on 19 May 2016, with the exception of Philip Yea, who will be subject to election for the first time at that meeting.
81 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection by shareholders at the Companys registered office.

The annual rates of Non-Executive Directors fees are shown in the table below.
There has been a rise in the base fee for Non-Executive Directors in 2016, as a result of the findings of a benchmarking exercise by the Companys Remuneration Consultants which was carried out by the Company at the end of 2015.
These are generally reviewed every two years and, therefore, the next scheduled review will be in December 2017: 2015 Annual 2016 Annual Position Fees Fees Non-Executive Director 45,000 50,000 Additional fee for the Chairmanship of the Audit Committee 14,000 16,000 Additional fee for the Chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee 8,000 10,000 Additional fee for the position of Senior Independent Director 6,000 6,000 Performance of the Company Total shareholder return performance Computacenter versus FTSE Software and Computer Services sector 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 Dec 2010 Dec 2011 Dec 2012 Dec 2013 Dec 2014 Dec 2015 Computacenter FTSE All Share So ware and Computer Services In this graph, TSR performance shows the value, in December 2015, of 100 invested in the Companys shares in December 2010, assuming that all dividends received between December 2010 and December 2015 were reinvested in the Companys shares.
CEO pay history The table below shows the total remuneration figure for the CEO over the previous seven financial years.
The total remuneration figure includes the annual bonus and LTIP awards which vested based on performance in those years.
The annual bonus and LTIP percentages show the pay-out for each year as a percentage of the maximum.
Annual bonus Salary Benefits potential Group CEO 0% -0.8% 46.2% Computacenter UK-based employees 1.93% 4.05% 1.87% The comparator Group of Computacenter UK based employees was chosen as the Committee believes it provides a sufficiently large comparator Group based on similar incentive structure to the CEO and reduces any distortion arising from currency and cost of living differences in other geographies in which the Group operates.
This includes the 2015 Additional Annual Bonus, as explained on page 77.
Relative importance of spend on pay The charts below show the relative expenditure of the Group on the pay of its employees, against certain other key financial indicators of the Group: Expenditure on Group Shareholder Distributions Group Adjusted Profit Employees Pay Ordinary Dividend and Return of Capital Before Tax 0.1% 389.5% 7.2% 2015 543.1m 2015 121.4m 2015 86.9m 2014 542.6m 2014 24.8m 2014 81.1m 1 As well as information prescribed by current remuneration reporting regulations, Group adjusted profit before tax has also been included as this is deemed to be a key performance indicator of the Group which is linked to the delivery of value to our shareholders.
The 2014 and 2015 1 Group adjusted profit before tax measure both exclude the impact of the Groups former subsidiary RDC, which was divested by the Group on 2 February 2015.
Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in the following financial year Executive Director Remuneration for 2016 will be in accordance with the terms of our Directors Remuneration Policy table, as set out on pages 72 to 74 of this report.
2016 base salaries The base salary of the CEO is increasing by 5 per cent to 525,000, whilst the salary of the FD will go up by 4.6 per cent to 340,000.
2016 annual bonus scheme The performance measures and weightings for the 2016 Annual Bonus Scheme will be as follows: Mike Norris CEO Tony Conophy FD 2016 2016 Pro t Group pro t before tax Pro t Group pro t before tax up to 50% up to 50% Services contribution growth Services contribution growth up to 10% up to 10% Cost savings Cost savings up to 10% up to 10% Average cash balance Average cash balance up to 10% up to 10% Personal objectives Personal objectives up to 20% up to 20% The proposed levels for 2016 have been set to be challenging relative to our 2016 business plan.
The targets themselves, as they relate to the 2016 financial year, are deemed by the Committee to be commercially sensitive and therefore have not been disclosed.
They will be disclosed at such time as the Committee no longer deems them to be so, and it currently anticipates including these in the Companys 2017 Annual Report and Accounts.
The maximum bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors in 2016 will be 124 per cent of base salary of the CEO, and up to 100 per cent of base salary for the FD.
83 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 2016 PSP Scheme The award levels of Performance Shares for the Executive Directors in the 2016 financial year are 200 per cent of salary for the CEO and 175 per cent of salary for the Finance Director.
The 2016 financial year LTIP awards will be subject to the following performance conditions: a In respect of 70 per cent of the total PSP award made to the Executive Directors in 2016: Threshold Below Threshold Vesting On-target Maximum 0% vesting 10% vesting 50% vesting 100% vesting Compound Annual Growth of Company Earnings per Share than 5% 5% 8.33% 12.5% In respect of the growth of Earnings per Share, awards will vest on a straight line between these points.
These targets will require management to deliver a strong, sustainable performance over the period.
b In respect of 30 per cent of the total PSP award made to the Executive Directors in 2016, these will be subject to targets based on growth of the Groups Services revenue over the three year performance period.
These targets are currently deemed to be commercially sensitive, but in accordance with the Companys approach in this area, these will be disclosed once they are no longer deemed to be so.
The Committee currently anticipates that Services revenue targets for the 2016 PSP scheme will be disclosed in its 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
This achievement 2 will be measured on a constant currency basis.
