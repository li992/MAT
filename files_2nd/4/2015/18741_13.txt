Directors Remuneration Committee report Dear Shareholder On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Committee report for 2015.
This report outlines the Directors Remuneration Policy the Policy applied by the Board for the executives and non-executive Directors of the Company.
The report is divided into two sections.
A policy report which sets out the approach to remuneration and a remuneration report which details what has been paid to the directors during 2014 15.
When considering remuneration for our senior executives, the Directors Remuneration Committee the Committee has used the policy framework approved by shareholders at the AGM in September 2014.
We continue to listen and take into consideration shareholders and institutional views regarding our Policy.
This year we are proposing to implement minor amendments to the Policy, which in our opinion further aligns executive remuneration with the interests of shareholders.
These include an adjustment to the annual bonus with the addition of a malus and clawback clause, consistent with the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP with a tightening of the target parameters of the annual bonus, the inclusion of executive directors in a newly introduced Share Incentive Plan SIP, and the ability for executive directors to receive cash in lieu of pension payments more detail of these minor amendments are on pages 78 to 80.
Any major changes to the Policy would only be made after consultation and approval from shareholders.
The Policy is designed and produced to comply with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code and amendments to the Companies Act 2006 regarding remuneration.
The Committee will continue to monitor the market competitiveness of the remuneration policy, in order to ensure we are able to retain and attract the best talent.
During the year the Committee reviewed the overall remuneration package of the executive directors to ensure that each director is retained and motivated to promote and achieve the strategic objectives of the Group.
We have no changes to the LTIP scheme that was introduced in 2013.
Both the annual bonus and the LTIP schemes will be reviewed over the next 12 months against emerging best practice and to determine their ongoing suitability.
Executive director salaries In order to retain the calibre of management necessary to deliver the Groups long-term strategy, our policy is to ensure that base pay for executive directors is competitive with the market, and recognizes personal performance.
The Committee reviewed the salaries of both executive directors during the last year.
The CEOs salary was increased in line with the average employee increase in the UK of 4.03%.
Following a review of the CFOs performance and remuneration relative to the market, it was felt appropriate by the Board to increase his salary by 11.32% more detail is provided on page 86 of this report.
This increase was a result of the Committee bringing the CFOs salary in line with the Remuneration Policy with the aim of paying market median base salaries.
In future it is anticipated that the CFOs salary increase will be in line with the average increase across the Group subject to market conditions.
Annual bonus outcome The annual bonus plan measures both in-year business performance targets and progress against personal and strategic objectives.
An important principle of the annual bonus plan is that no bonus can be paid unless the Group has achieved a base level of business performance.
The Group performance in 2014 15 was sufficient to trigger a bonus payout, the first in three years.
The business achieved 92% of the Group budget for adjusted operating profit and 98% of budget for Group revenue.
In addition this meant that the personal objective element of the bonus was also paid.
The CEO will receive an annual bonus amounting to 76% of actual basic salary with the CFO receiving 61% of actual basic salary further details of the annual bonus are on page 92.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP outcome The LTIP takes into consideration the performance of both the Group and its share price, and is designed to act as an incentive to motivate executives to achieve the long-term growth plans of the Group.
Under the LTIP the performance period is three years Directors report 75 | and executives are required to retain a percentage of shares after vesting in order to build up a shareholding value worth more than their annual salaries.
The LTIP will be tested on the third anniversary of grant which will be September 2016 and October 2017, and so no payments will be made to the executives under the LTIP in this financial year.
Share dilution In 2006 shareholders granted approval for the Group to use 1.5% of its issued share capital for employee share schemes per annum i. e. 15% in any 10 year period.
Under this authority the Group has granted 40 million shares to employees and continues to grant discretionary share awards to all employees twice per year.
Of the 40 million shares only 2 million of them have been granted to executives and the remainder to employees.
During the past nine years the Group has grown considerably with the number of employees increasing from 300 to 1,700, with over 250 employees based in the US.
In all markets we face increased competition for high calibre talent and this is particularly acute in the US.
Our remuneration package at Imagination is atypical, in that we do not currently pay cash bonuses to all employees but believe that share awards to all employees aligns their interest with that of shareholders and the Groups continued success.
At Imagination we have built a culture that encourages a broad-based employee ownership in the Group, and we believe that this builds strong loyalty and alignment with both the Groups fortunes and the interests of shareholders.
We wish to build on this culture and as such increase the number of shares available for award to employees and we are proposing an increase in the number of shares we can allocate to employees for future awards under the Groups share plans.
It should be noted that share awards to executive directors under the LTIP are mainly purchased in the market so it is not anticipated that they would benefit from this proposed increase.
We have consulted with our major shareholders on this issue and we understand they are supportive of our proposal.
Accordingly a resolution to amend current share plan rules to this effect is included in the AGM notice.
Activities of the Remuneration Committee during 2014 15 During the last financial year, amongst other things, the Committee: considered and agreed the potential outcome for the cash bonus for 2013 14 financial year: set 2014 15 annual bonus targets and performance targets for the LTIP 2015-2017: considered a benchmarking report in support of the executive salary review: reviewed executive directors base salary levels and approved increases as detailed in the report: advised on salary adjustments and share awards to senior management reporting to the Executive Directors: considered the projected out-turns for the 2014 15 annual bonus: agreed the remuneration terms for the appointment of Bert Nordberg who was appointed as non-executive chairman: considered and agreed the remuneration terms for Kate Rock who was appointed a non-executive director: reviewed appropriateness of all current employee share schemes, in particular share dilution limits under all plans and the introduction of a Share Incentive Plan SIP : reviewed executive directors participation in the all employee SIP instead of discontinued Save As You Earn SAYE scheme, and to propose to amend the Remuneration Policy accordingly at the AGM to allow the executive directors to participate: 76 Directors report | considered the statutory reporting regulations in respect of executive remuneration policy and in drafting the remuneration report: recommended the approval of the 2014 15 remuneration report to the Board: and reviewed its own terms of reference.
We believe our current remuneration practices are set out in line with the reporting regulations and we welcome the structure and transparency this brings.
Overall we believe that our remuneration policy is aligned with delivering the Groups strategy and longterm value to shareholders.
As part of the 2014 board review, the effectiveness of the Committee was considered by the external reviewers, Independent Audit.
I was pleased to note its view that they commended the Committee on its process and structure to proceedings and in trying to ensure that management are clear both on the responsibilities of the Committee and those of management in supporting the Committee.
We are considering other suggestions that were put forward and we will follow through on these in 2015 16.
I look forward to the on-going support of the Imagination shareholders on both the advisory vote for the executive remuneration arrangements as they were operated this past year, as well as the resolutions on the remuneration report, the remuneration Policy and the minor amendments to the Policy to enable executive directors to participate in the SIP which is the subject of approval at the AGM in September 2015.
Yours sincerely Andrew Heath Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 29 June 2015 Directors report 77 | Remuneration Policy The Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in September 2014 and applies for three years from that date.
We will be making minor amendments to align executive remuneration with the interests of shareholders further details are given in the table below and asking shareholders for approval to the revised Remuneration Policy at the AGM in September 2015.
The policy applies to the executive directors at the date of this report and is intended to apply to any new executive directors who may be appointed during this three year period.

Each year the Committee considers the most appropriate metrics to apply for the following financial year.
These metrics are currently Group revenue budget and adjusted operating profit.
A performance multiplier is then applied related to the achievement of the financial elements.
The annual bonus also includes a 25% element based on personal performance.
Each executive director is set a number of personal objectives in relation to clear strategic, operational, or relationship imperatives aligned to the Groups overall strategy.
The Committee is of the opinion that the financial targets and personal objectives for the Annual Bonus Plan are commercially sensitive and as such it would be detrimental to the Group to disclose them in advance of or during the relevant performance period.
Business targets are set as predefined ranges around budget and individual targets are set taking account of strategic priorities under the control of the executive.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Performance measures for the LTIP were selected after careful consideration and following consultation with larger shareholders and advisory bodies.
The Committee believes that the use of both TSR and EPS measures provides the best measure of the success of the execution of the Groups strategy and encourages, reinforces and rewards the delivery of sustainable shareholder value.
The TSR element which accounts for 50% of awards considers the Groups performance against two relevant comparator groups sector and size-based to reward sustainable shareholder value creation relative to alternative investment opportunities for our shareholders.
Targets are in line with typical market practice, requiring ranking at median to deliver threshold vesting increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for ranking within the upper quartile.
The normalized EPS growth performance condition which accounts for 50% of awards, has been set following independent analysis by the Groups advisors and brokers.
Based on this analysis, the compound annual growth in EPS targets were set for 2014 15 as follows: 0% pay out below 10% growth: 25% pay out at 10% growth: 100% pay out at 20% growth or greater: and Linear progression between 25% and 100% thresholds.
The Committee intends to review the performance targets and best practice guidelines annually.
Changes will be made only if the targets become inappropriate due to changing market conditions.
Directors report 81 | Illustration of the remuneration policy for 2015 16 The graph below illustrates the level of remuneration that could be achieved by the CEO and CFO through the operation of our remuneration policy for 2015 2016 and the actual total remuneration paid in 2013 14 and 2014 15.
The graphs show the proportion of total remuneration made up of fixed pay salary, pension and other benefits, annual bonus and the LTIP and the pay outcomes for three performance scenarios.
The following assumptions have been used: Minimum: this represents fixed remuneration consisting of current annualized salary, pension and an estimate of other benefits based on the 2014 15 disclosed value.
Target: this represents fixed remuneration as detailed above, plus 50% of the maximum bonus opportunity and vesting of 50% of the maximum LTIP award.
Maximum: this represents fixed remuneration together with the maximum annual bonus opportunity and vesting of 100% of LTIP award.
In accordance with the regulations, share price appreciation and dividend accrual are not taken into account.
SAYE awards are also excluded.
As seen by the charts above, at target levels of performance, around 62% of the CEOs total pay, and around 57% of the CFOs total pay, arises from performance-related elements, rising to over 70% at stretch levels, at which point total pay is capped.
The Committee is satisfied that there is a strong incentive for the prudent management of risk, and that there are no perverse incentives created by the remuneration policy.
82 Directors report | Development of the Group remuneration policy Consideration of executive remuneration with the wider Group When making remuneration decisions for the executive directors the Committee considers the wider economic environment and conditions within the Group.
In particular, the Committee considers pay and employment conditions across the wider workforce and carefully considers the broader employee salary increase budget when making reward decisions for executive directors.
The Committee considers wider industry benchmarking material in the context of monitoring its overall position on director and employee pay.
Consideration of shareholders views The Committee welcomes an open and transparent dialogue with shareholders and seeks the views of significant shareholders when any major changes are being made to remuneration arrangements.
The Committee will continue to engage with shareholders going forward and will aim to consult on any material changes to the application of the approved remuneration policy or proposed changes to the policy itself.
Recruitment remuneration arrangements When determining the appropriate remuneration package for a new appointment, the Committee will take a number of factors into account.
These typically include the candidates experience and calibre, their personal circumstances, external market influences and arrangements for existing executive directors.
The on-going remuneration package offered to new directors will only include those elements listed within the policy table, which may include specific relocation benefits.
On-going variable pay awards will be subject to the limits as set out in the policy table.
Full details of the recruitment package for any new executive directors will be set out in the next Annual Report on Remuneration.
In addition to the on-going elements of the remuneration package, the Committee reserves the right to buy-out awards being forfeited elsewhere through accepting a role at Imagination.
The Committee will give consideration to any relevant factors when determining the value of such awards, including the form of the award eg.
cash or shares, the proportion of the performance vesting period outstanding and the potential value of the forfeited remuneration, including performance conditions attached to the awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, and the timing of any potential payments.
It is the intention that such buy-out awards will be made through use of the exceptional LTIP limit.
However, the Committee may rely on the relevant Listing Rule exemption if necessary for the purpose of making a buy-out award in the event that the Group hire an executive director and need to match or pay-off shares they held with their previous company.
Where an executive director is appointed from within the organization, the Committee has the power to honour legacy arrangements in line with the original terms and conditions.
In the event of the appointment of a new non-executive director, remuneration arrangements will be in line with those detailed on page 91.
Service contracts Our policy is for notice periods for executive directors to be six months duration and each of the executive directors service contracts reflect this.
These agreements also contain restrictive covenants for periods of three to six months following termination of employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Groups customers, no-dealing with customers, and nonsolicitation of the Groups suppliers and employees.
In addition, each service contract has an express obligation of confidentiality in respect of the Groups trade secrets and confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by the directors in the course of their employment.
Directors report 83 | The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as an executive director during the financial year are as follows: Contract Date Notice period Sir Hossein Yassaie 31 March 1998 6 months notice by director or Company Richard Smith 3 May 2011 6 months notice by director or Company The non-executive directors do not have service contracts and are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive arrangements.
Their service does not qualify for pension purposes or other benefits, and no element of their fees is performance related.
No payments are due on loss of office.
Service contracts for the executive directors and Chairman, and appointment letters for the non-executive directors are available to view at the office of the Company Secretary at the registered office address.
It is the Groups policy to allow executive directors to hold non-executive positions at other companies and to receive remuneration for their services.
The Board believes that experience of the operations of other companies and their Boards and Committees is valuable to the development of the executive directors.
Termination of employment The Committee maintains a discretionary approach to the treatment of leavers, on the basis that the facts and circumstances of each case are unique.
When considering a departure event, there are a number of factors which the Committee takes into account in determining appropriate treatment for outstanding incentive awards.
These include: the position under the relevant plan documentation: the individual circumstances of the departure: any mitigating factors that might be relevant: the appropriate statutory and contractual position: the performance of the Company individual during the year to date: the nature of the handover process: and the requirements of the business for speed of change.
In some cases, the treatment is formally prescribed under the rules of the relevant plan.
Where there are good-leaver circumstances, awards which would otherwise lapse by default, will vest either on the normal vesting date or on cessation of employment.
These circumstances include death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy or sale of the Company or business.
If the executive dies or leaves due to ill health or injury, awards which have less than 12 months of the performance period remaining or LTIP awards which have less than 12 months of the deferred period to run, vest automatically on leaving.
In other leaver circumstances the Committee has discretion to determine when, and to what extent, awards vest.
The Committee considers the leaver circumstances along a continuum, ranging from bad leaver scenarios such as termination of employment for gross misconduct or resignation, through to the good leaver scenarios outlined above.
Accordingly the Committee may apply or dis-apply such performance conditions or time pro-rating awards vesting in these circumstances, as it considers appropriate.
Annual bonus In a departure event, the Committee will typically consider whether any element of annual bonus should be paid for the financial year.
Any bonus, if paid, will be limited to the period served during the financial year in which the departure occurs.
84 Directors report | Long-Term Incentive Plans The default position is that an unvested ESP or LTIP award lapses on cessation of employment, unless the Committee applies discretion to preserve some or all of the awards.
This provides the Committee with the maximum flexibility to review the facts and circumstances of each case, allowing differentiation between good and bad leavers and avoiding payment for failure.
Compensation for loss of office and past director payments No payments were made during 2014 15 to former executive directors by way of compensation for loss of office, or pay in lieu of notice.
There are no payments to be disclosed in respect of past directors.
Relative importance of pay spend The following table summarizes the major cash distributions during the year as set out in the notes to the financial statements on page 119, compared to the total pay spend for the Group.
Dividends and share buybacks The Company has not paid any dividends or performed any share buybacks in either financial year.
Directors report 85 | Remuneration Committee report Composition Andrew Heath chairs the Remuneration Committee, made up of independent non-executive directors, which met four times during the year.
Both Bert Nordberg and Kate Rock joined the Committee in March and January 2015 respectively.
The membership and meeting attendance is set out below.
In addition to the Committee members the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer may be invited to attend meetings, except in instances where their own remuneration is discussed, or other circumstances where their attendance would not be appropriate.
Committee members Meetings Eligible to attend Attended Andrew Heath Chair 4 4 David Anderson 4 4 Gilles Delfassy 4 4 Bert Nordberg 1 1 Kate Rock 1 1 Given their diverse business experience, the independent non-executive directors who made up the Committee in 2014 15 offer a fair and balanced view in relation to remuneration matters for the Group.
Responsibility The Committee determines the remuneration policy and rewards for the executive directors and, in his absence the Chairman.
The Committee also reviews the remuneration packages of those at the next most senior level of management and has regard to levels of pay across the Group.
Salaries and fees Our policy is to set salaries in line with market median, when comparing similarly sized companies, and individual performance.
The Committee is of the view that the salary of the CEO is consistent with this policy.
The CEO consequently received a salary increase of 4.03% in April 2015, which mirrored the average employee increase in the UK.
However, for the CFO, his basic salary is in the lower quartile compared to the market and the Committee decided that it is necessary to increase the CFOs salary in line with market median.
The Committee and the Board are pleased with Richards performance during a time where the Group has expanded considerably and that he is the right person to ensure the Group are able to execute its strategy.
After taking these factors into account the Committee has increased Richards salary by 11.32% with effect from 1 April 2015.
External Committee advisers The Committee has access to independent professional advice on remuneration matters, Towers Watson were appointed by the Committee in 2012, and Committee members continue to be satisfied that their advice is objective and independent and their fees are in line with market practice.
Access to their global database and expertise is an important factor in considering remuneration matters across the EMB and senior management team.
Work undertaken by Towers Watson in 2014 15 included advice on the salary benchmarking for executive directors, fees benchmarking for non-executive directors, fee benchmarking for the new non-executive chairman and assistance in amendments to the Remuneration Policy for which total fees of 54,000 were paid.
The Committee also received advice from J. P. Morgan Cazenove who provided independent verification of the Total Shareholder Return TSR calculations for the LTIP.
86 Directors report | Voting at the 2014 Annual General Meeting The key activities of the Committee during the year are set out in the letter to shareholders on pages 75 to 77 of this report.
As previously noted, shareholder support at the 2014 AGM was high, with 99.01% of shareholders voting in favour of the Remuneration Report.
The following table summarizes the details of votes cast in respect of Directors remuneration: the binding vote on the Directors Remuneration Policy and the advisory vote on the Directors Remuneration Committee report at the 2014 Annual General Meeting: Resolution Votes for Votes against Proportion of share Votes which were and % of votes cast and % of votes cast capital voting withheld Remuneration policy 170,076,223 98.57% 2,466,605 1.44% 64.20% 324,190 Remuneration report 170,839,650 99.01% 1,706,227 0.99% 64.20% 321,141 Performance graphs The performance graphs show the Groups one year and five year TSR together with the TSRs for the FTSE All-World technology Index from 1 May 2010 is shown below.
TSR for the Companys shares was 2.66% over the financial year compared with 31.01% for the FTSE All-World technology Index for the same period.
The Committee considers the FTSE All-World Technology Index to be an appropriate choice as the index contains companies from the US, Asia and Europe and therefore reflects the global environment in which the Group operates.
In addition, the Index includes many companies that are currently the Groups customers, as well as companies that use Imagination technology in their products.

The Group has issued share awards in the past nine years totaling 13.8% and with lapsed shares returning, the dilution is currently 10.28% of issued share capital.
As outlined in the Chairmans letter on pages 75 to 77 the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the appropriateness of this dilution level in 2015 and subject to shareholder approval at the 2015 AGM we will propose to increase the overall limit on dilution to 10% over 5 years for future all employee share awards.
To satisfy executive share awards we will largely buy shares in the market.
Employee Share Plan ESP The ESP is the primary Long-Term Incentive Plan that is offered to all employees.
For executives, the incentive plan is subject to performance conditions.
The award vested in three equal tranches of 750,000 shares commencing on 22 December 2012.
The first tranche of 750,000 shares vested on 22 December 2012 and these shares were not exercised.
Of the second tranche 278,000 shares vested on 22 December 2013, in accordance with the performance conditions, these shares have not been exercised.
The balance from the second tranche of 472,000 shares was retested on the third anniversary and as a result of the performance conditions not being achieved did not vest and were lapsed.
The third tranche of 750,000 shares did not vest due to the performance conditions not being achieved.
The performance conditions were related to the annual cumulative growth in the Groups share price over the third, fourth and fifth year from the date of grant.
If the annual cumulative growth of the Groups share price is less than 7.5%, no part of the award will vest, if the annual cumulative growth of the Groups share price is more than 7.5% and less than 15% the performance target will be satisfied pro-rata on a straight line basis and if the annual cumulative growth of the Groups share price is 15% or more, 100% will vest.
2 The award of 50,000 shares to CFO did not vest due to the performance conditions not being achieved as noted below for the TEESP.
The price of a share in the Group for these purposes will be the average midmarket closing price as derived from the Official List of the London Stock Exchange for each business day in the period of three months preceding the grant date and the third anniversary of the grant date.
The value of the index will be the average value of the Index for each business day in the three months preceding the grant date and the third anniversary of the grant date as appropriate.
The highest and lowest share prices in the year are set out on page 87.
Directors report 89 | Tax Efficient Employee Share Scheme TEESP Share awards with joint ownership between the executives and a beneficial interest held with the Company Employee Benefit Trust were granted on 22 January 2013.
The number of share awards and beneficial interest is determined by the share price on exercise.

2 Bert Nordberg joined the board as Chairman in March 2015.
3 David Hurst-Brown retired at the AGM in September 2014.
4 Kate Rock joined the board as a Non-Executive director in August 2014.
The Chairman and non-executive directors did not receive any other payments.
Bert Nordberg was appointed as Chairman from March 2015.
Bert will receive an annual salary of 130,000 per annum.
The non-executive directors fees were increased from 1 April 2015.
It was reviewed and recommended that as the nonexecutive directors had not received a fee increase since 2011, their fee would increase from 38,000 to 42,000.
The Chairmen of the committees will receive an additional annual fee of 5,000 for their services.
The following table compares salary increases given each year to the executives to those given to Imaginations employees.
The changes are effective from 1 April each year: Executive director 2013 14 Increase 2014 15 Increase With effect from 1 April 2015 000 000 000 Hossein Yassaie 427 4.32% 445 4.03% 463 Richard Smith 220 10.00% 243 11.32% 270 Average employee 4.32% 4.03% Directors report 91 | Pensions The Group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a group personal pension plan with defined contributions.
For executive directors, the Group matches the executive contribution maximum 4.5% and contributes an extra 1.2% and after two years of membership the 1.2% is increased by another 1.8% to a maximum of 7.5%.
If an executive reaches their annual or life time pension allowance, the Group will consider whether to pay an allowance in lieu of pension contributions as a taxable benefit.
Benefits For executive directors the Group provides the following benefits: Car Allowance Private Medical Sir Hossein Yassaie 15,000 1,054 Richard Smith 11,000 879 Annual Bonus Plan Performance measures for the Annual Bonus Plan are set annually.
These metrics are currently a Group revenue budget and adjusted operating profit.
The Committee is of the opinion that the numerical values of targets for the Annual Bonus Plan are commercially sensitive because they include budgeted numbers within the range of outcomes and it would be detrimental to the Group to disclose them in advance of or during the relevant performance period.
The Committee retains discretion to adjust bonus targets for any financial year to reflect intervening events including acquisitions or disposals.
No such adjustments were made during the financial year.
2014 15 annual bonus As a result of exceeding the annual operating profit target of over 85% in 2014 2015 and in accordance with the parameters the executives are entitled to receive an annual bonus.
The targets that applied to the 2015 annual bonus and the achievement against those targets were: Performance measure and weighting Performance Range Bonus earned of budget % of target bonus Performance conditions: Group Revenue Budget 25% 98% achieved 94.4% Adjusted Operating Profit AOP 50% 92% achieved 72.5% Personal performance 25% CEO 65% The Committee assessed performance of both the CEO and CFO in relation to their 2014 objectives and determined CFO 85% achievement levels of 65% and 85% respectively.
The 2014 15 performance measures weighted to a target bonus of 76% for the CEO and 81% for the CFO.
92 Directors report | The personal performance element depends on the achievement of predetermined objectives, which are reviewed and approved by the Committee each year.
These include key strategic, operational or relationship objectives relating to each executives role and responsibilities.
Performance is reviewed and analysed in detail on an annual basis by the CEO for CFO and by the Chairman for the CEO.
The assessments are presented to the Remuneration Committee for consideration and for 2014 15 the individual performance includes objectives relating to their specific areas.

Share Incentive Plans For 2014 15 there were three key incentive schemes in operation across the workforce as a whole.
They are as follows: For executives: LTIP SAYE For all other employees: Employee Share Plan SIP SAYE Option grants to executive directors ceased in 2006.
The move away from options to restricted shares for all employees in 2006 has reduced potential dilution and has simplified remuneration arrangements.
Shares earned are satisfied through the issue of new shares while some shares have been purchased to satisfy share awards made under the new LTIP for executives.

The compound annual growth in EPS targets were set for 2014 15 as follows: 0% pay out below 10% growth: 25% pay out at 10% growth: 100% pay out at 20% growth or greater: and Linear progression between 25% and 100% thresholds.

The reason for these percentage limits is largely due to the Group operating and competing for high calibre executives and to act as an incentive to retain executives to achieve the long-term growth plans of the Group.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee wants to be able to make share awards of 600% of base salary.
This facility was established primarily to facilitate global recruitment of executives, and especially to attract key executives from the US.
Directors report 95 | Linkage of Long-Term Incentive Plan targets to business strategy The new Long-Term Incentive Plan has a number of targets, as described above, which are relevant to the long term strategy of the Group.
Our intention is to review these targets on an annual basis, taking into account market conditions and any other relevant factors to ensure that they remain appropriate in the context of the factors set out above.
The Committee will review their applicability on an annual basis, so that in the event that exceptional circumstances arise, such as material corporate activity or substantial changes in market conditions, their impact can be considered against subsequent annual awards.
If changes are to be proposed for any prospective LTIP award, it would be the Committees intention to confirm any such change to shareholders in advance.
Former share option schemes The executives have no legacy share options.
Shareholding requirements Under the LTIP executives are required to build up and retain shares to a specified percentage of salary, 250% for the CEO and 175% for the CFO.
Until these targets have been reached, the executives must retain at least half of any shares acquired under the new LTIP but not taking into account, for these purposes, any shares sold to meet any tax liabilities arising in connection with the new LTIP.
