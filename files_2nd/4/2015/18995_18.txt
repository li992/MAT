Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Annual Remuneration Report This report covers the reporting period from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015 and explains how the Remuneration Policy hasbeenimplemented.
Comparative figures for the 2014 financial year have also been provided.
The 2014 column includes his remuneration for the period between 1 October and31December 2014. b Benefits are car car allowance, fuel fuel allowance, private medical insurance, life insurance and travel and accommodation expenses.
c All Directors received salary supplement allowance in lieu of contributions into the Groups pension scheme throughout the year.
No Director had any entitlement under thedefined benefit section of the pension scheme and no additional benefit was received as a result of early retirement.
d The Annual bonus column shows 50 per cent of the total bonus contribution earned under the MIP Element A in respect of 2015 performance, and 50 per cent of the total value of Element B shares awarded which are deferred but are not subject to further performance conditions other than continued employment.
The remaining 50 per cent in respect of 2015 Element A is deferred into shares in the MIP account which are subject to performance and employment-based forfeiture for a further holding period.
The remaining 50 per cent of 2015 Element B shares is subject to performance and employment-based forfeiture for a 3-year deferred period.
These deferred elements will be disclosed in the LTIP column when the conditions are satisfied.
e The LTIP column shows the aggregate value of sums released from MIP or LTIP account balances from earlier years that are no longer subject to deferral and forfeiture risk based on performance in 2015. f The LTIP column includes the 2013 Performance Share Award under the 2005 LTIP made to Martyn Coffey on joining in 2013.
Vesting of this LTIP award was, exceptionally, dependent on achieving a minimum share price target over a predetermined period of 30 days following the announcement of the 2015 results and on continued employment.
As at the latest practicable date for approving this report, the performance condition was not yet capable of measurement.
However, as permitted under theRegulations, where the performance targets are substantially but not fully completed by the end of the relevant financial year, an expected value may be shown.
Theaverage mid-market price of the Companys shares for the 30-day period ending on 31 December 2015 was 324 pence.
This is above the share price target of 250 pence required for maximum vesting and, accordingly, the LTIP column for 2015 shows Martyn Coffeys 2013 LTIP Performance Share Award as vesting in full.
The award has been valued in accordance with the Regulations as the number of shares assumed to be vesting multiplied by the average share price over the last quarter of 2015 335 pence.
The outcome of the 30-day measurement period and any vesting will be the subject of a separate announcement, and if Martyn Coffeys 2013 LTIP Performance Share Award has not vested in full, an explanatory note will be included in the 2016 Annual Report on Remuneration and the single figure for 2015 will be restated.
Setting pay in context The following graphs illustrate the relationship between total expenditure on remuneration and other disbursements from profit over the past 3 years.
The 4 elements represent the most significant outgoings for the Company during the financial year.
In addition to staff pay and shareholder distributions, capital investment and taxation are shown for the following reasons: investment the Company increased capital investment during 2015 as part of its stated plan to invest strategically to take advantage ofmarket demand and in order to ensure that the business grows in a sustainable manner with a corresponding long-term benefit for allstakeholders: and tax the Company is a UK taxpayer and feels that it is beneficial to demonstrate to all its stakeholders its total UK tax contribution.
Themost significant elements of the Companys UK tax contribution are VAT, employers NI, corporation tax, fuel duty and aggregates levy.
Asprofitability increases, corporation tax will also increase.
In 2015 the Group was accredited with the Fair Tax Mark.

"c The comparative bonus figure for 2014 includes the exceptional acceleration of incentives for ""good leavers"" at senior management and Executive Director level."
Thisexplains the decrease in employee bonus in 2015.
Outcomes of incentive schemes in 2015 audited This section explains how 2015 performance is reflected in rewards earned under the Companys incentive schemes.
Management Incentive Plan MIP The MIP incorporates: Element A, an annual bonus award carrying a maximum of 150 per cent of salary, of which 50 per cent must be deferred into shares: and Element B, an award normally in the form of a nil-cost option to acquire shares, carrying a maximum of 100 per cent of salary, conditional on continued employment for 3 years from grant and 50 per cent of which is also subject to a financial condition over the 3-year period.
Element B shares must be held for a further 2 years after vesting.
Both awards depend on achievement of the performance conditions set by the Committee at the date of award.
The table below shows the 2015 performance conditions and the extent to which they have been satisfied.
Percentage Percentage Percentage of maximum Percentage of salary of salary contribution based Minimum Maximum 2015 of target earned earned Measurement on measurement target target Actual achieved Element A Element B EPS 75% 12.12p 14.14p 14.32p 100% 112.5 37.5 Net debt 25% 27.5m 22.5m 11.5m 100% 75.0 25.0 Non-financial targets 20% deduction 95% customer service N A All met 100% No No if not met 10% reduction health and safety deduction deduction Performance conditions were set at the beginning of 2015 and the Committee took account of both internal budgets and external factors such as the market consensus of investors for the full year 2015.
During the year, cash flow from sales improved significantly and pre-tax profit grew by 57 per cent.
This performance meant that the stretching EPS and net debt targets set at the beginning of the year were achieved infull, resulting in a 100 per cent achievement against target.
The share price improved by 39 per cent during the year 31 December 2014: 234pence: 31 December 2015: 325 pence, which means the underlying value of share awards increased.
EPS EPS relates to our strategic objective to grow profits.
The Groups profit before tax increased by 57 per cent from 22.4 million to 35.3 million.
EPS improved by 41 per cent from 10.13 pence in 2014 to 14.32 pence in 2015.
EPS is measured using International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs based on the audited results of the Group and subject to the discretion of the Committee with regard to one-off items.
Net debt Net debt is relevant for measurement of cash flow and overall sustainability.
The Groups net debt at 31 December 2015 of 11.5 million was better than the lower better end of the target range set by the Committee at the beginning of the year.
Additional performance conditions Our customers are at the heart of our business model, and our measurement of customer service uses factors such as product availability, on-time delivery performance and administrative and delivery accuracy to assess performance.
The Groups average customer service performance, assessed monthly, exceeded its minimum target of 95 per cent throughout 2015.
The Group also continued its excellent performance against its stated objective of reducing days lost to accidents by 10 per cent year on year.
The actual reduction in days lost to accidents year on year was 43 per cent.
Had these 2 targets not been met, the overall level of MIP award would have reduced by 20 per cent: the achievement of these measures means that no reduction factor will apply.

d If the actual EPS falls below the forfeiture threshold over the 3 years before vesting, 50 per cent of the balance of the award is forfeited.
Once Element B shares have vested, they must normally be held for a further 2 years.
Element B shares lapse on cessation of employment except in good leaver circumstances, in which case they vest on leaving and must be held for 2 years from the date of leaving.
2005 LTIP: 2013 Performance Share Awards A proportion of Performance Share Awards granted in 2013 under the 2005 LTIP may vest following the announcement of the 2015 annual results.
Vesting of the LTIP award granted to Martyn Coffey on joining in 2013 was, exceptionally, dependent on achieving a minimum share price target over a predetermined period of 30 days following the announcement of the 2015 results and on continued employment.
As at the latest practicable date for approving this report, the performance condition was not yet capable of measurement but, as noted above, theexpected outcome of this award has been included in the LTIP column of the single total remuneration table.
The expected outcome of the 2013 performance award against the targets is set out in the table below: Share price target % of award vesting Actual Number of shares vesting Below 200p 0% 324p 243,412 100% Between 200p and 250p Between 50% and 100% pro-rata on a straight line basis The share price used to estimate the expected outcome of the 2013 award has been taken as the average share price in the 30 days ending 31 December 2015 324 pence.
Jack Clarke, having joined in 2014, does not hold a 2013 Performance Share Award under the 2005 LTIP.
2013 LTIP awards made to other senior managers below Board level and to past Directors were made on the basis of EPS and OCF growth performance targets measured over the financial years ended 31 December 2013, 2014 and 2015.
These targets were met in full, so these awards will vest in April 2016.

Marshalls plc 57 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Corporate Governance Annual Remuneration Report continued Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy in the following financial year 2016 Executive Directors Salary The Committee approved a 2.5 per cent salary increase for Executive Directors effective from 1 January 2016, in line with inflation and increases for UK employees generally, and an exceptional increase of 16.75 per cent for Jack Clarke, in line with policy, to reflect that he isnowestablished in the role and his performance as Finance Director is for the full year 2015.
1 January 2016 1 January 2015 Change Director '000 '000 % Martyn Coffey 422 412 2.5 Jack Clarke 276 237 16.75 Benefits and pension Benefits continue on the same basis as in 2015.
Variable pay incentives Executive Directors will be granted performance awards under the MIP conditional upon achieving certain performance conditions in 2016.
The Committee has discretion under the Remuneration Policy to change the weightings of performance criteria to align with its priorities, including measures relating to performance on ESG issues.
Our strategic priorities for 2016 are focused on improving profit margins, growing our business and developing our brand, while also remaining innovative and operating sustainably with the highest standards of health, safety and social responsibility.
The Committee believes that EPS and the ratio of OCF to EBITDA are the most appropriate criteria for measuring achievement of our financial objectives and that the combination of financial and non-financial criteria avoids inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The weighting for the operation of 2016 awards under the MIP will be: EPS 75% OCF to EBITDA 25% Targets are set between a minimum 0 per cent and maximum 100 per cent range in each case, with on-target budget performance expected to deliver 70 per cent of maximum.
Additional non-financial performance conditions to reflect our focus on brand, customers and employees will apply: customer service must remain at or above 95 per cent : and health and safety incidence: the rate of accidents must not fall below the 2015 level achieved.
2015 was an exceptional year for health and safety performance, resulting in only 5.1 lost time accidents per 1 million hours worked, following the Groups success in achieving a year on year reduction of significantly more than 10 per cent for the previous 8 years.
The target is therefore toremain below this ratio during 2016.
There is a reduction of award value earned by 20 per cent if these additional conditions are not met.
Element A awards have a forfeiture threshold set annually at the time of confirmation of the award.
If this is breached, 50 per cent of the deferred balance in a participants Element A MIP account is forfeited.
Element B awards also have a long-term financial underpin based on a minimum EPS threshold that must be maintained over the 3 years from the date of grant.
If this is breached, 50 per cent of the Element B award is forfeited.
Element B awards are granted after the end of the financial period by reference to which they have been earned and the underpin is set at the time of grant.
The measurement period under the MIP by reference to which these targets must be met will be the full financial year ending 31 December 2016.
It is the view of the Committee that the targets for the MIP are commercially sensitive as they are primarily related to budgeted future profit and debt levels in the Company and therefore their disclosure in advance is not in the interests of the Company or shareholders.
The Committee will, however, provide full retrospective disclosure to enable shareholders to judge the level of award provided against the targets set.
Marshalls plc 58 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information NonExecutive Directors The Board approved an increase in the fee by 2.5 per cent from 1 January 2016, in line with Executive Directors and employees.

50 per cent of Element A awards and 100 per cent of Element B awards shown in this column may be forfeited if the financial condition is not satisfied.
