The Committee adjusted the weightings of the annual bonus measures This section pages 53 to 58 describes the implementation of our toreect the strategic objectives for the year.
The weighting for the policies in 2014 15, including the single gure of remuneration, strategic scorecard which this year will focus on just two strategic supporting narrative for our bonus and long term outcomes, and priorities like-for-like sales and cost reduction has been increased additional supporting disclosures.
Consequently, the weighting for underlying PBT has decreased from 60% to 50%.
The weighting given to financial measures is therefore Johanna Waterous 80% of the total bonus.
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee LTIP We plan to make LTIP awards in April 2015 following the announcementof results, in line with the normal grant cycle for the Company.
The Committee considers that the new CEO should have anincentive interestin Morrisons shares from the earliest opportunity ensuring that his interests are aligned to shareholders.
The performance targets for the 2015 LTIP award should be aligned with Morrisons strategy and be meaningful and robust.
In this transitional period, the Committee believes that it is important to allow David Potts time to assess the business and provide his input into the formation of thelong term business plan under his leadership.
We therefore intend to wait until the outcome of this process before setting targets for the 2015 award, and we will revert to shareholders at this time.
We expect this tobe by the time of the interim results announcement in September.
Holding period The Committee reviewed the potential use of a post vesting holding period for the LTIP and concluded that the combination of a three year performance period and substantial shareholding guidelines created sufficient long term alignment with shareholders.
The Committee will continue to monitor practice in this area.
Clawback In line with the revised UK Corporate Governance Code, from 2015 16, we will be introducing clawback provisions into our annual bonus and LTIP plans, to supplement the malus arrangements already in place.
Full details of the malus clawback provisions are set out on page 51.

The target range was built around the objectives which the business set and communicated at the start of the year.
Performancewas at the target level.
For 2014 15, the strategic scorecard focused on delivery against key elements of the strategy for the year, with targets set in the context of the strategic plan and the current retail environment, and included both financial and operational elements.
Further discussion of performance in these areas is set out on pages 10 to 20 of the Annual report.
Key highlights include: operating cash ow which delivered strong performance above the maximum target set, good progress on cost savings initiatives and on target operational achievement in the roll out of online capability.
Performance in convenience was below expectations resulting in no payout for this element.
The personal measures are specic to the individual and were designed to support the delivery of our key financial and strategic objectives.
The Directors consider the specic details of the performance targets to contain commercially sensitive information linked to the Companys strategic priorities and internal budgets, which would be potentially valuable to competitors beyond the end of the financial year.
The disclosure of such information could therefore damage the Companys competitive position and shareholder value and is therefore not considered appropriate.
50% of any bonus payable is deferred in shares under the DSBP which vest three years after the date of award.
Dividend equivalents will accrue and be paid on the shares that vest.
These deferred shares are normally forfeited if the individual leaves the Company before they vest.
Dalton Philips bonus for 2014 15 was paid in cash under the terms of his settlement agreement.
