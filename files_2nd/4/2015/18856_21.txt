Directors Remuneration Report continued Part 1 Policy report The Group Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders on 14 May 2014 at the 2014 AGM and took effect from that date.
There are no proposed changes to the policy for 2016, and therefore no requirement for a shareholder vote on this part of the DRR at the 2016 AGM.
The Directors Remuneration Policy with updated scenario charts can be found at: www.
com rempolicy Contained in Part 2 of this report, section 2.10, are details of how the Directors Remuneration Policy will be applied in 2016: this part of the DRR will be subject to an advisory vote by shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
Part 2 Annual report on remuneration 2.1 Single figure of remuneration for each executive director The following table set out the single figure of remuneration for each of the executive directors, split between those based in the UK and the US.
b Taxable benefits received during the year.
Taxable benefits include company car or car allowance, private medical, dental and contributory health and welfare cover as applicable.
For those directors based in the US, the cost of benefits reflects the amounts that would be chargeable to UK income tax if the director were resident in the UK for tax purposes.
c Bonus awarded in relation to the year inclusive of all amounts subject to further deferral.
d The value of long-term incentives which vested in respect of performance periods ending during the year inclusive of all amounts subject to further deferral: this figure also includes dividends.
The LTIP award for performance period 2013-2015 accrues dividends which are paid as additional share options: 80% is paid following the end of the performance period and 20% deferred for two years.
The deferred element may continue to attract dividends which will be reported in the period which they are received.
The figures have been calculated using the number of share options that vested multiplied by the closing mid-market share price on 31 December 2015 of 6.125.
The exchange rate at 31 December 2015 of 1 $1.4739 was used for those executive directors paid in US dollars.
e Pension figure reflects cash value of Defined Contribution pension contribution or cash alternative or, for defined benefits style arrangements, figures are calculated in accordance with the basis set out in The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
Further detail in relation to individual pension arrangements is provided in section 2.2 on page 40. f The single figure of remuneration, being the sum of columns a to e inclusive.
g Robin Watsons annual salary and bonus was calculated using a hybrid salary.
This was calculated pro rata and comprises of his role as CEO for WGPSN from 1 January 2015 to 5 April 2015, where his salary was 378,500: and his salary of 500,000 from 6 April 2015 onwards following his promotion to Group Chief Operating Officer.
h David Kemp was appointed as executive director from 13 May 2015: the information shown here reflects his remuneration arrangements as executive director with the exception of long-term incentives which is based on performance period 2013-2015 and reflects his salary at the commencement of the performance period.
The pro-rata bonus is based on a hybrid annual salary comprising of 300,000 in his role as Deputy Group CFO from 1 January to 12 May 2015, and his salary of 350,000 as Group CFO from 13 May to 31 December.
i Alan Semple was based in the US and received his remuneration in US dollars.
All figures in the above table are therefore expressed in US dollars.
Alan Semple retired from the board on 13 May 2015: and subsequently from Wood Group on 30 June 2015.
His remuneration for 2015 reflects the period up to his employment end date of 30 June 2015.

Each company is ranked and Wood Groups position in this group is taken as a measure of success.
The TSR comparator peer group for Wood Group in 2015 comprised Aker Solutions, AMEC Foster Wheeler, Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, Fluor, Jacobs Engineering, KBR, McDermott, Petrofac, Saipem, SBM Offshore, Sulzer, Technip, Weir Group, Worley Parsons and WS Atkins.
AEPS and EBITA are determined using actual foreign exchange rates.
No adjustments are made to reflect changes in currency from the date the targets are set.
The targets for LTIP 2013-2015, and the extent to which they were achieved, are set out below.
On reaching the threshold, 25% of the relevant measure becomes payable: and on reaching the maximum, 100% of the relevant measure becomes payable.
For achievement between threshold and maximum, the allocation is on a straight line basis.
For the 2013 to 2015 cycle all vestings were made as nil cost options.
For all participants, 80% is paid following the end of the performance period and 20% of the share options awarded is deferred for a further two years.
This contributes to alignment with shareholders and aids retention, with continued employment a requirement to receive the deferred payment, other than for those classified as good leavers.
The LTIP award for performance period 2013-2015 accrues dividends which are paid as additional share options.
The deferred element may continue to attract dividends which will be reported in the relevant period.
