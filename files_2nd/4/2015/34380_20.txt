The Directors have confirmed to the Company, in writing, that they have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration beside those detailed below.
All figures are gross values including tax.
Annual Incentive The level of Annual Incentive is determined by the Remuneration Committee, based on British Lands performance and the individuals contribution during the preceding year.
The assessment for the year ended 31 March 2015 was undertaken with reference to performance against the following quantitative and qualitative targets, using data available at the year end.

The Group does not disclose prospective and retrospective performance targets for each individuals performance beyond that disclosed above as the Directors consider this to be commercially sensitive.

British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2015 101 Governance and remuneration REMUNERATION REPORT: Implementation Report continued The maximum Annual Incentive award achievable is 150% of base salary.
Taking into account the above performance, the Remuneration Committee set the aggregate Annual Incentive received by the Executive Directors for the year ended 31 March 2015 at 87% of the maximum 130% of base salary, as compared with 80% of the maximum for the year ended 31 March 2014.
One third of each Executive Directors Annual Incentive award was deferred and used to purchase MSP Bonus Shares, subject to a three-year holding requirement under British Lands Matching Share Plan MSP.
No further performance measures apply to these deferred shares: the MSP is described on pages 90 to 91.
Long Term Incentives audited information The figures in the Long Term Incentives column are comprised of awards vesting under two share schemes: the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Matching Share Plan MSP.
The performance measure attached to these LTIP awards measures the growth in the Companys net asset value NAV per share against the capital growth component of the Investment Property Databank UK Annual Property Index the Index, over a performance period of three years commencing at the start of the financial year in which the awards were granted.
Growth in the Companys NAV per share has to exceed that of the Index for a minimum proportion of the award to vest.
Stretching outperformance is required for the entire award to vest, as detailed below: Percentage by which the average annual growth of British Lands net asset value per share exceeds Percentage the average annual increase in the capital growth component of the Index vesting % 4.5% or more 100 3.5% or more but less than 4.5% 80 2.5% or more but less than 3.5% 60 1.5% or more but less than 2.5% 40 0.5% or more but less than 1.5% 20 More than 0% but less than 0.5% 10 0% or less 0 The vesting values of the LTIP awards granted in 2012, due to vest on 14 September 2015 and shown in the 2015 column of the single total figure of remuneration table, have been calculated using the average closing middle market quotation MMQ for the period from 1 January 2015 to 31 March 2015 824.69 pence as the vesting share price.
Aon Hewitt has calculated that these LTIP awards will vest at a rate of 100% reflecting British Lands growth in NAV of 11.7% per annum during the performance period, compared to the Index increasing by 4.7% per annum.
This produces the following estimated values on vesting: Estimated dividend Number of equivalent payment Award price performance Percentage Estimated value of due including exercise price shares Number of options of award award on vesting interest 1 1 Director LTIP award date p awarded awarded vesting % Chris Grigg 14 09 2012 538 185,873 743,494 100% 3,664,403 151,836 Lucinda Bell 14 09 2012 538 138,289 138,289 100% 1,536,918 112,965 Charles Maudsley 14 09 2012 538 157,992 100% 1,302,945 129,060 Tim Roberts 14 09 2012 538 157,992 100% 1,302,945 129,060 1 For the 2012 LTIP award Chris Grigg and Lucinda Bell received their awards as mixtures of options and performance shares: Charles Maudsley and Tim Roberts received their entire awards as performance shares.
The vesting values of LTIP awards granted in 2011, which vested on 30 June 2014 and are shown in the 2014 column of the single total figure of remuneration table, have been calculated using the MMQ on the day of vesting.
MSP performance is assessed using two equally-weighted performance measures, each relating to half of the total MSP Matching Share award.
For these MSP Matching Share awards, one performance measure was based on Total Shareholder Return the TSR Part : the other on the Companys gross income growth the GIG Part.
The table below shows the performance required by the Companys TSR compared to a comparator group of companies across the three-year performance period for any Matching Shares to vest under the TSR performance condition.
For these MSP Matching Share awards the comparator group consisted of Great Portland Estates plc, Hammerson plc, Land Securities Group PLC, Intu Properties plc and SEGRO plc.

Aon Hewitt has confirmed the TSR performance of the comparator group which will result in the TSR part of the award lapsing as British Lands TSR over the performance period was 91.8% compared to a median of 95.8% for the comparator group.
It is estimated that the GIG part will vest at a rate of 50%: the actual vesting rate will be calculated once the relevant figures are published by the Index.

Dividend equivalents accrued on all vesting LTIP and MSP awards are also included within the Long Term Incentives column, along with the interest accrued on dividend equivalents paid on vesting LTIP shares.
Other Items in the Nature of Remuneration audited information The values shown in the Other items column comprise the Executive Directors interests under the Companys all-employee share schemes the Share Incentive Plan SIP and the Sharesave Scheme and non-taxable benefits received by the Directors during the year, as shown in the table below.
These share schemes are offered on the same terms to all eligible employees of the Company.
The figures shown are the values of free and matching shares awarded under the SIP during the year and the notional gain on the exercise of any Sharesave options during the year.
Further details of the Executive Directors Sharesave Scheme interests can be found on page 107.
Pension audited information The figures shown in the Pension column represent the differing pension arrangements of the Executive Directors.
Chris Grigg received 35% of basic salary as cash in lieu of pension.
Charles Maudsley received a pension allowance of 15% of basic salary in the defined contribution scheme.
Lucinda Bell and Tim Roberts earned pension benefits in defined benefit schemes sponsored by the Company during the year: the increase in value over the year of their respective pensions is shown in the single total figure of remuneration table and further detail is provided on page 105.
There are no additional benefits that will become receivable by a director in the event that a director retires early.
British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2015 103 Governance and remuneration REMUNERATION REPORT: Implementation Report continued Scheme interests awarded during the financial year audited information Awards granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan The total fair value of each Directors LTIP award for the year ended 31 March 2015 was equivalent to 200% basic salary at grant.
At grant each Director can indicate a preference as to the proportion of the award that they wish to receive as performance shares and the proportion that they wish to receive as market-value options.
For the LTIP award granted in 2014 the Directors received awards consisting entirely of performance shares.
The share price used to determine the face value of performance shares and fair value of options and therefore the number of performance shares and or options awarded is the average market value of the Companys shares over the three dealing days immediately prior to the day of award.
This average share price was 684.3 pence.
The proportion of the award that vests, if any, is dependent on Company performance against the LTIP performance measures over the three years following grant.
These are detailed on page 99.
