The Chief Executives remuneration disclosed in the table below has been calculated to take into account base salary, taxable benefits, excluding his allowance in lieu of pension, and annual bonus including any amount deferred.
The UK employee pay on which the average percentage change is based is calculated using the increase in the earnings of UK-based, full-time employees using P60 and P11d data from tax years 2014 and 2015.
Part-time employees have been excluded from the analysis as many will have experienced material changes in pay during the period due to their change of hours.
The employee analysis is done on a matched basis, that is, the same individuals appear in the 2014 and 2015 populations.
The comparison figures are based on UK employees as described above as both executive directors and most of the Management Board are UK based and this is considered to be an appropriate comparison.

REMUNERATION FOR EMPLOYEES BELOW BOARD As stated in our Remuneration Policy, each year, prior to reviewing the remuneration of the executive directors and the members of the Management Board, the Committee considers a report prepared by the Group HR Director detailing remuneration practice across the Group.
The report provides a regional overview of how employee pay compares to the market, any material changes during the year and includes detailed analysis of basic pay and variable pay changes within the UK where all of the executive directors and most of the Management Board are based.
While the Company does not directly consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay and formulating the remuneration policy set out in this Report, the Company does receive an update and feedback from the broader employee population on an annual basis using an engagement survey which includes a number of questions relating to remuneration.
The Company does not use remuneration comparison measurements.
STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR Below are the Remuneration Policy decisions implemented for the financial year 2016.
There have been no material changes to our Remuneration Policy during FY15.
However, the Remuneration Committee took account of the Code and has introduced clawback into the executive incentive plans.
In reviewing the periods during which clawback should apply, the Committee took into consideration the relatively short-term and cyclical nature of our business.
The incentive plans already incorporated malus.
However, the Committee took the opportunity to align the trigger events for both malus and clawback.
A summary of how malus and clawback will operate is given below.
Clawback will be introduced in relation to the PSP granted in 2015 and to any annual bonus awarded in 2016 in relation to performance in FY16.
74|Hays plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION SUMMARY OF MALUS AND CLAWBACK PROVISIONS ANNUAL BONUS Clawback to apply to the cash element for three years from date of award Malus to apply to the deferred element during the three-year deferral period PSP Malus to apply during the three-year performance period Clawback to apply for two years post the vesting date For clarity, clawback provisions and the new trigger events for both malus and clawback will not apply to any annual bonus or PSP already granted.

BONUS PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS The weighting of the performance conditions remain as follows for 2016: Performance condition Weighting EPS 60% The operation of the Bonus Plan is otherwise as set out in the Remuneration Policy and the Policy Summary on page 64.
It should be noted that the Committee views the disclosure of the actual Cash conversion 20% performance targets as commercially sensitive.
The Committee will provide retrospective disclosure of Personal 20% the performance targets for the financial measures to allow shareholders to judge the bonus earned in the context of the performance delivered.
The Committee believes that some of the personal objectives Total 100% may continue to be commercially sensitive.

Company budget for FY16 and the expectations for performance: Strategic direction of the business over the period covered by the PSP award: Market conditions and visibility of future trading.
FY16 threshold and maximum range around this target was - 4% respectively.
Threshold and maximum ongoing growth expectations for years two and three set around a fixed range, currently RPI 4% to RPI 12% per annum.
Hays plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015|75 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The Committee reviewed the Group Chairmans fee during FY15 and determined that it should increase by 2.0% for FY16.
This is in line with the pay review for other employees in the Company.
The Board reviewed the fees for the other non-executive directors NEDs during FY15.
They determined that their base fee should increase by 2.0% for FY16 in line with other increases across the Company.
In addition, to recognise the increased time commitment of the SID, the additional SID fee will move from 5,000 p. a. to 10,000 p. a. for FY16.
There were no changes to Committee Chairman fees.
All increases are effective from 1 July 2015.
