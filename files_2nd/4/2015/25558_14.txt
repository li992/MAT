We intend to introduce the LTICS during 2016 and intend for the opening biennial vintage to comprise those companies created or first funded during 2014 and 2015.
In addition to the proposed introduction of the LTICS, and recognising the unique culture of teamwork and collaboration in the Group, we also decided to reopen the LTIP to all employees of the Group.

It is intended that this appointment be temporary and this continues to be the case.
However, as I have undertaken an extensive consultation with our major shareholders during 2015 it is my intention to see the proposed changes implemented before handing over to a new chairperson.
64 IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 24609-04 Proof 9 5 April 2016 8:02 PM Our Governance Committee Reports Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration policy and components This report sets out the Companys policy on the remuneration of its executive and non-executive directors the Policy which will become effective subject to approval by shareholders at our AGM on 12 May 2016.
As described in the Remuneration Statement, our Policy has been updated following a review of the Groups approach to remuneration by the Committee, including input from Deloitte LLP, and following an extensive consultation with institutions holding in excess of 70% of the Groups shares during 2015 and early 2016.
In updating the Policy, the Committee has continued to apply its principles supporting the overriding strategic objective of the Group to provide capital to and help to build world-changing businesses based on academic research.
The success of the Group over time will primarily be a function of three key variables the amount of capital provided to the portfolio, the return per annum achieved on that capital and the period over which it is invested.
To achieve this objective, the Committee continues to believe that the Group requires a remuneration structure that has incentive levers covering both the short-term 1-3 years and the longer-term 3-5 years and, for all employees other than the Groups executive directors, incentives directly aligned with those specific assets potentially over an even longer term 5-10 years.
The first two levers remain the most relevant for the Groups executive directors and therefore continue to be used as the variable elements of the Policy.
Changes to the remuneration policy The changes to the previous policy are limited to an increase in the maximum annual LTIP award to 300% from 150%, and minor amendments to facilitate the operation of the Policy and additional explanatory wording or clarifications.

As described above, the Groups annual incentive scheme operates such that any amounts in respect of a financial year are only paid in the following financial year or later years in the case of the 50% deferred into shares following completion of all audit, assurance and approval processes.
However, the charts above effectively depict the total face value of the bonus that can be earned in respect of the relevant year.
Conditional awards of shares under the Groups LTIP are made based on a percentage of the participants salary in face value terms and therefore the above amounts relating to the LTIP component reflect this.
Changes in the value of those shares over the vesting period are therefore ignored.
