Consideration of shareholders views The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year at a meeting shortly following the AGM.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time, is then considered as part of the Companys annual review of remuneration policy.
In addition, the Chairman of the Committee and the Chairman of the Company regularly engage directly with major shareholders and their representative bodies and report their views back to the Committee, who take them into account when formulating any material changes to the remuneration policy.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years remuneration report and any matters relating to remuneration discussed with shareholders during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy Report, authority was given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors such as the payment of pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes that have or will have been disclosed to shareholders in remuneration reports before the Policy took effect.
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
