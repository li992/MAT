Both the Plan and BETUS were closed to future accrual on 10 April 2011.
The total accrued pension and transfer value in the combined Plan and BETUS are 204,300 p. a. and 6.9m respectively, as at 27 September 2015.
They have been calculated based on entitlements accrued to 10 April 2011 but using market conditions at 27 September 2015.
These figures also include increases to accrued pension since the date of leaving defined benefit service for this member, as required under the rules of the Plan and BETUS.
The aim of these increases is to align the benefits with price inflation between the date of leaving pensionable service in the Plan and BETUS and the date when benefits are drawn.
In line with all members of the defined benefits section of the Plan, John Gibney will benefit from the Enhanced Early Retirement Facility EERF which allows the Plan members to retire within five years of reaching normal pension age without a reduction in their pension.
The EERF includes benefits payable from BETUS and is non-contractual.
Continuation of the EERF formed part of the agreement with the Plan trustee on the closure of the defined benefit section of the Plan.
The company has given notice to all of the Plan members that the EERF will be withdrawn by 5 April 2016.
As stated earlier in the report, John Gibney will retire in April 2016.
In accordance with the terms of the EERF the Remuneration Committee may consider offering a discounted one-off cash settlement to John Gibney in respect of his deferred benefits under the defined benefits pension and BETUS to reduce the companys balance sheet exposure.
Any payment will be made as a taxable lump sum and will extinguish all rights under the BETUS, and he will not be entitled to any further benefits from the scheme.
Full details will be made available in next years Directors Remuneration Report.
After this there will be no executives with a deferred defined benefit pension entitlement.
The cash allowance payable to the executives: Reflects contributions the company would have made to the defined contribution section of the Plan had these individuals elected to join, less a deduction to ensure the cash allowance is cost neutral to the company from a National Insurance perspective Is paid at a rate of 24.6% of pensionable pay base salary only for the CEO and 22.0% of pensionable pay base salary only to the CFO.
Outside appointments Simon Litherland is the President and Chairman of Incorporated Society of British Advertisers ISBA.
John Gibney was Britvics nominated Director of Interactive Screen Media Limited, a joint venture company, until 10 November 2015, when he resigned.

A shareholding requirement of 200% of salary for the CEO and 100% for the CFO applies.
The CEO was appointed to role in February 2013 and therefore currently has a shareholding of 42% of salary.
As such he may not sell any vested shares from the company LTIPs except to settle taxes and the payment of exercise prices until the shareholding requirement has been satisfied.

Directors Remuneration Policy For reference, the following is an extract from Britvics Remuneration Policy approved at the AGM held on 27 January 2015.
The full policy can be found in the 2014 remuneration report on www.
There is no intention to revise the policy more frequently than every three years.
However the committee will review the Remuneration Policy annually in order to ensure it remains aligned with the companys strategy, appropriately positioned against the market and aligned with corporate governance requirements.
In the event a change to the policy is required, the committee will consult with Britvics major shareholders prior to submitting the policy for approval by all shareholders.
Please note that because the table on page 63 is an extract of the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM.
As such, some of the text relates specifically to the 2015 financial year.

Britvic plc Annual Report 2015 67 governance annual report onremuneration continued Approach to remuneration on recruitment When hiring a new Executive Director, or making internal promotions to the Board, the Committee will in principle apply the same policy as for existing Executive Directors, as detailed in the Remuneration Policy.
The rationale for the package offered will be explained in the next Annual Remuneration Report.
For internal promotions any commitments made prior to appointment may continue to be honoured as the Executive is transitioned to the new remuneration arrangements.
Our recruitment Remuneration Policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and promotion of high-calibre Executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets to deliver our strategic objectives.
The details are set out in the table below: Area Policy and operation Base salary Base salary would be set at an appr opriate level to recruit the best candidate based on their skills, experience and current remuneration.
In some instances it may be appropriate to recruit on a salary at the lower end of the typical market range and progress salary increases above the typical rate of increases provided to the wider employee workforce to align with performance and policy over time Benefits and pension Benefits and pension would be in line with normal policy and may include, wher e appropriate, relocation benefits or other benefits reflective of normal market practice in the territory in which the Executive Director is employed Annual bonus Awards would be made under the annual bonus plan in line with the Remuneration Policy Maximum opportunity would not exceed 140% of base salary Normal LTIP awards Awards would be made under the LTIP plans in line with the Remuneration Policy ESOP and PSP Under the ESOP, maximum opportunity would not exceed 300% of base salary Under the PSP, maximum opportunity would not exceed 150% of base salary Additional LTIP awards On the r ecruitment of a director the Committee may make a one-off performance linked award under ESOP and PSP the ESOP and PSP subject to the below limits.
Under the ESOP an award of up to 500% of base salary may be made in a year to an Executive inclusive of the normal annual award that would be granted to an Executive Under the PSP an awar d of up to 200% of base salary may be made in a year to an Executive inclusive of the normal annual award that would be granted to an Executive Replacement awards The Committee will normally seek to avoid using r eplacement awards.
However where, in exceptional circumstances, replacement awards are considered by the Committee to be necessary, they are not subject to a formal maximum, although would be designed to reflect only the value of remuneration forgone by the recruited Executive or less.
In making any buyout awards the Committee would take into account any additional LTIP awards made as set out above Service contracts The Committee may agr ee a contractual notice period with the Executive which initially exceeds twelve months, as applies to other Executives, particularly if it is necessary to attract Executives who will be required to relocate their families This will r educe to a twelve month rolling notice period once the individual is 12 months from the end of their initial notice period 68 Britvic plc Annual Report 2015 strategic report gover governance finance financial statements other information governance annual report onremuneration continued Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office The table below sets out items that are contained within the service contracts for the Executive Directors.
It is the policy that these will apply to any future Director.
Item Policy Notice period 12 months if given by the company 6 months if given by the Executive Remuneration Base salary and pension Eligibility to participate in the annual bonus and LTIP and other share incentive plans Benefits Provision of company car or cash alternative Payment of professional subscriptions for up to two recognised professional bodies Eligibility for private medical insurance Contractual termination The company may terminate the Executive s employment at any time and with immediate effect and payment will pay the Executive an after tax sum in lieu of notice equal to the basic salary which the Executive would have been entitled to receive during their notice period.
A payment may also be made in respect of outstanding untaken holiday entitlement accrued up to and including the date of termination Payments in lieu of notice would be paid monthly and ar e subject to mitigation if the Executive obtains alternative income during the period If the Executive is terminated for r easons such as gross misconduct no payment in lieu of notice will be due The Committee may at its discr etion put the Executive on garden leave for any period provided that base salary and contractual benefits are paid during this period.
The Committee would only use this discretion when appropriate and would seek to minimise the cost to the company if such discretion was required Non-Executive Directors The NEDs do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment for a three-year term On termination NEDs shall only be entitled to accrued fees as at the date of termination In the event of a settlement agreement, the Committee may agree payments it considers reasonable in settlement of legal claims.
This may include reasonable reimbursement of professional fees in connection with such agreements.
