STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Directors remuneration report The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration outcomes for David for the 2015 financial year are fully justified, in the light of the business and individual performance during the year and were in the best interests ofthe Company and shareholders.
During the year, two other individuals served as Executive Directors, each for a relatively small proportion of the year.
Neither was entitled toany performance-related pay in respect of their period of service.
Sean Wilkins stepped down with effect from 20 January 2015, and his termination payments were set out in last years report.
Paul Doughty held office for approximately seven months but, because of his resignation, was not eligible for a bonus payment.
He had not been granted any long-term incentive awards during his tenure, and received no payments ontermination.
KEVIN HIGGINS Remuneration policy for 2016 Since our remuneration policy was approved by shareholders in 2014, REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN the Company has made significant progress under David Wilds leadership as evidenced by the strong earnings growth and shareholder returns wehave delivered.

The key changes to our policy for the CEO, David Wild are as follows: o base salary will be fixed for the duration of the policy.
From 2016, hisbase salary will be unchanged and frozen at 510,000 until 2019: o annual bonus opportunity will be reduced from 150% of salary to 100% of salary payable in cash : and o a single grant of performance share awards will be made to him under the proposed 2016 LTIP covering grants over the period 20162018, vesting in 20192021.
These awards will be subject to stretching performance criteria and continued employment.
Performance measures will be relative TSR and growth in EPS, and the programme will be underpinned by a requirement for the total shareholder return of the Company to increase in absolute terms, with the full release ofvested awards only achieved if TSR doubles.
If the resolution to approve the 2016 LTIP is not passed, the Company may make annual awards under the 2012 LTIP subject to the limits setout in the policy table and the rules of that plan.
In addition, base salaries will not be fixed over the life of the policy and the annual bonus opportunity will revert to up to 150% of salary of which 1 3 would be deferred and settled in shares.

For financial targets, a sliding scale is applied, with a very modest amount being payable for threshold levels of performance.
A number of the Companys non-financial strategic objectives have been incorporated into the annual bonus for Executive Directors and will be applied on an individual basis for a minority of the overall bonus opportunity.
These objectives will also be measured on a sliding scale of performance.

Dominos Pizza Group plc 56 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Details of variable pay earned in the year Annual bonus plan The incentive for the financial year ended 27 December 2015 was in the form of a bonus based on performance against a combination of financial targets, specifically a significant increase in the Groups underlying PBT, and non-financial targets, incentivising a number of the Companys strategic priorities.
The CEO had a bonus opportunity of up to 150% of salary in respect of the 2015 financial year.
Of this opportunity, 70% was linked to Group underlying PBT and operated on a banded basis, commencing at 20% for threshold levels of profit performance, 50% of bonus at target, with the full 100% only payable at stretch performance levels, being materially in excess of budget.
2015 was a successful year for the Group, with the underlying PBT of 69.85m including trading losses in the German business exceeding themaximum performance hurdle of 69.41m, and so resulting in a maximum payment for this element as shown below: Performance hurdle Targets set for year underlying PBT Actual performance achieved Resulting bonus out-turn Resulting bonus payable Growth in underlying profit before tax of Threshold: 59.95m Actual underlying PBT 100% of maximum 535,500 between 95% of target 20% payout and Target: 63.1m was 69.85m 110% or more full payout.
Graduated scale Maximum: 69.41m operates between performance points The non-financial targets set for the CEO, which accounted for 30% of his bonus opportunity, related to a number of key strategic objectives for2015 which included: o Germany reducing trading losses and deliver a strategic outcome: o Switzerland move the business to profitability, improve management and gain board agreement on a strategic plan: and o succession to build an executive team including potential CEO successors.
The Remuneration Committees assessment of performance against the above objectives concluded that there was good progress with these strategically-linked personal objectives and 17.5% points of the 30% forming this part of the bonus should be paid, equating to 133,875.
Payment of the bonus is subject to reaching a threshold level of profitability, and this underpin was met.
Accordingly, David Wild is entitled to receive a bonus in respect of 2015 performance amounting to 669,375, equating to 87.5% of the maximum opportunity and c. 131% of salary.
Consistent with our policy, two-thirds of the bonus is payable in cash and the remaining one-third will be deferred in shares that vest after two years.
The other Executive Directors who held office for part of the 2015 financial year, Sean WIlkins and Paul Doughty, were not eligible to receive a bonus in light of their respective resignations.
Share awards granted during the year audited Sharesave Plan The Company operates an HMRC-registered Savings-Related Share Option Plan open to all UK employees with the required period of service.
Under this arrangement, employees enter into a three-year savings contract for a fixed monthly amount and are granted an option, with the accumulated savings being used to fund the option exercise cost.
As permitted by HMRC rules, a discount of 20% to the market price at the date of invitation isoffered.
Vesting of the option is subject only to continued service.
An award was granted to David Wild during the year as follows: Executive Date of grant Type of award Number of shares Option price Face value Vesting date David Wild 29 04 15 Share option 2,816 639p 22,725 01 06 18 As explained above, the option price is at a 20% discount to the closing share price on 7 April 2015, the day before invitations to apply for options were issued.
Face value is calculated using the closing mid-market price of the Companys shares on the date of grant of 807p.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan Bonuses payable to Executive Directors are settled two thirds in cash and one third in shares, the receipt of the latter being deferred for two years.
Aprohibited period existing throughout 2015 because of ongoing negotiations in relation to the German business, the successful conclusion of which was announced to the market on 15 December 2015.
As a result the share-settled deferred portion of the CEOs 2014 bonus could not be granted until December 2015.
Given the delay caused by the prohibited period, the Remuneration Committee used discretions available to it under the rules of the DSBP to determine a that the strike price used to calculate the number of shares comprised in the award should be the closing mid-market quote of 730p for the Companys shares on 26 February 2015 and b that the Normal Vesting Date should be 27 February 2017: in each case this would have been the case if this award had been made as originally intended and at the first opportunity.
The strike price was used to determine theface value in the table below.

As outlined in the 2014 Directors remuneration report, Sean Wilkins stepped down from the Board and ceased to be an employee of the Company on 20 January 2015, at which point his outstanding share awards lapsed in full.
Throughout Paul Doughtys service as an Executive Director, the Company was in a prohibited period relating to the German transaction, which prevented any LTIP awards being granted to him.
Dominos Pizza Group plc 58 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Details of variable pay earned in the year continued Dilution limits The Company operates within best practice guidelines published by the Investment Association.
These broadly provide that where new-issue shares are used to satisfy awards made under employee share schemes, the aggregate number of shares placed under award disregarding any awards which have lapsed across all such schemes operated by the Company should not exceed 10% of the Companys issued share capital in any 10-year rolling period.
Termination payments audited Sean Wilkins left the Company on 20 January 2015 and received a termination payment, as explained in the 2014 Directors remuneration report.
Michael Shallow retired from the Board on 31 July 2015.
As a Non-executive Director, he was not employed and no termination payments were made to him.
Shortly after the year-end, Paul Doughty resigned as an Executive Director and ceased to be an employee of the Company, both on 31 December 2015.
He had been paid up to that date and no further payments were or are due to him.
As explained elsewhere in this report, he was not eligible for a 2015 bonus payment and had not been granted any LTIP awards.
Directors shareholdings audited To reinforce the linkage between senior executives and shareholders, the Company has adopted a shareholding policy that applies to Executive Directors under its long-term incentive arrangements.
The Executive Directors are required to retain sufficient shares from the vesting of awards to build up and retain a personal shareholding worth an equivalent of a minimum of 150% of their base salary.
It is expected that the required shareholding will be built up over a maximum of five years.
The Committee has discretion to waive the shareholding requirement in exceptional circumstances.
Once attained, a subsequent fall below the required level may be taken into account by the Committee when determining the grant of future awards.
The Committee has decided that awards made under the DSBP shall count assuming the sale of sufficient shares to fund the employees tax andNIobligations towards this target.

David Wild assumed the position of Interim CEO on 31 January 2014 and his appointment as the Groups CEO was formally confirmed on 30 April 2014.
For comparative purposes the total remuneration shown for the year ended 28 December 2014 includes remuneration received in both roles.
Given that the CEO was appointed in the 2014 financial year, he did not have any long-term incentive awards vesting based on performance periods ending during the 2015 financial year.
The first LTIP awards were granted to him in 2014 and these are expected to vest in the 2017 financial year.
Total shareholder return The graph below illustrates the Companys TSR performance over the seven financial years to 27 December 2015, plotted against the TSR performance of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts over the same period.
TSR reflects movements in the share price, adjusted for capital events and assuming all dividends are reinvested on the ex-dividend date.
The FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts has been selected for this comparison because i this is the index in which the Companys shares have been quoted since admission to the Official List and ii it forms the comparator group for the TSR performance condition used in the Groups 2012 LTIP.
The graph shows the value, at 27 December 2015, of 100 invested in the Company on 28 December 2008 compared with the value of 100 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 28 December 27 December 26 December 25 December 30 December 29 December 28 December 27 December 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Dominos Pizza Group plc FTSE 250 excl.

Dominos Pizza Group plc 60 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Total shareholder return rebased STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Details of variable pay earned in the year continued Percentage increase in the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer 2015 % Chief Executive Officer Salary 2.0 Benefits 40.0 Bonus 128.0 Average employee on a per capita basis Salary 0.1 Benefits 0.1 Bonus 29.8 The table above shows the percentage change in salary, benefits and annual bonus for the Chief Executive Officer between the current and previous financial year, and compares this to the equivalent year-on-year changes averaged across all Group employees and expressed on a per capita basis, which includes the impact of a 15% increase in headcount during the year.
Pay for Group employees includes material proportions paid in Euros and Swiss Francs, and the translation into Pounds for the purposes of this year-on-year comparison includes exchange effects.
The apparent increase in the value of David Wilds benefits year-on-year is skewed as he did not receive normal contractual benefits for the whole of2014 since he served as Interim CEO for four months of that year.
The year-on-year change in David Wilds bonus reflects the fact that the Companys profit performance in 2014 fell short of target, whereas in 2015 it exceeded the maximum level specified in the bonus plan.
Relative importance of spend on pay 2014 2015 restated where necessary % change Staff costs m 39.3 34.9 12.6 of which Directors pay m 2.2 2.3 4.3 Dividends and share buybacks m 31.0 29.7 4.3 Underlying PBT m 73.2 62.1 17.9 Underlying PBT was chosen as a comparator as it reflects the profit generated by the Groups continuing operations, virtually the whole of which leads to cash generation.
This therefore creates the opportunity for the Board to reinvest in the Groups business, or make distributions to shareholders, or both.
It is the same comparator as used in prior years remuneration reports.
