Service performance was also high in some areas for networks customers.
SSE performed well across Ofgems Broad Measures of Community Satisfaction, with improvement to customer satisfaction, significant improvement to complaints performance and its best ever performance with regard to customer interruptions.
There are, however, improvements to be made in certain parts of the networks business and this was taken into account in the final out-turn decision.

Benefits Benefits are provided at an appropriate level taking into account market practice at similar sized companies and the level of benefits provided for other employees in the Group.
Core benefits include car allowance, private medical insurance and health screening.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Companys all-employee share schemes on the same terms as other employees: - The Sharesave Scheme which allows employees options to acquire shares using the proceeds of a monthly savings contract of up to 500 per month.
Exercise of the options is not subject to satisfaction of any performance target.
The option price is set at a discount maximum of 20% to market value.
- The Share Incentive Plan the SIP which allows employees to allocate part of their pre-tax salary to purchase shares up to a maximum of 150 per month.
Participants receive two free matching shares monthly for each share purchased up to a maximum of six free shares.
- The long service award scheme which purchases 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 shares on behalf of an employee on the occasion of the employee reaching 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years service respectively with the Group.
Pension In common with all members of the pension schemes who joined at the same time as the Executive Directors, the following provisions relating to leaving the Company apply: for retirement through ill-health an unreduced pension based on service to expected retirement is paid: in the event of any reorganisation or redundancy an unreduced accrued pension is paid to a member who is aged 50 or above, with at least five years service or, for a member who has not yet reached that age, it will be payable with effect from 50: and from the age of 55, a scheme member is entitled to leave the Company and receive a pension, reduced for early payment, unless the Company gives consent and funds this pension being paid on an unreduced basis.
The Executive Directors are members of either the Southern Electric Pension Scheme or the Scottish Hydro-Electric Pension Scheme and their plan membership predates their Board appointments.
These are both funded final salary pension schemes and the terms of these schemes apply equally to all members.
The Directors service contracts provide for a possible maximum pension of two thirds final salary from the age of 60.
In relation to Executive Directors who are subject to the scheme-specific salary cap which mirrors the provisions of the previous HMRC cap arrangements the Company provides top-up unfunded arrangements which are designed to provide an equivalent pension on retirement from the age of 60 to that which they would have earned if they had not been subject to the salary cap.
There are no arrangements to compensate members for any change in their personal tax liability.
Dependent on the circumstances surrounding the departure of the Executive Director and financial health of the Company at the time, the Committees policy is to give consideration to a cash commutation of the unfunded unapproved retirement benefit UURB pension at the time of leaving.
Any cash commutation would limit SSEs liability, taking into account valuations provided by independent actuarial advisors, and would be undertaken on what was judged to be a cost neutral basis to SSE.
Directors pension information Accrued pension as at Accrued pension as at 31 March 2015 31 March 2014 000s 000s Alistair Phillips-Davies 329 272 Gregor Alexander 316 290 Payment to former Executive Director Colin Hood, former Chief Operating Officer, left SSE in October 2011.
His terms of employment provided for a pension via two schemes: the Southern Electric Pension Scheme SEPS and an Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme UURBS.
As previously disclosed, Colin Hood could request that the Committee consider a cash commutation of the portion of his pension provided through the UURBS when he reached the age of 60.
Having recently reached this age, the Committee was asked to consider whether it wished to approve a payment.
In line with Company policy, in considering this request the Committee took into account the financial health of the Company and agreed a commuted payment of 2.15m 1.1m net of tax and NI.
This payment is considered to be cost neutral to SSE based on account valuations provided by independent actuarial advisors.
Statement of implementation for 2015 16 This section provides an overview of how the Committee intends to operate the approved Remuneration Policy for 2015 16.
Salary The Committee reviewed salary levels for Executive Directors, taking into account a number of factors including individual performance and market data.
Effective from 1 April 2015, the two executive directors will receive a salary increase of 2.4%, which is in line with the average performance-based salary increases for the wider SSE employee population.
This will move the Chief Executive to 824,320 and the Finance Director to 637,133.
Benefits There are no changes proposed to our benefits framework for 2015 16.
More information on the benefits offered can be found in the Policy Report.
Pension Participation in SSEs funded final salary pension schemes and unfunded pension arrangements.
Annual Incentive Plan The maximum AIP opportunity for Executive Directors will remain at 100% of salary for 2015 16.
Following the changes we made to the AIP framework for 2014 15, the Committee considers that this structure remains appropriate for the business for 2015 16.
As such, the performance measures against which the Executive Directors performance will be evaluated for the purposes of the 2015 16 AIP remain as below: Performance measure Weighting Adjusted PBT 30% Growth in DPS 10% Cash-flow 10% Customer 15% Team-working 20% Personal 15% PSP The maximum PSP opportunity for Executive Directors will remain at 150% of salary for 2015 16.
We are retaining the same performance framework as was used for the awards made last year, as below: Performance measure Weighting Relative TSR against FTSE 100 All equally weighted Relative TSR against European Utilities 20% each EPS Growth in DPS versus RPI Customer service Consumer Futures ranking Awards made to Executive Directors will have a two-year holding period following the end of the three-year performance period.
103 Directors Report Annual Remuneration Report 2014 15 continued Recovery Provisions In accordance with the revised UK Corporate Governance Code the Committee gave consideration to its existing malus provisions and how to structure new clawback provisions.
The Committee believed that it is right that it should have the ability to recover pay in circumstances where that pay is later proved to have been unfairly earned.
It explored the potential circumstances to which each provision should apply and the applicable timescales.
As a result, the PSP and AIP will now have the following recovery provisions: Malus Clawback What is it?
Ability to reduce or cancel unvested deferred Ability to take back value delivered through AIP and PSP share awards the cash element of the AIP or vested PSP awards Circumstances to which each provision - Material misstatement or restatement of - Material misstatement or restatement would apply accounts current of accounts new - Misconduct which results in a materially - Serious misconduct new adverse financial effect current - Factual error in calculating payment - Serious reputational damage including material vesting new environmental or safety issue, or material operational or business failing current - Factual error in calculating payment vesting new - Serious misconduct new Plans impacted AIP deferred shares and PSP Cash AIP and PSP Applicable time period At any point between the grant date and vesting At any point: date a three-year period - Up to three years post-payment of cash under the AIP: and - Up to three years post-vesting of PSP shares When do new provisions apply First applies to any deferred shares granted in First applies to payments in respect of the 2015 16 2016 and to PSP awards granted in 2015 AIP and PSP awards granted in 2015 Personal Shareholding Policy The Committee agreed that the level of SSE shares to be held by Executive Directors should be increased from 100% of base salary to 200%.
The Committee believed that this increase was more aligned to shareholder expectations.
It is notable that both current Executive Directors have shareholdings above this level at present.

Source: Datastream The FTSE 100 Index is used as a comparator to SSE as the Company has been a member of the FTSE 100 during the period of comparison.
Chief Executive pay progression comparison The table below shows the percentage change in the Chief Executives base salary, benefits and AIP between 2014 and 2015 compared with the percentage change in the average of all employees: % change in remuneration from 2013 14 to 2014 15 % change in % change in % change in base salary benefits annual incentive Chief Executive 14.7% 8.3% 13.7% All Employees 2.42% -15.9% 1.8% Notes The Chief Executive base salary is calculated on the same basis as the single figure table on page 100.
The 14.7% reflects the Chief Executives promotion into the new role.
The all-employee base salary change is based on comparing the change in the average basic salary increase at April 2014 and April 2015.
The Chief Executive change in benefits is calculated on the same basis as the single figure table on page 100.
The increase of 8.3% is largely down to a higher value in Share Incentive Plan matching shares.
The all-employee change in benefits is based on P11D data from 2014 and 2015.
The reduction of 15.9% is related to a decrease in private medical costs.
The Chief Executive annual incentive is calculated on the same basis as the single figure table on page 100.
The 13.7% increase represents a higher outturn in 2015 from the increase-based salary.
The all-employee change in annual incentive reflects the average out-turn for all eligible employees in 2014 and 2015.
The increase in value of 1.8% is due to higher performance out-turns in 2014 15.
