OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT INTRODUCTION FROM THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN I am pleased to introduce our Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2015.
In challenging trading conditions, including macroeconomic difficulties for developing markets, disruption to the UK pension market and soft premium rates for major risks, I have set out the Committees major activities and decisions for 2015 and the year ahead.
As always, the Committee is well aware of the interest among JLTs stakeholders in executive remuneration and has sought to ensure that the remuneration policies and practices at JLT drive RICHARD HARVEY the right behaviours that are in the long term interests of both the Company and its shareholders.
"KEY PRINCIPLES ""The Committee is Our remuneration policies continue to be based on the following key principles: mindful of the fact that Simple, consistent and transparent."
"our business operates Achieving a balance between pay and performance, such that: in a highly competitive fixed pay remains at an appropriate level when considered against the highly competitive global market place, ensuring we are able to attract and retain high calibre staff: and global market. """
variable pay and incentives provide a strong and demonstrable link between the performance of the Company and its Executive Directors and senior management team remuneration.
The Committee believes this philosophy provides a direct incentive for our people to create longterm sustainable value for our shareholders.
Share awards continue to be an essential tool in aligning the interests of staff with those of shareholders.
In setting remuneration levels, the Committee is mindful of the fact that our business operates in a highly competitive global market.
The Committee takes into account appropriate remuneration data relevant to UK public companies of a similar size and complexity but also recognises that there are no directly comparable UK companies and that its principal international competitors are often businesses which are part of much larger groups, primarily in the US.
OUR REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK Based on these principles, the key elements of our remuneration framework are embedded in our Remuneration Policy Policy, which was approved by shareholders in 2014 and continue to be: Salary Market competitive Benefits & Appropriate for the nature and location of the role pension Pension contributions at a relatively low level compared to the market, to reflect our focus on performance-related reward Bonus Linked to challenging profit and individual performance targets Target 100% of salary 150% for CEO Maximum 200% of salary Enables us to be competitive in the market, particularly in the insurance industry, to retain and incentivise key executives to deliver performance for shareholders Deferral mechanism ensures alignment with long term shareholder returns LTIP Shares vest after three years based on the delivery of stretching EPS growth targets.

The Committee I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee for their believes this target range is appropriately stretching in the current continued support during the past year.
The Committee has also agreed to extend the treatment of smoothing US investment costs for the purposes of calculating EPS for LTIP performance.
In preparation for the review of the Policy, to be approved by shareholders in 2017, and in light of the changing shape of the organisation and the evolving trends in executive pay, the Committee will review the remuneration strategy for Executive Richard Harvey Directors during 2016.
Chairman, Remuneration Committee 1 March 2016 The Committee is aware that some shareholders and investor bodies have a preference for vesting periods which are longer than the conventional three years.
The Committee has considered this and continues to believe that in a broking business, three years remains appropriate to be market competitive and consistent with our business cycle.
However, this will be considered during the review.
