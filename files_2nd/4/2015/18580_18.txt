How the Bonuses for 2015 were Calculated The 2015 bonuses for Executive Directors were calculated by reference to performance against a challenging sliding scale of profit, cash debt and personal targets.

Genus plcAnnual Report 2015 70 Directors Remuneration Report continued Section D: Annual Report on Remuneration continued How the Long-term Incentive Figure was Calculated in The Single Total Remuneration Table Karim Bitars PSP award granted on 7 December 2012 and Stephen Wilsons PSP award granted on 28 February 2013 wereboth subject to an EPS performance condition, based on the growth in EPS from a base year of 2012 compared to theEPS in 2015.
These awards were granted under our former policy.
The performance targets were as follows in relation totheawards: Tier 1 The range of targets applicable to awards with a value of 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary to the Group Finance Director were as follows: 1 2 Per annum growth in adjusted EPS % of award vesting RPI 4% Nil RPI 4% 30% RPI 11% 100% Tier 2 The range of targets applying to an additional award with a value of 75% of salary were as follows: 1 3 Per annum growth in adjusted EPS % of award vesting RPI 9% Nil RPI 9% 10% RPI 10% 20% RPI 11% 35% RPI 20% 100% 1 Growth in adjusted EPS over the three-year performance period will be computed based on a simple average annual growth rate.
2 From RPI 4%, a linear scale of 10% vesting per % increase in adjusted EPS was applied.
3 From RPI 11%, a linear scale of 7% vesting per % increase in adjusted EPS was applied.
The adjusted 2015 EPS after the cost of share-based payments was 55.1 pence per share.
The comparable base 2012 adjusted EPS figure after the cost of share-based payments and with the effect on pension interest of the exceptional provision in respect of the Milk Pension Fund recognised in that year was 44.7 pence.
This represents a three-year growth rate of 23.2%.
RPI over the three-year period was 7.6%.
As a consequence the average annual growth in EPS was RPI 5.2%.
By applying the performance condition calibration, the resulting level of vesting is 25.6% for Karim Bitar and 23.4% for Stephen Wilson.
Karim Bitars award was over a maximum of 75,420 shares, so the actual level of vesting is 19,307 shares and these will vest on 8 December 2015.
Stephen Wilsons award was over a maximum of 43,063 shares, so the actual level of vesting is 10,076 shares and these will vest on 29 February 2016.
The Companys share price on 30 June 2015 was 1,427 pence, meaning that the value of Karim Bitars award was 275,511 and Stephen Wilsons award was worth 143,785.
Material Contracts There have been no other contracts or arrangements during the financial year in which a Director of the Company was materially interested and or which were significant in relation to the Groups business.
Payments for Loss of Office and Payments to Former Directors Audited There were no payments for loss of office in the year.
Executive Directors External Appointments Executive Directors are permitted to accept an external non-executive position with the Boards approval.
Any fees received in respect of these appointments may be retained by the Executive.
Stephen Wilson received 50,000 in relation to his Non-Executive Directorship at Xchanging plc for the year to 31 December 2014.
What the Executive Directors can earn in 2016 A summary of this chapter is given on page 66.
Base Salary The Committee reviews the Executive Directors base salaries prior to each financial year, taking into account factors such as individual and corporate performance, an assessment of market conditions and, most importantly, the salary increases applicable to the Groups other UK employees.
The Executive Directors current salary levels with effect from 1 July 2015 are as follows: Karim Bitar: 537,367 2% increase from 2015 : and Stephen Wilson: 364,140 2% increase from 2015.
The Committee determined that salaries would be increased by 2%, reflecting the average increase awarded across the UK employee population.
It did not refer to other market benchmarking data this year when making this decision.
Genus plcAnnual Report 2015 STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL 71 REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS INFORMATION Benefits The Executive Directors will receive the following benefits-in-kind, namely a car allowance, life assurance, an annual medical screen and private medical insurance.
Pension In lieu of company pension contributions, the Company pays Karim Bitar and Stephen Wilson a taxable pension allowance of 25% and 15% of basic salary per annum respectively.
Performance-Related Annual Bonus Consistent with the approved remuneration policy and past practice, the Company bonus scheme for the 2016 financial year for the Executive Directors is: On-target value of bonus 62.5% of salary.
Performance measures Adjusted profit before tax 60% weighting.
Calibration of profit target No bonus is payable unless the prior years result is exceeded.
Thereafter, the bonus is determined on the following basis: Pay out Percentage of 1 Growth on prior year Adjusted PBT profit element salary awarded 0% 0% 0% 10% per annum delivers 50% 37.5% 15% per annum 100% 75% Straight-line pay out between performance points.
Calibration of cash generation target The cash target is the budgeted figure, with a specific range of 3m below the target and 3m above.
Specific numbers were set rather than a percentage range to ensure the executives were focused on actual cash generation.
Calibration of non-financial Non-financial strategic targets are linked to successful implementation of the Companys strategictargets strategy, with the targets being both quantifiable and stretching.
Achievement of these targets is central to unlocking the Groups growth potential and as such it would be commercially sensitive to disclose them in advance.
We will disclose retrospective performance against the strategic targets as we have done on page 69.
Bonus deferral 25% of any bonus will be deferred by way of shares for three years and will vest subject to continued employment, other than in certain good leaver circumstances.
Malus and clawback The Committee can apply malus to deferred bonuses and claw back any element of paid bonuses that should not have been awarded or paid, in the event of a material misstatement of the Groups annual results.
Long-Term Incentives At last years AGM, shareholders approved a new 2014 PSP.
This will be used in the manner set out in the Notice of 2014 AGM to grant awards in 2015 in line with the approved policy.
The Chief Executive will be granted an award over shares worth 200% of salary and the Group Finance Director will be granted an award over shares worth 175% of salary.
These awards are in line with those in 2014.
The performance targets for the awards to be granted in 2015 will primarily relate to average annual growth in adjusted EPS, measured over three years.
The range of targets for the 2015 awards is as follows: Vesting 1 Average Annual Growth in Adjusted EPS % award Less than 6% per annum 0% 6% per annum 20% 20% per annum 100% Straight-line vesting between performance points 1 Growth in adjusted EPS over the three-year performance period will be calculated on a simple average annual growth rate after the cost of share-based payments.
Genus plcAnnual Report 2015 72 Directors Remuneration Report continued Section D: Annual Report on Remuneration continued The Committee remains convinced that using adjusted EPS is the correct approach, for the reasons set out in the Performance and Remuneration Statement above.
The Committee believes the above targets are appropriately challenging.
They incentivise Executives to deliver the Companys growth strategy and are therefore aligned with shareholders interests.
They also adhere to the principles of transparency and simplicity to maximise the incentive provided to participants by the PSP.
As with awards currently granted under the PSP, the Committee will retain the ability to scale back vesting based on EPS performance if it does not consider the vesting result to be consistent with the progress achieved against the Companys strategy during the performance period.
This is considered appropriate, to broaden the executive teams focus beyond financial performance.
Another key feature of the 2015 PSP awards will be the requirement to retain the after tax number of shares vesting in 2018 for two years.
Clawback and malus provisions may be applied at the Committees discretion if the Companys results are found to have been misstated within three years of vesting.
The process that the Committee followed to arrive at these decisions The Companys Committee complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on remuneration for the Executive Directors and other members of GELT.
The Committees full terms of reference are available on the Companys website at www.

The Group HR Director facilitates this process, presenting to the Committee the pay structures across the organisation and how they fit the Groups remuneration policy.
The process includes an annual staff engagement survey that includes questions on pay, as well as consulting employees informally on their views of the current overall remuneration policy.
This forms part of the feedback provided to the Committee and is used by the Group HR Director to assess the policys ongoing effectiveness and the changes that should be made.
When setting the Executive Directors base salaries, the Committee compares the salary increases proposed for each Executive Director within those proposed for employees in their geographical location, as well as considering the typical increase proposed across the Group as a whole.
