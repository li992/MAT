70 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Base salary Salaries are reviewed annually and typically take effect from 1 April each year.
The quantum of executive total remuneration was reviewed against four comparator groups: retailers, distributors, companies of a similar market cap, and companies with similar revenues.
Salaries for 2016 were determined taking into account this benchmarking data, as well as the other factors detailed in the policy table.
The salaries for 2014, 2015 and 2016 are set out below, together with the average increases across the Group.
Name 1 April 2014 1 April 2015 1 April 2016 Stefan Bomhard n a 650,000 700,000 7.6% increase Richard Howes n a n a 405,000 Average increase across Group 2.9% 2.1% 3.4% The Committee considered carefully the salary positioning of Stefan Bomhard, who joined the Company on a base salary that was c. 20% below that of the previous Group Chief Executive.
It is the view of the Committee that Stefan has had a very successful year and, as such, the Committee feels it is appropriate to increase his salary by 7.6%.
This increase is within the range of increases offered to other employees and moves his total package closer albeit not all the way to median.
The salary increase will not affect the number of PSP shares granted in 2016 which, consistent with our policy, is currently xed at 159,705 shares.
Chairmans and Non-Executive Directors fees The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors fees were reviewed in 2015.
The Chairmans fee was increased from 300,000 to 320,000 p. a. and the Non-Executive Directors fees were increased from 55,000 to 60,000 p. a.
An additional 15,000 p. a. is payable for the Chairmanship of the Remuneration and Audit Committees.
The Chairman of the CR Committee receives an additional 10,000 p. a.
The fee for the Senior Independent Director was increased from 76,000 to 81,000 p. a.
All changes were with effect from 1 December 2015.
The Non-Executive Directors fees are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they remain appropriate.
Pension During the year, the Executive Directors received a cash supplement of 30% of base salary in lieu of pension contributions, and were eligible to join the Cash scheme.
For 2016, this arrangement remains unchanged for Stefan Bomhard, and for John McConnell until his departure date.
Richard Howes, the new Chief Financial officer, will receive a cash supplement of 30% of base salary in lieu of pension contribution and will be eligible to join the Cash scheme.
On 31 December 2012, the Group closed the UK final salary pension plan to future accrual.

com 71 DIRECTORS REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED Annual bonus In line with the Committees commitment to disclose bonus targets, the tables below illustrate targets, performance and resulting bonus outcome for the Executive Directors at the time for the 2013, 2014 and 2015 bonuses.
Further detail on the 2015 bonus performance matrix can be found in the 2014 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Executive Directors annual bonuses are assessed against a financial performance matrix of revenue and operating profit targets and an NPS multiplier.
This matrix is designed to reward stretching financial performance, while maintaining exceptional customer service.
NPS is the Groups primary measure of customer satisfaction, used to gauge the strength and loyalty of our customer relationships.
The annual bonus is reduced if NPS falls below benchmark but is not increased for achieving or beating benchmark.
The benchmark is established each year based on the Boards assessment of what constitutes excellence in customer service.
The tables below illustrate performance against the bonus targets for 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Actual performance for determining bonus outcomes has been calculated using the same currency rates as used to set the bonus targets.
This ensures that bonus outcomes are linked to, and reward for, underlying financial performance.
Annual Bonus for 2016 The maximum annual bonus opportunity in 2016 will remain unchanged from previous years and will be 150% of salary.
The bonus for the new Chief Financial officer will be pro-rated to reect the proportion of the year served.
