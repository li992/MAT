GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT STATEMENT BY CHAIR OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE This report is divided into two main sections: The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out the details of how our remuneration policy was implemented for the year ended 31 March 2015.
The Directors Remuneration Policy Report contains details of the remuneration policy that was approved at the 2014 annual general meeting, and remains unchanged.
The report complies with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 and also the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The remuneration committee, whose membership and responsibilities are set out on page 27 of this report, strives to ensure that executive directors remuneration is aligned with the interests of shareholders.
The remuneration committee believes that shareholders interests are best served by focussing a greater proportion of total potential remuneration on compensation which varies with performance.
Short and long-term incentives are structured to reward executives for enhancing shareholder value.
The value received by executive directors under the share incentive arrangements depends on the degree to which the associated performance conditions are satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share price of the company at that time.
This ensures that substantial rewards are received only when substantial value has been created for shareholders.
As discussed in last years report, the committee undertook a comprehensive review of PayPoints remuneration last year, with the following objectives: motivate senior management to maximise economic value for shareholders: comply with new regulatory and governance requirements: respond to shareholder feedback: and ensure no increase in cost to the company.
Following this review, we proposed several changes to our remuneration policy intended to simplify our incentive structure, closely align it with our business strategy, and take account of evolving market practice and the latest institutional shareholder guidelines.
The new policy received a 97.7% vote in favour and is working well in its first year of operation.
Bonuses for the year under review were 88.1% of maximum, reflecting growth in economic profit of 11.7%, with 25% deferred into shares vesting after three years subject to continued employment.
Based on our three year earnings per share growth to 31 March 2015 of 44.7%, the 2012 DSB awards will vest in full.
2012 LTIP awards will be performance-tested in May 2015, and based on TSR performance to date relative to FTSE 250 index constituents excluding investment trusts, we expect these awards to lapse.
During the year, the committee reviewed the remuneration policy and concluded that it continues to be appropriate.
For 2015 16, executive director salaries were reviewed in line with the shareholder-approved salary policy.
The Chief Executives salary has been increased by 5%, to bring it in line with the market, while the salaries for the Finance Director and Business Development Director have been increased by 2.5% in line with increases for the general employee population.
Pensions for the Finance Director and Business Development Director have been increased from 14% to 15% of salary.
The proposed LTIP award and bonus opportunity for 2015 16 is unchanged from last year, as are the performance measures.
The current financial year is the first year that awards will be granted under the DABS, in respect of the bonus for the year under review, which was approved by shareholders at the last annual general meeting.
Our current policy contains provisions for malus on DABS and LTIP awards.
The committee notes the requirement for clawback in the updated UK Corporate Governance Code and intends to review its approach to clawback as part of the next policy review.
At the annual general meeting in July 2015, the Annual Report on Remuneration will be put to an advisory vote.

Remuneration committee membership in 2014 2015 The remuneration committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for executive directors and senior managers and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors.
The committee members are all independent directors.
Neil Carson is Chairman of the committee, with Eric Anstee, Stephen Rowley and Nick Wiles as members.

26 PayPoint plc Annual Report 2015 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued The remuneration committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference which set out the full remit of the committee.
A copy of the terms of reference is available to shareholders by writing to the Company Secretary at the registered office.
The terms of reference are also available on the companys website at www.
The remuneration committee met four times during the year and all members were in attendance with the exception of Nick Wiles and Eric Anstee who were each unable to attend one meeting.
During the year, the committee sought internal support from the Chief Executive and Finance Director, who attended committee meetings by invitation from the Chairman, to advise on specific questions raised by the committee and on matters relating to the performance and remuneration of senior managers.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director were not present for any discussions that related directly to their own remuneration.
The Company Secretary attended each meeting as Secretary to the committee.
In undertaking its responsibilities, the committee seeks independent external advice as necessary.
To this end, for the year under review, the committee continued to retain the services of Kepler Associates as the principal external advisers to the committee.
The committee evaluates the support provided by its advisers annually and is comfortable that the Kepler team provides independent remuneration advice to the committee and do not have any connections with PayPoint that may impair their independence.
Kepler Associates is a founding member and signatory of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants, details of which can be found at www.
During the year, Kepler Associates provided independent advice on a wide range of remuneration matters including current market practice, benchmarking of executive pay, incentive design and remuneration reporting and provides no other services to the company.
The fees paid to Kepler Associates on the basis of time and materials in respect of work carried out for the year under review were 89,435.

PayPoint plc Annual Report 2015 35 Variable GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued Notes to the policy table Payments from previous awards The company will honour any commitments entered into prior to the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy as detailed in this report, and executive directors will be eligible to receive payment from any historical awards made.
This includes outstanding awards made under the 2009 LTIP and 2009 DSB Plan, as detailed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The differences between the 2009 LTIP and DSB and the plans in the policy table above are detailed below and in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
In 2014, the remuneration committee undertook a comprehensive review of executive incentive arrangements to simplify the long-term incentive structure and align it with the business strategy, to motivate senior management to maximise economic value for shareholders and to improve compliance with new regulatory and governance requirements.
As a result of the review, the following changes were made to the 2009 LTIP and DSB plans: The pay out at threshold in the annual bonus was reduced from 70% of to 25% of maximum to be in line with best practice.
The matching plan was removed, and a small offsetting increase made to the annual bonus and LTIP opportunities so that the fair value of long-term incentive awards would be broadly maintained.
The requirement to mandatorily defer 25% of the bonus into shares was maintained, but deferred shares were made subject to continued employment and clawback.
Under the LTIP, the level of vesting at threshold was reduced from 30% to 25% to be in line with best practice and unvested awards were made subject to clawback.
Use of discretion The remuneration committee may exercise discretion in two broad areas for each element of remuneration: To ensure fairness and align executive director remuneration with underlying individual and company performance, the committee may adjust upwards or downwards the outcome of any shortor long-term incentive plan payment within the limits of the relevant plan rules.
Any adjustments in light of corporate events will be made on a neutral basis, i. e. the intention of any adjustment will be that the event is not to the benefit or detriment of participants.
Adjustments to underlying performance may be made in exceptional circumstances to ensure outcomes are fair both to shareholders and participants.
In the case of a non-regular event occurring, the committee may apply its discretion to ensure fairness and seek alignment with business objectives.
Non-regular events in this context include, but are not limited to: corporate transactions, changes in the companys accounting policies, minor or administrative matters, internal promotions, external recruitment and terminations.
Any use of discretion by the committee during the financial year will be detailed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance measure selection Economic profit has been selected as the measure for the annual bonus plan, as it captures growth, returns and risk.
The use of a single measure provides simplicity and focus.
Economic profit is defined as operating profit after deducting the actual tax charge and a capital charge based on the weighted average cost of capital applied to the average capital employed.
The operating profit is the profit before any goodwill impairment, interest and tax.
Average capital employed is based on a 12 month average starting on 1 April including cumulative goodwill, but excluding net cash indebtedness.
At the sole discretion of the remuneration committee, exceptional items may be removed from operating profit where the inclusion of such items would be inconsistent with fair measurement, and actual tax may be adjusted to normalised rates if they are considered unsustainable.
Performance targets relating to the annual bonus plan are set from the companys annual budget, which is reviewed and signed off by the companys board prior to the start of each financial year.
Relative TSR has been selected as the measure for the LTIP as it is considered the best measure of long term performance for PayPoint, is directly aligned with shareholder interests and rewards management for outperformance of the companys peers.
The FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts is currently considered to be the most appropriate benchmark, being representative of PayPoints size and given PayPoints lack of listed sector peers.
TSR is calculated using the three month average share price preceding the start and end of the performance period.
The target for economic profit applying to the annual bonus is set annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points.
The target is set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular strategic priorities and economic environment in a given year.
Remuneration policy for other employees PayPoints approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the group, with consideration given to the level of experience, responsibility, individual performance and salary levels in comparable companies.
All UK employees are eligible to participate in the companys SIP and senior managers participate in the annual bonus scheme with the same measure at the appropriate business level as is set for the executive directors at group level, but each with personal targets in addition.
Senior managers c. 25 individuals are eligible to participate in the LTIP.
Performance conditions are consistent for all participants, while award sizes vary by organisational level.
36 PayPoint plc Annual Report 2015 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued Shareholding guidelines The committee recognises the importance of executive directors aligning their interests with shareholders through building up a significant shareholding in the company.
Shareholding guidelines are in place, which require executive directors to acquire a holding, equivalent to at least 100% of their salaries.
Executive directors are required to retain 50% of any LTIP and deferred bonus shares acquired on vesting net of tax until the guideline level is achieved.
Acquired holdings may be held by spouses or dependent family members.
Non-executive director remuneration The remuneration of the non-executive directors is within the limits set by the articles of association.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus plan or share incentive programme operated by the company and are not entitled to pension contributions or other benefits provided by the company.
Details of the policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below: Element and link Operation Opportunity Performance to strategy metrics Fees Fee levels are reviewed annually, with any Non-executive director fee increases are applied in Continued strong To attract and retain adjustments effective 1 April in the year line with the outcome of the annual fee review.

Pay scenario charts The charts below provide an illustration of the potential future reward opportunities for the executive directors, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: minimum, target and maximum.
Potential reward opportunities are based on PayPoints remuneration policy, applied to base salaries as at 1 April 2015.
For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance based on the maximum bonus opportunity under the current remuneration policy of 106% of salary.
For the LTIP, the award opportunities are based on LTIP awards under the current remuneration policy of 145% of salary for the Chief Executive and 125% of salary for other executive directors.
Note that LTIP awards granted in the year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value is based on the face value at award rather than vesting i. e. the scenarios exclude the impact of any share price movement over the period.

Where new appointees have initial basic salaries set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period of two to three years subject to the individuals development in the role.
Pension New appointees will receive contributions to personal pension plans in line with existing policy.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with existing policy.
SIP New appointees will be eligible to participate in the SIP in line with existing policy.
Annual bonus The structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant 150% of salary maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year.
Targets for the personal objectives element will be tailored to the executive.
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other 300% of salary executives, as described in the policy table.
The normal limit of 200% of salary will apply, save in exceptional circumstances when awards of up to 300% of salary may be made.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the remuneration committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both PayPoint and its shareholders.
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, the committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a different structure in order to facilitate the recruitment of an individual, exercising the discretion available under the relevant Listing Rule LR 9.4.
2 R to replace incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Such buyout awards would have a fair value no higher than that of the awards forfeited.
In doing so, the committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
Internal appointment In cases of appointing a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the remuneration committee and board will be consistent with the policy for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the board, the company will continue to honour these arrangements.
Non-executive directors In recruiting a new non-executive director, the remuneration committee will utilise the policy as set out in the table on page 37.
38 PayPoint plc Annual Report 2015 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued Service contracts and exit policy Executive directors Executive director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the committee.
In accordance with general market practice, each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract requiring 12 months notice of termination on either side.
Executive director service contracts are available to view at the companys registered office.
Details of the service contracts of the executive directors of the company are as follows: Name Company notice period Contract date D Taylor 12 months 13 September 2004 G Earle 12 months 30 September 2004 T Watkin-Rees 12 months 13 September 2004 There are no special provisions in service contracts relating to cessation of employment or change of control.
The policy on termination is that the company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations and executive directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
In addition, the remuneration committee ensures that there are no unjustified payments for failure.
Under normal circumstances, executive directors may receive termination payments in lieu of notice equal to pay and benefits for the length of their contractual notice period.
When considering exit payments, the committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and participants.
The table below summarises how the awards under the annual bonus and LTIP are typically treated in specific circumstances.
Whilst the committee retains overall discretion on determining good leaver status, it typically defines a good leaver in circumstances such as death, ill health, injury or disability, retirement with the companys consent, redundancy or any other reason that the committee determines.
Bad leavers include those leaving employment due to resignation or misconduct, and retirement without agreement of the company.
Final treatment is subject to the committees discretion: Event Timing vesting of award Calculation of vesting payment Annual bonus Good leaver Paid at the same time as continuing employees.

of performance conditions as at the effective date of change of control, and the award is pro-rated for the proportion of the vesting period served to the effective date of change of control unless the board decides otherwise.
Outstanding matching awards under the 2009 DSB Plan will be treated in the same way as awards under the LTIP.
Mandatorily deferred and voluntarily invested shares under this plan are simply held on trust for participants and therefore would be released immediately on cessation or a change of control.
PayPoint plc Annual Report 2015 39 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued Non-executive directors The non-executive directors do not have service contracts: rather, they have letters of appointment which are subject to a three year term.
Details of the terms of appointment of the non-executive directors are set out in the table below: Name Date of letter Unexpired term as at Date of appointment Notice period 31 March 2015 D Morrison 24 July 2013 481 days 10 August 2004 1 month E Anstee 24 July 2013 481 days 16 September 2008 1 month S Rowley 24 July 2013 481 days 16 September 2008 1 month 1 N Wiles 24 July 2013 481 days 22 October 2009 1 month 2 W Tucker 5 February 2014 677 days 5 February 2014 3 months N Carson 18 June 2014 844 days 23 July 2014 1 month 1.

However, in order to comply with the Code and as reported last year, all directors will be subject to annual re-election.
Non-executive directors letters of appointment are available to view at the companys registered office.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the company When making decisions on executive director remuneration, the committee considers pay and conditions across PayPoint.
In particular, it is anticipated that salary increases for senior executives will have regard to those of salaried employees as a whole.
Employee engagement surveys are carried out annually across the group, with questions which seek the employees views on these matters.
Participation in these surveys is generally in excess of 80% of all employees.
Consideration of shareholder views The remuneration committee maintains a regular dialogue with its major shareholders and when determining remuneration, takes into account the guidelines of investor bodies and shareholder views.
The committee continues to monitor trends and developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the structure of the executive remuneration remains appropriate and commits to undergo a shareholder consultation in advance of any material changes to remuneration policy.
This report covers the remuneration of all directors that served during the period.
This report has been approved by the remuneration committee.
