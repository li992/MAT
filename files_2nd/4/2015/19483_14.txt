Remuneration arrangements should be designed to provide executive directors with the opportunity to receive a share in the future growth and development of the Group which is regarded as fair by both other employees and shareholders.
This approach should allow the Company to attract and retain the dynamic, self-motivated individuals who are critical to the success of the business.
