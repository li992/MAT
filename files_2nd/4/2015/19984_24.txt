Malus and clawback The Company has been able to withhold payment of performance related remuneration since 2012.
These malus provisions have applied to the deferred element of the annual bonus, the LTIP and the LGU.
Following changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Committee has concluded that it is appropriate to introduce additional clawback provisions to each of these elements of performance related remuneration to enable the Company to recover sums paid for the financial year ending 31 March 2016.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015 Investor Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 96 Governance Remuneration report continued Annual remuneration report Annual bonus: 2014 15 performance against targets audited The Committees assessment of performance in the financial year ended 31 March 2015 is shown in table 5.
Table 5: Assessment of performance and bonus payout Component Overview of performance 2014 15 bonus targets Threshold Budgeted Stretch Actual Group profit Group profit after tax 74.8m 93.5m 96.4m 96.3m after tax 50% Payout level % of maximum 0% 50% 100% 98% For bonus purposes, the Committee believes that underlying profit after tax is a more representative measure of performance, removing certain items from the reported profit after tax of 85.7m 2014: 96.3m that may give a distorted view of performance.
Underlying profit after tax is determined by applying the Groups underlying effective tax rate of 20.1% 2014: 19.0% to its underlying profit before tax of 121.9m 2014: 106.4m.
The following items have been removed from the Groups reported profit before tax to determine underlying profit before tax: net profits on, and costs associated with, disposals of 0.4m 2014: 10.5m amortisation of acquired intangible assets of 6.9m 2014: 2.7m exceptional transaction costs of 4.4m 2014: nil impairment of goodwill 2.8m 2014: nil deferred acquisition payments on the HOE acquisition of 1.5m 2014: nil.
The Groups underlying profit after tax also includes the benefit of 1.1m of research and development expenditure credit RDEC following early adoption of new rules in the UK.
To ensure a consistent treatment with the basis of the budget and the stretch targets, the Committee removed the positive impact of RDEC when calculating the underlying profit after tax position for bonus purposes.
Consequently, the adjusted result of 96.3m 2014: 86.2m was slightly below the stretch target resulting in a payout of 98% 2014: 100% for this element of annual bonus.
In previous years the equivalent benefit from research and development expenditure was shown as a reduction in the effective tax rate.
2014 15 bonus targets Threshold Budgeted Stretch Actual Cash conversion Half year cash conversion 2.5% 3.0% 12.5% 34.5% 25% Full year cash conversion 52.4% 65.5% 71.3% 102.3% Payout level % of maximum 0% 50% 100% 100% The cash conversion target measures operating cash flow as a percentage of budgeted profit.
The Groups cash performance was strong.
Operating cash flow was 133.9m 2014: 95.5m with half year and full year cash conversion results of 34.5% and 102.3% respectively.
This resulted in both the half year and full year stretch conversion targets 12.5% and 71.3% respectively being exceeded, leading to the maximum 100% payment 2014: 100% for this element of the bonus.
Personal James Cullens objectives 25% Payment of 85% achieved for: delivering an updated people strategy and HR plan delivering a senior succession plan for the Group and revised succession planning process developing a new short-term incentive arrangement for executives outside the top 50 most senior roles in the Group completing a successful handover from Alun Griffiths.
Heath Drewett Payment of 85% achieved for: developing new opportunities to accelerate EPS growth over the medium term negotiating an agreement with the trustee of the Atkins Pension Plan for a joint investment strategy in advance of the next triennial valuation in March 2016 creating a new financial and major project reporting framework.
Alun Griffiths Payment of 100% achieved for: completing a successful handover to James Cullens HR leadership team succession planning delivering a senior succession plan for the Group.
Uwe Krueger Payment of 90% achieved for: developing new opportunities to accelerate EPS growth over the medium term strengthening the senior leadership team, including the promotion and development of key talent within the Group working effectively with both the incoming and outgoing Group HR directors to develop a new succession plan.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015 Governance 97 Remuneration report continued Annual remuneration report Annual bonuses payable to the executive directors for the financial year ended 31 March 2015 are shown in table 6.
Two thirds of the payment to current directors will be payable in cash and one third will be deferred into shares for three years via the DSP, subject to continued employment and malus provisions.
James Cullens was appointed to the Company on 1 July 2014.
His annual bonus relates to the period for which he held office.
Alun Griffiths retired from the Company on 30 July 2014.
As a consequence of his retirement following 28 years of service to the Group, his annual bonus for 2013 14 was, and his pro rata 2014 15 bonus payment will be, paid entirely in cash.
T o ensure a like for like comparison Alun Griffiths annualised bonus compares an equivalent full year bonus for the year ended 31 March 2015 240,570 with the full year bonus paid to him for the year ended 31 March 2014.
Annual bonus: 2015 16 performance targets The Committee has determined that the bonus for the year ending 31 March 2016 will operate on similar terms to 2014 15.
50% of the bonus will be based on Group profit after tax performance with a further 25% based on a cash conversion measure.
50% of the maximum will be paid for meeting the budgeted profit after tax and cash conversion targets and 100% for meeting the stretch targets.
The profit after tax and cash conversion targets are considered commercially sensitive so will not be disclosed in advance, although the Committees assessment of performance against these targets will be confirmed in next years report.
The remaining 25% will be based on individual objectives aligned to key strategic areas for each executive director.
Table 7 provides the headline strategic areas under which personal performance targets have been set.
The performance targets which apply to these areas are measurable, challenging and subject to rigorous review by the Committee at the time they are set, during the year and at the year end when performance is assessed.
Subject to commercial sensitivity, we intend to provide an overview of the Committees assessment of performance against the underlying targets in next years report.

The EPS performance targets and vesting levels are set out in table 8.
The Committee adjusted the underlying diluted EPS as at 31 March 2012 as a consequence of the introduction of changes to IAS 19 to ensure that the underlying diluted EPS was measured consistently during the performance period and to facilitate a like for like comparison.
This adjustment reduced the underlying diluted EPS as at 31 March 2012 from 79.0p to 73.5p.
In determining the underlying diluted EPS as at 31 March 2015, the Committee considered the beneficial impact of RDEC and those same items that could give a distorted view of performance as were considered for the purposes of bonus calculations.
In all cases its treatment was consistent with that applied in relation to the bonus, including removing the positive impact of RDEC.
These adjustments increased the underlying diluted EPS as at 31 March 2015 from 85.4p to 96.0p.
Accordingly, the actual vesting percentage for the LTIP awards granted in 2012 is 70%.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015 Investor Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 98 Governance Remuneration report continued Annual remuneration report In determining the LTIP outcome the Committee concluded that: cash conversion over the performance period had been suitably underpinned by cash generation there were no significant acquisitions in the performance period for which it was necessary to adjust vesting inflation during the performance period has not had a significant effect on the level of challenge presented by the targets it was not appropriate to apply malus provisions.

LTIP, LGU and DSP awards in 2014 15 The current long-term incentive framework is built around two performance measures, both of which are fundamentally aligned to the creation of shareholder value, as illustrated in figure 2: Growth in EPS.
The primary metric for measuring the delivery of our growth objective over the medium to long term.
It is incorporated into the long-term incentive framework via the LTIP, which is our primary long-term incentive vehicle, reflecting the importance of EPS growth to our strategy Sustained growth in the share price.
This ensures alignment between executive reward and sustained share price growth over the long term, representing the ultimate measure of performance for our shareholders, and is incorporated into the long-term incentive framework via the LGU.
Figure 2: Long-term incentive framework Performance measure EPS Share price growth Delivery mechanism LTIP LGU Vesting period 3 years 4, 5 and 6 years Executive directors received a LTIP award of 75% of salary.
The vesting of these awards is subject to the EPS targets described in table 9.
Table 9: LTIP performance measure for awards made in 2014 Atkins EPS growth % of award that vests 12% or greater per annum 100 Between 5% and 12% per annum Pro rata between 25 and 100 on a straight line basis 5% per annum 25 Below 5% per annum 0 The Committee believes that these EPS targets are appropriate and stretching in the current environment.
Performance against these targets will be measured from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2017.
Executive directors also received a LGU award of 50% of salary.
The vesting of each tranche of this award is subject to the Committees assessment of the Groups progress against its strategy.
This will include: driving margins over the longer term above 8% reducing dependence on the UK with our long-term aspiration being to have more than 75% of our business outside the UK growing organically and through acquisition.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015 Governance 99 Remuneration report continued Annual remuneration report One third of annual bonuses payable to Uwe Kruger and Heath Drewett for the year ended 31 March 2014 was deferred via the Atkins Deferred Share Plan DSP.
LTIP, LGU and DSP awards are normally granted in June July each year.
However, it was not possible to grant share awards on the intended date of grant of 26 June 2014 due to the Company being in a prohibited period at that time.
Consequently the awards were granted on 17 November 2014, which was within the next available award window.
The Committee agreed that, in accordance with the rules and terms of the LTIP and DSP, the vesting date for these awards would be 26 June 2017 as originally intended.
However, the LGU awards will, in accordance with the rules and terms of this plan, vest on the fourth, fifth and sixth anniversaries of 17 November 2014 the date of grant as outlined in the policy table table 27.
LTIP, LGU and DSP awards made during the year are set out in table 10.
The LTIP awards have been granted in the form of nil-cost options.
The face value has been calculated using the middle market quotation for an Atkins ordinary share on 17 November 2014, the date of grant, which was 13.03.
The stated values exclude any amount attributable to dividend equivalents over the relevant performance period.
The LGU awards are granted in the form of units where the value of the LGU is dependent on sustained long-term share price growth.
The face value for the LGU awards has been calculated using the middle market quotation for an Atkins ordinary share during the six months immediately preceding the 17 November 2014 date of grant, which was 13.2835.
Given the value of the LGU is dependent on share price growth, the percentage of face value for stretch performance has been valued in a manner consistent with the guidance issued by the GC100 and Financial Reporting Lab, namely assuming units are worth 33% of their initial face value.
The target performance face value is assumed to be 50% of stretch performance face value.
T he DSP awards have been granted in the form of nil-cost options and represent the deferral of the annual bonus for the financial year ended 31 March 2014.
The face value has been calculated using the middle market quotation for an Atkins ordinary share on 26 June 2014, the intended date of grant, which was 13.06.
The stated values exclude any amount attributable to dividend equivalents.
LTIP and LGU awards to be made in 2015 16 The Committee intends to grant LTIP and LGU awards to Uwe Krueger, James Cullens and Heath Drewett on the same basis as the awards made in the financial year ended 31 March 2015.
The underlying diluted EPS for the year ended 31 March 2015 was 97.1p.
This figure, which includes the positive impact of RDEC, will be used to assess the extent to which the performance condition of the 2015 LTIP awards has been satisfied.
The Committee determined that no adjustment in respect of RDEC was required as all future financial results will be presented on a consistent basis.
The Company has been able to withhold payment of performance related remuneration since 2012.
All employee share plans All executive directors currently participate in the Atkins Share Incentive Plan SIP although James Cullens first SIP share purchase is not able to take place until after the date of this report purely for administrative reasons.
Alun Griffiths participated in the SIP until he retired on 30 July 2014.

Subject to performance criteria described in note 32 to the Financial Statements.
50% of the 2011 LTIP award was subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR condition and the remaining 50% subject to an EPS condition.
As disclosed in last years report and accounts, the TSR condition vested in full and the EPS condition, having been adjusted for the impact of the material IAS 19 accounting charge introduced in the final year of the performance period, was met in part which resulted in 68.7% of the awards vesting.
The awards granted under the terms of LTIP A, LTIP B and DSP are structured as options, for which the exercise price is nil.
LTIP B and DSP share awards are normally granted in June July each year.
However, it was not possible to grant share awards in June July 2014 due to being in a prohibited period at that time.

The award levels were originally determined with reference to a five month average share price 8.8249 instead of a six month average share price 8.6622 as outlined in the Directors remuneration policy table 27.
The amended award levels based on the six month average share price are shown in table 12.

Administrative powers under incentive plans Any awards made under legacy incentive plans prior to the approval of the Companys remuneration policy may be paid out subject to the terms of those plans as originally applied at grant or subsequently amended and the relevant performance conditions being achieved.
Administrative powers under incentive plans The policy table provides a summary of the incentive plans in the form required by the Regulations.
In addition to the operational features described, the Committee retains standard administrative powers such as inviting individuals to participate and determining the structure of an award and deciding whether or not to apply malus provisions.
These powers, as set out in the rules of the plans, will continue to apply.
Selection of performance measures and target setting The Committee has the flexibility to select performance measures and weightings and set targets annually to ensure continuing alignment with the strategic priorities of the Group.
Any significant departure from the current operation of the policy as set out in the annual remuneration report would be discussed in advance with our major shareholders.
In selecting performance measures the Committee takes into account the Groups strategic objectives and shortand long-term business priorities.
The performance measures selected incentivise and reward the delivery of stretching financial performance and the creation of shareholder value.
The performance targets chosen are set in accordance with the Groups operating plan and are reviewed annually to ensure they are sufficiently stretching.
In selecting the targets the Committee also takes into account analysts forecasts, economic conditions and the Committees expectation of performance over the relevant period.
Targets and actual performance in relation to them will be disclosed in the annual remuneration report provided that the Committee determines that the information is not considered commercially sensitive.
In practice it is anticipated that EBS targets will remain commercially sensitive and so a full description of actual performance and the Committees performance assessment will be disclosed only at such time as the Committee considers they are no longer commercially sensitive.
LTIP targets will be disclosed in the remuneration report prior to grant if determined at that time or, if not, in the first report following grant.
For LGU awards, a full explanation will be provided on vesting of the performance assessment in the context of the Groups strategic priorities over the period.
Share ownership guidelines The Companys shareholding guidelines seek to strengthen further the alignment of the executive directors with shareholders.
Executive directors are expected to build up a significant interest in the Companys shares equivalent to one times their individual salaries, based on the value of such shares at the time of their acquisition or their current market value, whichever is the higher.
Shares that count towards this guideline include those held by the executive directors spouse and or dependent children plus any vested shares awarded under a Company share plan.
Our share ownership guidelines were adopted on 1 April 2012.
Executive directors are expected to meet the guideline within a five year period from 1 April 2012 or, if later, the date of their appointment to the Board.
The Committee may vary the length of the periods within which the shareholding may be acquired.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2015 Governance 117 Remuneration report continued Directors remuneration policy Other remuneration policies relating to executive directors During 2014 15: James Cullens was appointed as an executive director Uwe Krueger was appointed as a non-executive director of Aggreko plc.
The relevant approved policies relating to recruitment, termination and external directorships have therefore been restated in this report for ease of reference.
Recruitment and appointment of executive directors The Committee determines the remuneration package for all new executive directors appointed to the Board.
Such appointees may be individuals who are already employed by the Group or from elsewhere.
In determining the appropriate remuneration package for a new executive director the Committee will consider the calibre of the candidate, the level of their existing remuneration, the jurisdiction the candidate is recruited from and their skills and experience, data for companies of a similar size and complexity and contextual information regarding remuneration paid to employees elsewhere in the Group.
The remuneration of a new executive director will include all elements set out in the policy table table 27, namely salary, benefits, pension, participation in the EBS and long-term incentive awards under the LTIP and LGU.
Depending on the level of salary set on appointment, the Committee may make larger initial increases to move salary to the desired level during the first three years following appointment.
The maximum opportunity levels in relation to other elements of remuneration outlined in the policy table table 27 will apply.
Depending on the timing and circumstances of the appointment, the Committee may vary the weighting of objectives under the EBS in the first year that the individual serves on the Board.
For an external appointment the offer may include compensation for the forfeiture of awards from a previous employer.
In assessing the level of such a buyout award, the Committee will take into account the type of incentive scheme, performance targets and whether they are likely to be achieved and the performance period of the forfeited award.
In so doing the Committee will seek to ensure up to equivalence in value.
To the extent that the Committee determines that it is appropriate, such awards will be share based with vesting subject to appropriate performance targets.
The Committee reserves the right to rely on exemption 9.4.
2 of the Listing Rules to enable a buyout award to be made.
In such circumstances any arrangement put in place will only compensate for remuneration lost and will take the form of performance-related variable remuneration.
For internal promotions, the Committee reserves the right to satisfy pre-existing executive incentive awards and other obligations which may be in place at the time of appointment.
Termination policy for executive directors In line with current market practice, the executive directors have rolling service contracts which are terminable on giving 12 months notice.
On the recruitment of an executive director who previously had a longer notice period commonly seen outside the UK, the Committee reserves the right to mirror the notice period with it reducing on a rolling basis to 12 months within two years of appointment.
No service agreement provides for predetermined amounts of compensation in the event of early termination of service contracts or a change in control.
The Committee retains its discretion to make a payment in lieu of notice which will be limited to one years base salary, benefits and pension.
The Committee also retains its discretion to make phased payments.
The service agreements include a duty for the executive director to mitigate loss and any payment in lieu of notice may be reduced to take account of such mitigation for example if alternative employment is taken up.
There is no contractual obligation to pay annual bonus.
Depending on the circumstances, the Committee has the discretion to make a pro rata bonus payment, linked to the original performance standards and delivered entirely in cash.
The executive directors entitlements to any bonus and unvested share awards granted in connection with the EBS or under the terms of the LTIP and LGU will be treated in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan rules, summarised in table 28.

Payment of the leavers reasonable legal fees will also be permissible.
External directorships The Board and the Committee recognise the benefit we can obtain if our executive directors serve as non-executive directors of other companies.
Subject to review in each case, the Boards general policy is that each executive director may accept one non-executive directorship with another FTSE 350 company from which any fees received may be retained.
The Board also encourages executive directors to undertake pro bono appointments with charitable or professional organisations to aid their personal development and further enhance the profile of the Company.
