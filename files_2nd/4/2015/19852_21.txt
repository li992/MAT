CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT ANNUAL STATEMENT ON REMUNERATION The Remuneration Committee is focused on ensuring Executive Directors are rewarded for long-term performance rather than short-term returns.
Summary of major decisions made in 2015 The Committee has continued to operate the approved shareholder policy during 2015 and will continue to do so during 2016.
As such, the major work of the Committee this year involved the monitoring of the 2015 performance targets KPIs for the TIP and the setting of new performance targets for 2016.
Performance and reward for 2015 At the start of 2015, Executive Director base salaries were frozen for the second consecutive year to reflect the streamlining and refocusing of the business and the ongoing challenging nature of the oil and gas industry.
The performance targets set for 2015 in respect of the TIP awards to be granted in 2016 were challenging in the context of the time and proved even more so as the year progressed.
It is disappointing to report a nil contribution for the TSR measure, which made up 50 per cent of the scorecard.
However, the Group scored well on its financial, production, organisational and strategic targets for 2015, and the Committee is particularly pleased with the progress of the TEN Project with first oil due, as planned, during 2016.
The DEAR SHAREHOLDER net result of these various factors produced an overall KPI On behalf of the Board, I am presenting the Remuneration performance of 37.7 per cent, resulting in a cash bonus of 94 Committees Committee report for 2015 on Directors per cent of salary and a further 94 per cent of salary awarded remuneration.
The report is again split into three in shares deferred for five years.
Full details of performance main sections: against the KPIs is shown on pages 100 and 101.
This Annual Statement, which provides a summary of The 2013 PSP Awards were based on relative TSR the year under review and the Committees intentions performance over the three years ended 31 December going forward: 2015 and did not vest in 2016 as a result of Tullows below-threshold TSR against the competitor groups The Directors Remuneration Policy Report, which over the performance period.
sets out the three-year Directors remuneration policy for the Company which commenced 1 January 2014 Executive Director Remuneration Policy for 2016 and became formally effective from the 2014 AGM.
In determining base salary levels and TIP performance While disclosure of this part of the report is not targets for 2016, the Committee wanted to recognise the required this year, this section has been included ongoing challenging environment of the oil and gas sector, again in line with best practice: and our business strategy and the ongoing need to streamline The Annual Report on Remuneration, which provides and refocus the business.
We also wanted to recognise details of the remuneration earned by Directors in the and reward the talent and continued commitment of year ended 31 December 2015 and how the policy will the Executive team, albeit in light of market conditions.
90 Tullow Oil plc 2015 Annual Report and Accounts 2 Our conclusion from these discussions has led to a freeze in COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION base salary and fixed pay for the third year running and a set of KPI targets which include TSR performance 50 per cent, Fixed pay strong production of Jubilee, and the final delivery of the TEN Project.
BASE SALARY Stretching financial metrics, a strong balance sheet and operational and organisation targets are also included in the 2016 scorecard as well as measures to deliver on the longer-term growth strategy of the Company.
Details of the actual targets are currently commercially sensitive and PENSION & BENEFITS will therefore be fully disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report.
Finally, in line with the pay freeze, the Committee has again, Pension for the second consecutive year, agreed with the Executive Benefits Directors to reduce the maximum award available under Medical Insurance the TIP in 2016 from 600 per cent to 500 per cent of salary.
Permanent Health Insurance Life Assurance During 2016, the Committee intends to conduct a major review of all aspects of remuneration, in particular the design and operation of the TIP, prior to the submission of our policy to shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
