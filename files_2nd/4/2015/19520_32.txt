Governance Directors remuneration report It is the remuneration committees main responsibility to ensure that payments to executives are appropriate and aligned with shareholder interests.
Our remuneration policy and payments to directors for the year ended 31 March 2015 follow that principle.
Dear Shareholder On behalf of the board, I am pleased to present the remuneration committees report for 2015.
I summarise the groups performance and the resulting pay outcomes for the year ended 31 March 2015, and highlight some of the key issues that the remuneration committee has considered during the year.
Performance and outcome This has been another year of strong underlying financial performance reflected in EBITA margin growth, adjusted EPS growth, and strong cash flow performance.
For the five years to 31 March 2015, our compound annualised adjusted EPS growth of 5.6% per annum above inflation and 36% pts.
TSR outperformance of our comparator group has enabled the Lesley Knox long-term incentives with a five-year performance period to vest.
Chairman of the remuneration committee However for the three years to 31 March 2015, our compound annualised adjusted EPS growth of 1.2% per annum above inflation was insufficient for the share options and performance share awards with a three-year performance period to vest, and therefore these have lapsed in full.
Further details on the performance conditions and vesting of long-term incentives are included on pages 88 and 89 of this report, and a summary of this years total remuneration for executive directors is shown on page 84 and in the remuneration at a glance table on the opposite page.
Remuneration policy We submitted our remuneration policy for shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM, and I was encouraged by the support of over 92% of shareholder votes in favour.
At the time of the AGM, and also arising from our regular annual shareholder consultations earlier in the year, some shareholders questioned our policy that permitted share options to vest for threshold performance at levels up to 65% of maximum for the Chief Executive, and up to 80% of maximum for other executive directors.
The remuneration committee considered this issue, and determined that it was too high.
Therefore, for future grants of share options to the Chief Executive and other executive directors, vesting at threshold performance will be reduced to 25% of maximum.
Our remuneration policy, approved at the 2014 AGM, is reproduced on pages 76 to 82 of this report for ease of reference.
It remains unchanged, except for context, and to note the reduction in threshold vesting of share options from 2015.
The details of letters of appointment for non-executive directors appointed during the year have also been updated in the table on page 81.
