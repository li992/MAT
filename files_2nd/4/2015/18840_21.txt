Directors Report Annual Statement from the Remuneration Committee Chairman Remuneration for 2015 16 The overall structure of the remuneration package will remain unchanged Mary Harris and we will, therefore, continue to operate within the policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
Salaries for the Executive Directors increased Chairman, Remuneration in March 2015 by 1.75 per cent, which is in line with the percentage salary Committee increases for other central colleagues and below the three per cent for store colleagues awarded in September 2014.
There are no changes proposed to the maximum opportunities under the incentive plans.
Future Builder performance measures and targets for 2015awards In November 2014, we announced an updated strategy to navigate the challenging retail environment.
Following this, the Committee undertook a review of our Future Builder plan to ensure alignment with our strategy.
During the year, we actively consulted with our top 15 shareholders and the main shareholder bodies regarding our long-term incentive arrangement.
TheCommittee values the views of our shareholders, and I would like to take the opportunity to thank all those who took part in the consultation process.
Dear Shareholder, Following the review, and consistent with the remuneration policy approved last year, the Committee approved changes to the performance conditions for As the grocery retail sector continues to go the 2015 Future Builder.
This award shall be based on four equally weighted financial metrics with target ranges that reflect the new challenging through major structural change, it is vital environment: that our remuneration policy reflects both Return on capital employed has been retained as a measure: the environment in which we are operating Earnings per share has been introduced as a new measure: and the Companys updated strategy.
The cash flow measure has been expanded to take into account capital expenditure this reflects the reduced capital expenditure targets in our This has been a challenging year for the grocery retail sector.
The heightened strategy: and competitive environment, food price deflation and price investments have A strategic cost savings measure has been introduced, which explicitly impacted our financial performance as well as the sector overall.
Within this focuses on the structural cost savings identified as one of our key strategic difficult context, we have outperformed our main supermarket peers in terms targets over the next few years.
of profit and made good progress on our strategic goals.
The target ranges applying to each measure for awards to be made in Remuneration for 2014 15 2015are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

2014 15 reflect the financial outcomes during the year and the stretching targets we set.
The Committee also wanted to ensure the targets are appropriately motivating to the broader management team, as circa 200 senior colleagues As a result, pay for Executive Directors is significantly lower in 2014 15 than participate in this arrangement.
We have an experienced management team in 2013 14.
This is predominantly as a result of no payments being made with deep sector experience who will provide the necessary leadership and under either the annual bonus or Future Builder our long-term incentive execution skills to succeed in this market and differentiate ourselves against plan which was due to vest in May 2015.
However, given the progress made our peers.
It is critical this team value their incentives and view targets as on our new strategy and key aspects of our relative performance, the both challenging and yet achievable in the current environment.
Deferred Share Award DSA outcome for the year was 52per cent of the maximum compared with 80 per cent last year.
58 Directors Report Recovery provisions introduction of clawback In line with best practice, the Committee has also taken the opportunity to strengthen the recovery provisions applicable to our incentive plans.
The existing recovery provision that applies to the Future Builder will be extended to the Deferred Share Award.
In addition, a clawback provision has been introduced for future incentive awards, which enables incentive payments to be reclaimed in certain scenarios.
Looking ahead to 2016 The Long-Term Incentive Plan, under which the Future Builder awards are currently granted, was approved by shareholders in 2006 and will expire in July 2016.
During 2015 16, the Committee will give further consideration to how any replacement plan should be structured with a view to presenting thisto shareholders for approval at next years AGM.
We will look to appropriately consult with shareholders regarding any new arrangements later in the year.

In cases of material mis-statement of financial results, serious reputational damage, serious misconduct and fraud, the Committee may reduce the number of shares under an unvested award, cancel an unvested award in full or impose further conditions on an unvested award.
This provision will now be extended to the Deferred Share Award from 2015 16.
In addition, the Committee has further strengthened the recovery provisions applicable to future awards.
For future awards, a clawback provision will be introduced in relation to all incentive plans.
In the circumstances listed above, the Committee may require an Executive Director to make a repayment in relation to bonus payments or share awards received within two years of the end of the relevant performance period.
