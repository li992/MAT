Historic awards Awards which were granted prior to the Companys IPO are set out in the Annual report on remuneration ARR.
These awards remain eligible to vest, based on their original terms and will be disclosed in the relevant ARR as required.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2015 53 Remuneration Committee report continued Performance measures The rationale behind each performance measure currently used in the Performance Share Plan and how it is calculated is as follows: Performance measure Rationale Relative TSR performance Recognises outperformance and delivery of relative value to Shareholders Relative total Shareholder return is currently measured against the FTSE 250 excluding Investment trusts the Index.
This was chosen as a comparator group because it represents similar sized companies, is subject to less volatility than a smaller peer comparator group and is transparent for both Shareholders and participants.
The Committee will review on an annual basis the continued appropriateness of the comparator group.
Clinical and key strategic Recognises the importance of R&D to future business growth business objectives The growth of the Company and therefore delivery of value to investors is dependent on achievement of certain key clinical timelines.
The annual bonus is designed to drive the achievement of the Companys clinical and strategic business targets.
These targets are agreed by the Board and selected because of their importance in value creation for Shareholders.
Objectives are weighted for Executives in proportion to the degree of responsibility for control and achievement of that objective.
The weightings are agreed by the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration on recruitment The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration package of new Executive Directors.
Each element of an Executive Directors remuneration is set out below: Salary Base salary will be determined based on the role, experience of the individual and the current market rate.
It may be considered necessary to appoint a new Executive Director on a below market salary e. g. to reflect limited plc board experience.

Long-term incentive PSP awards are granted in line with the policy outlined for existing Executives.
Any ongoing annual award is awards limited to that of the current Chief Executive Officer.
An award may be made shortly following an appointment provided the Company is not in a prohibited period.
For internal appointments, existing awards will continue on their original terms.
Pension A company contribution or cash supplement up to the maximum as outlined for current Executive Directors.
Buy-out awards To enable the recruitment of exceptional talent, the Committee may determine that the buy-out of remuneration forfeit from a prior employer is necessary.
Where possible, any replacement remuneration will be offered on a likefor-like basis with the forfeited awards and may be in the form of cash or shares and depending whether the award forgone has similar performance conditions, may or may not be subject to performance conditions.
The value of any buy-out will be limited to the value of remuneration forfeit.
Where appropriate, such awards will be granted under existing share plans, however, the Remuneration Committee will have discretion to make use of the flexibility to make awards under exemptions in the Listing Rules.
Fee levels for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors will be set at a level that is consistent with those of existing Non-Executive Directors.

Statement of consideration of employees pay and remuneration conditions elsewhere in the Group The Company does not formally consult with employees on the matters of Executive Director remuneration.
However, the Committee is made aware of employment conditions in the wider Group.
The same broad principles apply to the remuneration policy for both Executive Directors and the wider employee population.
However, the remuneration for Executive Directors has a stronger emphasis on performance-related pay than for other employees.
In particular the following approach is used: Salaries, benefits and pensions are compared to appropriate market rates and set at approximately mid-market level with allowance for role, responsibilities and experience.
When setting salary levels for the Executive Directors, the Committee considers the salary increases provided to other employees and in particular those based in the UK.
An annual bonus plan is available to all employees and is based on business and individual performance.
Awards from the Performance Share Plan are made to all current employees including Executive Directors.
Scenarios The charts set out for illustrative purposes only, what annual remuneration the Company expects the Directors to obtain if performance levels are below threshold, meet expectations or exceed the maximum targets.
The assumptions used in the calculations are set out below: Fixed pay: this includes salary, pension and benefits.
Base salary effective 1 January 2016 and expected pension contribution has been used.
The actual monetary value of benefits received in 2015 have been used.
Expected: this includes salary, pension, benefits, annual bonus and PSP.
This assumes that 70% of the annual bonus maximum will be payable for each of the Directors and 50% of PSP awards will vest.
Maximum: It is assumed that the maximum annual bonus would be payable and that the awards under the PSP vest in full.
No share price growth has been assumed.

Annual report on remuneration This section of the Remuneration Committee report has been prepared in accordance with Part 3 of the Regulations as amended, and 9.8.
The Annual report on remuneration will be put to an advisory Shareholder vote at the AGM on 18 May 2016.
Composition From 1 January 2015 to 9 February 2015, the Committee was made up of Dr Jean-Jacques Garaud Chairman, Dr Tim Corn, and Mr Paul R Edick.
Mr Edick was not considered to be independent and therefore, for this period the Committee did not comply with the requirement of the Code that all members of the Remuneration Committee be Independent Non-Executive Directors.
On 9 February 2015 Mr Edick was succeeded by Ms Lota S Zoth who is an Independent Non-Executive Director.

The terms of reference of the Committee appear on the Companys website.
The Committee met three times during the year ended 31 December 2015.
Each meeting was fully attended.

Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2015 59 Remuneration Committee report continued Committee evaluation A review of the effectiveness of the Committee was carried out in December 2015 as part of the process of evaluating Board effectiveness.
Audited information Total remuneration year ended 31 December 2015 The total remuneration of the individual Directors who served during the year is set out in the table below.
Total remuneration is the sum of emoluments plus pension contributions and the value of long-term incentive awards vesting by reference to performance in the year ended 31 December 2015.
The majority of these benefits consist of medical insurance and life assurance 7 This is the value of the total bonus earned during the financial year and includes the annual bonus paid in respect of performance against goals for 2015 and 2014 and the IPO bonus paid for performance in ensuring an orderly and efficient IPO in 2014.
Where the requisite shareholding requirement has not been met by an Executive Director then 50% of the annual bonus will be paid in shares.
Where the requirement has been met then 25% will be paid in shares.
8 The amount shown relates to the gain, being the market value on date of exercise less exercise price, on EMI share option awards that vested during the year 9 UK tax legislation imposes penalty taxes on annual pension contributions where prescribed maximum limits are exceeded.
The Committee has previously determined that Executive Directors affected by this legislation would receive pension benefits limited by the prescribed maximum amounts and an additional taxable supplementary cash payment equal to the cost to the Company of the benefit foregone.
The amount of this supplementary allowance is set so that there is no additional cost to the Company as a result of the implementation of this arrangement.
In 2015 Steven Harris received 40,114 of this pension amount as supplementary cash 2014: nil.
Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc Annual report and accounts 2015 60 Annual bonus for the year to 31 December 2015 For the year ended 31 December 2015 the bonus consisted of two elements.

Performance objectives are agreed by the Board at the beginning of the year and the Remuneration Committee determines the proportion of bonus payable to each Director and Senior Vice President in the event that the objective is achieved.
The Remuneration Committee determines at the beginning of the year following the bonus year, the extent to which the objective has been achieved and the proportion of the bonus earned.

In view of a number of significant additional achievements of each of the executives, the Committee was satisfied that a payment of 100% of salary was appropriate.
The achievements included: Receipt of first regulatory approval for respiratory product Integration of the two acquisitions across six geographic locations Oxford, Chicago, Morrisville, Solna, Germany and China in less than six months Recruitment, training and deployment of US field-based organisation Deferred share bonus awards are structured as conditional awards over shares which vest after three years.

Where the guidelines have been met in full, 75% of bonuses are paid in cash and 25% in shares.
Both Steven Harris and Rod Hafner have met their shareholding guidelines and therefore 75% of their 2015 bonus was paid in cash.
Julien Cotta has not yet met the shareholding guidelines and so 50% of his bonus was paid in cash and 50% in shares.
