These objectives include improving returns, enhancing operating profit, increasing the efficiency of capital employed and delivering strong customer satisfaction.
Such objectives are measured by reference to the Groups reported KPIs of pre-tax profit, ROCE, earnings per share and customer satisfaction scores, all of which are built into the Groups incentive schemes.
Annual bonus arrangements are clearly linked to the Groups near term strategy via the inclusion of profit before tax, ROCE and customer service as performance measures.
The LTIP has a longer term perspective and features performance measures of relative total shareholder return and earnings per share, both of which are measured over a three year period and ROCE, measured in year three of the performance period, ensuring that efficiency of earnings is not compromised for the sake of near term returns.
The Committee remains satisfied that current remuneration arrangements effectively support the business strategy.
Key remuneration decisions during 2015 During 2015, the Committee set targets for the 2015 annual bonus shown on page 61 and approved 2014 bonus payments.
It set targets for and approved LTIP awards made in 2015 and approved the level of vesting for the 2012 LTIP awards.
A consultation with shareholders took place on the 2015 salary increase for the Chief Executive to a market equivalent level and the Committee approved the remuneration arrangements on the departure of Jonathan Hill and the recruitment of the new Group Finance Director, Earl Sibley.
The Committee also completed the 2016 remuneration review, which included consideration of the link between executive remuneration and pay and employment conditions throughout the Group including the general proposals for staff for 2016.
As explained in the Committee Chairmans letter on page 57, the salary of the Group Finance Director, who joined the Group in April 2015, has been carefully reviewed for 2016, adopting a progressive approach.

Shareholding guidelines Guidelines have been approved for executive directors in respect of ownership of Bovis Homes shares.
The Board expects executive directors benefiting from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or exercise of share options to retain 100% of the net value derived from the exercise as shares, after settling all costs and income tax due, until such time as the executive director holds shares with an historical cost equal to their basic annual salary.
A holding period is not prescribed, as this would signal an ability to sell after the end of the holding period and the executive directors have always retained shares received.
The executive directors shareholdings relative to the guidelines are shown below.

Implementation of remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December 2016 Changes in the way that remuneration policy will be implemented in 2016 versus 2015 include a base salary increase for the GFD, the removal of the cash flow measure and a corresponding increase in the ROCE weighting for the 2016 annual bonus, and the introduction of provisions that enable the withholding of payment or the recovery of sums paid malus and clawback in incentive schemes.
Executive directors base salaries and benefits The salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 2016 are as follows: % increase Executive directors Position 2016 base salary from 2015 David Ritchie CEO 550,000 0.0% Earl Sibley appointed 16 04 15 GFD 275,000 10.0% The Committee carefully considered the increase for Earl Sibley and the Committee Chairman, Alastair Lyons, wrote to major shareholders in January 2016 to outline the rationale behind the decision.
In summary, this was as follows: i Earl Sibley was appointed in April 2015 on a salary of 250,000 with the expectation that salary would be increased to an appropriate market rate for a strongly performing experienced individual over the first three years of service, subject to individual performance and increased experience.
The Committee considers that this progressive approach contributes to our executive directors being fully motivated to deliver the Groups growth strategy to the benefit of shareholders.
ii In view of the strong level of performance being delivered by Earl Sibley and the experience he has gained since joining, the Committee decided to progress his salary by 10% for 2016.
The resulting level of salary remains below that of the previous GFD on leaving the Group at the beginning of March 2015.
It is anticipated that a similar increase will be applied in January 2017, subject to continuation of the GFDs development, strong performance and contribution to the Group.
The salary of David Ritchie, the Chief Executive, was not increased.
An allowance of just over 3% of salary roll was provided for general staff increases.
Benefits will continue on the same basis as for 2015.
Bovis Homes Group PLC | 67 6% 4% 10% 7% 18% 13% m Annual remuneration report Remuneration report Approach to annual bonus Following the annual review, it was concluded that the annual bonus scheme continues to measure key elements of performance that are in line with the Companys stated strategy over the shorter term, but that the cash flow measure should be removed, as the Group is now consistently delivering strong operating cash flow, and the ROCE measure should instead be increased from 20% to 30%, reflecting the importance of delivering growth in return on capital.
In addition, provisions that enable the withholding of payment or the recovery of sums paid malus and clawback have been included for the 2016 annual bonus to apply in circumstances of i a serious misstatement of results: ii an error in assessing a performance condition or in the information on which the award was granted: or iii gross misconduct.
Malus will apply prior to the bonus payment date and clawback will apply for a two year period thereafter.
There is no change to quantum and the balance of financial and non-financial metrics remains at 70%:30%.
The Committee has decided not to disclose the detail of performance targets in advance as they are considered commercially sensitive, being closely indicative of the Groups growth strategy, but will disclose them retrospectively in the 2016 annual remuneration report.
The 2016 performance measures and weightings are described below.
Measure Rationale link to strategy % weighting Financial measures 70% Profit before tax Explicitly ties reward to financial performance.
40% Challenges management to deliver and out-perform profit target.
ROCE Aligns the way the business is managed with the key interest of 30% shareholders, being the return achieved on invested capital.
Non-financial measures 30% Customer service Quality of service is key to reputation and future success, both in 10% terms of customer demand and achieved selling prices.
Individual performance Focuses the executive directors on strategic priorities and the 20% achievement of defined elements within their roles Total opportunity 100% Approach for Long Term Incentive Plan awards The key features of the long term incentive arrangements as outlined on page 63 remain the same as those for 2015, with the addition of provisions that enable the withholding of payment or the recovery of sums paid malus and clawback for 2016 awards.
These provisions will apply in circumstances of i a serious misstatement of results: ii an error in assessing a performance condition or in the information on which the award was granted: or iii gross misconduct.
Malus will apply prior to the award vesting date and clawback will apply for a two year period thereafter.
Performance conditions Total Shareholder Return one-third of total award The threshold target for maximum vesting, being outperformance of the index by 10% per annum, is historically equal to at least upper quartile performance, and is thus deemed appropriately stretching.
TSR will be calculated using a three month averaging period at the start and end of the period to smooth the impact of share price volatility on vesting.
Performance measurement Threshold performance Maximum performance TSR Equal to the median of the Index Median plus 10% per annum 68 | Annual report and accounts | Our governance Our governance Annual remuneration report Earnings per share one-third of total award The Committee adopted cumulative EPS targets for the 2016 awards.
When setting minimum and maximum absolute EPS targets for the 2016 awards, the Committee considered data providing visibility over the three year performance period, including internal forecasts and analysts projections, and set absolute minimum and maximum EPS targets of 370p and 440p per share to be measured on a cumulative basis over the three year performance period.
Where EPS falls below the minimum, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS can be realised.
Performance measurement Threshold performance Maximum performance EPS Cumulative EPS of 370p Cumulative EPS of 440p Return on Capital Employed one-third of total award When setting minimum and maximum absolute ROCE targets for the 2016 awards, the Committee again considered data providing visibility over the three year performance period, including internal forecasts and analysts projections.
The Committee set absolute minimum and maximum ROCE targets for the 2016 awards of 20.5% and 25.3%, to be measured in the third year of the performance period 2018.
Performance measurement Threshold performance Maximum performance ROCE 20.5% 25.3% Pensions Pension arrangements as outlined on page 64 will continue on the same basis as in 2015.

The fees for the Deputy Chairman and the other non-executive directors were increased to their current levels with effect from 1 January 2015 and will next be reviewed with effect from 1 January 2017.
Remuneration of senior management and other below board employees In addition to responsibility for executive directors, the Committee is also involved in consideration of the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Leadership Team below the Board, in conjunction with the Chief Executive.
Alignment is delivered by ensuring that senior management participate in the same bonus and incentive schemes as the executive directors, with similar performance measures and targets.

Notes to the policy table The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
In 2016 the Company introduced provisions for the recovery of sums paid under the annual bonus and LTIP under certain serious circumstances which are summarised on pages 62 and 68.
The executive directors may request and the Company may grant salary and bonus sacrifice arrangements.
The LTIP rules permit the substitution or variance of performance conditions to produce a fairer measure of performance as a result of an unforeseen event or transaction and include discretions for upwards adjustment to the number of shares to be realised in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or voluntary winding up.
Non-significant changes to the performance metrics may be made by use of discretion under the LTIP rules.
Awards are normally satisfied in shares, although there is flexibility to settle in cash.
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments that are not in line with the policy table set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed: i before the policy came into effect: or ii at a time when the relevant i ndividual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an award over shares is agreed at the time the award is granted.
Performance measures for the annual bonus scheme and the LTIP are selected to focus the executive directors on strategic priorities, both short term and those related to long term sustainable performance, providing alignment with shareholder interests.
Targets for each performance measure are then set by the Committee in light of strategic objectives over the short term for the annual bonus scheme and over at least a three year performance period for the LTIP.
In setting targets the Committee takes into account a number of reference points including internal and analysts forecasts.
