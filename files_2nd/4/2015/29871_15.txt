The review process involves an analysis of fees paid to Directors of other companies having similar profiles to that of the Company.
This review would be submitted to the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Directors fees would be agreed for the next 3 year period subject to approval by the Shareholders at the relevant AGM.
