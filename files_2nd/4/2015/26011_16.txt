Philip Johnson's leaving arrangements As announced on 30 November 2015, after six years of service, Philip Johnson and the Board agreed that he would step down from his role of Chief Financial Officer.

These awards will become exercisable in full upon cessation, with the exception of a portion of the 2015 bonus which will continue to be deferred, as required under AIFMD regulations.

The Remuneration Committee determined that it was appropriate for holders of share option awards under both the DBP and LTIP schemes to benefit from the 21 April 2015 Special 65 Dividend.
This took place by means of adjusting upwards the number of shares over which options were held by a factor of 2.77 per cent.

This factor is equivalent to the value the holder of a share option award would have received had they been entitled to receive the Special Dividend as a cash payment.

69 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Remuneration report continued Dilution Our policy regarding dilution from employee share awards is to ensure that dilution will be no more than 10 per cent.
in any rolling 10 year period and no more than five per cent.
from employee share awards granted to executive Directors of the Company in any rolling 10 year period.
As at 31 December 2015, share awards granted under the DBP, LTIP and Sharesave in the five and a half years since Jupiters Listing were outstanding over 17.1m shares including 2.7m granted to executive Directors.
to executive Directors of the Companys issued share capital.
Our current intention is to settle all share awards outstanding as at 31 December 2015 with market purchased shares and our ongoing practice is to purchase shares in the market to settle obligations.
No new shares have been issued since Listing in 2010.
Therefore, we are currently operating within the relevant dilution targets by a comfortable margin.
Notwithstanding the target outlined above, as a business exposed to both market shocks and critical people issues, we believe we should retain flexibility to act very quickly to take steps that could increase dilution up to a maximum of 15 per cent.
on a temporary and short-term basis, if the Remuneration Committee and Board believe it is clearly in shareholders interests to do so.
If dilution were to exceed 10 per cent.
in any rolling 10 year period, this would be on an exceptional basis and for a short time period.
The Remuneration report for the relevant year would also contain the necessary justifications for such an outcome.
The Remuneration Committee and Board would ensure that dilution levels returned to within the 10 per cent.
