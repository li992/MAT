The Committee is mindful that annual bonus awards should fairly reflect performance in the round.
The formulaic outturn of quantitative targets is therefore considered in the context of factors such as the buoyancy of occupier demand in the wider West End market and progression against longer-term strategic goals, to ensure the level of bonus is appropriate.
Whilst the achievement against the targets was 70%, the Committee felt that a more reasonable award in view of these external factors was 60%.
Accordingly a bonus of 75% of salary is payable in deferred shares or 60% of salary if taken entirely in cash.
All the executive directors elected to take their bonus in shares which equates to an award of 75% out of a maximum opportunity of 125% of salary.
SHAFTESBURY ANNUAL REPORT 2015 GOVERNANCE ANNuAL REmuNERAtiON REpORt CONTINUED 095 LTIP vesting in performance period to 30 September 2015 Awards of nil cost options are made by the Committee based on a multiple of salary divided by the average share price over five days prior to the date of grant.
Vesting of these options is determined by performance over a three-year period.
As a long-term business, a consistent approach to target setting is taken.
The performance criteria are, and have been, applied consistently since the current LTIP was approved by shareholders in 2006 and are set out below.

Under the rules of sharesave, all employees must be invited to participate on similar terms.
In July 2014, the executive directors entered a new savings contract under sharesave for an additional 250 per month, and received a grant of options which become exercisable in July 2019.
However, the exercise of these options will be subject to approval by shareholders to increase the amount executive directors may save under sharesave according to our approved policy, in line with revised HMRC limits.
This amendment will be made in the policy report, which is subject to a shareholder vote.
This will be at the 2016 AGM and, therefore, prior to the exercise of these options.
