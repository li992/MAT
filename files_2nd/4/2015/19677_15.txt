Notes to the tables on pages 44 to 46 The Company also operates a shareholding policy details can be found on page 39 of this report.
The PSP will be operated in accordance with the plan rules.
In accordance with the rules of the PSP, any performance condition may be substituted or varied if the Committee considers it appropriate, provided that the amended performance condition is in its opinion reasonable and not materially less difficult to satisfy.
The plan rules also provide for the adjustment of awards in the event of any variation of the Companys share capital, capital distribution, demerger, special dividend or other event having a material impact on the value of shares.
Malus applies where stated in the above table.
Other elements of remuneration are not subject to recovery provisions.
Under Kate Swanns service contract, if her employment is terminated by the Company making a payment in lieu of notice and the Company subsequently discovers that there were grounds for her summary dismissal, Kate Swann may be required to make a repayment equal to the net of tax value of any payments, benefits or shares received under any relevant bonus or incentive plan.
SSP Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Corporate governance 47 The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments that are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed: i before the policy came into effect including payments relating to the admission : or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes, payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an award over shares is agreed at the time the award is granted.
Performance measures and targets Annual bonus Annual bonus metrics and targets are selected to incentivise Directors to meet objectives for the year and are chosen in line with the following principles: The targets set for financial measures should be incentivising and appropriately stretching.
Targets may be adjusted by the Committee to take into account significant capital transactions during the year.
There should be flexibility to change the measures and weightings year-on-year in line with the needs of the business.
PSP Performance conditions and targets are determined by the Committee to reflect the Groups strategy and having regard to market practice within the Companys business sector.
For 2014 and 2015 awards, the measures were selected taking into account that: Earnings per Share is considered by the Company to be the best indicator of long-term performance Total Shareholder Return is a key objective of most of our shareholders.
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group Differences in the policies for Executive Directors and other employees in the Group generally reflect differences in market practice taking into account role and seniority.
The remuneration policies for Executive Directors and the senior executive team are generally consistent in terms of structure and the performance measures used.
All eligible employees may participate in the Companys all-employee share plans in the relevant territory.

48 Corporate governance Directors remuneration policy continued Approach to recruitment remuneration In the event that the Group appointed a new Executive Director, remuneration would be determined in line with the following principles: The Committee will take into account all relevant factors, including the calibre and experience of the individual and the market from which they are recruited, while being mindful of the best interests of the Group and its shareholders and seeking not to pay more than is necessary.
So far as practical the Committee will look to align the remuneration package for any new appointment with the remuneration policy set out in the table on page 47.
Salaries may be higher or lower than the previous incumbent, but will be set taking into account the review principles set out in the policy table.
Where appropriate the salaries may be set at an initially lower level, with the intention of increasing salary at a higher than usual rate as the Executive Director gains experience in the role.
For interim positions a cash supplement may be paid rather than salary for example a Non-Executive Director taking on an executive function on a short-term basis.
To facilitate recruitment the Committee may need to buy-out terms or remuneration arrangements forfeited on joining the Company.
Any buy-out would take into account the terms of the arrangements, in particular, any performance conditions and the time over which they would vest.
The overriding principle would be that the value of any replacement buy-out awards should be no more than the commercial value of awards that have been forfeited.
The form of any award would be determined at the time and the Committee may make buy-out awards under LR 9.4.
2 of the Listing Rules for buy-out awards only.
The maximum variable pay opportunity in respect of recruitment excluding buy-outs comprises a maximum annual bonus of 200% of annual salary and a maximum PSP grant of 200% of annual salary, as stated in the policy table on page 47.
The Committee retains the flexibility to determine that, for the first year of appointment, any annual incentive award within this maximum will be subject to such terms as it may determine.
Where an Executive Director is appointed from within the Company or following corporate activity reorganisation for example, merger with another company, the normal policy would be to honour any legacy arrangements in line with the original terms and conditions.
Where the recruitment requires relocation of the individual, the Committee may provide for additional costs and benefits.
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the remuneration package will be consistent with the policy set out above.
Details of Directors service contracts Executive Directors Executive Directors have rolling service contracts.
None of the existing service contracts for Executive Directors makes any provision for termination payments, other than for payment in lieu of notice.
Kate Swanns payment in lieu of notice would be calculated by reference to the base salary and pension contributions or equivalent allowance in respect of any unexpired portion of the notice period.
This payment can be made in instalments over the notice period and can be reduced where alternative employment is commenced during the notice period.
Any such payment to Kate Swann would be repayable net of tax if it was subsequently discovered that the Company would have been permitted to dismiss her summarily.
Jonathan Daviess payment in lieu of notice would be calculated by reference to the base salary in respect of any unexpired portion of the notice period.
SSP Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Corporate governance 49 The Executive Directors service contracts contain provisions relating to salary, car allowance, pension arrangements, medical insurance, life insurance, business travel insurance, company car, holiday and sick pay, and the reimbursement of reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the Executive Directors while on company business.
Kate Swanns service contract includes the provision that she is entitled to participate in the annual bonus scheme.
For any new Executive Directors appointed their participation in the Companys incentive plans will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The following service contracts in respect of Executive Directors who were in office during the year are rolling service contracts and therefore have no end date: Date of commencement of contract Notice period for Director Notice period for Company Kate Swann 15 July 2014 9 months 12 months Jonathan Davies 15 July 2014 9 months 12 months Service contracts for new Executive Directors will be limited to nine months notice for the Director and 12 months notice for the Company.
Chairman The terms of the Chairmans appointment broadly reflect the terms of the three-year appointments of the Non-Executive Directors.
The Chairmans appointment can be terminated at any time upon written notice, resignation or in accordance with the articles of association of the Company.
The Chairman receives no benefits from the office other than fees and reimbursement of expenses incurred in performance of his duties, including any tax due on the expenses.
He is not eligible to participate in Group pension arrangements.
Non-Executive Directors All Non-Executive Directors have been appointed on an initial term of three years, subject to renewal thereafter.
All are subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment which can be terminated at any time upon written notice, resignation or in accordance with the articles of association of the Company.

Payments to departing Directors In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined by reference to the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
The Committee may structure any compensation payments in such a way as it deems appropriate, taking into account the circumstances of departure.
In the event of the Company terminating an Executive Directors contract, the level of compensation would be subject to mitigation if considered appropriate.
50 Corporate governance Directors remuneration policy continued Payment in lieu In the event of termination by the Company of an Executive Directors employment, a payment in lieu of notice may be of notice paid.
This payment would be equal to a maximum of annual base salary and cash allowance in lieu of pension in respect of any unexpired portion of the notice period.
Annual bonus Executive Directors may, at the determination of the Committee, remain eligible to receive an annual bonus for the financial year in which they ceased employment.
Any such bonus will be determined by the Committee, taking into account time in employment and performance.
Performance On cessation of employment, any outstanding unvested awards will lapse unless the participant dies or is deemed to be Share Plan awards a good leaver by the Committee in its discretion.
Where the participant is deemed to be a good leaver, any outstanding unvested awards will normally continue and will vest at the normal vesting date to the extent the original performance conditions have been satisfied.
Awards will normally, unless the Committee determines that an alternative proportion of the awards should vest, be pro-rated for the portion of the vesting period completed in employment.
The Committee may, in exceptional circumstances, or if the participant dies, decide to allow awards to vest on cessation of employment subject to the Committees assessment of performance against the original performance conditions at that time or the Committees assessment of the likely achievement of the performance conditions over the original performance period.
Payments in relation to The Company may pay an amount considered reasonable by the Remuneration Committee in respect of an Executive statutory rights Directors statutory rights.
Payments required by law The Company may pay damages, awards, fines or other compensation awarded to an Executive Director by any competent court or tribunal or other payments required to be made on termination of employment under applicable law.
Professional fees The Company may pay an amount considered reasonable by the Remuneration Committee in respect of fees for legal and tax advice, and outplacement support for the departing Executive Director.
2 Were an award to be made under LR 9.4.
2 then the leaver provisions would be determined at the time of award.
Takeovers and other corporate events Under the PSP, on a takeover or voluntary winding-up of the Company, PSP awards will vest in accordance with the rules of the plan.
Vesting would be determined by the Committee based on the proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed and the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied, although the Committee has the discretion to determine that such greater proportion as it considers appropriate of the awards should vest, including where it considers the level of shareholder returns is at a superior level.
In the event of a variation of share capital, demerger, capital distribution or any other event having a material impact on the value of the shares, the Committee may determine that outstanding PSP awards shall vest on the same basis as set out above for a takeover.
Alternatively the Committee may with the consent of the acquiring company decide that PSP awards will not vest on a corporate event but will be replaced by new awards over shares in the new acquiring company or another company determined by the acquiring company.
Bonuses may be paid in respect of the year in which the change of control or winding up of the Company occurs, if the Committee considers this appropriate.
The Committee may determine the level of bonus taking into account any factors it considers appropriate.
Amendments The Committee may make amendments to the terms of the Companys incentive plans in accordance with the rules of those plans which were summarised for shareholders in the Companys IPO prospectus.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax, administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group In making remuneration decisions, the Committee also considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
When reviewing and setting Executive Director remuneration, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of Group employees.
The Group-wide pay review budget is one of the key factors when reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors.
Although the Group has not carried out a formal employee consultation regarding Board remuneration, it does comply with local regulations and practices regarding employee consultation more broadly.
Consideration of shareholder views In reviewing and setting remuneration, including that of Executive Directors, the Committee receives updates on investors views, and may from time to time engage directly with investors and or investor representative organisations on remuneration topics as appropriate.
These lines of communication ensure that emerging best practice principles are factored into the Committees decision-making.
