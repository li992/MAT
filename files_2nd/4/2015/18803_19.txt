CHANGES TO THE POLICY TABLE All changes made to our policy are detailed in the Chairs statement.
Minor wording changes have also been made to ensure that the policy can be implemented as intended by the Remuneration Committee.
SELECTION OF PERFORMANCE METRICS The annual bonus is based on performance against a mix of financial measures.
The mix of financial measures is aligned to the Groups Key Performance Indicators KPIs and is reviewed each year by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they remain appropriate to reflect the priorities for the business in the year ahead.
The targets are set for each KPI to encourage continuous improvement and challenge the delivery of stretch performance.
INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 DIRECTORS REPORT 65 Directors report Remuneration report continued The LTIP is based on EPS growth and TSR performance.
EPS is a measure of the Groups overall financial success and TSR provides an external assessment of the Companys performance against the market.
It also aligns the rewards received by executives with the returns received by shareholders.
A sliding scale of challenging performance targets is set for each measure.
The Committee reviews the choice of performance measures and the appropriateness of the performance targets prior to each LTIP grant.
The Committee reserves the discretion to set different targets for future awards, without consulting with shareholders.
The targets for awards granted under this remuneration policy are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
When setting the targets for the annual bonus and the LTIP, the Remuneration Committee takes into account a range of factors, including the business plan, prior year performance, market conditions and consensus forecasts.
