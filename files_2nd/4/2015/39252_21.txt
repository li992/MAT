Redefine International P. L. C. Annual Report 2015 | 59 Governance Directors remuneration report Summary of the policy report on remuneration continued Remuneration policy for the Executive Directors The key principles of the executive remuneration policy are to attract, retain and motivate to ensure the longterm success of the Company.
A summary of the elements of the executive remuneration policy is shown overleaf.
Overriding Committee discretion Subject to the discretion of the RemCo, the Remuneration Policy may be amended to accommodate minor changes, for administrative or legislative purposes, without obtaining shareholder approval.
Furthermore, the Committee may adjust upwards or downwards the extent to which a PSP award would otherwise vest if it considers that such level of vesting is not reflective of overall corporate performance or of the executives personal performance.
Executive service contracts and recruitment remuneration arrangements All Executive Directors have a service contract, comprising the remuneration elements detailed in the Remuneration Policy.
There is no fixed length of service but the contract can be terminated by either party giving the other notice in writing for a period not exceeding 12 months.
On termination of the service contracts, the applicable payments for each of the remuneration elements are shown above.
The executive service contracts are available for inspection at the Companys registered office.
For future executive recruitment the same elements and parameters would be applicable as shown above.
The base salary of new executives would be compared to the current executives and set at an appropriate level to the role.
Bonuses, benefits and pensions would be in line with current executives and inclusion in the PSP scheme would be at the RemCos discretion.
It is most unlikely that compensation would be offered for the forfeit of any award from a previous employer.
Reelection of Directors In May 2014, the Company entered the FTSE 250 and therefore, in line with the Code B.
7.1 requirement, all the Directors will be subject to reelection by Shareholders at the AGM.
In the event that an Executive Director is not reelected, it should be noted the Executive Directors service contracts all require a notice period of between three months and one year, and any PSP awards which have not yet vested would be subject to the RemCos discretion.
There is no such provision in the Nonexecutive Directors letters of appointment.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company All employees have contracts with terms in line with standard market practice.
Remuneration is similar in structure to the executive pay structures, containing the same three elements: fixed element: all employees are offered a base salary.
These are reviewed annually with changes effective 1 September and increases are in line with those offered to executives.
However, as with the executives, the Company is under no obligation to award an increase following the review.
Benefits offered vary with the level of seniority: shortterm incentive: bonuses are based on the Groups performance and that of the individual and are awarded on similar principles as those given to the executive, but are subject to the discretion of the executive.
Payment of the bonus is conditional upon the employee being employed by the Group and notice not having been served on the date the bonus is paid: and longterm incentive: employees are eligible to participate in the Restricted Share Plan RSP at the discretion of the RemCo.
Under the RSP share awards may be given as either a nil cost option award or as a contingent award.
Such awards may carry award dividends entitling the employee to dividends which would have been received on the shares during the vesting period, payable either in cash or ordinary shares.
RSP awards are subject to performance targets set by the RemCo at the time the awards are made.
Shareholders approved the RSP at the EGM held on 29 November 2013 and authorised Directors to allot shares for the purposes of the RSP up to a maximum number of 23,000,000 ordinary shares.
Notice of termination: for most employees, a notice period of three months is required to terminate the contract and payment in lieu of notice will be given in appropriate circumstances.
Employees of the European portfolio are paid in Euros, all others are paid in Sterling.
Statement of shareholder views The Company meets regularly with its major Shareholders and any feedback on remuneration has been taken into consideration during the establishment of this policy.
