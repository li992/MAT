Base pay has not been increased since the appointment of the current Executives in 2013, which, at that time, had been positioned conservatively.

Michael Williams was a Director until his resignation from the Board on 20 February 2015 and his bonus award, as an Investment Manager, is primarily assessed in relation to the profitability of his Investment Management team.
Figure 2.1 below shows the performance criteria that were set by the Committee, their weightings and the Committees assessment of performance for the year.

2 The reported adjusted profit before tax for the 2015 financial year is 62.2 million.
This excludes 1.3 million of profit relating to Stocktrade which has been classified as discontinued operations.
For the purposes of comparing achievement with the original PBT target set for Executive Directors in 2014, this 1.3 million has been added back to adjusted PBT.
Additionally, a notional Euroclear plc dividend of 450,000 has been added back as the forecast used to set the PBT target for the year assumed Euroclear plc dividends which were not received due to the sale of the investment during the year, the proceeds from which have already been excluded.
These two adjustments give an adjusted profit before tax for the year of 64.0 million which ensures that results and targets are compared on a like-for-like basis, and that the performance outcome is not disadvantaged by the sale of those businesses, which is in alignment with the strategic objective of focusing on the core discretionary business.

A technology strategy has been agreed and is being implemented.
The goal of divesting Stocktrade as part of the strategic focus on the core business of discretionary management was achieved in the year with completion due in 2016.
Net organic growth targets of 5% were achieved despite the distraction of continued business reorganisation.
A detailed explanation of FUM growth is included in the Results section on page 25.
Client Service The quality and consistency of client outcomes continues to be high, 125% evidenced by the levels of satisfaction indicated by clients in response to our client survey and the high response rate we received.
Risk Management & Compliance The project to implement a revised Operational Risk Framework is nearing 93% completion and a new project to formalise the Conduct Risk Framework is underway.
This, combined with continued work on the Investment Governance framework, has strengthened the way that the Group identifies and manages its key risks.
The new client advice process has reduced risk to client outcomes.

With the exception of Michael Williams, the maximum annual bonus for each individual Executive Director is 150% of total fixed pay.
Annual bonus awards are delivered part in cash and part in deferred shares that vest after three years.
Figure 2.3 shows how the split is calculated: Figure 2.3: 2015 Executive Directors deferral rates for 2015 bonus award Portion of variable pay Fraction deferred Up to 50,000 None Between 50,000 and 1 x fixed remuneration One-third Above 1 x fixed remuneration Two-thirds In Michael Williams case, as he is an Investment Manager with significantly lower base pay, the first 50,000 is in cash, and the balance above 50,000 is two-thirds cash one-third shares.
The Committee has the discretion to adjust the final outcome upwards or downwards in the event that an exceptional event outside of the Executive Directors control occurs which, in the Committees opinion, materially affected the bonus out-turn.
There were no such events during 2015.
Both the cash and share element of the bonus is subject to clawback.

Employees may use funds from their gross salary up to a maximum of 10% of their gross salary in regular monthly payments being not less than 10 and not greater than 125 to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company Partnership Shares.
Partnership Shares are acquired monthly.
For every Partnership Share purchased, the employee receives one matching share up to a total value of 20 per month.
All shares to date awarded under this scheme have been purchased in the market on a monthly basis: it is the intention of the Directors to continue this policy in the year to September 2016.
Share schemes under which no awards were made in 2015 2004 Approved Share Option Plan ASOP Awards under the ASOP have been historically granted to Directors and other employees.
These awards have been subject to a condition that the year-on-year growth in annual fee income charged on portfolios shall not be less than 10% p. a. compound or a 33% increase in annual fee income over a three-year period.
The performance criteria were set by the Remuneration Committee at the time of grant and selected to recognise that income growth is a key driver of shareholder value.
The options are exercisable from five to 10 years from grant.
These options were only granted once an employee had been with the Group for two years.
Awards have not been made under the ASOP since 2011.
The Board does not intend to issue any options or shares under this scheme in 2016.
2002 Senior Employee Matching Purchase Share Scheme SEMP Awards have not been made under this scheme since 2009.

The Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding equivalent to 100% of total base pay over a period of five years, excluding awards that have not yet vested or have vested but not yet been exercised.
Andrew Westenberger and David Nicol have not yet met this requirement as they are still within a five-year period following their appointment to the Board in 2013.
At the date of his last sale of Brewin Dolphin shares, Stephen Fords remaining shareholding was in excess of the 100% target.
His shareholding as a % of base pay at 30 September 2015 was 98% as a result of share price movements between the sale of shares and the year end share price.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to hold shares in the Company but are not subject to a formal shareholding guideline.

Chief Executives Remuneration Figure 6 shows the movement in the salary and annual bonus for the Chief Executive between the current and previous financial year compared to that for the average UK employee.
Rather than having separate base salary, pension and benefit components, Executive Directors and other senior staff receive a total fixed pay sum which they can receive part as a defined pension contribution and or benefits such as car benefit, private medical insurance or long-term illness disability insurance.
More junior staff receive a fixed salary plus additional pension contributions.

This benchmarking exercise has shown that base pay had fallen further below competitive levels, particularly considering that there is no pension provision for Executive Directors, and also did not recognise the delivery of a high level of performance by the Executive Directors since appointment.
The Committee is consulting with key institutions and shareholder representative bodies on this issue and will decide whether the Executive Directors base salaries should be adjusted during the 2016 performance year.
The current salaries are shown in Figure 11: Figure 11: Current salaries for the Executive Directors Salary as at Salary as at 30 September 28 September 2015 2014 Change David Nicol 350,000 350,000 Stephen Ford 300,000 300,000 Andrew Westenberger 300,000 300,000 ii Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors As detailed in the Remuneration Policy, the Groups approach to setting the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors remuneration is with reference to market levels in comparably sized FTSE companies, levels of responsibility and time commitments.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors fees were reviewed in November 2015 and Non-Executive Directors fees will remain unchanged for 2015 16.
With regard to the Chairman, it was concluded that his fee should be increased to 180,000 with effect from 1 January2016 to reflect significant additional time commitment to the Company.
In order to fulfil this additional commitment, the Chairman had reduced his time committed to other appointments.

Profit and margin will be adjusted to exclude the impact of exceptional items.
The LTIP awards granted in the 2016 financial year will be subject to two separate performance conditions, each accounting for one-half of the award.
The metrics are aligned to the Groups strategic objectives.
The performance conditions are as follows: Figure 13: Performance targets for the LTIP awards to be granted in 2016 financial year Weighting each measured Threshold Stretch Performance Metric independently 25% vesting 100% vesting Measurement period measured over the three financial 1 Adjusted EPS 5% years 15 16, 16 17, and 17 18, 2 Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR 50% from a restated base 13% using 14 15 as the base year.
Average Annual Discretionary FUM growth 3 FUM 50% 2.5% 7.5% Measured in 2018 19 financial year 1 The threshold performance requirement of 5% CAGR is measured from an adjusted EPS level of 16.1p for 2014 15, rather than the reported EPS of 17.1p.
This adjustment takes into account the value of FUM at the year end 2014 15, which was lower than the average FUM for the 2014 15 year as a whole.
As FUM is an important driver of EPS, using the adjusted figure recognises the actual starting point for growth at the end of 2014 15.
The equivalent CAGR from the 2014 15 reported EPS of 17.1p is 3%.
2 The stretch target of 13% CAGR is in excess of the market consensus of 10% CAGR over the three-year period and will be calculated from the starting point of 17.1p for 2014 15.
Market consensus is calculated using the assumption that there will be positive investment performance of 5% per annum.
3 Average annual net inflows in discretionary FUM expressed as a % of prior year discretionary FUM.
The adjusted profit before tax margin target used in previous years has been replaced for the 2015 16 performance year with a FUM growth target in support of the strategic focus on profitable growth.
The annual bonus targets for Executive Directors include margin as one-third of the financial criteria, which ensures that directors remain incentivised to maintain margin improvements.
The threshold vesting target requirement for FUM growth of 2.5% is set at 50% of the market consensus 5% and full vesting is delivered at 150% of market consensus.
There is also a general underpin: the Committee will assess the overall health of the business and whether prudent risk management has been applied and may scale back the vesting level if it considers this to be appropriate having taken account of this general underpin.

It sets out the Directors Remuneration Policy for the Group.
The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, executive remuneration guidelines produced by shareholder organisations, and the remuneration principles of the FCAs Remuneration Code so far as they apply to the Group.
Overview The Committee has full delegated responsibility for determining individual total remuneration for the Board Chairman, Executive Directors, members of the Executive Committee and any other employees designated as Code Staff under the FCA Remuneration Code, with the exception of the Non-Executive Directors.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Groups website.
In determining the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee takes into account the following objectives: To attract, retain and motivate talented Directors and senior management of the calibre required to manage the business successfully, whilst seeking to avoid paying more than is necessary to meet this objective.
To motivate and reward good performance.
To meet relevant regulatory requirements, including the requirements of the FCA Remuneration Code so far as these apply to the Group.
The main principles of the policy are to: Ensure that total remuneration is set at a level that is market competitive by benchmarking against relevant external comparators, taking account of size, complexity, and sector, and to ensure that the overall package takes account of market practice.
Maintain appropriate proportions of fixed and performance-related pay, to help to drive performance over the short and longer term, maintain a flexible cost base, and avoid creating incentives for excessive risk taking.
Align incentive plans with the business strategy, prudent risk management, and shareholder interests.
Achieve consistency with the general remuneration philosophy applied to the Groups employees as a whole.
Details of the remuneration components are provided in Figure 15 the Remuneration Policy table for Executive Directors.
How the views of shareholders are taken intoaccount The Committee will regularly compare the Groups Directors Remuneration Policy with shareholder guidelines and take account of the results of shareholder votes on remuneration.
If any material changes to the remuneration policy are contemplated, the Committee Chairman will consult with major shareholders about these in advance.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years Remuneration Report are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration section of the Directors Remuneration Report.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Group applies a consistent remuneration philosophy for employees at all levels and the Committee takes account of the aggregate rate of base salary increase for all employees when determining increases in fixed pay for Directors.
All employees are eligible for performance-related annual bonus and the principle of bonus deferral applies to annual bonuses for employees whose bonuses exceed certain thresholds established by the Committee.
The Group does not operate formal employee consultation on remuneration.
However, employees are able to provide direct feedback on the Groups remuneration policies to their managers or the Human Resources department and as part of an annual employee feedback survey.
The Committee monitors the effectiveness of the Groups remuneration policies in recruiting, retaining, and motivating employees, and receives reports on how the Groups remuneration policies are viewed by employees and whether they are meeting business needs.
The Committee does not seek to apply fixed ratios between the total remuneration levels of different roles in the Group, as this would prevent it from recruiting and retaining the necessary talent in a highly competitive employment market.
75 Additional Financial Governance Strategic Overview Information Statements Report Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Benchmarking The Committee takes account of market benchmark data when setting total remuneration packages for Executive Directors.
Comparisons are made with other FTSE listed companies of similar size and business profile to the Group.
Practices in the wealth management sector, and other related sectors, are also considered.
Benchmark data is used by the Committee as a reference point, alongside other factors such as the individuals role and experience, and company and personal performance, rather than as a direct determinant of pay levels.

targets, which are set each year by the Committee based on the priorities into shares, also for the year.
The KPIs may include, for example, profit before tax and aligns reward with operating profit margin.
Non-financial KPIs may also be included in the longer-term scorecard, but non-financial performance has a lower weighting than financial performance.
For each KPI, there is a threshold, target and stretch i. e. excellent performance level: the maximum annual variable pay is paid for stretch performance.
In common with all other employees of the Group, a significant proportion of variable pay is compulsorily deferred under the Deferred Profit Share Plan DPSP into Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC BDH Ordinary Shares or nilpriced options over shares, which vest in one tranche, normally after three years.
The deferral policy for Executive Directors is shown in the table below: Portion of variable pay What fraction is deferred?
Portion up to 50,000 None One-third Portion between 50,000 and 1 x fixed remuneration Portion above 1 x fixed remuneration Two-thirds The Committee may seek to clawback annual variable pay in exceptional situations, such as misstatement of performance, failure of risk management orserious misconduct.
1 Michael Williams was an Executive Director for part of the 2015 performance year but, as an Investment Manager, is remunerated based on the performance of his team.
His base pay is set substantially lower than other Executive Directors and his annual bonus is dependent on the profits of his Investment Management team and is not subject to a cap.
One-third of the portion of his bonus above 50k is deferred into Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC shares or nil-cost options over shares which vest in one tranche, normally after three years.

Executive Directors will be required to hold net of tax vested shares for a period of two years following vesting.
The Committee may seek to clawback LTIP in exceptional situations, such as misstatement of performance, failure of risk management or serious misconduct.
Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees The approach to remuneration for the Executive Directors is generally consistent with that for employees across the Group as a whole.
However, there are some differences which the Committee believes are necessary to reflect the different responsibilities of employees across the Group, and the need to recruit, retain and motivate employees in a variety of roles.
For example, below Executive Director level, the portion of annual variable pay that is deferred is structured differently and is capped at one-third rather than the two-thirds deferral that applies to Executive Directors.
Awards of market purchased shares are made to selected individuals from time to time, excluding Executive Directors, which vest subject to continued service, to recognise individuals value to the Group and to create further alignment with shareholders.
External Non-Executive Director positions Executive Directors are permitted to serve as Non-Executive Directors of other companies, on the grounds that this can help to broaden the skills and experience of the Director, provided there is no competition with the Groups business activities and where these duties do not interfere with the individuals ability to perform their duties for the Group.
Where an outside appointment is accepted in furtherance of the Groups business, any fees received are remitted to the Group.
If theappointment is not connected to the Groups business, the Executive Director is entitled to retain any fees received.
Approach to remuneration for new Executive Director appointments The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms and maximum levels of the Groups approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.
The Committee may also offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders, for the purpose of replacing awards or potential foreseeable earnings which are forgone by the individual on becoming an Executive Director.
This includes the use of awards made under 9.4.
In considering any such payments the Committee would take account of the amount of remuneration foregone and the nature, vesting dates and any performance requirements attached to the remuneration foregone.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments and the rationale for these.
For an internal appointment, any deferred pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may be permitted to continue where this is considered to be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders.
For external and internal appointments, the Group may meet certain relocation expenses as appropriate.
77 Additional Financial Governance Strategic Overview Information Statements Report Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Service contracts and loss of office payments Service contracts normally continue until the Executive Directors agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree.
The service contracts contain provision for early termination.
Notice periods are limited to six months by either party.
If the Group terminates the employment of an Executive Director without giving the period of notice required under the contract, the Executive Director would be entitled to claim recompense for up to six months Total Fixed Pay.
In cases of good leavers the Committee may consider a discretionary award of annual variable pay, subject to performance, in respect of the portion of any financial year that the individual has been working with the Group, although not for the period of any payment in lieu of notice or garden leave.
In the event of a change of control of the Group there is no enhancement to these terms.
In summary, the contractual provisions are as follows: Figure 16: Contractual provisions Provision Detailed terms Notice period Six months.
Termination payment in the event Total Fixed Pay in respect of the unexpired period of contractual notice.
In certain cases, the Committee may of termination by the Company also consider a discretionary award of annual variable pay, subject to performance, in respect of the portion without due notice of any financial year that the individual has been working with the Group, although not for the period of any payment in lieu of notice or garden leave.
Change of control Same terms as above on termination.
Any outstanding share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Groups LTIP or other share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, disability, redundancy, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee taking into account the individuals performance and the reasons for their departure, good leaver status can be applied.
In such cases, the normal practice, unless there are exceptional circumstances, is for any LTIP awards held to be pro-rated for the period of the performance period that has expired, and the performance conditions would continue to apply.
Share awards under the Deferred Profit Share Plan DPSP will vest in full on the original vesting schedule.
An Executive Directors service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, the Directors Remuneration Policy includes authority for the Group to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous Remuneration Reports.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration of this report as they arise.
