com Annual report 2015 85 Directors remuneration report The symbol by a heading indicates that the information in that section has been audited.
Annual remuneration report The annual remuneration report sets out the remuneration out-turns for 2015 and how these relate to our performance in the year and details of the operation of our policy for 2016.
Remuneration principles The remuneration committee has oversight of the remuneration policy.
The general philosophy underlying the reward strategy for executive directors is the same as that applied to all other employees.
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and data on comparable positions in other similar organisations are taken into consideration when determining executive directors remuneration.
The main aim of the policy is to ensure that management and staff are remunerated fairly and in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualified personnel.
We believe that: performance-related remuneration is an essential motivation to management and staff and should be structured to ensure that executives interests are aligned with those of shareholders: individual rewards should reflect the group objectives but be dependent on the profitability of the group and should be appropriately balanced against risk considerations: the structure of packages should support meritocracy, an important part of Beazleys culture: reward potentials should be market-competitive: and executives pay should include an element of downside risk.
Elements of remuneration Salary increases generally in line with Base salary all-employee increases Benefits include private medical insurance, travel Benefits insurance, and company car or monthly car allowance Defined contribution pension plan Pension or cash equivalent Discretionary annual bonus from an incentive pool Deferral into shares Annual bonus generated by reference to ROE and awarded based Deferral into underwriting on individual performance Three and five year LTIP time horizons Long term incentive plan Performance against long term NAVps targets LTIP awards may be forfeited if shareholding Shareholding guidelines guidelines are not met Risk and reward at Beazley The committee regularly reviews developing remuneration governance in the context of Solvency II remuneration guidance, other corporate governance developments and institutional shareholders guidance.
The chief risk officer reports annually to the remuneration committee on risk and remuneration as part of the regular agenda.
The committee believes the group is adopting an approach which is consistent with, and takes account of, the risk profile of the group.
com 86 Directors remuneration report continued We believe reward at Beazley is appropriately balanced in light of risk considerations, particularly taking into account the following features: Features aligned with risk considerations Share deferral A portion of bonus is normally deferred into shares for three years.
These deferred shares, together with shares awarded under the LTIP, mean that a significant portion of total remuneration is delivered in the form of shares deferred for a period of years.
Extended performance periods A portion of the LTIP has performance measured over an extended five-year period.
Shareholding requirements Executive directors are expected to build up and maintain a shareholding of 150% of salary 200% for the CEO.
LTIP awards may be forfeited if shareholding requirements are not met.
Investment in underwriting Management and underwriters may defer part of their bonuses into the Beazley staff underwriting plan, providing alignment with capital providers.
Capital commitments can be lost if underwriting performance is poor.
Underwriters remuneration Under the profit related bonus plan payments are aligned with the timing of profits achieved aligned with profit achieved on the account.
For long tail accounts this may be in excess of six years.
If the account deteriorates then payouts are clawed back through adjustments to future payments.
Since 2012 profit related pay plans may be at risk of forfeiture or reduction if, in the opinion of the remuneration committee, there has been a serious regulatory breach by the underwriter concerned, including in relation to the groups policy on conduct risk.
Clawback and malus For deferred share awards and LTIP awards from 2012 malus provisions were introduced.
For provisions for annual bonus LTIP awards from 2015 and annual bonus in respect of 2015, clawback provisions also apply.
and LTIP shares Single total figure of remuneration The table below sets out the single figure of total remuneration for executive directors for the financial years ending 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.
The share price at the time LTI awards were made was 132.7p for the 2011 award and 204.2p for the 2013 award, while the average share price in the last three months of 2015 was 372.8p.
This represents share price growth of 180% and 83% over the five and three year periods respectively.
2 Benefits for Adrian Cox included an allowance of 95,335 in respect of his secondment in the US.
This included housing allowance of 38,869 and tax gross up of the benefit of 47,471.
3 1,093,657 of the single figure for Andrew Horton is a direct result of the significant share price appreciation over the LTI periods, which is directly aligned to shareholders experience.
4 The LTI figure for Clive Washbourn includes the vesting of the first tranche of the MSIP award granted in 2013 to address a commercial risk to the business.
This was an award, approved by shareholders, with performance conditions which required sustained exceptional divisional performance.
The marine division achieved average ROE results of 53.1% as compared with a group average of 19% over the period and the first tranche vested in full.
For Clive Washbourn, 1,390,260 of the single figure is also as a direct result of the significant share price appreciation, which is directly aligned to shareholders experience.
com Annual report 2015 87 The figures in the preceding table reflect the following: salaries for 2015 increased by an average of 1.1%, which was below the average increase for all-employees: annual bonus out-turns were similar to last year, with Beazley delivering another strong performance in 2015: and LTI out-turns reflect that the LTI performance targets were met in full.
Beazley achieved sustained NAV growth of 20.14% per annum and 16.80% per annum over the three and five year periods respectively.
Beazley also achieved significant share price appreciation as detailed in the notes to the table.

com 88 Directors remuneration report continued Salary The committee reviews salaries annually taking into consideration any changes in role and responsibilities, development of the individual in the role and levels in comparable positions in similar financial service companies.
It also considers the performance of the group and the individual as well as the average salary increase for employees across the whole group.
Salary reviews take place in December of each year, with new salaries effective from 1 January.
For 2016, the average salary increase for executive directors is 1.0%, which was below the average salary increase across the group.
The base salaries for the executive directors in 2015 and 2016 are as set out below: 2015 2016 base salary base salary Increase % Martin L Bride 310,000 313,100 1.0% Adrian P Cox 332,800 336,200 1.0% D Andrew Horton 443,500 448,000 1.0% Neil P Maidment 332,800 336,200 1.0% Clive A Washbourn 332,800 336,200 1.0% Benefits Benefits include private medical insurance for the director and his immediate family, income protection insurance, death in service benefit at four times annual salary, travel insurance, health-club membership, season ticket and the provision of either a company car or a monthly car allowance.
Adrian Cox was on secondment in the US until 30 June 2015 and his benefits also included relocation and expatriate benefits in the year to that date.
Annual bonus plans The enterprise bonus plan is a discretionary plan in which all employees are eligible to participate.
The operation of a pool approach reflects Beazleys commitment to encourage teamwork at every level, which, culturally, is one of its key strengths.
The framework for determining bonuses is as follows: a percentage of profit is allocated to a bonus pool subject to a minimum group return on equity: and the percentage of profit increases for higher levels of ROE.
This ensures that outcomes are strongly aligned with shareholders interests.
A broad senior management team, beyond executive directors, participate in the bonus pool, reinforcing the companys collegiate culture.
Recommended awards to individuals from the available pool are determined by taking into account performance based on each individuals contribution to the group, including a review of performance against individual objectives.
For heads of the business divisions, divisional performance is also taken into account.
The bonus is discretionary and, rather than adopting a prescriptive formulaic framework, the committee considers wider factors in its deliberations at the end of the year, for example quality of profit and risk considerations.
In determining awards, the committee will not necessarily award the enterprise bonus pool in aggregate i. e. the sum of the bonus awards may be less than the enterprise bonus pool.
For heads of divisions a bonus may be awarded outside of the incentive pool in circumstances where the performance of a division in relation to the group is very strong.
The approach to the calculation of bonuses is aligned to shareholders interests and ensures that bonuses are affordable, while the ROE targets increase the performance gearing.
The committee reviews the bonus pool framework each year to ensure it remains appropriate, taking into account the prevailing environment, interest rates and expected investment returns, headcount and any other relevant factors.
com Annual report 2015 89 Performance out-turn for 2015 The process for determining 2015 bonuses is described below, including full details of the ROE targets underpinning our bonus approach along with the guideline levels which are used by the committee in its determination for each executive director.
ROE for 2015 was 19% and the overall enterprise bonus pool in which executive directors as well as other senior employees participate was calculated based on this.
The risk-free return RFR was set at 1% taking into account the yield on US treasuries of two to five year maturities: the committee then considered the individual bonus award for the executive directors and other senior employees within the committees remit.
In determining the bonus award for each individual the committee took into account the individuals contribution including, where relevant, the performance of their division: and in considering individual awards in respect of executive directors for 2015, the committee had regard to the following broad framework: ROE performance hurdles Guideline illustrative bonus award as a % of maximum RFR 0% These percentages are indicative only and based on broad group results.
Within the pool framework RFR 3% 12.5% bonus out-turns may be higher or lower taking into RFR 10% 37.5% account divisional, strategic and personal RFR 17.5% 75% performance.
RFR 25% 100% The framework is used by the committee as a broad guideline rather than being formulaic and applies to a broader group of executives than board directors.
A key principle of the process is that the committee exercises its judgement in determining individual awards taking into account the individuals contribution and performance.
In particular, there may be a diverse spread of returns earned across the various divisions within the business which will be reflected in bonus out-turns achieved.
The table therefore provides full retrospective disclosure of all the group financial targets that determine the annual bonuses.
Corporate achievements that the committee took into account for the year included the following: the delivery of profit after tax of $249m, and the return of $219.5m to shareholders by way of dividends: delivery of growth in our gross premiums written of 3% in a market where premium rates were under increasing pressure: continued acceleration of growth in the US in line with our strategic objective, where gross premiums written grew 21% in 2015: and continued focus on attracting and retaining the best talent, including strengthening our Asia based underwriting team to support our Asia Pacific growth.
While the specific individual objectives of the executive directors are considered commercially sensitive, the following provides details of some of the executive director achievements which the committee took into account: the continued growth of our onshore US platform where premiums grew by 21% year on year: approval of our Solvency II model by the Central Bank of Ireland CBI : growth in both our Paris and Singapore offices in terms of premiums and people: the continued recruitment and retention of high calibre staff despite challenging market conditions, including mergers and acquisitions taking place in our sector: the return of our life, accident & health division to a small profit: the establishment of our partnership with Korean Re: and continued focus on our employee engagement, being positioned as a top quartile employer in our employee survey.
com 90 Directors remuneration report continued The resultant bonuses were as follows: Bonus delivered as a mix of cash and % deferred shares of salary Martin L Bride 800,000 258% Adrian P Cox 1,000,000 300% D Andrew Horton 1,300,000 293% Neil P Maidment 1,000,000 300% Clive A Washbourn 1,000,000 300% The following graph and table sets out the out-turn for 2015 against performance and illustrates the way in which bonuses over time reflect profit and ROE performance.
The deferral will range from 0% to 37.5% dependent on the level of bonus.
Deferred shares are generally subject to continued employment.
A portion of bonus may also be deferred under the investment in underwriting plan, and this capital can be lost if underwriting performance is poor.
No such deferral was made in 2015 see investment in underwriting on page 93 for further details.

com Annual report 2015 91 Long term incentive plan LTIP Under the LTIP, executive directors, senior management and underwriters receive awards of shares subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions measured over three and five years.
The key features of the plan are as follows: 50% of the award is measured after three years and 50% after five years: awards are in the form of nil-cost options with a ten-year term: and participants are expected to build a shareholding in Beazley equal to their annual award level.
For example the CEO has a shareholding requirement of 200% of salary.
Participants have three years to build this shareholding.
Given the five year performance period for 50% of the award, as well as the significant shareholding requirement and additional clawback provisions which extend to seven years from date of award, the committee considers that the LTIP is significantly aligned to long term performance.
Against that background it does not consider that further holding periods are required.
Vesting of awards is based on growth in net asset value per share NAVps, one of Beazleys key performance indicators.
The committee considers the LTIP NAVps growth targets to be very stretching, particularly taking into account that growth must be over a sustained three and five year period.
Growth in NAVps is calculated taking into account any payment of dividends by the company.
In line with our reporting to shareholders, NAVps is denominated in US dollars.
The targets are equivalent to those that applied in 2012.
LTIP awards vesting in respect of the year The LTIP awards shown in the single total figure of remuneration for 2015 include: t he second tranche of awards granted on 14 February 2011.
These are due to vest on 14 February 2016, subject to the achievement of a NAVps growth performance condition over the five years ended 31 December 2015: and t he first tranche of awards granted on 13 February 2013.

100% Straight-line vesting between points Dilution The share plans permit 10% of the companys issued share capital to be issued pursuant to awards under the LTIP, SAYE and option plan in a ten-year period.
Following the adoption of the 2012 LTIP, the company adheres to a dilution limit of 5% in a ten year period for executive schemes.
Investment in underwriting Traditionally, Lloyds underwriters contributed their personal capital to syndicates in which they worked.
With the move to corporate provision of capital, individual membership of Lloyds has declined significantly.
The committee feels that having personal capital at risk in the syndicate is an important part of the remuneration policy and provides a healthy counterbalance to incentivisation through bonuses and long term incentive awards.
The company has operated the Beazley staff underwriting plan for this purpose since 2004 and executive directors and other selected staff are invited to participate through bonus deferral with an element of their cash incentives at risk as capital commitments.
These capital commitments can be lost in full if underwriting performance is poor.
The group funds the capital for the plan.
The individual capital commitment is then funded through individual bonus deferral.
The aim is for individuals to fund their capital within three years.
To date over 200 employees of the group have committed to put at risk 10.1m of bonuses to the underwriting results of syndicate 623.
Of the total at risk, 9.3m has already been deferred from the bonuses awarded.
The following executive directors participated in syndicate 623 through Beazley Staff Underwriting Limited: 2014 2015 2016 year of year of year of Total account account account underwriting underwriting underwriting bonuses deferred capacity capacity capacity Martin L Bride 199,000 400,000 400,000 400,000 Adrian P Cox 199,000 400,000 400,000 400,000 D Andrew Horton 199,000 400,000 400,000 400,000 Neil P Maidment 199,000 400,000 400,000 400,000 Clive A Washbourn 199,000 400,000 400,000 400,000 The executive directors are currently fully funded in the plan and no further bonus deferral was made in 2015.
Funding of 7,400 is no longer at risk from 31 December 2015 following the close of the 2013 year of account and will be released to participants.
The remaining portion of total bonuses deferred is at risk of the underwriting performance of the years of account as listed in the table above.
Malus and clawback For incentives in respect of 2015 clawback provisions will operate.
Under these provisions the committee has the discretion to require clawback in certain circumstances for a defined period following payment or vesting.
Annual bonus and LTIP awards may be subject to clawback in the event of: material misstatement of results: gross misconduct: or factual error in calculating vesting or award.
com 94 Directors remuneration report continued Annual bonus awards may be subject to clawback for a period of three years following payment of the cash bonus.
These clawback provisions will also extend to any deferred shares delivered before the end of the three year period and to the notional investment where the bonus is voluntarily deferred as notional capital into the investment in the underwriting plan excluding any returns on the investment which will not be subject to clawback.
LTIP awards may be subject to clawback for a period of two years following vesting.
Malus provisions have applied to the LTIP and deferred share plan for a number of years.
The committee has the discretion to reduce or withhold an award in circumstances of: conduct which justifies summary dismissal: an exceptional development which has a material adverse impact on the company, including but not limited to reputational damage, material failure of risk management, a material misstatement or any significant sanction from a government agency or regulatory authority: or where the committee considers it is necessary to comply with a law or regulatory requirement.
Pensions The pension benefits for executive directors and staff are provided by way of a defined contribution scheme arranged through Fidelity, which is non-contributory.
The company contributes 15% of salary for directors.
Following changes to pension tax legislation that came into force from April 2011, an equivalent cash alternative may be offered if an individual exceeds the lifetime or annual allowance.
Prior to 31 March 2006 the company provided pension entitlements to directors that are defined benefit in nature, based on its legacy policy under the Beazley Furlonge Limited Final Salary Pension Scheme.
Future service accruals ceased on 31 March 2006.
Only base salary is pensionable, subject to an earnings cap.
The normal retirement age for pension calculation purposes is 60 years.
A spouses pension is the equivalent of two-thirds of the members pension before any commutation payable on the members death after retirement.
Details of the defined benefit entitlements of those who served as directors during the year are as follows: Transfer Increase Increase Transfer value Increase in Accrued in accrued in accrued value of of accrued transfer benefit at benefits benefits A less benefits at value less 31 Dec excluding including directors 31 Dec directors 2015 inflation A inflation contributions 2015 contributions Normal retirement date Adrian P Cox 12,293 161 278,326 45,609 12 Mar 2031 Neil P Maidment 41,965 550 1,032,630 216,014 21 Oct 2022 Clive A Washbourn 18,651 244 472,962 114,889 26 Oct 2020 Under the Beazley Furlonge Limited Final Salary Pension Scheme, on early retirement the director receives a pension which is reduced to reflect early payment in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
No other pension provisions are made.
Payments for loss of office No loss of office payments have been made in the year.
Jonathan Gray was an executive director of Beazley plc until 30 June 2013, when he stepped down from the board.
He remained in employment with the group, leading the open market property underwriting team and serving on the board of Beazleys subsidiary, Beazley Furlonge Limited.
On 30 June 2015 he retired from the group.
No loss of office payments were made.
As a good leaver, the treatment of previous share awards and deferral into the staff underwriting plan was as follows: deferred shares awards were pro-rated for time.
38,810 shares vested: LTIP awards were pro-rated for time and performance.
For the 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards, the committee determined that performance be measured at the time of retirement, in line with the treatment for the 2011 LTIP awards.
Calculations were performed independently by Deloitte LLP.
In aggregate 420,575 shares vested: and notional capital which was voluntarily deferred into the staff underwriting plan will continue until the closure of the relevant underwriting years, when he will receive repayment of notional capital, along with any profit results payable or reduction for any loss result.
com Annual report 2015 95 External appointments Andrew Horton has been a non-executive director of Man Group plc since 3 August 2013, and he retains the fees in respect of this appointment.
Non-executive directors fees The fees of non-executive directors are determined by the board.
When setting fee levels consideration is given to levels in comparable companies for comparable services in addition to the time commitment and responsibilities of the individual nonexecutive director.
No non-executive director is involved in the determination of their fees.
The board reviews fees annually.
No non-executive director participates in the groups incentive arrangements or pension plan.
Non-executive directors are appointed for fixed terms, normally for three years, and may be reappointed for future terms.
Non-executive directors are typically appointed through a selection process that assesses whether the candidate brings the desired competencies and skills to the group.
The board has identified several key competencies for non-executive directors to complement the existing skill-set of the executive directors.
These competencies may include: insurance sector expertise: asset management skills: public company and corporate governance experience: risk management skills: finance skills: and IT and operations skills.
Beazley operates across Lloyds and the US markets through a variety of legal entities and structures.
Non-executive directors, in addition to the plc board, typically sit on either one of our key subsidiary boards, namely Beazley Furlonge Ltd, our managing agency at Lloyds, or Beazley Re dac, our reinsurance company.
As a result of developments in regulation, the degree of autonomy in the operation of each board has increased in recent years, with a consequent increase in time commitment and scope of the role.
Non-executive directors service contracts Details of the non-executive directors terms of appointment are set out below: Commencement date of appointment Expires George P Blunden 1 Jan 2010 AGM 2019 Angela D Crawford-Ingle 27 Mar 2013 AGM 2019 Dennis Holt 21 Jul 2011 AGM 2018 Sir J Andrew Likierman 25 Mar 2015 AGM 2018 Padraic J OConnor 20 Mar 2009 AGM 2016 Vincent J Sheridan 9 Jun 2009 AGM 2017 Rolf A W Tolle 6 Dec 2010 AGM 2017 Catherine M Woods 1 Jan 2016 AGM 2019 With effect from 2012 the standard approach for non-executive director appointments is that the appointment expires at the AGM following the end of the three year term, notwithstanding the fact that each non-executive director is subject to annual re-election at each AGM.
For executive directors there is no unexpired term as each of the executive directors contracts is on a rolling basis.

Underwriter bonus plan profit related pay plan Underwriters participate in a profit related pay plan based upon the profitability of their underwriting account.
Executive directors do not participate in this plan.
The objective of the plan is to align the interests of the group and the individual through aligning an underwriters reward to the long term profitability of their portfolio.
Underwriters who have significant influence over a portfolio may be offered awards under the plan.
There is no automatic eligibility.
Profit related pay is awarded irrespective of the results of the group.
This bonus is awarded as cash and is based upon a fixed proportion of profit achieved on the relevant underwriting account as measured at three years and later.
Any movements in prior years are reflected in future year payments as the account develops after three years.
For long-tail accounts the class is still relatively immature at the three-year stage and therefore payments will be modest.
Underwriters may receive further payouts in years four, five and six and even later as the account matures.
Therefore each year they could be receiving payouts in relation to multiple underwriting years.
If the account deteriorates as it develops any payouts are clawed back through reductions in future profit related pay bonuses.
From 2012 onwards any new profit related pay plans may be at risk of forfeiture or reduction if, in the opinion of the remuneration committee, there has been a serious regulatory breach by the underwriter concerned, including in relation to the groups policy on conduct risk.
The fixed proportion is calculated based upon profit targets which are set through the business planning process and reviewed by a committee formed of executive committee members and functional specialists including the group actuary.
Underwriting risk is taken into account when setting profit targets.
In addition to profit related pay, underwriters are also eligible to receive a discretionary bonus, based upon performance, from the enterprise bonus pool.
A proportion of this bonus may be paid in deferred shares, which vest after three years subject to continued employment.
Support bonus plan Employees who are not members of the executive and who do not participate in the underwriters profit related pay plan participate in a discretionary bonus pool.
This pool provides employees with a discretionary award of an annual performance bonus that reflects overall individual performance including meeting annual objectives.
A proportion of this award may also be dependent on the groups ROE and therefore allocated from the enterprise bonus pool.
