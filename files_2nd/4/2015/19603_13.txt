While the use of substitutes is uncommon in the market and some of our shareholders interpreted this to be a retrospective change, concerned by industry consolidation and reduction of the peer group from 18 to 15, the Committee resolved to consider the outcome under this approach.
While the Company remained below median, the gap in TSR between the Company and the peer group median reduced to 1.7%.
On balance, the Committee determined that the default outcome under the plan did not reflect the corporate performance delivered over the threeyear performance period, nor the shareholder experience of absolute returns exceeding 70%.
Applying the discretion permitted to the Committee under the Plan Rules and Remuneration Policy, it was concluded that the element of the awards subject to TSR performance would be deemed to vest at threshold 25%.
The Committee recognised that the use of discretion was not something to be taken lightly, but after much debate felt that this was appropriate and fair in the circumstances.
This part of the award therefore vested at 25%.
50% of the award was based on cumulative free cash flow performance.
The target set in 2013 was $1,780 billion.
Over the three-year period, the adjusted cumulative cash free cash flow was $1,703 billion.
These adjustments include items such as Board approved M&A, including the acquisitions of Healthpoint and ArthroCare and Board approved Business Plans such as the Group Optimisation programme, the Regranex hold, the Capex plan and metal-on-metal settlements.
This part of the award therefore vested at 42%.

InDecember 2015, he met with shareholders holding around 18.4% of the Companys shares to discuss the following issues: Previously, the Board felt that the disclosure of the financial targets used in our Annual Incentive Plan would be commercially sensitive.
However, following discussions with shareholders, we agreed to look at ways of disclosing these targets retrospectively without causing us commercial concerns.
The financial targets we used in our Annual Incentive Plan for 2015 are therefore disclosed on page 83.
We also discussed with shareholders whether the vesting period relating to our long-term share plans should be extended from three to five years, by requiring Directors to retain and hold vested shares for a two-year period after vesting.
Whilst this is exactly what our Executive Directors do, out of choice, this is not something that is currently a condition of the Performance Share Awards.
The Committee has considered this further and have agreed that this is a matter, which we would prefer to address in the context of a full review of our remuneration policy, which we shall be undertaking during 2016 ahead of putting the remuneration policy to shareholders for approval in 2017.
