Strategic report Strategic report Strategic report Financial Additional Overview Strategy Performance Governance statements information Directors Remuneration Report Dear Shareholders, Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee The discretionary remuneration of our CEO, Irakli Gilauri, is always one of our Committees most important decisions.
It conveys to our shareholders our sense of the Groups performance and prospects, how Mr Gilauri has performed, and of course, how the Committee rewards that performance.
Although the discretionary compensation of senior management is not part of our formal Directors Remuneration Policy, our views of the Groups performance and prospects are generally also reflected in senior management discretionary compensation decisions, of course always dependent on how each senior manager performs in respect of his KPIs.
As mentioned in last years Directors Remuneration Report, although the Committee and the Board rated the overall performance of Mr Gilauri as excellent, which would have meant a discretionary bonus award at or near maximum opportunity as per our Directors Remuneration Policy, Mr Gilauri requested that his actual bonus should be notably less.
Mr Gilauri was concerned that 2015 could be a considerably more difficult year than 2014, so as a Alasdair Al Breach demonstration to the Group of the need for cost discipline, he felt Chairman of the that he and the group of senior officers he leads should take a lower Remuneration Committee discretionary bonus.
His suggestion was met with overwhelming support by the senior officers.
The Committee also accepted that view.
As a result, the Committee ultimately awarded Mr Gilauri discretionary compensation of 25,000 shares, representing 27% of total salary and 55% of his maximum opportunity.
Despite the Lari devaluation and challenging macro-economic conditions, 2015 was another record year for the Group.
It met or exceeded its strategic objectives as described in the Strategic Report of this Annual Report and achieved an all-time low cost to income ratio.
Mr Gilauri also met or exceeded all of his objective and non-tangible KPIs.
The Committee and the Board again rated Mr Gilauris overall performance in 2015 as excellent and although Mr Gilauris austerity in 2014 was commendable, the Committee strongly felt that he deserved a discretionary award near maximum opportunity.
As a result, the Committee agreed to award Mr Gilauri 47,000 shares, representing 46% of total salary and 92% of his maximum opportunity.

2 At year-end 2015, NeilCo Limited, a company wholly-owned by Mr Janin, held 10,000 BGEO shares.
3 At year-end 2015, Gemsstock Growth Fund, which Mr Breach manages, held 20,000 BGEO shares.
The Directors Remuneration Policy is heavily weighted towards remuneration in deferred salary shares and discretionary compensation in deferred shares.
The long vesting periods, particularly for deferred salary shares five years, result in executive management having large holdings of unvested shares.
Accordingly, the Group does not apply a shareholding guideline or impose a holding period on Mr Gilauris or executive managements shares.
The policy naturally results in our executives holding a significant number of unvested shares and achieves a delay between performance and vesting.
We believe these results are consistent with the principles of the Investment Management Association.
As at the date of this Annual Report, Mr Gilauris shareholding remains 539,819 BGEO shares, representing approximately 1.4% of the share capital of BGEO.
The vesting period for the majority of unvested shares exceeds four years.
None of Mr Gilauris connected persons have interests in any BGEO shares.
The Group does not require Non-Executive Directors to hold a specified number of shares in BGEO.
Notwithstanding this, some Non-Executive Directors have chosen to become shareholders.
There have been no changes in the Non-Executive Directors BGEO shareholdings since 31 December 2015.
Several of our Directors chose to subscribe for shares in the GHG IPO, which closed on 12 November 2015.
The following table sets forth the respective holdings of GHG shares of each Director as at 31 December 2015.

Senior officer remuneration In addition to the CEO of BGEO and the Bank, in 2015, there were seven senior officers.
These individuals include the Banks Deputy CEOs responsible for the following divisions: Finance, Retail Banking, Corporate Banking and Investment Management as well as the 2 CEOs of GHG and m and the Group General Counsel.
Key information regarding remuneration for senior officers is disclosed below in the interests of transparency, but the remuneration of senior officers is not subject to the Regulations or to the Directors Remuneration Policy.
The principles and remuneration structure described in the Directors Remuneration Policy are currently applied in broadly the same way to senior officers.
This means that, as for Mr Gilauri, senior officers receive remuneration based on two components: salary, which includes both a modest cash sum and deferred share compensation which vests over a five-year period: and a discretionary award, payable 100% in deferred share compensation vesting over a two-year period, which is dependent on both Group performance and the executive achieving his KPIs.
Unlike previous years, we have not combined the table reflecting senior officer remuneration for a two-year period due to additional disclosure required in respect of 2015 in respect of deferred share salary.
Certain senior officers signed new contracts upon expiration of their previous contracts and increases in deferred share compensation for these senior officers occurred during the year, which has required us to calculate the value of 2015 deferred share compensation using different share values.
In addition, certain senior officers received a portion of their deferred share salary from entities within the Group other than BGEO.
Details for each senior officer are listed in the footnotes to the 2015 table.
With respect to both 2015 and 2014, the following applies to remuneration for both years: Cash salary.
Values are expressed in US Dollars but paid in Lari.
Under the deferred share programme, the option awards in respect of deferred share salary are formally granted in January of the year following the work year even though the number of deferred salary shares is fixed in the contract.
The terms and conditions applying to deferred share salary, and an explanation of why it is not subject to performance measures, are described in section 1 a of the Directors Remuneration Policy.
The means of determining the number of shares underlying this compensation and the terms and conditions are described in section 1 b of the Directors Remuneration Policy.

Committee effectiveness review An externally facilitated review of the Committee was performed by Lintstock.
The evaluation principally addressed the composition of the Committee, the structure and effectiveness of the Remuneration Policy and the performance evaluation process.
The effectiveness evaluation concluded that the Committee continues to operate and perform effectively.
Our priorities for 2016 include the commencement of discussions regarding the terms of the Directors Remuneration Policy to be proposed to shareholders for approval at the 2017 AGM.
We are also carefully monitoring the performance of senior management against expanded self-development and mentoring KPIs and are enhancing the scope of management performance evaluations.
Directors Remuneration Policy Our Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by our shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
The approved Directors Remuneration Policy which has not been amended is valid for three years from the date of the 2014 AGM and will not be presented to shareholders for approval at the 2016 AGM.
In the pages that follow, we have provided a summary of the key provisions of the Directors Remuneration Policy in order to provide context to the discussion of the implementation of the policy in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 107 to 123.
Please refer to the 2013 Annual Report for the full text of the approved Directors Remuneration Policy, which is also available on our website, http: bgeo.
There will be no significant changes between the Directors Remuneration Policy and its implementation in 2016.
Mr Gilauri entered into a new contract with the Bank, which will take effect on 1 May 2016.

3 At vesting upon exercise of the nil-cost options, the Executive Director receives in addition to the vested shares cash payments equal to the dividends paid on the underlying shares between the date the award was made and the vesting date.
Dividend equivalents are paid in Lari as at the date dividends were paid to other shareholders.
4 Work year refers to the year following the year to which the award relates.
a Salary The deferred share salary comprises the most important element of the Executive Directors fixed annual remuneration and is commensurate with his role within the Group.
By heavily weighting the base salary to deferred share compensation rather than cash, the Executive Directors day-to-day actions are geared towards sustained Group performance over the long term.
The deferred share salary component is neither a bonus nor a LTIP: it is salary fixed at the outset of each three-year service contract and is therefore not subject to performance targets or measures.
That salary, however, increases or declines in value depending on Group performance over the five-year vesting period, aligning the Executive Directors interests directly and naturally with those of shareholders.
b Discretionary deferred share compensation The Group does not operate a LTIP because it believes there is sufficient long-term incentive built into its deferred share salary and discretionary deferred share compensation.
No cash bonuses are paid to Executive Directors.
Instead, individual and Group performance is rewarded through an award of discretionary deferred share compensation that vests over the two years following the work year.
As discretionary deferred share compensation is awarded to reward past performance over the work year, it is not subject to any performance measures over the period from award to vesting.
The aggregate pool of shares available each year for awards of discretionary deferred share compensation for the Executive Director and all other members of executive management is determined annually by the Remuneration Committee in its discretion, based on a number of factors including: financial objectives e. g. ROAE, operating leverage and Cost to Income ratio : business growth objectives e. g. net loan book growth and deposit growth and fee and commission generation : risk management objectives e. g. capital strength, liquidity management and cost of credit risk : the performance of the Bank relative to its competitors in Georgia and in the light of overall global market conditions: and the market value of the shares at the time the discretionary share award is determined.
The number of shares over which an individual Executive Directors discretionary deferred share compensation will be granted is determined by the Remuneration Committee by reference to the performance of the Group and the Executive Directors KPIs, which are set for the Executive Director by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the financial year and which reflect the Executive Directors required contribution to the Groups overall key strategic and financial objectives for the financial year.
A description of the KPIs set for Mr Gilauri in respect of 2015 and his performance against these targets can be found on pages 111 and 112.
While the Remuneration Committee has defined the set of factors to determine the aggregate pool of discretionary shares and evaluate an Executive Directors performance, it seeks to steer away from defining a series of narrow objectives for its Executive Directors and does not utilise strict weighting of performance measures.
A high level of discretion is intentionally maintained when determining the quantum of discretionary deferred shares awarded to each Executive Director.
Even in a good year for an Executive Director e. g. achievement of most of his KPIs, in a bad year for the Group e. g. poor financial performance by it the Executive Director could receive little or no discretionary share compensation.
As mentioned in the table on the previous page, the maximum value of discretionary deferred share remuneration that Mr Gilauri may be awarded in a given year for the remainder of his service contract with the Bank is capped at 50% of his total salary.
c Equity compensation trust and dilution limits An equity compensation trust, the Rubicon Executive Equity Compensation Trust Trust, was established for the purposes of satisfying deferred share compensation awarded to Executive Directors and persons discharging managerial responsibility.
In 2015, Sanne Fiduciary Services Limited, acting as trustee of the Trust, purchased 282,657 shares in the market.
The BGEO shares currently committed to the Trust will partially satisfy awards in respect of the 2015 work year.
We intend for Sanne to continue purchasing additional shares in the market, but may need to issue new shares, in order to ensure that there are a sufficient number of shares committed to the Trust in order to satisfy awards.
However, the Group has committed to shareholders that new shares issued in satisfaction of deferred share compensation from the time of the Companys listing on the Premium Segment of the LSE will not exceed 10% of BGEOs ordinary share capital over any 10-year period.
d Business expenses Executive Directors are reimbursed for reasonable business expenses incurred in the course of carrying out duties under their service contracts, on provision of valid receipts.
Legacy arrangements It is a provision of this Policy that the Group will honour all pre-existing obligations and commitments that were entered into prior to this Policy taking effect.
The terms of those pre-existing obligations and commitments may differ from the terms of the Policy and may include without limitation obligations and commitments under service contracts, deferred share compensation schemes and pension and benefit plans.
