Under the rules of the LTIP, Directors are not eligible to participate.
Under the LTIP, participants are eligible to receive phantom share awards conditional rights to receive cash payment by reference to aspecified number of the Companys ordinary shares, which are paid in cash upon vesting and are made to participants based on the priceofthe Companys ordinary shares at the time of vesting.

Over and above the Annual Bonus Plan and the LTIP, which are both heavily weighted towards Group performance, Diego Hernndez was tasked by the Board to build an organisation that could sustain itself in the long term in a very competitive labour market by building a depth of talent, ensuring that succession plans were in place for all key positions in the Group and to develop a successor for the role of CEO of Antofagasta Minerals.
Over the three-year performance period, considerable work has been done and the Committee assessed that the targets were fully met.
The specific performance criteria and weightings attaching to the Recruitment Award were as follows.
Weighting Measure 12.8% Increased leadership effectiveness of the Executive Committee evidenced by 360-degree feedback and measured against external benchmarking performed in 2012, and in fully closing any gaps agreed with the Remuneration and Talent Management Committee.
61.6% Implementation of a succession plan for each member of the Executive Committee and for the General Managers of each of the Groups operations evidenced by the successful identification of at least one successor for each position that is deemed ready to assume the role at the vesting date.
12.8% Improvement of the organisational climate in the mining division, specifically regarding quality of life, recognition and development.
12.8% Implementation of a development programme for high-potential employees.
Indicative total remuneration in 2016 The Group CEOs total remuneration in 2016 will consist of the same elements as in 2015, including: Annual base salary of Ch$570,362,748 $806,737 as at 1 January 2016, subject to adjustments for Chilean inflation, as described above: An annual bonus equivalent to 50% of base salary if target performance is achieved, with a maximum of 100% if stretch targets are met: The vesting of LTIP awards granted before 1 September 2014, which using the average closing share price for the last quarter of2015 are equivalent to a maximum of 49% of base salary: and The vesting of 2015 Strategic Awards, which are equivalent to a maximum of 190% of base salary.
A significant proportion of the rewards available to Diego Hernndez is dependent on the performance of the Group.

This reflects the challenges associated with low forecast copper prices and the Groups goals of focusing on safety, costs and productivity.
Starting in 2016, the Board has determined that two stand-alone triggers will apply to the calculation of Group performance as follows: 1.
If net profit adjusted for currency fluctuations, metals prices and exceptional items is negative, the score relating to core business will be90%.
If there are one or more fatalities in a year, the final Group performance score will be reduced by 15% within the performance range.
If there are no fatalities the score willbe increased by 15% within the performance range.
In addition, the Board has the discretion to adjust the final Group performance score by up to 3%.
The Board has also agreed to adjust the ratios between Group and individual performance under the 2016 Annual Bonus Plan.
In 2016, theperformance of the Vice Presidents will be weighted 70% towards Group performance and 30% towards individual performance previously the split was 50 50.
This change is intended to more closely align the performance of the Group CEO and the members oftheExecutive Committee with the Groups objectives of improving safety, costs and productivity in 2016.
