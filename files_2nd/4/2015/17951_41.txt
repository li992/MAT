Performance and pay chart: this shows the performance of a hypothetical investment of 100 in the Companys shares as measured by the TSR for the Company against abroad equity market index the FTSE 100 Index over a period of seven financial years starting from 1 January 2009 through to 31 December 2015 based on 30 trading day average values.
TSR: this is measured according to the return index calculated by Datastream and has been reviewed by the Committees remuneration consultants.
It is measured on the basis that all the Companys dividends are reinvested in the Companys shares.

A local currency basis is used for the purposes of the TSR calculation making it consistent with the approach to TSR measurement for the LTIP.

Review By Remuneration Committee in February 2016 on basis of an internal report augmented by an assessment by the Groups external auditors of the relevant calculations.
Payout Determined by actual performance for each measure, relative to that measures performance points.
Discretion The Remuneration Committee is able to override a proposed pay-out in circumstances where, in its judgement, the overall performance of the Company justifies a different outcome, whether higher or lower than that determined by the bonus formula.
Individual performance element Awarded for Outstanding performance, by adjusting upwards by up to 20% of the annual corporate IEIS result subject to the applicable maximum award limit: paid in cash.
Individual performance rated as Requires Improvement results in the corporate IEIS result being reduced by 50%.
The Committee also reviews the personal performance of each Executive Director against his or her operational and strategic measures: which are agreed at the start of the year and which depend on the priorities for each Directors area of responsibility, in the context of the delivery of the Group strategy.
98 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements IEIS performance review presentation of outcomes Bonus targets and results 2014 and 2015 The Remuneration Committee considers annually the question of commercial confidentiality and the sensitivity of bonus targets and results.

This comparator group is considered to be the most appropriate group as Executive Directors are employed on UK contracts.
Using a more widely drawn group encompassing the worldwide nature of the Groups business would also present practical difficulties in collation as well as presenting a less relevant comparator given the significant variations in employee pay across the Group and the differing economic conditions and wide variations in GDP per capita.
The data for this comparator group is made up as follows as at 31 December 2015: a the weighted average base salaries: b the average taxable benefits per grade: and c an estimated weighted average bonus based on that population as at that date.
UK-based employees were awarded performance-based pay increases in the range 0% to 8% with an average of around 3%.

A.
At retirement the pension will be based on a 12 months average and will be provided through the UURBS.
2 With effect from 1 January 2011 being the date of his appointment as Chief Executive Designate Nicandro Durante commenced an accrual of 2.5% for each year of service on a basic salary in excess of that stated in 1 above.
At retirement the pension is based on a 12 months average and will be provided through UURBS.
Total accrued pension is the amount of pension that would be paid annually on retirement based, on service to the end of the year.
The pension-related benefits disclosed in the single figures for Directors remuneration represent Nicandro Durantes net accrual for the period, being the differential between his total pension entitlements as at 31 December 2014 adjusted for inflation and as at 31 December 2015, multiplied by 20 in accordance with the Regulations.
Nicandro Durante receives a pension in payment from the Fundao Albino Souza Cruz FASC from Souza Cruz S. A. a Brazilian registered entity in which the Group had a 75% interest.
During 2015, the Group undertook the acquisition and delisting of the Souza Cruz shares that it did not own.
This process was completed on 5 February 2016 when Souza Cruz became a wholly-owned subsidiary.
This pension benefit has been in payment since April 2012 and currently amounts to approximately 305,000 per annum after adjusting for currency exchange reflecting his 31years service at Souza Cruz.

In addition, he has an unfunded pension promise from the Company in respect of earnings above the cap on an equivalent basis to the benefits provided by the UK Pension Fund.
This is provided through membership of an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme UURBS.
Further to the changes to the applicable tax regulations, Ben Stevens has reached his lifetime allowance of 1.8 million and therefore has ceased accrual in the Pension Fund with all future benefits being provided through membership of the UURBS.
During the year, there has been no change to the overall pension entitlement of Ben Stevens.
Total accrued pension is the amount of pension that would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
The pensionrelated benefits disclosed in the single figures for Directors remuneration represent Ben Stevens net accrual for the period, being the differential between his total pension entitlements as at 31 December 2014 adjusted for inflation and as at 31 December 2015, multiplied by 20 in accordance with the Regulations.

Eligibility of shares: shares earned but not yet vested under the Companys short-term DSBS and long-term LTIP incentive plans as well as those held in trust under the all-employee share ownership plan SIP are not eligible and do not count towards the shareholding requirement.

Waiver of compliance with guidelines: this is permitted with the approval of the Remuneration Committee in circumstances where a restriction on a requested share sale could cause undue hardship.
No such applications were received from the Executive Directors during 2015.

British American Tobacco Annual Report 2015 111 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Remuneration Report Annual Report on Remuneration continued During 2014, the Remuneration Committee identified a number of factors which prompted a new round of engagement with major shareholders on possible revisions to the Remuneration Policy.
The impact of the relatively severe movements in sterling exchange rates was seen as fide-linking long-term rewards for management from the underlying strong performance of the business and the impact of those exchange rate movements on actual LTIP outcomes highlighted the emergence of a gap between the Company and its relevant peers in the terms of the Chief Executives earnings potential.
The Company undertook a further short programme of engagement with over thirty of its largest shareholders in late 2014 and early 2015 in order to gauge their opinions on proposed revisions to the Policy.
A diversity of views and feedback was received and in order to reflect the views of investors in the Remuneration Committee decisions, the Company decided not to propose any policy changes at that time other than the introduction of clawback provisions for both the IEIS and LTIP.
It was with this background that the Committee noted the Companys AGM results of voting as part of its annual analysis of AGM remuneration voting outcomes and trends.
As described elsewhere in this report, the Company subsequently engaged with shareholders representing about 60% of our shares before putting forward the proposals to be considered for approval by shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
