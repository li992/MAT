Executive Directors The Committees policy for the Executive Directors is to provide remuneration which is largely performance orientated, closely aligns the Directors interests with those of shareholders and which will retain a talented executive team who can deliver excellent long term Company performance.
To achieve the aim of this policy the remuneration of the Executive Directors is made up of different elements of xed and variable pay, with a significant emphasis on performance-related pay for achievement of stretching targets.
If challenging performance conditions attached to variable pay are achieved in full, a substantial proportion of an Executive Directors remuneration will be performance related.
Overall, the Committees policy is to ensure that the balance of performance conditions in the annual bonus and long term incentive plan awards provides a good link to the Companys business strategy and continues to make the Company successful on a sustainable basis.

Persimmon Plc 60 Annual Report December 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Differences between the Executive Directors and general employees remuneration policy Performance-related pay makes up a signicantly higher proportion of remuneration for the Executive Directors and senior employees than for employees generally, reecting the role of these individuals in managing the business to achieve the Companys strategic objectives.
The Committee considers that the emphasis on performance related pay for Executive Directors and senior employees closely aligns the Directors interests with those of shareholders and helps to deliver excellent long term Company performance.
Legacy arrangements For avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors Remuneration Policy, the authority is given to the Company to honour any previously disclosed commitments entered into with current or former Directors such as the payment of pensions or the vesting exercise of past share awards.
External appointments None of the Executive Directors currently have an external appointment.
The Directors recognise that external appointments can broaden an individuals skills and experience.
If an Executive Director wishes to take up an external appointment, he must first seek approval from the Chairman and or the Group Chief Executive.

Persimmon Plc 61 Annual Report December 2015 Annual report on remuneration The Remuneration Committees Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2015 is set out below, including remuneration for 2015 and the proposed implementation of the approved Remuneration Policy for 2016.
The auditor is required to report on the following information up to and including the Statement of Directors shareholding requirements and share interests.
Mark Prestons fees are paid in full to his employing company, Grosvenor Estate Holdings.
There is a salary sacrifice arrangement in place for the Companys dened benefit pension scheme.
As a result the actual salary paid to an Executive Director while accruing service in this scheme was reduced by 9% of pensionable salary, which would have been the member rate of contribution to the scheme.
During the year no Director waived their entitlement to any emoluments.
Additional information on the amounts which make up the single gure for total remuneration is set out below.
Benets Benets include fully nanced cars or cash car allowance, private medical scheme membership, life assurance benets, income protection scheme membership, professional subscriptions and some telephone costs.
Annual bonus 2015 The performance condition for Executive Directors 2015 annual bonus was made up of Annual bonus performance condition two financial metrics, being profit and cash generation measures up to 50% and 40% weightings of maximum bonus potential, respectively, and also included two non-financial metrics, Customer care measures 10% being a customer care measure up to 10% of maximum bonus and a health and safety measure which could act as a downward modier of up to 10% of bonus.

Persimmon Plc 62 Annual Report December 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information The customer care condition was split into three equal measures.
One third of the measure was to achieve a minimum percentage of customers who would recommend Persimmon, as measured by the results of the NHBCs Customer Satisfaction Survey question, Would you recommend Persimmon to a friend?, as published by the NHBC.
This survey is an independent measure of customer satisfaction for houses legally completed from October 2014 to September 2015, measured from survey responses up to 11 February 2016.
The second measure was based on achievement of Group Customer Journey Performance documents issued on time, as measured through the Persimmon Group reporting process.
The final measure was meeting the Group Build Completion Programme target, as set out by the Persimmon Group reporting process.
However, if the Group was rated as a two star builder with a score of less than 70% as measured by the NHBC Customer Satisfaction Survey as at 11 February 2016, then there would be no customer care bonus element payable, even if some of the other targets were met.
The health and safety performance condition could reduce the total annual bonus payments if any to the Executive Directors by up to 10% if in the view of the Committee, the health and safety management and or performance of the Group is below the standard expected of a reputable market-leading housebuilder.
The Committee reviewed the Groups health and safety performance and agreed nottoreduce the Executive Directors annual bonuses for 2015.
The target gures set for each part of the performance condition, and the extent to which they were achieved are set out below.
There is straight line vesting between the relevant target gures.
The maximum bonus payable is two times base salary for the Group Chief Executive and one and a half times base salary for the other Executive Directors.

These awards will ordinarily vest half on the announcement of the annual results in 2017 and half on the announcement of the annual results in 2018.
Vesting of Bonus Share Scheme awards is not subject to further performance conditions, other than the Director must remain employed at the date of exercise subject to standard good leaver provisions.
Long Term Incentive Plan awards vesting in 2015 Executive Directors have outstanding awards under the 2012 LTIP, which have a 10-year performance period due to end in 2021.
Thersttarget has been achieved, which is to return 1.70 per share to shareholders by 31 December 2015, but no shares have yet vested.

Directors pension entitlements The value of the pension benets earned and salary supplements paid during the year is as follows.
Value of dened benefit pension Salary earned supplement Total Executive Director J Fairburn 51,635 44,001 95,636 M H Killoran n a 144,720 144,720 N P Greenaway n a 30,555 30,555 D Jenkinson 51,635 17,271 68,906 Jeff Fairburn and Dave Jenkinson each earn pension in the Companys dened benefit scheme on a career average revalued earnings basis and on a scheme capped salary currently 149,400.
The cap increases on 1 July each year in line with increases in the Retail Price Index.
Their scheme retirement age is 65 and their accrual rate is sixtieths.
As Jeff Fairburn and Dave Jenkinsons pensionable salaries in the dened benefit scheme are capped, they do not earn pension on their total base salary.
They were paid a salary supplement of 9% of the difference between their pensionable salary and their base salary in 2015.
Mike Killoran and Nigel Greenaway have both ceased membership of Company pension schemes.
Both have benets in the Companys dened benefit pension scheme, Mike Killorans scheme retirement age is 60 and Nigel Greenaways is 65.
Mike Killoran is paid a salary supplement of 30% of his base salary, which the Committee after taking advice considers is cost neutral to the Company based on the pension benets Mike Killoran previously earned.
Nigel Greenaway receives a salary supplement of 9% of his base salary.
No additional benets are receivable by the Directors on early retirement.
Persimmon Plc 64 Annual Report December 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information The dened benefit pension benets accrued for each Director serving through the year are as set out below: Accrued Accrued Increase in pension as at pension as at Increase in accrued pension 31 December 31 December accrued during the year 2015 2014 pension net of ination J Fairburn 53,804 50,614 3,190 2,582 D Jenkinson 42,475 39,420 3,055 2,582 LTIP awards granted in 2015 As described in the Annual Report on Remuneration last year, when Jeff Fairburn was appointed Group Chief Executive the Committee deliberately granted him a lower award of shares under the Long Term Incentive Plan 2012 2012 LTIP than that of his predecessor, pending their assessment of his performance.
The Committee agreed that Jeffs excellent performance and strong leadership since his promotion merited an additional award of an option under the 2012 LTIP.
Jeff was therefore granted the following option in 2015, to bring his total award to the maximum approved by shareholders for the Group Chief Executive.
Percentage receivable if Basis on Number of Initial option Fair value Fair value per Regulatory minimum Type of interest which award ordinary exercise at date of year to date of value of performance Performance Name awarded was made shares price the award full vesting the Award achieved period end date Market price specified number 31 December Jeff Fairburn 241,600 16.84 819,024 117,003 4,247,328 27% share option of shares on 2021 the basis of performance since being appointed Group Chief Executive The fair value of the award is considered by the Committee to be 3.39 per share.
This is the independent calculation of the fair value of the awards for such transactions in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and has been prepared using the Black Scholes option pricing model.
The awards were granted with an option price at full market value and the value will be dependent upon the performance condition being met.
The regulatory value is required to be included using a strict calculation which is inappropriate for this award.
It should be noted that the regulatory value has been calculated using the share price on the date of grant, it takes no account of the fact the award was a market value option and makes no allowance for the exercise price that will be payable by the Director.
The date of grant was 26 February 2015 and the share price on that date was 17.58, however, in accordance with the rules of the 2012 LTIP the market value for setting the initial option exercise price was the mid market price of a share on the day prior to the date of grant.
The number of shares that will vest is the same for all awards made under the 2012 LTIP and is dependent on the payment of cash returns to shareholders for the period 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2021, which must be achieved by the Measurement Dates set out below.
Cumulative Cash Return targets Measurement Dates Achieved 1.70 per share or more by 31 December 2015 2.80 per share or more by 31 December 2017 3.90 per share or more by 31 December 2019 5.05 per share or more by 31 December 2020 6.20 per share or more by 31 December 2021 The initial exercise price will reduce by an amount equal to the value of cash returns to shareholders made by the Company during the period from date of grant to the earlier of 31 December 2021 or the date of exercise of an option.
The aggregate number of shares held under an option that will vest by each Measurement Date will normally be determined by reference to the fraction x 6.20, where x is the value of the Cumulative Cash Return paid by the relevant Measurement Date.
The first stage of the performance condition has been achieved but no awards will ordinarily vest until 31 December 2017, at which point up to 40% of the total number of shares held under an option will vest and may be exercised.
The remainder of the award will vest upon completion of the original Capital Return Plan.
If 6.20 per share is returned early, an option will vest and become exercisable on the date this is achieved.
Persimmon Plc 65 Annual Report December 2015 Annual report on remuneration continued In considering the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied, no options shall vest and become exercisable unless, in the opinion of the Committee, acting fairly and reasonably, the cash returns paid by the Company are nanced out of retained earnings and the Company has an ungeared balance sheet at the relevant Measurement Date, except to take account of events and or circumstances which the Committee fairly and reasonably determines are appropriate the Underpin.
If the cash return of 1.70 had not been met by 31 December 2015, the 2012 LTIP would have expired on 31 December 2015 and all options would have lapsed in full on that date.
If the Cumulative Cash Return is not achieved by a future Measurement Date options will vest and become exercisable on the Measurement Date by which the Cash Return for that date has not been achieved and the number of shares that vest will be reduced accordingly.
Once an option vests and becomes exercisable, a participant will be able to sell sufficient shares to pay the tax and national insurance payable but will be required to retain half of the balance of their shares for at least 12 months from date of exercise.
Payments for loss of ofce There were no payments for loss of ofce in 2015.
Payments to past Directors There were no payments to past Directors for the year ended 31 December 2015 where the total payment to the former Director exceeded a threshold set by the Company of 60,000.
Service contracts The Executive Directors have service contracts with a 12-month notice period.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not employees, they have letters of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities: they do not have service contracts.
The Chairmans continued appointment is subject to his re-election by shareholders at each AGM and may be terminated on six months notice.
A Non-Executives appointment is initially for a three-year term, subject to re-election at each AGM but their appointment may be terminated on one months notice.
There are no change of control provisions in the Executive Directors service contracts.
The rules of the Companys share schemes provide for early exercise of awards on a takeover or change of control.

Group Chief Executive change in remuneration Set out below is a comparison of the change in remuneration of the Group Chief Executive from 2014 to 2015, compared to the change in remuneration of the Groups salaried employees.
We have selected the salaried workforce as the comparator group as this includes 2,729 2014: 2,430 junior to senior employees with the most relevant pay structure.
Percentage change from 2014 to 2015 Value of taxable Annual salary Bonus benets Group Chief Executive 3.0% 9.5% 9.2% Average of salaried employees 3.4% 12.7% 8.2% The average bonus and average value of benets per salaried employee fell over the year due to the dilution effect of the increased number of more junior employees and trainees, recruited to support the growth of the business.
These employees generally receive a lower percentage bonus and lower value benets than managers and directors.

Dave Jenkinson has been awarded a salary of 500,000 from 1 January 2016.
This is as a result of his promotion from North Division Chief Executive to Group Managing Director and his additional responsibilities in overseeing all of the Groups operating businesses.
Base salary from 1 January 2016 2015 Jeff Fairburn 655,600 636,500 Dave Jenkinson 500,000 339,500 Mike Killoran 496,870 482,400 Nigel Greenaway 349,700 339,500 Nigel Greenaway will retire from the Board on 14 April 2016 and from the Group on 30 April 2016.
His base salary and salary supplement will both cease on the date he leaves the Group.
Annual bonus In line with the Companys strategy to improve margins and return cash to shareholders under the Capital Return Plan, the Committee has decided that the most appropriate performance condition for 2016 annual bonus will again primarily be based on profit before tax and cash generation measures, plus conditions relating to customer satisfaction, which will account for 10% of the maximum bonus opportunity.
Health and safety outcomes may act as a downward modier of up to 10% of the bonus outcome.
The Committee considers that the chosen annual bonus performance targets and maximum award levels achieve their aim of having a large part of an Executive Directors remuneration performance related and that those performance conditions are closely aligned to the Companys strategy to grow the business, improve margins and increase cashow.
They also link the Executive Directors remuneration with two of the Companys key non-financial performance indicators.
The targets are based on gures which are commercially sensitive, but they will be disclosed in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Committee considers that the targets it has set are stretching.
Annual bonus awards continue to be subject to robust clawback and malus provisions.
The Committee has determined that the maximum annual bonus potential for Jeff Fairburn should remain at 200% of base salary.
This annual bonus potential reects that Jeff Fairburns base salary is lower than the salaries of the Chief Executives of the other large housebuilders.
This structure enhances the emphasis on pay for performance, with any annual bonus payable in excess of 100% of base salary paid entirely in deferred shares.
The Committee notes that Jeff Fairburns combined base salary plus maximum annual bonus remains below the FTSE 100 market median.
The Committee has retained the maximum annual bonus achievable for the other Executive Directors at 150% of base salary, except for Nigel Greenaway.
As Nigel is retiring from the Group in April 2016, he will not be participating in the 2016 Executive Directors bonus arrangements.
Instead he will be eligible for a maximum bonus of 40,000.
This discretionary bonus will be subject to Nigels satisfactory personal performance.
Any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary would again be paid in bonus share scheme awards for all Executive Directors.
Ordinarily half will vest one year and the other half will vest two years after the announcement of the relevant years financial results.
Long Term Incentive Plan awards In recognition of Dave Jenkinsons promotion to Group Managing Director, the Remuneration Committee have decided that he should receive an additional award under the 2012 LTIP of 745,800 shares.
The award will have an initial exercise price equal to the market value at the date of the award, which can reduce by a maximum of 3.80 per share.
This will bring Daves total outstanding 2012 LTIP awards in line with that approved by shareholders for the Group Managing Director.
Nigel Greenaways 2012 LTIP awards will become exercisable when he retires in April 2016.
The number of shares Nigel will be able to acquire will be reduced pro rata strictly in accordance with the schemes rules.
He will have 12 months to exercise these awards and will be required to retain half of the shares received after sales to pay tax for a minimum of one year.
Persimmon Plc 70 Annual Report December 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Pension and Pension Salary Supplement The Committee has recently reviewed the remuneration payable to Dave Jenkinson on his promotion to Group Managing Director.
As part of that review it became apparent that the pension salary supplement payable to Dave Jenkinson in his new position and to Jeff Fairburn, Group Chief Executive was no longer reasonable or competitive.
The Committee has therefore decided that the salary supplement payable in lieu of pension to Jeff Fairburn and Dave Jenkinson should be increased to 24% of base salary from 1 January 2016.
The Committee agreed to retain Mike Killorans salary supplement at 30% of his base salary as this reects the value of the pension benets given up when he withdrew from future pension accrual.
Nigel Greenaways salary supplement isunchanged as he will be retiring in April 2016.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors fees The Committee has agreed that the Chairmans fee for 2015 should be increased by 3%, making his fee for 2016 207,650.
The Board as a whole determines the fees of the Non-Executive Directors.
The Board has agreed that the fee for 2016 should increase by 3%, making the fee 57,900, plus an additional fee of 10,000 for the extra responsibilities in chairing a committee.
The fee for chairing a committee is unchanged from last year.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the Chairmans and each Executive Directors remuneration.
The Committee is currently comprised of the following four Non-Executive Directors, who all served throughout the year.
Nigel Mills will be appointed to the Committee on 4 April 2016 and Mark Preston will retire from the Committee on 14 April 2016, when he resigns as a Non-Executive Director of the Company.
Current members Date of appointment to the Committee Jonathan Davie Chairman 1 January 2010 Nicholas Wrigley 18 December 2007 Mark Preston 27 February 2012 Marion Sears 20 February 2013 The Committee sought advice on Executive Directors remuneration matters from its independent remuneration consultants New Bridge Street NBS, a trading name of Aon Hewitt part of Aon plc, who were selected by the Committee due to their expertise in this eld.
The Committee considers that the advice provided by NBS as professional remuneration consultants is objective and independent.
NBSis a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
Aon Hewitt also provides advice to the Company on the Companys pension schemes via its actuarial and pension consultancy division.
The Committee does not consider that the independence of NBS is compromised by this appointment as NBS is a separate division of Aon Hewitt based in London the actuarial and pension consultancy ofces are in Leeds and Birmingham.
The amount of fees the Company paid to NBS for the services they provided in 2015 was 16,107, charged on a time spent basis.
In addition, the Committee consulted with Jeff Fairburn, Group Chief Executive, but no Director was involved in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The Committee has also reviewed the remuneration of the Groups Regional Boards the level of management below Board level and of the Group Company Secretary.
