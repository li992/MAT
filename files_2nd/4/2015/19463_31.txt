The vesting percentages under these plans were determined on 27 February 2015 and were in line with those disclosed on page 78 in the 2014 Remuneration Report.
Using the share prices and exchange rates on the vesting dates increased the 2014 disclosed figure by 1,239,960 for Erik Engstrom and by 115,304 for Nick Luff.
