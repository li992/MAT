In 2015, the Executive Directors principally took the allowance in cash 96,000 in respect of Mr Soriot, and 49,000 in respect of Mr Dunoyer and selected other benefits including healthcare insurance, death-in-service provision and advice in relation to tax.
Annual bonus 2015 The CEO had a target annual bonus of 100% of base salary range 0-180% and the CFO had a target annual bonus of 90% of base salary range 0-150%.
One-third of the pre-tax bonuses shown will be deferred into Ordinary Shares which will vest three years from the date of deferral, subject to continued employment.
The bonus is not pensionable.
The precise targets or target ranges set at the beginning of the performance period are closely aligned to the Companys strategic priorities, set out in the global Scorecard.
As with 2014, we have set out below the targets for 2015 in respect of the achieve Group financial targets element of the annual bonus and Company performance against those targets.
In addition, we have provided the outcomes under each of the achieve scientific leadership and return to growth measures.
While, in the judgement of the Board, the targets themselves under these areas remain commercially sensitive, we remain committed to making retrospective disclosure of these when we no longer consider the targets to be commercially sensitive, which we currently anticipate to be two years after the end of the performance period as we have done for the 2013 annual bonus targets which are set out on page 114.
When assessing business performance the Remuneration Committee noted that some achievements were enabled by additional investment which was not originally budgeted when the Scorecard targets were set.
As a consequence, the Remuneration Committee has taken care to ensure that Scorecard performance has been appropriately evaluated by reference to the original budgeted investment.
The global Scorecard outcome was 160% and the Remuneration Committee determined that Mr Soriots annual bonus should amount to 175% of base salary, representing 97.2% of his potential maximum, and that Mr Dunoyers bonus should amount to 149.3% of base salary, representing 99.5% of his potential maximum.
This includes the application of the Scorecard outcome and a further performance uplift to reflect the Remuneration Committees view of Mr Soriots and Mr Dunoyers individual contributions beyond the achievements underpinning the Scorecard outcome.
Achieve Group financial targets These targets are based on the Companys key financial measures.
The annual bonus outcomes reflect the strong revenue and Core EPS performance delivered in 2015, exceeding the targets set at the beginning of the year.
Cash flow performance was also on target.

Achieve scientific leadership These measures reflect the Companys ability to deliver innovation to the market.
In 2015, we continued to make significant progress towards achieving scientific leadership and exceeded two out of five of our pipeline targets.
The AstraZeneca pipeline now includes 146 projects, of which 125 are in the clinical phase of development.
There are 15 NME projects currently in late-stage development, either in Phase III pivotal Phase II studies or under regulatory review.
During 2015, across the portfolio, 56 projects successfully progressed to their next phase.
This includes three first launches and three first approvals in a major market, and 18 NME progressions.

Individual performance Although the performance targets in the global Scorecard drive prima facie bonus outcomes, the Remuneration Committee also applies judgement to assess the Executive Directors individual performance.
For 2015, the Remuneration Committee has determined that following the application of the Scorecard outcome, Mr Soriots bonus will be increased by 175,000 from 160% of base salary to 175% and, in respect of Mr Dunoyer, by 37,000 from 144% of base salary to 149.3%.
The Remuneration Committee awarded an individual performance uplift of 15% to Mr Soriots award, which recognises his leadership qualities in driving the Company through a period of transitional change as we continue to return the Company to growth.
The Remuneration Committee in particular wished to recognise his continued focus on the Companys longer-term strategy by unlocking the value of non-core assets and technology to support our accelerated pipeline and Growth Platforms in the near term, and the acquisitions of ZS Pharma and Acerta Pharma and business development deals which have the potential to generate sustainable returns for our shareholders.
In addition, under Mr Soriots leadership we have achieved excellent three-year TSR performance against our peers and the Company was ranked as second best employer in the UK in an independent survey commissioned by Bloomberg.
The Remuneration Committee awarded an individual performance uplift of 5.3% to Mr Dunoyers award, which recognises in particular his role in delivering financial performance in line with guidance despite significant foreign currency headwinds, the successful $6 billion bond issue and the execution of the Companys business development activities.

The measure for the cash flow target for the PSP awards made in 2015 is net cash flow before distributions and other adjustments required by the performance conditions subject to any further adjustments the Remuneration Committee chooses to make using its judgement and thus referred to as adjusted cumulative cash flow, over the same three-year performance period as the TSR performance measure, and the level of vesting for the part of the award subject to the cash flow performance measure is based on a sliding scale between a threshold cash flow target and an upper target.
Vesting levels in relation to the threshold target and the upper target are shown in the table below.
Adjusted cumulative cash flow PSP awards made in 2015 % of award under cash flow performance measure that vests Less than $9 billion 0% $9 billion 25% Between $9 billion and $11 billion Pro rata $11 billion 75% Between $11 billion and $13 billion Pro rata $13 billion and above 100% Twenty-five percent of the award is based on achieve scientific leadership measures covering five areas: an NME target, which reflects the Companys ability to deliver innovation to the market: major life-cycle management approvals, which represent a good proxy for near-to-mid term growth: the volume of NMEs in Phase III and their registration: a target for peak-year sales, to track the value of pipeline output: and delivery from our research and early development organisation, assessed by Phase II starts.
Twenty-five percent of the award is based on return to growth measures based on quantitative sales targets relating to the Companys six Growth Platforms: Brilinta Brilique, Diabetes, Respiratory, New Oncology, Emerging Markets, and Japan.
As the PSP performance measures related to achieve scientific leadership and return to growth are an indicator of the Companys longer-term strategic priorities, we believe that the targets target ranges associated with them are commercially sensitive.
We will make retrospective disclosure when the targets are deemed to be no longer commercially sensitive, which we currently anticipate to be immediately following the end of the performance period.
More information about the PSPs performance measures is set out on page 126 of the Remuneration Policy Report.

Total shareholder return TSR The graph below compares the TSR performance of the Company over the past seven years with the TSR of the FTSE100 Index.
This graph is re-based to 100 at the start of the relevant period.
As a constituent of the FTSE100, this index represents an appropriate reference point for the Company.
We have also included a Pharmaceutical peers average, which reflects the TSR of the current comparator group and provides shareholders with additional context.
The charts below show how the Companys TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the relevant companies in the comparator group from the first day in the three-year performance period in respect of the PSP awards made in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and how the Company ranks against those other companies on this basis.

Before and after the 2015 AGM, John Varley and Graham Chipchase, each of whom has been the Remuneration Committee Chairman during 2015, met and or spoke with the Companys major shareholders, the Investment Association and Institutional Shareholder Services to clearly understand their views.
Key areas arising from these discussions were the desire to see a clearer link between executive pay and the achievement of the Companys 2023 $45 billion revenue target based on 2013 exchange rates, and the desire for greater simplicity and transparency in the design of executive remuneration, particularly with respect to the Companys LTI plans.
This year we have simplified the PSP for awards made in 2016 by replacing the six return to growth performance targets with one aggregate sales target for our Growth Platforms.
This will reflect performance across our Growth Platforms as a whole.
Further we have disclosed the target for this measure now, at the start of the performance period.
This is in line with our aim to strike the right balance between transparency in our reporting on executive pay and protecting our commercially sensitive information.
We gave careful consideration to whether there could be a more transparent link between the financial targets which we communicated in May 2014 and executive pay.
This has some attraction, although there is a clear balance to be struck given the need to ensure that our arrangements are simple, practicable and aligned to our business.
Ultimately, following discussions, the Remuneration Committees view is that the best way to achieve line of sight to the 2023 revenue target is by ensuring that the financial and operational measures under the PSP are directly linked to the long-term business plan including the 2023 $45 billion revenue target, which we announced in May 2014.
However, the Remuneration Committee will continue to consider ways in which a more transparent link between the 2023 revenue target and executive pay may be achieved.
We intend to continue to consult with our major shareholders and shareholder representative bodies during the course of 2016 on proposals to further simplify our LTI plans for the future.

As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the Implementation Report of this Directors Remuneration Report will be proposed at the AGM on 29 April 2016.
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2016 This section sets out how the Remuneration Committee intends to implement our Remuneration Policy during 2016.
Effective from 1 January 2016, Mr Soriots base salary was increased, in line with increases in the UK employee population, by 2% to 1,190,000.
Mr Soriots target annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged at 100% of salary and his LTI plan target will remain unchanged at 437.5% of base salary.
However, the Remuneration Committee has granted an above-target LTI award for 2016 of 499% of base salary.
Effective from 1 January 2016, Mr Dunoyers base salary was increased, in line with increases in the UK employee population, by 2% to 707,000.
Mr Dunoyers target annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged at 90% of base salary and his LTI plan target award will remain unchanged at 350% of base salary.
The annual bonus measures and weightings for 2016 are set out in the table overleaf and are consistent with those applicable in 2015.
Individual performance for each of the Executive Directors will be assessed by reference to individual objectives in line with the Companys objectives for the year.
The performance measures and weightings for 2016 in respect of the LTI plans AZIP and PSP are set out in the tables overleaf and are broadly consistent with those applicable in 2015.
However, for 2016 we have decided to simplify one of the elements of the PSP by changing the return to growth measure from six key individual measures to one aggregate measure.
Furthermore, this change allows us to disclose the aggregate target for this measure at the start of the performance period, in contrast to the individual targets for each Growth Platform which remain commercially sensitive.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 121 Corporate Governance Remuneration Policy Report This section sets out the Remuneration Policy the Policy that was approved by shareholders at the Companys AGM in April 2014.
It is intended that the Policy shall remain in effect for a period of three years from 1 January 2015.
The Policy set out below has not been amended since its approval by shareholders in April 2014, other than to show changes to individual remuneration in 2016 in the Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors section on page 129 and the notes to those scenarios, which remain within Policy.
However, mindful of shareholder commentary on the Policy since its approval, the Remuneration Committee sought to clarify certain aspects of the Policy in relation to its approach to recruitment remuneration for Executive Directors and, in 2014, it adopted Operating guidelines with effect from 1 January 2015 identified on page 130, which do not form part of the Companys Policy as approved by shareholders.
These clarifications are marked in bold in this Policy Report.
Setting the Companys Policy The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting overall remuneration policy and makes decisions about specific remuneration arrangements in the broader context of employee remuneration throughout the Group.
All roles within the organisation are benchmarked against comparable roles in similar organisations and in the employees local market to ensure the Company is paying fairly at all levels.
Executive Directors remuneration arrangements are benchmarked against a global pharmaceutical peer group and the FTSE30.
Each year the Company actively engages with its employees, either on a Group-wide basis or in the context of smaller focus groups, in order to solicit feedback generally and on a wide range of specified issues, including pay.
While the Remuneration Committee did not consult with employees when determining the Executive Directors remuneration policy, it does annually review Group remuneration data including ratios of average pay to senior executive pay: bonus data: gender and geographical data in relation to base salaries and variable compensation: and aggregate data about the shareholding levels of senior managers.
Many employees are also shareholders in the Company and therefore had the opportunity to vote at the 2014 AGM on this Remuneration Policy Report.
In reviewing the base salaries of Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee considers the overall level of any salary increases being awarded to employees in the Executive Directors local market in the relevant year.
In all aspects of its work, the Remuneration Committee considers both the external environment in which the Company operates and the guidance issued by organisations representing institutional shareholders.
It consults the Companys largest investors on general and specific remuneration matters and provides an annual opportunity for representatives of those investors to meet the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and other Remuneration Committee and Board members.
It is the Companys policy to seek input from major shareholders on an ad hoc basis where significant changes to remuneration arrangements are proposed.
The Companys shareholders are encouraged to attend the Companys AGM and any views expressed will be considered by the Remuneration Committees members.
The Remuneration Committee works with the Audit Committee to ensure that the Groups remuneration policies and practices achieve the right balance between appropriate incentives to reward good performance, managing risk, and the pursuit of the Companys business objectives.
Legacy arrangements The Remuneration Committee may approve remuneration payments and payments for loss of office where the terms of the payment were agreed before the Policy came into effect, or at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company provided that, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the agreement was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
This includes the exercise of any discretion available to the Remuneration Committee in connection with such payments.
For these purposes, payments include the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration including awards over shares, on the basis of the terms agreed at the time the award is granted.
Minor amendments The Remuneration Committee may make minor amendments to the arrangements for the Directors as described in this Remuneration Policy Report for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes, or to take account of a change in legislation.
122 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 Corporate Governance Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors Fixed elements of remuneration: base salary, benefits and pension The Companys approach to determining and reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors and the employee population as a whole is the same.
On an annual basis, the salaries for individual roles are reviewed in the context of individual sustained performance and the external market.
AstraZeneca participates in annual global compensation surveys, which provide benchmarking data for all roles within the organisation, ensuring a robust salary review process for all employees.
The Company seeks to provide an appropriate range of competitive benefits, including pension, to all employees including Directors in the context of their local market.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 123 Corporate Governance Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors continued Variable elements of remuneration Annual bonus All employee bonuses are determined by reference to the Group scorecard and an assessment of individual performance.
The Group scorecard is designed to reflect the Companys strategy and the focus of its business activity and priorities in the performance year.
The performance measures are recommended by the CEO and determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each year.
They are designed to ensure that all eligible employees receive an element of reward based on the Groups overall financial and non-financial performance.
A scorecard approach ensures that all employees across functions and geographies are focused on the activities critical to delivering the business strategy.
The performance measures and weightings underlying the annual bonus plan will be disclosed in advance.
The outcomes against targets, for reasons of commercial sensitivity, will be disclosed in arrears.
The Implementation Report will identify, in arrears, the performance versus the objectives and the consequent levels of remuneration deemed appropriate by the Remuneration Committee.
For Executive Directors, one-third of their pre-tax annual bonus is delivered in shares, which are deferred for three years, under the Deferred Bonus Plan.
Employees below SET level receive a bonus in cash and are not required to defer a proportion in shares.

of corporate strategy in the relevant year.
The greatest weighting is typically placed on the achievement of financial targets, with an equal weighting between the scientific and commercial growth metrics reflecting the importance of both sales and R&D success.
The actual annual weighting will depend on the strategic priorities for the performance year.
The Group scorecard is made up of a number of separate metrics within each performance measure.
Each metric has a payout range associated with it including a target which is intended to be stretching.
In relation to each metric, a threshold level of performance is specified.
If performance falls below this level there will be no payout for that proportion of the award.
Each metric has a different weighting.
If none of the metrics attributable to a performance measure is met then a bonus payout will not be made in respect of that performance measure.
If none of the metrics is met in any of the performance measures, then no bonus payout will be made.
The Board will consider Company performance against the Group scorecard objectives as well as the Executive Directors individual performance in order to determine the value of the bonus award.
Individual performance will be assessed by the Remuneration Committee on the basis of objective criteria established by the Chairman in the case of the CEO, and by the CEO in the case of the CFO.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to move the theoretical award up or down subject to the annual bonus award being no greater than the maximum percentage of base salary applicable to that award in the year in question.
The Remuneration Committee will use its discretion to ensure that a fair and balanced outcome is achieved, taking into account the overall performance of the Company and the experience of its shareholders.
Two-thirds of the annual bonus is delivered in cash and one-third is delivered in shares, which are deferred for three years as explained opposite.
The annual bonus, including the deferred share element, payable for target performance for the CEO is currently 100% of base salary and for the CFO is currently 90% of base salary.
For bonuses awarded in respect of 2015 and subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee will have discretion, for up to six years from the payment date, to claw back from individuals some or all of the cash bonus award in certain circumstances including i material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual.
However, in the case of i and ii the Remuneration Committee may only exercise its discretion for up to two years from the payment date.

Executive Directors Directors must normally remain in employment for three years from grant interests with those for deferred shares to vest.
Once performance measures have been applied to determine the value of the total bonus, no further performance measures apply to the deferred share element.
For deferred share elements relating to bonuses awarded in respect of 2015 and subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee has discretion: to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested deferred bonus award in certain circumstances malus, including i material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual for up to six years from the vesting date, to claw back from individuals some or all of the deferred bonus award in certain circumstances, including i material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual.
However, in the case of i and ii the Remuneration Committee may only exercise its discretion for up to two years from the vesting date.
Long Term Incentives LTIs Overview: An Executive Directors target LTI award is considered annually and set at a level which takes account of market analysis.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to grant awards above or below target based on individual performance and potential.
The CEOs current LTI target is 250% of base salary on an expected value basis, and the CFOs current LTI target is 200% of base salary on an expected value basis.
An illustration of the expected value basis can be found in the Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors section on page 129.
The Companys variable long-term arrangements for Executive Directors currently comprise two LTI plans: the PSP and the AZIP.
Under each of these plans the maximum market value of shares that may be awarded is 500% of a participants base salary.
If the Remuneration Committee ever felt that it would be in the interests of shareholders to grant annual variable awards to an Executive Director with values exceeding the historical range of up to 500% in aggregate under the LTI plans, it would consult major shareholders in advance.
Currently when LTI awards are granted to Executive Directors, the split between the two plans is weighted in the proportion: 75% PSP and 25% AZIP.
When granting LTI awards the Remuneration Committee applies a target as a percentage of base salary on an expected value basis.
For the AZIP, the expected value on vesting is 100% of the value of the award at grant.
For the PSP, the expected value on vesting is 50% of the value of the award at grant.
The table overleaf explains the operation, minimums and maximums payable under each of these LTI plans.
Performance measures: Performance measures are recommended by the CEO and determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance measures in respect of the PSP are designed to drive long-term performance against the Companys strategic objectives, in terms of commercial, scientific and financial success.
In respect of the AZIP, dividend-based performance hurdles motivate the generation of returns for shareholders on a sustainable basis over an extended period of time, and will be set by the Remuneration Committee at a level it considers appropriate at the start of the performance period.
The combined eight-year performance and holding period is designed to reflect the development cycle of a medicine and therefore to align executive reward with successful product development.
When setting the performance measures at the start of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee will also determine an appropriate payout curve if any, for each measure.
The Remuneration Committee will assess performance against the performance measures to determine the level of payout.
The Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to increase or decrease the payout should it consider it appropriate, subject to the maximum percentage of base salary applicable in the year in question.
The intention of the Remuneration Committee is to exercise judgement appropriately, in particular so that the experience of shareholders over time is taken into account.
As a matter of good practice, certain major shareholders would be consulted before any material change to the performance measures for the PSP or AZIP are implemented.
The Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that, on the one hand, reward outcomes are not purely mechanistic: but on the other, that in exercising its discretion, that exercise is not seen by employees to be arbitrary or unfair.
The Remuneration Committees objective is to use reward arrangements to drive performance by employees which supports the creation of value for shareholders.
Cessation of employment and other circumstances: The LTI plans are governed by plan rules, which define how individual awards should be treated upon termination of an Executive Directors employment see Principles of payment for loss of office for Executive Directors section on page 132.
Provision is also made for the treatment of awards in respect of corporate activity including rights issues, sale of a business outside the Group and a change of control.
The treatment of awards in these circumstances is also subject to Remuneration Committee discretion.
In the event of a change of control an award will vest pro rata to the time elapsed between the date of grant of the award and the date of the event to the extent that the performance measures have been met up to the date of the event, subject to the Remuneration Committees discretion to make an alternative determination.
Other employees: Other employees at mid to senior levels globally are eligible for LTI awards in the form of PSP and or Restricted Stock Units.
The occupants of approximately 700 senior roles in the Company are currently eligible for PSP awards these are the leaders who have the ability directly to influence the delivery of the Companys strategic goals.
Awards under the AZIP are currently granted to SET members only including the Executive Directors.

The three-year performance period commences on 1 January in the year of the award.
The vesting date is the third anniversary of the date on which the award is granted.
A two-year holding period commencing three years from the date of grant for Executive Directors will be included in the new PSP rules which are being put to shareholders for approval at the AGM in 2014 and, if approved, will be effective for awards made after the AGM.
These awards will vest at the end of the holding period.
During the holding period, no further performance measures will apply as performance has already been assessed.
All the performance measures have a payout curve.
The payout curves are structured in different ways depending on the overall objective they are intended to measure.
Typically, performance measures are structured such that 25% of the award will vest for threshold level of performance.
The relationship between threshold, target and out-performance will be determined by the Remuneration Committee at each grant of the PSP and is dependent on whether the performance measure is science, commercial or finance based.
An award will typically vest at 100% if the target usually set at upper quartile performance is achieved and threshold level of performance associated with any metric will be at or above a median level.
There will be other vesting points between the threshold and maximum of 100% vesting, typically on a straight-line basis where the performance measures permit.
The Remuneration Committee may acting fairly and reasonably adjust or waive a performance target if an event occurs that causes it to believe that the performance target is no longer appropriate.
Payouts can range from 0% to 100% of the original award.
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends accrued during the vesting period will be paid.
Subject to shareholder approval of the renewal of the PSP at the 2014 AGM, for awards granted under the PSP after the AGM and in subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee will have discretion: to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested award in certain circumstances malus, including i material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual for up to six years from the third anniversary of the date of grant, to claw back from individuals some or all of the award in certain circumstances, including i material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual.
However, in the case of i and ii the Remuneration Committee may only exercise its discretion for up to two years from the third anniversary of the date of grant.

Currently, two performance measures apply: dividend level and dividend cover.
Both measures must be achieved for the award to vest.
If an event occurs which causes the Remuneration Committee acting fairly and reasonably to consider that a performance measure is no longer appropriate it may adjust that measure.
The AZIP is operated over a four-year performance period, with a subsequent four-year holding period.
Performance periods commence on 1 January in the year of the award.
Holding periods run for a period of four years starting from the end of the performance period, and end on the eighth anniversary of the start of the performance period.
During the holding period, no further performance measures apply as performance has already been assessed.
If both measures are achieved in each year of the performance period, the award will vest in full at the end of the holding period.
If either or both of the measures are not achieved, the award will lapse.
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends paid during the performance and holding periods will be paid.
For awards granted under the AZIP prior to the AGM in 2014, the Company may reduce or cancel some or all of the shares that are the subject of a participants award at any time during the performance or the holding period if, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee acting fairly and reasonably, this is warranted by the underlying performance of the Company, the occurrence of an event that causes, or is very likely to cause, reputational damage to the Company, or serious misconduct by the participant.
In order to ensure consistency between our LTI plans, for awards granted under the AZIP on or after the AGM and in subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee will have discretion: to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested award in certain circumstances malus, including i material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual for up to six years from the end of the performance period, to claw back from individuals some or all of the award in certain circumstances, including i in the case of material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual.
However, in the case of i and ii the Remuneration Committee may only exercise its discretion for up to two years from the end of the performance period.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 127 Corporate Governance Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors continued Restricted shares In certain circumstances, as part of the recruitment arrangements, an Executive Director may be awarded restricted shares.
There are no performance measures attached to awards of restricted shares because typically they will be awarded for the purpose of compensating newly recruited Executive Directors for loss of entitlements on leaving a previous employment.
However, the Remuneration Committee will consider whether the lost incentives were subject to performance measures and their likely vesting.
If foregone awards were subject to performance testing, then the compensatory AstraZeneca award will normally be granted under the PSP and or AZIP in order to align the performance conditions attaching to the award to the delivery of the Companys strategy.
Restricted share awards will generally be used only when the foregone compensation was not subject to performance testing.
The Remuneration Committee may divide an award of restricted shares into tranches vesting at different points and may apply performance measures bespoke to the individual if it considers it appropriate.
If it decides to attach performance conditions, the performance conditions and period will be defined at grant.
In most instances, there are no performance conditions attached to these awards.
They will therefore vest in full if the individual remains in office on the vesting date.
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of awards of restricted shares.
Restricted shares may be used for the same purpose on the recruitment of other employees.
AstraZeneca also operates another restricted share plan the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan to provide LTI awards to eligible employees globally.
Currently Executive Directors and other senior executives are not eligible to participate in this plan.

In order to compile the charts, the following assumptions have been made: Minimum Consists of the fixed elements of remuneration only: base salary, taxable benefits and pension remuneration base salary is that applicable in 2016 taxable benefits are taken from the corresponding figure in the Executive Directors single total figure remuneration table for 2015 as set out on page 107 pension measured as a cash payment equivalent to 30% of base salary in the case of the CEO and 24% of base salary in the case of the CFO.

The face value of the AZIP and PSP awards for the CEO at target is 437.5% of base salary.
For 2015, the Remuneration Committee awarded an above-target award at a face value of 499% which is taken into account in the figures provided in the outperformance row of the chart above.
The face value of the AZIP and PSP awards for the CFO at target is 350% of base salary.
Approach to recruitment remuneration for Executive Directors The Company seeks to pay no more than necessary to recruit the best candidate available for a role as an Executive Director.
On the recruitment of a new Executive Director, the Company seeks to put in place a remuneration package which is broadly in line with the remuneration package applicable to relevant incumbent Executive Directors.
However, in order to offer a competitive package to the most capable candidate, the Company may consider providing remuneration arrangements that exceed those of existing Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee may also agree to pay allowances to expatriates in line with the Companys international assignment policy which provides for support towards housing, schooling and other relocation or assignment related costs.
The remuneration package offered to new recruits may include any element listed in the policy table above, or any other element which the Remuneration Committee considers is appropriate given the particular circumstances, with due respect to the interests of the Companys shareholders.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 129 Corporate Governance Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors continued Operating guidelines: The Remuneration Committee is aware that the pharmaceutical industry is global and that future Executive Directors might come from organisations with very different pay structures and practices.
The Remuneration Committee believes that it is in the interests of shareholders to retain an element of flexibility in the recruitment policy to enable it to recruit the best candidates.
However, this flexibility is limited.
As described below, our intention is to use buy-out awards on recruitment only to compensate a new recruit for awards which are forfeited at the previous employer.
All other aspects of the compensation opportunity of a new recruit will be subject to the maxima contained in the Policy.
In considering which elements to include, and in determining the approach for all relevant elements, the Remuneration Committee will take into account a number of different factors, including typical market practice, existing arrangements for the other Executive Directors and internal relativities and market positioning.
The Company may reimburse the costs of financial planning and tax advice to Executive Directors.
The Company also provides Directors and Officers Liability Insurance and an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and the Companys Articles to all Executive Directors.
The Company may find it necessary to compensate a new recruit for forfeiture of entitlements from a previous employer.
The value of such compensation cannot be anticipated and will depend upon a range of factors including the circumstances of the individual in question.
In such circumstances, the Company will seek to offer a package weighted towards equity in the Company.
However, the precise nature of the compensation package will depend on the type of entitlement that the recruit is foregoing and which the Company will generally seek to compensate in kind: the buyout might therefore comprise cash and or restricted shares and or LTI.
The Remuneration Committee will obtain and take into account independent valuations of the entitlements to determine the appropriate level of compensation.
Shares which could be offered to the new recruit would be granted under LTI plans available at the time or under a plan specific to that individual as permitted under the Financial Conduct Authoritys Listing Rules.
Performance measures may apply to such share awards.
The Companys policy seeks to link the performance of the Executive Director to the performance of the Company in any given period.
The precise targets and measures will depend on the objectives of the Company and the individual at that time and will be determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The Company will not offer cash or shares to newly recruited Executive Directors as a bonus, or golden hello on joining other than to compensate for the loss of a previous remuneration opportunity.
Where compensation is offered to a new recruit on his or her hire, the Company will explain the reasons for this to shareholders in a timely manner, and will provide details of the payments.
Operating guidelines: The Remuneration Committee will not grant cash or share awards as a golden hello.
As described above, cash or share awards granted on joining the Company will be to compensate a new recruit for loss of previous remuneration awards only.
Ongoing annual variable remuneration will not exceed an award which comprises up to 250% of base salary under the annual bonus, and up to 500% of base salary under the PSP and up to 500% of base salary under the AZIP.
If the Remuneration Committee ever felt that it would be in the interests of shareholders to grant annual variable awards to a new Executive Director with values exceeding the historical range of 0 680% of base salary comprising up to 180% under the annual bonus and up to 500% in aggregate under the LTI plans, it would consult major shareholders in advance.
The Company intends to honour all remuneration arrangements previously entered into in the case of Group employees who are promoted to the position of an Executive Director.
130 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 Corporate Governance Service contracts for Executive Directors Save as noted below, it is not intended that service contracts for new Executive Directors will contain terms that are materially different from those summarised below or contained in the Policy set out in this Remuneration Policy Report.
The contractual obligations below are applicable to each of the current Executive Directors unless stated otherwise, and to the Executive Directors only.
Notice period The Company may terminate the employment of an Executive Director by giving not less than 12 months written notice.
The Company may agree, on the appointment of a new Executive Director, that any notice given by the Company will not expire prior to the second anniversary of the commencement date of the Executive Directors appointment.
The Company agreed to such a provision in the case of Mr Dunoyer.
An Executive Director may terminate his employment on 12 months written notice.
Payment in The Company may terminate an Executive Directors contract at any time with immediate effect and pay him a lieu of notice sum in lieu of notice.

The payment in lieu of notice may be paid as a lump sum or the Company may decide to pay the first six months of the payment in lieu in equal monthly instalments, with the balance paid within 30 days of the final instalment being paid.
Garden leave If an Executive Director has given or been given notice of termination, the Company has the right to place the Executive Director on garden leave.
Summary The Company may terminate an Executive Directors employment summarily, in particular defined circumstances termination such as gross misconduct, with no further payment.
Payments in If, on termination, the relevant Executive Director has exceeded his accrued holiday entitlement, the value of this lieu of holiday excess may be deducted by the Company from any sums payable.
If the Executive Director has unused holiday entitlement, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to require the Executive Director to take such unused holiday during any notice period, or make a payment in lieu of it calculated in the same way as the value of any excess holiday.
Directors and Directors and Officers Liability Insurance and an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and the Officers Liability Companys Articles is provided to the Executive Directors for the duration of their employment and for a minimum Insurance of five years following termination.
Deemed In respect of awards made to compensate Mr Soriot for loss of remuneration opportunity at his previous employer, treatment if Mr Soriot gives notice of termination of his employment after the end of the performance period under the AZIP under AZIP but before the end of the holding period, the award under the AZIP will vest on the earlier of the end of the holding and restricted period and the end of the period of 24 months from the date of cessation of employment, unless the shareaward Remuneration Committee determines otherwise.
If Mr Soriots employment is terminated by the Company other than in the event of prescribed misconduct events, his restricted share award will continue to subsist.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2015 131 Corporate Governance Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors continued Principles of payment for loss of office for Executive Directors The Company does not make additional payments for loss of office, other than, as appropriate, payments in lieu of notice as described above or payments in respect of damages if the Company terminates an Executive Directors service contract in breach of contract taking into account, as appropriate, the Directors ability to mitigate his loss.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to award payments in certain circumstances, as set out below, depending on the nature of the termination and the Executive Directors performance.
The LTI plans are governed by plan rules, which define how individual awards under those plans should be treated upon termination of employment.
Provision is also made for the treatment of awards in respect of corporate activity including sale of a business outside the Group.
The treatment of awards in these circumstances may also be subject to Remuneration Committee discretion.
Generally, awards under LTI plans will only be allowed to vest for those Executive Directors who leave the Company by mutual agreement, for example in circumstances of ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement, or where employment terminates by reason of the Executive Directors death see the table opposite for further information.
In addition to any payment in lieu of notice, the individual components of remuneration and other payments which may be payable on loss of office are set out below, subject to the terms of any applicable bonus rules or share incentive plan rules: Annual bonus An Executive Director may receive a bonus for the performance year in which he leaves the Company.
Typically this sum will reflect an on-target bonus pro-rated for the part of the year in which he worked.
This is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and will depend on the circumstances, including an assessment of the Executive Directors performance in the relevant period and the circumstances of his departure.
The deferred share element of previous bonuses granted, and any deferred share element of the bonus awarded in respect of the departing year, may still vest for the benefit of the departing Executive Director at the end of the period of deferral despite the fact that the Executive Director did not work for the entirety of this period.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to accelerate and or retain the deferral period and allow shares to vest for the benefit of the Executive Director on his departure and or in accordance with the vesting schedule as the case may be.
The Remuneration Committee will decide whether it is appropriate in the circumstances for these shares to vest for the benefit of the departing Executive Director.
LTI plans The rules of the LTI plans envisage circumstances under which some, all or none of an Executive Directors shares held under LTI plans will vest in connection with his departure.
The exact timing and number of shares vesting will depend on the circumstances, including the Executive Directors reason for leaving as set out in the table opposite and may be subject to Remuneration Committee discretion, depending on what it considers to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
Restricted share awards and awards under the RSP The treatment on termination will depend upon the terms of the individual Executive Directors awards on recruitment.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine the treatment at the time of departure based on what it considers to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
Non-statutory redundancy payment Executive Directors are not entitled to non-statutory redundancy payments.
Pension contributions and other benefits Pension contributions and other benefits for Executive Directors will be payable up to the termination date or as part of a payment in lieu of notice as described on page 131.
Payments in relation to statutory rights The amount considered reasonable to pay by the Remuneration Committee in respect of statutory rights may be included in the overall termination payment.
Payments required by law The Company may pay damages, awards, fines or other compensation awarded to or in respect of an Executive Director by any competent court or tribunal or other payments required to be made on termination of employment by any applicable law, regulator or collective labour agreement.
Mitigation The departing Executive Director will be required to mitigate his loss by using reasonable efforts to secure new employment.
