As such, there is no threshold or target performance defined for this element of pay.
The figures shown in the chart below for the CFOs DFSS bonus include the value of the actual DFSS bonus paid in 2015.
Under all scenarios, potential reward opportunities are based on expected awards for 2016 in accordance with Admirals Remuneration Policy, applied to salaries as at 31 December 2015.

DFSS bonus in respect of 2015 The Group paid a bonus to all holders of DFSS shares in 2015, which was equivalent to the dividend payable on all outstanding DFSS shares awarded but not yet vested.
The Committee continues to feel that having a Group-wide bonus equivalent to the dividend flow received by investors further aligns the incentive structure with shareholders.
Neither Henry Engelhardt nor David Stevens received a DFSS bonus.
From 2015, DFSS bonus payments will be subject to clawback in exceptional circumstances, such as material misstatement or gross misconduct.
Scheme interests awarded in 2015 DFSS As mentioned in the 2014 report, the Company held a comprehensive review of the DFSS in 2014, and as a result, a number of changes were made to the scheme.
The key changes that have been made to the DFSS include: Increased maximum DFSS opportunity of 2 million.
Awards above 1 million are subject to a 600% of salary limit: Inclusion of 100% performance-related awards for the Groups most senior managers: Two additional performance measures, relative TSR and ROE: and Introduction of malus and clawback provisions.
Following the comprehensive review of the DFSS that was carried out in 2014 and early 2015, there are no further amendments proposed to the DFSS, except for the introduction of a sub-plan for French participants in order to take advantage of changes to the tax regime in France brought by the Macron Law.
A resolution approving the sub-plan will be put to shareholders for approval at the Groups AGM in April 2016.
In September 2015, Geraint Jones was granted an award under the DFSS of 50,000 shares with a value at the date of award of 743,500 based on share price of 14.87, equivalent to 372% of salary.
