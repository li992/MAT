60 MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Directors remuneration report Chairmans introduction and annual statement It is my pleasure to present the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Pay philosophy Executive remuneration packages at Meggitt are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of ahigh calibre, to recognise the international nature of the Groups business and toreward the directors for delivering value to shareholders.
The package targets fixed pay atmarket competitive levels to companies of asimilar size and with similar operating characteristics, supplemented by performance-related annual bonuses and an equity-based long term incentive plan designed to reward and incentivise growth, and provide astrong link to Group and individual performance.
2015 activity Having approved and implemented our new remuneration policy and package in 2014, 2015was ayear of little change for our remuneration plans.
The 2014 Directors remuneration report was submitted to shareholders for approval at our 2015 AGM, gaining an approval rating of 99.77%.
During the year, the Committee considered whether the recently implemented Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Short Term Incentive Plan STIP were providing fair outcomes taking into account Group performance, and determined that they were.
The Committee also reviewed various governance updates relating to remuneration, including feedback from the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills on remuneration reports and the Investment Associations updated Principles of Remuneration.
We approved awards under the LTIP and confirmed the vesting outcomes under the STIP awards made in 2014 and awards made in 2012 under our legacy share plans the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and Equity Participation Plan EPP.
Since the year end, we have approved performance targets for the STIP and LTIP for 2016 awards which are detailed in this report, agreed the salaries for the executive directors and confirmed the vesting outcome of the 2015 STIP and awards made under the legacy ESOS and EPP share plans in 2013, asoutlined below.
We also finalised the effectiveness review of the Committee and Kepler, our advisers, which was carried out using questionnaires and Committee discussion.
Overall the ratings for the Committee and Kepler were satisfactory: there was avaluable discussion about effectiveness but no significant areas were highlighted for improvement.
The intended remuneration arrangements for 2016, outlined in this report, are in line with thePolicy approved by shareholders at our 2014 annual general meeting AGM.
2015 performance Group revenue was flat year on year on an organic basis, with 4% organic growth in civil aerospace and flat military revenue being offset by a20% organic decline in energy as customers cut back on capital expenditure in response to lower commodity prices.
Underlyingprofit before tax declined organically by 9% reflecting adverse product mix, particularly in civil aftermarket.
Underlying earnings per share EPS declined by 2%.
The EPS, cash and total shareholder return elements of the awards granted in 2013 under the ESOS and EPP have failed to meet their performance conditions.
For awards made under the STIP in 2015, the profit element did not reach threshold, the free cash flow element vested at 83% of target and the personal objective element of the award vested to the extent indicated on page 71 for each director.
This outcome would have resulted in STIP payouts of 61%-71% of salary for the executive directors.
However, in recognition of the fact that Group profit performance was below threshold in 2015, the executive directors agreed with the Committeethat the STIP outcome for executive directors should be reduced by 25%.
This Directors remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
The report also meets the requirements of the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
In this report we describe how the principles relating to directors remuneration, assetout in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 the Code, are applied in practice.

indd 60 07 03 2016 04:28 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 61 The Policy report This section of the report sets out the Policy for the directors, which shareholders approved at the 2014 AGM and is effective for aperiod of three years from the date of the 2014 AGM.
The only amendment to the Policy from the version approved by shareholders in 2014 is to update the data used in the pay-for-performance scenario analysis to provide figures for 2016.
Executive Director Remuneration Policy Table Base salary Function To attract and retain talent by ensuring base salaries are competitive in the relevant talent market.
Operation Salary will be reviewed by the Committee annually, in February, with changes effective from 1 April of that year.
Salaries for the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
In deciding salary levels, the Committee considers personal performance including how the individual has helped to support the strategic objectives of the Group.
The Committee will also consider employment conditions and salary levels across the Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Salaries are paid to existing directors in GBP: however the Committee reserves the right to pay future and existing directors in any other currency converted at the prevailing market rate when achange is agreed.
Opportunity It is not anticipated that percentage salary increases for executive directors will exceed those of the wider workforce over the period this Policy will apply.
Where increases are awarded in excess of the wider employee population, for example if there is amaterial change in the responsibility, size or complexity of the role, the Committee will provide the rationale in the relevant years annual report on remuneration.
Performance None explicitly, but salaries are independently benchmarked periodically against FTSE companies in similar metrics industries and those with similar market capitalisation.
Personal performance is also taken into account when considering salary increases.
Pension Function To provide post-retirement benefits for executive directors in acost-efficient manner.
Operation The pension plans operated by the Group which executive directors are, or could be, members of are: Meggitt Pension Plan defined benefit pension plan, closed to new members.
Meggitt Workplace Savings Plan defined contribution personal pension scheme, open to new members.
Salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable.
There are no unfunded pension promises orsimilar arrangements for directors.
Opportunity From 2013, it has been our Policy that new executive director external appointments are eligible for apension allowance of 25% of salary, payable either as pension contribution up to any limit set in current regulations or, abovesuch limits, in cash.
Where agreements have been made prior to the approval of this Policy which entitle an executive to receive apension allowance higher than 25% of salary, pension allowances up to amaximum of 50% of salary, will be paid: Mr Young and Mr Green had agreements prior to the approval of this Policy which entitle them to receive apension allowance of 50% of salary and this arrangement will continue for these directors.
indd 61 07 03 2016 04:28 62 MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Directors remuneration report continued Benefits Function To provide non-cash benefits which are competitive in the market in which the executive director is employed.
Operation The Group may provide benefits including, but not limited to, acompany car or car allowance, private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, life assurance, afuel allowance, amobile phone, relocation costs and any other future benefits made available either to all employees globally or all employees in the region in which the executive director is employed.
Opportunity Benefits vary by role and individual circumstances: eligibility and cost is reviewed periodically.
Benefits in respect of the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
It is not anticipated that the costs of benefits provided will increase significantly in the financial years over which this Policy will apply, although the Committee retains discretion to approve ahigher cost in exceptional circumstances e. g. to facilitate recruitment, relocation, expatriation etc.
or in circumstances where factors outside the Groups control have changed materially e. g. market increases in insurance costs.
metrics Annual bonus Short Term Incentive PlanSTIP Function To incentivise executive directors on delivering annual financial and personal targets.
Operation Performance measures, targets and weightings are set at the start of the year.
The performance period of the STIP is afinancial year.
After the end of the financial year, to the extent that the performance criteria have been met, 75% of the STIP award is paid in cash to the director.
The remaining 25% ofthe award will be deferred into shares and released with no further performance conditions attached, and nomatching shares provided after afurther period of two years.
Under the STIP 2014 rules as approved by the Committee, the Committee may decide to apply malus and or clawback to STIP awards and deferred STIP awards to reduce the vesting of awards and or require repayment of awards in the event of areview of the conduct, capability or performance of the director where there has been misconduct by the director or material misstatement of the Companys or aGroup members financial results forany period.
Deferred STIP awards may lapse in certain leaver circumstances see page 67.
Opportunity The STIP provides for amaximum award opportunity of up to 150% of salary in normal circumstances with an on-target opportunity of 100% of salary and an opportunity of 50% of salary at threshold.
The Committee has discretion to make aSTIP award of up to 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances e. g. asubstantial contract win which has asignificant positive financial impact in the long term but which has no, or negative, short term financial impact.
Dividends accrue on unvested deferred STIP awards over the vesting period and are released on the vesting date.
Performance STIP awards are based on the achievement of financial and personal performance targets.
For the executive metrics directors, two-thirds of the STIP will be weighted to financial performance, with the remainder subject to personal performance.
The relative weightings of the financial and personal elements for any STIP period, andthe measures used to assess financial and non-financial performance, will be set by the Committee in its absolute discretion to align with the Groups operating and strategic priorities for that year.
The award for performance under each element of the STIP will be calculated independently.
The Committee will have discretion to review the consistency of the pay-out of the financial and personal elements and adjust the total up or down within the levels specified above if it does not consider this to be afair reflection of the underlying performance of the Group or the individual.
The personal performance element will typically be based on three to five objectives relevant to the executives role.
Details of the measures, weightings and targets applicable to the STIP for each year, including adescription of how they were chosen and whether they were met, will be disclosed retrospectively in the annual report on remuneration for the following year subject to commercial sensitivity.
indd 62 07 03 2016 04:28 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 63 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Function To align the interests of executive directors with shareholders in growing the value of the Group over the long term.
Operation The LTIP replaced the ESOS and EPP in 2014.
Under the LTIP, executive directors are eligible to receive annual awards over Meggitt shares vesting after three years, subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets.
Whilst it is the current intention that LTIP awards will be in the form of nil cost options, the LTIP provides, atthe absolute discretion of the Committee, for awards over conditional shares, market value share options andphantom awards.
Under the LTIP 2014 rules as approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2014, the Committee may decide to apply malus and or clawback to awards to reduce the vesting of awards and or require repayment of awards in the event of areview of the conduct, capability or performance of the director where there has been misconduct by the director or material misstatement of the Companys or aGroup members financial results for any period.
Opportunity Executive directors will normally be eligible for annual LTIP awards of 220% of salary.
Awards up to amaximum of 300% of salary may be granted in exceptional circumstances e. g. to support the recruitment of akey executive or to recognise exceptional individual performance.
30% of an award will vest if performance against each performance condition is at threshold and 100% if it is at maximum, with straight line vesting in between.
Dividends accrue on unvested LTIP awards over the vesting period and are released, to the extent the LTIP award vests, on the vesting exercise date.
Performance Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to continued employment and performance against three measures, which are metrics intended to be as follows: Earnings per Share EPS : Return on Trading Assets ROTA, which is underlying operating profit after tax divided by net trading assets, measured at constant currency.
Net trading assets are adjusted to exclude goodwill and other intangible assets arising on the acquisition of abusiness, derivative financial instruments, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax and net debt: and Strategic goals typically to be based on three strategic priorities around execution, growth and innovation.
The way these measures link to our KPIs can be seen on pages 30 to 33.
It is the current intention that the weighting of the measures will be equal i. e. one third each but that the Committee will consider, and adjust if deemed appropriate, the weighting at the start of each LTIP cycle.
Any  information on measures, targets and performance will be disclosed retrospectively.
Awards made under the LTIP will have aperformance period of three financial years, starting from 1 January ofthe year in which the award is made and ending on 31 December of the third year.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of the relevant performance period, awards will lapse.
Vesting of the strategic element will also be subject to adiscretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent to which achievement of the strategic objectives is consistent with the underlying financial performance over the three-year period.
The measures and targets in operation for grants made under the LTIP in the current year, and which are not deemed commercially sensitive are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan SIP Function To align the interests of employees and shareholders by encouraging all employees to own Meggitt shares.
Operation Sharesave SchemeAll employee scheme under which all UK employees including executive directors may save up to the maximum monthly savings limit as determined by legislation over aperiod of three or five years.
Options under the Sharesave Scheme are granted at adiscount of up to 20% to the market value of shares at the date of grant.
SIPAll employee scheme under which i all UK employees including executive directors may contribute up to the monthly maximum as determined by legislation to purchase shares monthly from pre-tax pay: and ii all UK employees including executive directors may receive free shares up to the annual maximum value as determined by legislation.
Opportunity Savings, contributions and free shares are capped at the prevailing legislative limit at the time UK employees are invited to participate.
indd 63 07 03 2016 04:28 64 MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Directors remuneration report continued Notes to the Policy table The Committee is satisfied that the above Policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-taking.
The Committee retains discretion to make minor, non-significant changes to the Policy without reverting to shareholders.
Payments from outstanding awards Outstanding awards are currently held by the directors under the EPP and the ESOS, the Groups long term incentives operated prior to the introduction of the LTIP in 2014.
These awards will continue to vest subject to performance conditions being met and be capable of exercise during the period over which this Policy applies.
The tables on pages 79 to 80 highlight outstanding and vested awards.
Approach to target setting and performance measure selection Targets applying to the STIP and LTIP are reviewed annually, based on anumber of internal and external reference points, including the Groups strategic plan, analyst forecasts for Meggitt and its sector comparators, historical growth achieved by Meggitt and its sector comparators and external expectations for growth in Meggitts markets.
STIP The performance measures used under the STIP reflect financial targets for the year and non-financial performance objectives.
ThePolicy provides the Committee with flexibility to select appropriate measures on an annual basis.
STIP performance targets are set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular personal performance objectives and the economic environment in agiven year.
For financial measures, target is based around the annual budget approved by the Board.
Prior to the start of the financial year, the Committee sets an appropriate performance range around target, which it considers provides an appropriate degree of stretch challenge and an incentive to outperform.
LTIP The vesting of LTIP awards is linked to EPS, ROTA and the achievement of long-term strategic goals.
EPS is considered by the Board to be the most important measure of Meggitts financial performance.
It is highly visible internally, is regularly monitored and reported, and is strongly motivational for participants.
EPS targets will continue to be set on anominal cumulative pence basis to incentivise consistent performance and reflect the fact that Meggitts profits are generated to alarge degree outside the UK and not significantly influenced by UK retail price inflation.
ROTA helps to balance the achievement of growth and returns.
The Committee believes ROTA is agood internal proxy for total shareholder return TSR which focuses executives on managing the balance sheet and Meggitts operational performance, whilst also being less remote for participants below Board level.
The definition of net trading assets for ROTA excludes goodwill and other intangible assets arising when abusiness is acquired, to reflect that acquisitions are not within the control of the majority of participants.
In order to safeguard against poor acquisitions, the Committee has overall discretion to reduce the outcome under the ROTA element if in its opinion the outcome does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The performance of acquisitions against Board approved targets is also monitored separately.
The Committee believes that the strategic goals component will help reinforce the realisation of Group strategy and the achievement of key non-financial and strategic goals over long product cycles which drive long-term value at Meggitt.
The element will typically comprise ascorecard of three-year targets across amaximum of three core strategic areas for the Group.
The Committee believes that this approach will enable it to reflect the Groups long-term nature and shifting strategic priorities in the LTIP to ensure executives interests remain closely aligned with those of our shareholders over time.
Specific measures and targets for each area will be developed and clearly defined at the start of each three-year cycle to balance leading and lagging indicators of performance.
Vesting of this element is subject to adiscretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent to which achievement of the strategic objectives is consistent with Meggitts underlying financial performance over the performance period.
Remuneration policy for other employees The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as that for executive directors.
Annualsalary reviews take into account Group performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in comparable companies.
Some employees below executive level are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes: opportunities and performance measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individuals role.
Senior executives are eligible for LTIP on similar terms as the executive directors, although award opportunities are lower and vary by organisational level.
All UK employees are eligible to participate in the Sharesave Scheme and SIP on identical terms.
Share ownership guidelines In 2013, the Committee increased the minimum shareholding guidelines for executive directors from 100% to 300% of base salary for the Chief Executive and from 100% to 200% of base salary for each of the other executive directors.
There is no set time frame within which directors have to meet the guideline, however until they meet the guideline they are not permitted to sell more than 50% of the after-tax value of avested share award.
The shareholding requirement ceases when adirector leaves the Group.
Further information on the shareholding requirement is in the annual report on remuneration see page 78.

Note that the LTIP awards granted in ayear will not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value excludes the impact of share price movement or dividend accrual.
The Maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration salary and benefits and pension, plus maximum payout under all incentives 150% of salary under the STIP, and full vesting of LTIP awards.
The On-target scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target STIP based on two-thirds of maximum opportunity and LTIP threshold vesting 30% vesting.
The Minimum scenario reflects fixed remuneration only, being the only element of the executive directors remuneration package not linked to performance.
Non-Executive  Policy Table Non-executive directors are submitted for re-election annually, do not have acontract of service and are not eligible to join the Groups pension or share schemes.
Details of the Policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below: Fees Function To attract and retain non-executive directors of the highest calibre with broad commercial and other experience relevant to the Group.
Operation Fee levels are reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 1 April each year.
The fees paid to the Chairman of the Board are determined by the Committee, while the fees for all other non-executive directors are reviewed by acommittee of the Board formed of executive directors.
Fees for the year under review and for the current year are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Additional fees are paid to the chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committee and to the Senior Independent Director, to reflect the additional time commitment of these roles.
In deciding fee increases, the committees consider employment conditions and salary increases across the Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Currently, all fees are paid in GBP, however the committees reserve the right to pay future and existing nonexecutive directors in any other currency converted at the prevailing market rate when achange is agreed.
Opportunity Fee increases will be applied taking into account the outcome of the annual review.
The maximum aggregate annual fee for all non-executive directors including the Chairman as provided in the Companys Articles of Association is 1,000,000.

300% in exceptional circumstances In determining the appropriate remuneration structure and levels, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of Meggitt and its shareholders.
The Committee may make an award in respect of anew appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving aprevious employer, i. e. over and above the approach outlined in the table above.
Any such compensatory awards will be made under existing share schemes, where appropriate, and will be subject to the normal performance conditions of those schemes.
The Committee may also consider it appropriate to structure buy-out awards differently to the structure described in the Policy table, exercising the discretion available under UKLA Listing Rule 9.4.

In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
The value of any such buy-out will be fully disclosed.
Internal promotion Where anew executive director is appointed by way of internal promotion, the Policy will be consistent with that for external appointees, as detailed above.
Any commitments made prior to an individuals promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the Policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Group may, where appropriate, seek to revise an individuals existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors and prevailing market best practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director, including details of any exceptional payments, will be disclosed in the RIS notification made at the time of appointment and in the annual report on remuneration for the year in which therecruitment occurred.
Non-executive directors In recruiting anew non-executive director, the Committee will use the Policy as set out in the table on page 65.
indd 66 07 03 2016 04:28 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 67 Service contracts and exit payment policy Executive director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee andare designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to manage the Group.
The Committees Policy is that executive directors service contracts should be terminable on no more than 12 months notice.
The Committees approach to payments in the event of termination of employment of an executive director is to take account of theparticular circumstances, including the reasons for termination, individual performance, contractual obligations and the rules ofthe Groups applicable incentive plans which apply to share awards held by the executive directors: Compensation for loss of office in service contracts Except as set out in the table on page 68, under the terms of their service contracts, the executive directors may be required to work during their notice period or may, if the Group decides, be paid in lieu of notice if not required to work the full notice period.
Payment inlieu of notice will be equal to base salary plus the cost to the Group of providing the contractual benefits pensions allowance, healthinsurance and company car or car allowance that would otherwise have been paid or provided during the notice period.
Payments will be in equal monthly instalments and will be subject to mitigation such that payments will either reduce, or stop completely, if the executive director obtains alternative employment.
An executive directors employment can be terminated by the Company without notice or payment in lieu of notice in specific circumstances including summary dismissal, bankruptcy or resignation.
Treatment of STIP Executive directors have no automatic entitlement to any bonus on termination of employment under the STIP, but the Committee may use its discretion to award abonus normally pro-rated.
Where any bonus is deferred into shares, the award will normally lapse if an executive directors employment terminates unless the executive director leaves for specified good leaver reasons.
The good leaver reasons are death, redundancy, retirement, injury, disability, the business or company which employs the executive director ceasing to be part of the Group, any other circumstances in which the Committee exercises discretion to treat the executive director as agood leaver or on achange of control.
If the executive director is agood leaver their award will vest on the normal vesting date, or earlier on achange of control, and would not be subject to pro-rating.
Treatment of long term incentive plan awards The treatment of awards under the ESOS, EPP and LTIP is governed by the rules of the plans which have been approved by shareholders and is described below.
Awards will normally lapse if an executive directors employment terminates unless the executive director leaves for specified good leaver reasons.
The good leaver reasons are the same as described above.
If the executive director is agood leaver, awards will vest to the extent that the attached performance conditions are met, but on atime pro-rated basis, with Committee discretion to allow early vesting.
Under the EPP and ESOS, awards vest as soon as practicable after an employee has left.
Under the LTIP, awards vest on the normal vesting date.

On change of control, Mr Green may give notice to terminate his employment within six months of the event and upon such termination he shall become entitled to the liquidated damages payment summarised above.
External appointments held by executive directors The Board believes that the Group can benefit from experience gained when executive directors hold external non-executive directorships.
Executive directors are allowed to hold external appointments and to receive payment provided such appointments are agreed by the Board or Committee in advance, there are no conflicts of interests and the appointment does not lead to deterioration in the individuals performance.
Details of external appointments and the associated fees received are included in the annual report on remuneration on page 77.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company The Committee does not consult with employees specifically on executive remuneration policy and framework but does seek to promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodiesincluding trade unions and works councilsas part of its broader employee engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Salary increases made elsewhere in the Group are amongst the data that the Committee considers in determining salaries for executive directors.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee considers shareholder views received during the year and at the AGM each year, as well as guidance from shareholder representative bodies more broadly.
The majority of shareholders continue to express support of remuneration arrangements at Meggitt.

There was one meeting between the end of the financial year and the date of signing of this report, which all current members of the Committee attended.
The Committee operates within agreed Terms of Reference, which are available on our website and were updated in 2014.
The Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration policy and packages for all executive directors and direct reports to the Chief Executive covering five of the next most senior executives across the Group and for agreeing the fees for the Chairman.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and Organisational Development Director attend meetings of the Committee byinvitation: they are absent when their own remuneration is under consideration.
None of the non-executive directors has, or has had, any personal financial interests or conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
Advisors to the Committee During the year, the Committees independent remuneration advisors were Kepler who were appointed in 2010 after acompetitive tender process was run by the Committee.
During 2015, Kepler were acquired by Mercer.
The Committee considered this development in light of the existing business relationship between the Company and Mercer, as Mercer act as the Companys primary advisors on UK pensions and benefits.
However the Committee determined that this did not impact Keplers independence and that they were satisfied that Kepler could continue to act as advisors to the Committee.
The Committee evaluates the support provided by Kepler annually and is comfortable that they provide effective and independent remuneration advice to the Committee.
Kepler provide guidance on remuneration matters at Board level and below.
Kepler do not have any other connection with the Group.

Percentage change in CEO cash remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in remuneration for all executive employees.
We have selected our executive population around 300 people for this comparison because it is considered to be the most relevant, due to the structure of total remuneration: most of our senior executives receive benefits under the same STIP and LTIP structure as our CEO.
2 The base salary for executive employees is calculated using the increase in the earnings of full-time executive employees using the same employee data set in 2014 and 2015.
Approximately 50% of the executive employees had pay rises of 2% or less, 20% had pay rises of between 2 and 5% and the remainder had pay rises of over 5%.
Pay rises above 2% are awarded on merit, for increased responsibilities or to bring salaries in line with benchmark.
3 For benefits, this information is not collected for the executive employee population and is therefore estimated from asample of executive employees, using aconsistent set of employees.
4 For STIP, the increase is estimated as at 15 February 2016 as the validation processes for personal performance ratings for executive employees below the level of the Board Group Executive Committee is not yet complete.
To the extent there is asignificant variation between the actual outcome and the estimate, this will be declared in the 2016 Directors remuneration report.

2016 STIP measures STIP measures for 2016 are based on underlying operating profit one third, free cash flow one third and personal performance one third.
The STIP targets for 2016, together with details of whether they have been met, will be disclosed subject to commercial sensitivity in the 2016 Directors remuneration report.
The opportunity is in line with the Policy disclosed on page 62.
2016 LTIP measures The executive directors will be granted awards under the LTIP, the vesting of which will be subject to the measures shown below.
The Committee sets performance measures for underlying EPS, ROTA and organic revenue growth annually using aconsistent method, with reference to performance in the prior year 2015 and the Groups budget for 2016.
For EPS, the Committee also takes into account other external benchmarks such as analyst consensus EPS, and EPS ranges for comparator companies.
The organic growth range also takes into account external market trends.
The targets for the 2016 LTIP award have been set in relation to these reference points and the 2015 outturn which was lower than for 2014 and are considered by the Committee to be appropriately stretching for the three-year cycle.
A number of the strategic measures have agreed annual schedules and, to ensure that the LTIP targets for these measures remain relevant and stretching over the entire three-year performance period, targets for these measures will be set as three sets of annual targets i. e. at the start of each year and measured over a12-month period.
Therefore, the quality and delivery targets shown below are effective for year 1 of the 2016 LTIP award, year 2 of the 2015 LTIP award and year 3 of the 2014 LTIP award.
In determining the final vesting outcome at the end of each LTIP cycle, the Committee will consider performance over the three-year performance period for each strategic measure.
