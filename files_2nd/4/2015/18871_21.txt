Directors remuneration report Annual statement Dear shareholder It is my pleasure to present the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Committee role, remit and membership In 2015, the Remuneration Committees remit and role were unchanged.
Further to the 2015 Board and Committee review and evaluation process, it was agreed that all of the Non-executive Directors should constitute the membership of all of the Board Committees.
Accordingly, Nancy Tuor Moore was appointed a member of the Committee with effect from 24September 2015.
Remuneration policy Our remuneration policy supports the following principles: to provide a clear link between performance and reward and ensure that the Executive Directors interests are closely aligned with those of our shareholders: and to help us to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre executives to manage the business and deliver against our strategy, ensuring the long-term success of the Company.
Ruth Cairnie Chairman of the Remuneration Committee We operate a remuneration structure comprising base salary and benefits, a bonus plan and a long-term incentive plan.
Our incentives are aligned with our strategic priorities.
The outcomes reflect the performance of the Remuneration Committee membership: business and strategic progress in 2015.
Ruth Cairnie Chairman Chris Girling We continued to apply our remuneration policy, as approved by shareholders Nancy Tuor Moore appointed 24 September 2015 at the Annual General Meeting AGM in May 2014.
No changes to the Paul Withers remuneration policy are proposed for 2016.
The Committee will review the remuneration policy, in the context of Kellers evolving requirements, changes in market practice and shareholder expectations, including recent guidance on time horizons and holding periods for long-term incentives and long-term executive share ownership, prior to submitting it for shareholder approval no later than the 2017 AGM, as required.

Notes to the policy table Performance measure selection and approach to target setting The measures used under the annual bonus plan are selected annually to reflect the Groups plans for the year and reflect both financial and non-financial priorities.
Performance targets are set annually to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular strategic priorities and economic environment in a given year.
The Committee believes that EPS and TSR continue to be appropriate measures of long-term performance for Keller.
EPS provides a link to long-term financial performance and is highly visible internally, while TSR provides strong alignment with shareholder interests.
EPS targets will be reviewed and confirmed prior to each grant, taking account of analyst estimates, historical performance and EPS performance ranges used at other FTSE250 companies.
The TSR target for full vesting has been determined on the basis of an historical analysis of the median to upper quartile spread and is in line with typical market practice for a company of Kellers size.
The Committee retains discretion to adjust this target for future awards should circumstances change.
If an event occurs which causes the Committee to consider that an outstanding PSP Award or bonus would not achieve its original purpose without alteration, the Committee has discretion to amend the targets, provided the new conditions are materially no less challenging than when originally imposed.
Such discretion could be used to adjust appropriately for the impact of material acquisitions or disposals, or for exceptional and unforeseen events outside the control of the management team.
The application of any such discretion would have regard to the Committees practice of ensuring the stability of measures and targets throughout the business cycle.
KELLER GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 55 Directors remuneration report continued Remuneration policy report continued Shareholding guidelines To reflect the importance the Committee places on aligning their interests with shareholders, Executive Directors are required to hold shares with a value equivalent to 100% of salary.
Executive Directors are required to retain 50% net of tax of shares acquired on vesting of share Awards until the required holding is attained.
Awards under previous remuneration policies Any awards or remuneration-related commitments made to Directors under previous remuneration policies will continue to be honoured.

Recruitment remuneration arrangements In the case of appointing a new Executive Director from outside the Company, the Remuneration Committee will seek to align the remuneration package with our remuneration policy, which may include elements outlined in the policy table above.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both Keller and its shareholders and will seek not to pay more than is necessary for this purpose.
The Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer on a like-for-like basis, which may be awarded in addition to the remuneration structure outlined in the table above.
In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met.
The Committee may also rely on exemption 9.4.
2 of the Listing Rules to facilitate such a buy out if required.
Internal promotions to the Board In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Remuneration Committee will apply the policy consistently as for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to Executive Director level, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements.
Incentive opportunities for below Board level employees are typically no higher than Executive Directors, but measures may vary.
Non-executive Director recruitment In recruiting a new Non-executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will utilise the policy as set out in the table above.
All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement, the dates of which are set out below.

If employment is terminated by the Company, the departing Executive Director may have a legal entitlement under statute or otherwise to additional amounts, which would need to be met.
In addition, the Committee retains discretion to settle any other amounts reasonably due to the Executive Director, for example to meet the legal fees incurred by the Executive Director in connection with the termination of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement and the individual must seek independent legal advice.
In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing Executive Directors including but not limited to settlement, confidentiality, restrictive covenants and or consultancy arrangements.
These will be used sparingly and only entered into where the Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so.

Notably, on the personal objectives, Alain and Justin ensured a smooth transition in the handover of the CEO responsibilities and provided effective leadership of the business throughout: James led a successful drive for efficiencies and best practice in plant and equipment costs across the business, overseeing the establishment of a Group Procurement function: and Wolfgang continued to lead improvements in the Groups bid appraisal process, to reduce the risk from underperforming contracts.
Leading safety targets were met by each of the Executive Directors: however, the Committee exercised its discretion to reduce the pay-outs under that target in recognition of two fatalities in the business in the year.
The overall outcome is an annual bonus pay-out for Executive Directors of between 85% and 88% of salary for 2015.
Without the reduction of pay-outs made at the Committees discretion on leading safety targets, annual bonus pay-outs would have been in the range of 87% and 90%.
The Committee did not exercise any discretion in relation to the financial performance targets.
The financial targets, together with the actual performance achieved against each target, are set out in the table below.
