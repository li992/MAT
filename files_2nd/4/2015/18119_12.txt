Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Governance D Directors remuneration report irectors remuneration report Annual statement I am pleased to introduce the directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The report is split into three sections, namely: i this annual statement: ii the remuneration policy as approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
Although the disclosure of this part of the remuneration report is not required this year, it has been repeated in line with best practice: and iii the annual report on remuneration explaining payments made in the year under review and how the policy will be operated for 2016.
Remuneration policy Our employees are central to the companys ongoing success and in setting the remuneration policy at Clarksons our objective is to attract and retain the best talent in our markets.
At the same time the remuneration committee seeks to ensure that executive pay is aligned to the corporate plan and business goals as well as supporting the interests of shareholders.
We have had a consistent policy since 2006 and believe that it has served the companys shareholders well since then.
Remuneration policy across the group is consistently applied, as are bonus plans which are operated group wide.
Executive directors are shareholders in Clarksons and accordingly understand the imperative to deliver long-term returns for the companys owners.
Their short-term rewards are directly aligned to the profitability of the company.
Performance and reward for 2015 At the beginning of 2015, following the acquisition of RS Platou ASA, the executive bonus scheme was amended so as to ensure that earnings per share on the enlarged shareholding was no lower than it would have been prior to the acquisition at each tranche level of executive remuneration.
The executive directors sacrificed 5% of the bonuses they were eligible to receive, for the purposes of providing additional reward to other senior employees.
Strong growth in both the earnings per share and total shareholder return over the three years to 31 December 2015 will result in a 70% vesting of the 2013 grant of LTIP awards in May 2016.
While the base salary level of executive directors was frozen for the eighth year in a row, an adjustment was made to Jeff Woydas salary to reflect his mid-year appointment as chief operating officer in addition to his role as chief financial officer to correspond with the significant increase and the size and complexity of his role.
No other salary adjustments were made during 2015 or from 1 January 2016.
Policy for 2016 The remuneration committee is not proposing to make any changes to the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
As such: base salary levels were not increased from 1 January 2016: the annual bonus will continue to be based on a bonus pool derived from group profit before tax: consistent with the policy applied to the majority of senior employees, 90% of the annual bonus payable will be paid in cash with 10% voluntarily deferred into shares for four years and clawback provisions will continue to apply: and LTIP awards will be granted in 2016 as part of the normal annual grant policy and will continue to be based on a combination of earnings per share and relative total shareholder return targets.
The remuneration committee believes these continue to be correct principles for a business such as Clarksons and I commend this remuneration policy to you.
Should you have any questions, please contact me at the company address.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions and discuss the policy more widely.

com 43 Governance Governance Directors remuneration report continued Directors remuneration policy This remuneration policy report was put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and, following its approval, became effective from that date.
No changes for 2016 are proposed.
How the remuneration committee operates to set the remuneration policy The remuneration committee is responsible, on behalf of the board, for: setting the senior executives remuneration policy and actual remuneration: reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the board and shareholders: and approving the design of, and recommending targets for, any performance-related pay schemes the company operates for senior executives.
The remuneration committee encourages dialogue with shareholders and engages with the companys major shareholders on a regular basis.
Major shareholders will be consulted on a timely basis on any material changes proposed for the remuneration policy.
Summary of overall remuneration policy The policy of the company is to ensure that executive rewards are linked to performance, to provide an incentive to achieve the key business aims, deliver an appropriate link between reward and performance and maintain a reasonable relationship of rewards to those offered in other competitor companies in order to attract, retain and motivate executives within a framework of what is acceptable to shareholders.
We maintain a strong focus on ensuring that executives are incentivised to drive economic profit as well as being rewarded for creating sustainable value.
There are few comparable UK public companies involved solely in the business of providing shipping and related wholesale financial services.
Comparisons are therefore made with City-based companies and private companies in the shipping sector, many of which are headquartered overseas.
In the highly competitive global labour market which operates within the shipping services sector where business is based around personal client relationships, the retention of key talent is critical to continued business success.
Remuneration levels are set to attract and retain the best talent and to ensure that market competitive rewards are available for the delivery of strong business and personal performance within an appropriate risk framework.
It is recognised by the remuneration committee that the current management team is highly regarded and would be attractive to Clarksons competitors in the shipping industry and increasingly, wholesale brokerage and agency businesses.
Retention of key talent in this context is critical, whilst recognising the need for appropriate succession planning.
The proportionate breakdown of the total remuneration is such that, in line with most other wholesale brokerage and agency companies, a very high proportion of the package is performance-related.
The chief executives bonus recognises that he performs the duties and responsibilities incumbent with the role of group chief executive and in addition, as a shipbroker, generates significant revenues.
Consideration of shareholder views The company is committed to maintaining good communication with investors.
The remuneration committee considers the AGM to be an opportunity to meet and communicate with investors, giving shareholders the platform to raise any issues or concerns they may have.
In addition, the remuneration committee would engage directly with major shareholders should any material changes be made to the directors remuneration policy.
Details of the votes cast in respect of the resolutions to approve last years remuneration report and any matters discussed with shareholders during 2015 are set out in the annual report on remuneration on page 57.

2 The annual bonus performance measures are focused on profit before tax to reflect how successful the company has been in managing its operations.
The LTIP performance measures, EPS and TSR, reward significant long-term returns to shareholders and long-term financial growth.
EPS growth is derived from the audited financial statements while TSR performance is monitored on the remuneration committees behalf by New Bridge Street.
Targets are set on a sliding scale that takes account of internal strategic planning and external market expectations for the company.
Only modest rewards are available for achieving threshold performance with maximum rewards requiring substantial out-performance of challenging strategic plans approved at the start of each year.
3 The committee operates the annual bonus and LTIP plans according to their respective rules, and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
Consistent with market practice, the committee retains flexibility and discretions in a number of key areas.
4 The remuneration policy for the executive directors is designed with regard to the policy for employees across the group as a whole and is consistent between the executive directors and the remainder of the workforce.
In particular, there has been a widespread salary freeze for all employees earning salaries of 100,000 p. a. or more.
In contrast, salaries for lower paid employees have generally increased on average across the population each year.
The annual bonus plan operates on a similar profit-driven basis across the group and there is a relatively high level of employee share ownership.
The key differences in policy for executive directors relate to participating in the LTIP awards, which have strict vesting conditions.
This is considered appropriate to provide a link for a proportion of performance pay with the longer term strategy thereby creating stronger alignment of interest with shareholders.
The committee does not formally consult with employees in respect of the design of the companys executive director remuneration policy, although the committee will keep this under review.
5 For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this directors remuneration policy, authority was given to the company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors such as, the payment of a pension or the vesting or exercise of past share awards that have been in previous remuneration reports.
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.

It should, however, be noted that there is in fact no upper limit as explained on page 45 and the above charts are purely for illustrative purposes.
5 Share price movement has been excluded from the above analysis.
Directors recruitment and promotions The remuneration committee has the objective to attract and retain the best talent in our markets, while at the same time ensuring executive pay is aligned to the corporate plan and business goals as well as supporting the interests of shareholders.
If a new executive director was appointed, the company would seek to align the remuneration package with the remuneration policy approved by shareholders, including the maximum limit for the LTIP and an annual bonus pool entitlement in line with that of the other executive directors.
However, flexibility would be retained to offer remuneration on appointment in respect of deferred remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
The committee will look to replicate the arrangements being forfeited as closely as possible and in doing so, will take account of relevant factors including the nature of the deferred remuneration, performance conditions and the time over which they would have vested or been paid.
1 Basic salary levels applying on 1 January 2016.
The initial notice period for a service contract may be longer than the policy of one year, provided it reduces to one year within a short space of time.
For an internal appointment, any ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.

The remuneration committee may also agree that the company will meet certain relocation and incidental expenses as appropriate.
com 47 Governance Governance Directors remuneration report continued Directors service contracts and payments for loss of office The remuneration committee reviews the contractual terms for executive directors in light of developments in best practice and trends in our sector.
The remuneration related elements of the current contracts for executive directors are shown in the table below: Provision Detailed terms Notice period One year by the company or the director.
Termination payment Chief executive: The company may elect to pay in lieu of notice: an amount equivalent to 12 months base salary plus the cost of contractual benefits: plus an amount equivalent to 50% of the last bonus received.
In addition: if not already paid, any bonus in respect of the prior year is payable if not agreed, an amount equal to the last bonus received : and a pro-rated bonus for the period of the year worked is payable.
Chief financial officer and chief operating officer: The company may elect to pay in lieu of notice: an amount equivalent to base salary, benefits and bonus for the relevant period of notice.
President of broking and investment banking: The company may elect to pay in lieu of notice: an amount equivalent to base salary and contractual benefits only.
The remuneration committee recognises that it is unusual in the context of listed PLCs to pay an amount in lieu of annual bonus for the notice period to the chief executive and chief financial officer and chief operating officer but considers that the policy is appropriate for the following reasons: salary forms a lower proportion of remuneration than in most other UK companies: typically in the shipbroking industry, income from business conducted is received over a number of years in arrears: bonuses are only payable if profit thresholds and targets are achieved i. e. there is no automatic entitlement to a bonus: and unvested awards under the LTIP are capable of vesting subject to performance.
For unvested entitlements to share awards under the 2004 Clarkson LTIP which reached the end of its ten year life in May 2014, the rules contain discretionary provisions setting out the treatment of awards where a participant ceases to be employed by the Clarksons group for designated reasons.
In the case of the participants injury, disability, statutory redundancy, retirement, a sale of their employing company or business in which they were employed or for any other reason at the discretion of the committee, the participants awards will not be forfeited but will vest on the date of cessation of employment, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions.
In the case of a participants death, any unvested awards will vest in full on the date of cessation.
For unvested entitlements to share awards under the 2014 Clarkson LTIP, where a participant ceases to be employed by the Clarksons group due to ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, a sale of his employing company or business or for any other reason at the discretion of the committee good leaver circumstance, then he will be entitled to keep his award as described below: performance-related awards will normally vest on the normal vesting dates unless the remuneration committee determines that they should vest upon cessation subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions and time pro-rating unless the remuneration committee decides to disapply time pro-rating.
In the case of a death or ill-health, awards will vest at cessation subject to the relevant performance conditions: and deferred bonus awards will vest in full.
48 Clarkson PLC Annual Report 2015 48 Clarkson PLC Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Provision Detailed terms Change of control Chief executive: If, within 18 months of a change of control, the company gives the chief executive notice except for reasons of gross misconduct or material breach of contract or the chief executive gives notice as a result of a material breach of his contract or the company limits his ability to earn future bonuses, the chief executive will, within 30 days of termination, receive an amount equivalent to one years basic salary, 150% of the last annual bonus received and the gross annual value of contractual benefits pro-rated.
In these circumstances, the chief executives notice period is reduced to four weeks.
Chief financial officer and chief operating officer: Within one year of a change of control the executive or the company may give notice of not less than four weeks in the case of the former whereupon the executive will receive immediately an amount equivalent to one years basic salary, contractual benefits, employer pension contributions and annual bonus.
President of broking and investment banking: No change of control provisions exist.
All unvested awards under the 2004 Clarkson LTIP would vest, to the extent that any performance conditions attaching to the relevant award have been achieved.
All unvested awards under the 2014 Clarkson LTIP would vest, to the extent that any performance conditions attaching to the relevant award have been achieved.
To the extent that any performance conditions have been met, the committee will consider whether time pro-rating should apply.
In August 2008 it was however contractually agreed with the current chief financial officer and chief operating officer, Jeff Woyda, that no time pro-rating will be applied to his LTIP awards.
The remuneration committee recognises that it is now unusual, in the context of listed PLCs, for service contracts to contain change of control provisions and will therefore seek to avoid such provisions for future executive appointments to the board.
Details of the current executive directors service contracts are as follows: Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period Andi Case 17 June 2008 12 months 12 months Jeff Woyda 3 October 2006 12 months 12 months 1 Peter M.

Anker and Birger Nergaard were appointed to the board with effect from 2 February 2015 upon the completion of the RS Platou ASA acquisition.
Non-executive directors are appointed by letter of appointment for a fixed term not exceeding three years, renewable on the agreement of both the company and the director, subject to re-election at each AGM.
Each appointment can be terminated before the end of the three year period with three months notice due.
Fees payable for a new non-executive director appointment will take into account the experience of the individual and the current fee structure.

Annual bonus for 2016 For 2016, the annual bonus opportunity will remain uncapped and will continue to be based on a bonus pool derived from group profit before tax as follows: below a profit floor set by the committee no bonus is triggered: and above the floor, an escalating percentage of profits is payable into a bonus pool for progressively higher profit before tax performance.
Profit for bonus calculations may be adjusted by the remuneration committee where appropriate and does not include mark-to-market valuations or business that has not been invoiced.
The profit floor and challenges for 2016 have not been disclosed on a prospective basis as these are considered to be commercially sensitive, although disclosure will be provided retrospectively.
Consistent with the policy applied to the majority of senior employees, 90% of the bonus payable will be paid in cash with 10% voluntarily deferred into shares for four years and clawback provisions will continue to apply.
Long term incentive awards to be granted in 2016 Consistent with past practice, it is envisaged that: executive directors will receive LTIP awards over shares worth up to 150% of salary in 2016. the vesting of 50% of awards will be determined by the companys EPS for 31 December 2018, as shown in chart i below.
The EPS for 2015 is shown black line for reference: and the vesting of the remaining 50% will be determined by the companys TSR performance from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018 against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts, as shown in chart ii below.
The level of total shareholder return achieved against the FTSE 250 Index over the last three year cycle is shown black line for reference.
EPS and relative TSR are considered to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance for the group, in that they ensure executives are incentivised and rewarded for the earnings performance of the group as well as returning value to shareholders.
The awards will be subject to clawback provisions.
