The overall rationale for this approach is as follows: Strategic delivery Growth in AEPS pence Xavier Rolet has been a very successful CEO since his appointment in 2009, and the Group has been transformed into a successful global international 25% exchange group through a combination of organic and inorganic growth.
Clearnet and Russell 5% 2% 5% 36% Indices have increased the size, scope, breadth of product offerings and the 103.3 98.6 97.0 92.6 Groups international footprint.
Xavier Rolet has been instrumental in the Groups 23% -19% success over this period and we are keen to reward him appropriately for the 68.3 67.9 55.3 future, reflecting the new reality of LSEG that he leads.

Until the minimum shareholding requirement of 2x base salary is reached, the percentage of bonus that is deferred will be deferred 100% into shares.
A salary increase of 2% for Raffaele Jerusalmi is broadly in line with the average Once the level of minimum shareholding has been reached, individuals are employee increases.
able to elect to defer under 3 different approaches: 100% of the deferral amount into shares: 50% into shares and 50% into cash: or 100% into cash Base salaries effective from 1 April 2016, are set out in the table below: Deferred awards are subject to malus provisions.

The current TSR targets 8% to 16% growth per annum have been used, unchanged, over 6 annual award cycles 2010 to 2015 inclusive.
During this period of high performance, targets of 8% to 16% have become increasingly harder to achieve in each consecutive cycle and while it is appreciated that targets should continue to be stretching, they should also be achievable to remain motivational.
For 2016 LTIP awards, the Remuneration Committee consulted with major shareholders in Q4 2015 on TSR performance metrics and acted on their feedback in coming to a decision to use an amended range of 6% to 14% growth per annum.
Threshold vesting at 25% of the maximum, lowered from 30% of the maximum in 2014 in response to shareholders input, would remain unchanged with straight-line pro-rating applying between these 2 points.
EPS growth targets remain 6% to 12% per annum.
The Committee is satisfied that this range is still sufficiently stretching and, if delivered, will continue to drive significant value for shareholders.
Awards to be made during 2016 Based on the context as previously stated and an assessment of individual performance, the Remuneration Committee has approved grants to each of the Executive Directors under the 2014 LTIP as follows: Executive Director, CEO of Borsa Italiana Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer and Director of Capital Markets 1 2016 % of salary 300% of salary 275% of annual salary 275% of salary LTIP award subject to amount 2,400,000 1,278,750 Sterling equivalent of 1,400,000 performance at prevailing FX rate at time of grant Note: 1.
