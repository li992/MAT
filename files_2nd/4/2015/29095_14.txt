Basis for determining annual bonus awards audited In determining the annual bonus award for the Chief Executive and other executive Directors, the Committee made an assessment of the overall performance of the business and of each individual, including business performance within each individuals responsibilities, as well as individual performance against annual objectives.
A number of financial and non-financial factors were taken into account, without attaching a separate weighting to each factor.
Based on its assessment of performance, the Committee applied its judgement to determine annual bonus awards, taking into account the recommendation of the Chief Executive in respect of other executive Directors.

Planning for the succession of the Chief Executive has been a long-term consideration for the Board.
Promoting from within was the clear preference and the appointment of Peter Harrison as Chief Executive in 2016, following his recruitment as Head of Equities in 2013, demonstrates the successful implementation of this key succession plan.
The focus on succession plans also means a number of other key roles will also be filled with internal talent.

In addition, all of the key performance indicators set out in the Strategic report on pages 12 and 13 were considered, as these are used to measure our performance over the long term.
The Committee members and the Board as a whole also review performance across a broad range of other metrics as part of the normal course of business throughout the year and during the year end process.
Performance against many of these metrics is disclosed in the interim management statements during the year, in the half year and full year results announcements and in the Annual Report and Accounts.
Determining vesting of prior LTIP awards audited The LTIP awards granted on 12 March 2012, covering the 2012 to 2015 performance period, vested on 1 March 2016.

The figures in the employer contribution columns represent contributions paid into defined contribution pension arrangements during the year and exclude any contributions made by the Director.

He has no further prospective pension benefits from the Group.
Payments to former Directors audited Kevin Parry stepped down from the Board and ceased to be an employee of Schroders on 5 May 2013.
As disclosed in the 2013 Remuneration report, the Committee exercised its discretion at that time to allow him to retain his unvested LTIP awards.
The LTIP remained subject to performance conditions and in addition the proportion of the shares under award that is ultimately released to him on exercise will be prorated for the performance period that he worked.
The value that vested on 1 March 2016 from the LTIP award granted to Mr Parry on 12 March 2012 was 58,000 after prorating.
He did not receive an award in 2013 so this was the final LTIP award he held and there will be no further payments to him.
ECP and LTIP awards granted during 2015 audited The following awards under the ECP were granted to Directors on 9 March 2015, in respect of deferred bonuses for performance during 2014.
No further performance conditions need to be met for awards to vest but ECP awards normally require the participant to remain in employment with the Group until the third anniversary of grant in order to vest in full.
ECP Share awards were granted as nil cost options.
ECP Fund awards are conditional rights to receive a cash sum based on the value of a notional investment in a range of Schroders funds.
These awards were granted in respect of performance during 2014.

All ECP Share awards and LTIP awards were granted over ordinary shares, except for the awards granted to Philip Mallinckrodt, which were granted over non-voting ordinary shares.
The share price used to determine the number of shares under each ECP Share award and LTIP award is the mid-market closing share price on the last trading day prior to the date of grant and this is the price used to calculate the face value shown.
ECP Fund awards are notionally invested in Schroders funds on the date of grant, and the value of the award tracks the value of the funds.
The vesting of the LTIP awards is subject to the performance conditions set out on page 80.
