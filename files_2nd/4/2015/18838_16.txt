Principles considered when setting remuneration The Company operates in the particularly competitive media market.
We aim to balance the need to attract and retain highquality talent essential to the Companys success with the need to be cost-effective and to reward exceptional performance.
TheCommittee has developed a Remuneration Policy for the Company that balances these factors, while taking into account the prevailing best practice and a fair outcome for investors.
A significant proportion of the remuneration package is tied to the achievement of stretching performance conditions, that alignremuneration with our strategy to deliver strong business performance and create shareholder value.
Individuals should berewarded for success and performance measured over clear timescales.
The remuneration package is focused on rewarding sustained long-term performance and aligning executives with the shareholder experience.

The performance conditions that apply to the bonus are set on an individual basis and are linked to the Companys corporate, financial and strategic priorities.
This enables the Committee to reward both annual financial performance delivered for shareholders, and performance against specific financial, operational or strategic objectives set for each Executive Director, which are closely linked to the strategic priorities of the business.

The remainder of the bonus 40% was based upon the Committees assessment of the contribution the Executive Director has made tothe overall strategy through the delivery of specific targets.
Both Executive Directors had a number of common objectives aligned to our Strategic Priorities.

ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 71 Governance Annual Remuneration Report continued During the year particular achievements, in addition to the delivery of the stretching business plan, related to international expansion and development of organic growth and new commissions.
This was achieved with the acquisition of Talpa, Twofour Group and other production businesses and investments.
Adam Crozier was also assessed against the continuing international expansion of ITV Studios, as well as the growth of the UK and international Pay and Online businesses.
Ian Griffiths was also assessed against effective M&A activity, and supporting ITV Studios and Broadcast to develop their international businesses and creative performance.
With regard to disclosure of performance against the corporate and financial targets, previous reports stated that these targets contained commercially sensitive information, which would remain so until two years after the end of the relevant financial year, at which point they may be disclosed.
However, to reflect emerging best practice, the Committee has decided to provide immediate disclosure of the corporate and financial targets used following the relevant year end, together with performance against those targets and the resulting level of payout.

The proposed performance measures for awards are detailed below and remain unchanged from 2015.
The weightings for 2016 reflect the changes to the bonus framework outlined in the Chairmans letter on page 68.
The Board considers the actual targets for 2016 to be commercially sensitive at this time and we envisage including equivalent disclosures to those included in respect of the 2015 bonus in next years report.
Performance measure Strategic target Weightings ITV plc EBITA before exceptional items 60% Profit to cash conversion 10% Cost savings 5% Individual targets 25% Share awards Awards will continue to be made under the LTIP in line with the Remuneration Policy.
The proposed performance measures and targets for awards to be made in 2016 are detailed below.
Under the LTIP rules, the maximum annual award that can be granted in any financial year is 350% of salary.
This is to allow the Committee flexibility when recruiting Executives and to ensure the longevity of the plan.
There is currently no intention to grant awards at this level.
Awards in 2016 will be made to the Executive Directors with a value of 225% of salary, at the same level as awarded in 2015 and in line with the operational maximum set out in the Remuneration Policy.
In order to ensure that Executive Directors are only rewarded if value is delivered to shareholders, awards will be subject to an initial cumulative adjusted EPS performance gateway equal to that required for threshold performance 54.6 pence.
If this gateway is achieved, performance will then be assessed by reference to the conditions set out below.

Vesting between threshold and maximum 100% is on a straight-line basis except in respect of the Family SOV measure.
This has a lower level of vesting that occurs at 21.2% 75% vesting with straight-line vesting to that position from each threshold and maximum.
When assessing performance against this target, the Committee will also have regard to the health of the main ITV channel.
Shares that vest will be subject to a two year holding period.
Malus and Clawback Malus and clawback provisions may be operated at the discretion of the Committee in respect of any cash and deferred share elements of the bonus and awards made under the LTIP following the introduction amendment of these clauses.
Under malus, unvested share awards including any LTIP shares subject to a post vesting holding period can be reduced down to zero if considered appropriate or be made subject to additional conditions.
Clawback allows for repayment of bonuses previously paid and or shares previously received following vesting.
Malus clawback can be operated up to four years following the start of the relevant bonus year for bonuses, and up to six years from the relevant date of grant for LTIP awards.
The circumstances in which the operation of these provisions may be considered include material misstatement of results, gross misconduct or fraud.
