Role and remit of the committee The committee assists the board in setting the remuneration packages for the Companys executive directors and other executive committee members.

The committees formal terms of reference are available on Ranks website at: www.
com en investors corporate-governance terms-of-reference.

Committee activity during the year Matters discussed by the committee during the year included the following: long-term incentive plan: changes to remuneration policy: institutional shareholder feedback on proposed changes to remuneration policy: remuneration packages for new members of the executive committee: 2015 xed pay review: 2014 15 annual bonus payments: 2015 16 annual bonus plan structure and targets: annual review of remuneration policy and practices: and review and approval of the Policy Report and the Annual Remuneration Report.
Advisers to the committee The committee has access to external information and research on market data and trends from independent consultants.
After a tender process Towers Watson was appointed as external remuneration advisers to the committee.
They have been sole advisers to the committee since January 2007.
Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group, the body which oversees the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the United Kingdom.
The chief executive, the company secretary, the finance director and the human resources director provided assistance to the committee during the year.
They attended meetings of the committee, although none of them was involved in any decision relating to his or her own remuneration.
Towers Watson attended two out of the committees eight meetings during the year.
During the year, the committee requested Towers Watson to advise on matters including remuneration of the chairman, non-executive directors, executive directors and other executive committee members.
Towers Watson also provided the TSR performance graph for the directors remuneration report.
Towers Watson was paid fees totalling 67,133 for services provided to the committee during the year fees are based on hours spent.
Towers Watson did not provide any other services to the Group during the period under review.
THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 75 Governance Directors remuneration report continued Committee evaluation The committees performance during the period under review was assessed via con dential questionnaires with committee members and other individuals who support its work.
Results were then reviewed by the committee chairman and discussed with the board.
The board agreed that the committee continued to perform effectively.
Shareholder consultation and voting outcome During the year the committee, through its chairman, consulted its majority shareholder and others of its larger shareholders with regard to their views on proposed changes to Ranks executive directors remuneration arrangements, the main features of which were as follows: a maximum vesting period of five and a half years made up of a three-year performance period and phased holding periods up to two and a half years.
This time horizon was more closely aligned with sustainable long-term value creation for shareholders: performance to be measured by financial measures 50% : EBITDA, pro t after tax and digital revenue, alongside a balanced scorecard of strategic nonfinancial measures 50%, all of which are aligned to our long-term strategic plan: the awards to be structured as contingent block awards intended to ensure executives focus on the long-term success of the business: and clawback and malus provisions to be introduced to strengthen the committees governance of the incentive plan.
The above necessitated amendments to the Rules of The Rank Group Plc 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan the Plan Rules and minor changes to the long-term incentive section of our directors remuneration policy that was approved by shareholders in October 2014 the Policy.
Shareholder feedback from that consultation process that took place in the first quarter of the current calendar year and the committees response included: Shareholder comment on proposals Committee response Threshold vesting level too high One of the main criticisms of Ranks historic long-term incentive plans by Ranks majority shareholder was that they tended to reward relatively modest growth at threshold performance levels.
We have subsequently toughened the performance expectations at threshold vesting signi cantly in order to ensure that minimum performance requires management to achieve stretching results.
Whilst the committee understands that UK market practice tends to favour a lower vesting percentage at threshold, our majority shareholder supports the view that a higher vesting percentage at this level of performance is warranted to incentivise management given the stretching targets.
Performance metric The committee considered carefully shareholders comments regarding metrics and as a result of those comments resolved to underpin the scheme with a return on capital employed ROCE measure.
Weighting for nonfinancial metrics The committee has considered this carefully and believes that the weighting is appropriate given our strategic direction and long-term goals for the business.
Performance period start date Henry Birch joined us as our new chief executive on 6 May last year.
The committee considered it entirely appropriate that Mr Birch and his team had an appropriate long-term incentive in place.
The base from which the targets for the scheme to be put to shareholders was the commencement of the then current financial year.
Regrettably it had taken longer than the committee had hoped to have the mechanics of the scheme debated internally.
Nevertheless, Mr Birch and his team had been working to the speci ed financial and nonfinancial metrics since the start of the then current financial year on 1 July 2014 and therefore the committee felt it appropriate for the commencement of the performance period to be 1 July 2014.

Implementation of policy in 2015 16 For the following financial year it is not anticipated that the remuneration policy outlined on pages 63 to 67 will change and therefore the committee will manage pay decisions within the set policy.
Salaries will be reviewed with any changes effective 1 January 2016.
The executive directors will participate in the annual bonus plan.
As in previous years, a pool will be generated based on growth in pro t. It is the view of the committee that the absolute targets, as well as the targets governing individuals allocations, are commercially sensitive.
The pro t growth targets and actual performance will be disclosed in next years report as they have been this year.
We believe that our policy continues to be aligned with our strategic goal of creating long-term sustainable value for shareholders.
We welcome shareholder feedback on issues related to executive remuneration.
