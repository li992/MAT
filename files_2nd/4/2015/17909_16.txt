44 Governance Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Annual Statement This report, which has been prepared pursuant to and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013, has three sections this Annual Statement, the Directors Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Directors Remuneration Policy provides details of the remuneration policy for directors for 2014 15 onwards and is included for reference, as this was approved by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting AGM in December 2014.
The Annual Report on Remuneration which, together with the Annual Statement will be subject to an annual advisory shareholder vote, describes the remuneration of directors in respect of the financial year under review and how the policy continues to be operated.
Remuneration paid in 2014 15 The Committee considers that the remuneration paid to executive directors fairly reflects both Company and individual performance during the financial year.
The basic salaries of the executive directors in 2014 15 were determined by the Committee in July 2014 after consultation with shareholders.
They provided for the second and final tranche of increases to bring salaries up to market levels.
Ted Ayress salary was set at 600,000 and Keith Adeys at 350,000 for the year under review.
A significant proportion of total remuneration is comprised of bonuses awarded for performance.
As set out on pages 20 to 23 of this report, the Group built on the previous years progress and continued to perform extremely strongly.
Management took full advantage of favourable market conditions to increase sales, average selling price, margin, operating profit, dividend and NAV while maintaining a strong balance sheet.
the number of homes sold increased by 13.2% from 6,851 to 7,752.
1 operating profit increased by 41.0% from 255.6 millionto 360.4 million.
NAV per ordinary share increased by 15.0% from 1,118p to 1,286p.
the Companys annual and three-year TSR performance was in the upper quartile of the FTSE 250 excluding financial services companies and investment trusts.
Looking forward, the Group concluded the year with a record year-end order book supported by a healthy increase in plots available with detailed planning permission.
One additional operating division was opened during the year and an additional division commenced operations with effect from 1 August 2015 to assist the Groups growth strategy.
This performance is reflected in the annual bonus earned by the executive directors.
Operating profit grew strongly to a record level and exceeded the expectations of the Board and shareholders at the start of the year.
The profit related element of the bonus was therefore achieved in full.
In relation to the non-financial elements of the bonus, levels of health and safety showed further improvement and compare very well with other companies in the construction sector.
A bonus of 5.5% out of a maximum of 7.5% of salary was awarded.
The customer care score came under pressure as a result of the high volume of construction.
The score remained high but fell just short of the challenging threshold which had been set and no bonus was earned.
The Groups land bank of plots, ready for construction, showed a healthy increase and resulted in a bonus of 11% of salary.
As a result the directors earned a total bonus of 106.5% out of a maximum of 120% of salary, which the Committee believes has been fully justified by the progress made by the Company.
It will be payable in November 2015.
In 2012 Ted Ayres and Keith Adey were granted awards under the Bellway p. l. c. 2004 Performance Share Plan PSP and Bellway p. l. c. 2008 Share Matching Plan SMP.
Of these awards, 50% were subject to a performance condition comparing the Companys TSR to the companies within the FTSE 250 excluding financial services companies and investment trusts.
This condition was tested at the end of 2014 15 with Bellways TSR of 74.2% ranking it within the upper quartile of the group and therefore these shares will vest on 13 November 2015 and 23 November 2015 respectively.
The TSR condition relating to the other 50% which was measured against a group of other listed housebuilders was not met and this part of the award lapsed.
Overall, the Committee believes that the bonus and PSP and SMP vesting results were reflective of an improvement in the performance of the Group for the three-year period ending 31 July 2015.

The bonus structure and opportunity remains as before the maximum annual bonus potential is 120% of salary, with 90% of salary based on operating profit and 30% of salary based on non-financial performance measures although, as described later in this report, minor changes have been made to the non-financial elements of the bonus.
As disclosed last year and following consultation with major shareholders, the final grant of awards under the SMP was made by the Committee in November 2014.
PSP award levels from 2015 onwards will increase from 100% to 130% of basic salary, with the increase reflecting the Committees estimate of the expected value of SMP awards forgone.
The Committee believes that this change will simplify the pay structure and improve the alignment of executive remuneration with the interests of shareholders.
In addition, a two-year minimum holding period will apply whereby executive directors will be expected to retain shares which vest under long-term incentive awards net of any shares required to be sold to settle the relevant taxes, for a period of at least two years from vesting.
Conclusion The Committee considers that the current policy, which has been approved by shareholders, continues to reward directors appropriately for improvements in Company performance, which are aligned with the Companys strategy of improving shareholder returns.
The Committee consulted its major shareholders on the continued application of its remuneration policies during the year.
I am pleased to report that at the Companys last AGM in December 2014, over 97% of our shareholders voted in favour of the Remuneration Policy, which the Committee anticipates will remain in place until the 2017 AGM and over 98% of our shareholders voted in favour of the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration which consists of the Annual Statement and Annual Report on Remuneration.
At this years AGM on 11 December 2015 there will be a single vote on directors remuneration.
This will be an advisory vote on the Annual Statement and Annual Report on Remuneration and will require a majority vote in favour to pass.
Further information on this resolution is set out on page 101 and we look forward to your continued support.

indd 45 30 10 2015 09:39 46 Governance Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued This part of the remuneration report, the Directors Remuneration Policy, was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 12 December 2014.
Although not required by the regulations, the substantive terms of the policy are reproduced here for ease of reference.
Any details, however, that were specific to 2014 15 for example, the application of remuneration policy chart have been updated, where applicable, to reflect the current position.
As no changes are being made, there will be no vote on the remuneration policy at the 2015 AGM.
Directors Remuneration Policy The remuneration policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code published in 2014, the views of the Companys major shareholders and the Investment Association IA and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.
Objectives of remuneration policy The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and motivate executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Group, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has a policy of paying a level of remuneration at around the mid-market level of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses, subject to experience and performance.
The Committee uses this comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising the relatively low number of direct housebuilding comparators, their differing size and the risk of an upward ratchet effect with any peer-based analysis.
The structure of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance-related elements of remuneration annual bonus and long-term incentives constitute a significant proportion of an executives potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable if stretching performance targets are achieved.
The structure of the performance conditions for annual bonus and long-term incentives has been designed to provide a strong link to the Groups performance, namely a focus on maximising profit in a sustainable fashion and producing superior shareholder returns, thereby generating a strong alignment of interest between senior executives and shareholders.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group Whilst the Company does not consult directly with employees when drawing up the executive remuneration policy, in determining the elements of remuneration for the executive directors the Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group as a whole, paying particular attention to the levels of basic pay increase awarded to the workforce generally.
Normally, the salaries of the directors are increased in accordance with the general pay increase awarded to the workforce and it is the intention of the Committee to revert to this practice now that the executive directors salaries have reached mid-market levels.
All employees, including the executive directors, can join the Groups savings related share option arrangements, have life assurance benefits and have access to pension arrangements.
A significant proportion of employees benefit from health insurance, a company car or car allowance.
The Committee is apprised regularly of any significant policy changes for the workforce generally and management below Board level in particular.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee takes into account the views of shareholders.
When any significant changes are proposed to the remuneration policy, the Chairman of the Committee will consult with major shareholders and representative bodies in advance.
In setting the policy, the Committee consulted with major shareholders, the IA and ISS in 2013 14 on the proposed salary increases for the executive directors to bring them in line with their peers, the proposed changes to the non-financial annual bonus performance measures and long-term incentive provision going forward.

The TSR performance is independently calculated for the Committee bythe Companys brokers.
The executive directors may also participate in any all-employee plan operated by the Company up to prevailing HMRC limits.
F or the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors Remuneration Policy, authority has been given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors such as in connection with the unvested SMP awards and the final SMP award which was granted in 2014, notwithstanding that the SMP will notform part of the Companys policy going forward.

The chart below illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the executive directors vary under three performance scenarios: minimum, target and maximum.
The chart, which has been based on the simplified long-term incentive policy applying from 2015 onwards i. e. PSP awards at 130% of salary with the SMP no longer operated, is indicative, as share price movement and dividend accrual have been excluded.
Chart labels show proportion of total package comprised of each element.
Assumptions Minimum fixed pay only salary benefits pension pay in lieu of pension : salary is actual for 2015 16, benefits are based on the value of actual benefits received in 2014 15 and pension pay in lieu of pension is based on policy of 20% of salary applied to the 2015 16 salary.

The Committee meets at least twice a year and during the year it met on four occasions.
Its duties are to review and determine the basic salary, taxable benefits, terms and conditions of employment, including performance-related payments, long-term incentive plans and other benefits of the executive directors and the Chairman.
The Committee also reviews remuneration policies for senior management below Board level.
During the year, in addition to routine matters, the Committee: recommended the draft rules of the Bellway p. l. c. 2014 Employee Share Option Scheme ESOS for approval by the Board.
The ESOS, which is intended to operate below Board level Board directors are not eligible to participate was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM: and reviewed current market practice and future trends in executive remuneration.
The remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman is determined by the Committee within a framework set by the Board.
None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Groups website at www.
During the year, the Group Company Secretary provided advice on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration.
The Committee also received independent external advice from New Bridge Street NBS, part of Aonplc.
NBS was appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other services to the Company other than to the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration.
NBS is also a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and abides by its Code of Conduct.
The Committee is satisfied that NBS is independent.
The total fee paid to NBS for advice to the Committees during the year was 27,374.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors apart from the Chairman is determined by the Board Committee on NonExecutive Directors Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors.
It also receives advice from the Group Company Secretary and NBS.
Implementation of remuneration policy in 2015 16 This section sets out how the Company will implement the remuneration policy for the 2015 16 financial year.
Basic salaries The Committee has awarded salary increases in line with the increases given to the general workforce of around 3% for 2015 16.
Accordingly, from 1 August 2015, the Chief Executives salary was increased to 618,000 p. a. and the Finance Directors salary was increased to 361,000 p. a.
Annual bonus For the 2015 16 financial year, the bonus opportunity will continue to be limited to 120% of basic salary.
The performance conditions relate to a stretching target of pre-exceptional operating profit 90% and non-financial performance 30%, with non-financial performance being assessed by reference to land bank management 15%, health and safety 7.5% and customer care 7.5%.
The Committee considers that performance in relation to targets based on annual profitability and non-financial metrics provide a good link to the long-term performance of the business and that the division between financial and nonfinancial performance targets provides an appropriate balance between long and short-term shareholder returns.
The land bank element of the bonus requires a predetermined number of plots with detailed planning permission DPP available for completion in the following financial year to be met.
The health and safety performance is measured using the NHBC health and safety score, which is an independent measure based on regular inspections of each site.
The customer care element has been updated for this year from a simple net satisfaction score to the average of six key indicators, as measured by the NHBC.
This measure has been adopted as a more appropriate reflection of the metrics by which the performance of each division is managed by the executives.
For each non-financial element, as was the case last year, sliding scale targets will apply whereby a proportion of the bonus will be payable if a base threshold is achieved, with further bonus paid on a sliding scale for improvements in performance up to the maximum bonus opportunity.
In the event that the threshold profit criterion is not met, no bonus will be payable under the non-financial elements.
Long-term incentives As disclosed last year following consultation with major investors, reflecting the fact that the SMP will no longer be operated, the Company anticipates making a grant under the PSP in November 2015 with a face value equivalent to 130% of salary to the executive directors.
Awards will vest to executives after three years, subject to the achievement of performance conditions based around TSR, which measures the total return on a notional investment in Bellway shares, compared to the return on the same notional investment in shares in a group of other companies or an index.
Consistent with last year, the PSP award granted in 2015 16 will be subject to a relative TSR condition with 50% of awards measured against a group of housebuilders and the other 50% against the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding financial services companies and investment trusts.

A two-year minimum holding period for any shares which vest after allowing for tax will apply.
This will increase the alignment of directors interests with the longer-term interests of shareholders.
Chairman and non-executive director fees For 2015 16, the Chairmans fee and the base fee for non-executive directors increased by around 3%, which is in line with the average pay awards for the workforce generally.
The Chairmans fee was increased from 195,000 to 200,000 p. a. with effect from 1 August 2015 and the base fee for the non-executive directors was increased from 53,045 to 54,636.
The fees for chairing the Audit Committee and the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration have also increased by 3% from 5,150 to 5,305 and the additional fee for the senior independent non-executive director has increased from 7,725 to 7,957.
Implementation of remuneration policy in 2014 15 The auditor is required to report on the information contained in the following part of this report.
Taxable benefits include car or car allowance and health insurance.
P ension includes both payments in lieu of pension of 98,880 and contributions to a defined contribution scheme of 91,120.
None of the directors are members of the Groups defined benefit scheme and both of the executive directors are members of a defined contribution scheme.
T he value of long-term incentives in 2015, reflects the partial vesting of the 2012 PSP awards, which will be exercisable from 13 November 2015 and the partial vesting of the 2012 SMP awards which will be exercisable from 23 November 2015, including additional shares in lieu of dividends accrued from the date of the 2012 SMP award to vesting, using the share price at 31 July 2015.
The 2014 figures have been restated to reflect the actual share price, on vesting, of the partially vested 2011 PSP awards, which took place after the publication of last years report.
Other items refer to the discount on the awards, during the year, under the Groups savings related share option scheme.

indd 55 30 10 2015 09:39 56 Governance Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued Annual bonus for the year ended 31 July 2015 The annual bonus is payable in November 2015 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2015.
The performance conditions for the 2014 15 bonus were operating profit pre-exceptional items 90% of salary and non-financial performance 30% of salary, with non-financial performance being assessed by reference to land bank management 15% of salary, health and safety 7.5% of salary and customer care 7.5% of salary.
In previous years the payment of any bonus for non-financial performance, depended on the target being met in full.
For 2014 15 onwards this was changed to a sliding scale of targets.
For land bank, a 10% payment would be triggered for a predetermined percentage increase in plots with DPP, with an additional 1% payment for further improved performance, up to a maximum of 15% of salary.
Similarly, for health and safety and customer care there is a minimum payment of 4.5% for no deterioration in scores from the previous year, with additional 1% increments payable up to a maximum of 7.5% for improved performance.
The actual bonus payment against operating profit was determined on the following basis: Measure Weighting Threshold Target Maximum Actual Payment Payment % of salary value % of maximum % of salary Operating profit 315 331 340 360.4 pre-exceptional 90% million million million million 100% 90% As can be seen from this table, the actual operating profit exceeded the maximum value set by the Committee at the start of the year.
This was the result of the success of management in acquiring land and constructing and selling more homes at higher prices, in a favourable business environment, whilst at the same time controlling construction costs.
Details of the three non-financial metrics that applied are set out in the table below: Non-financial measure Objectives Score Land bank Increase in the forward land bank of plots with DPP available for completion Maximum 15% of salary in the following financial year in the year to 31 July 2015 to ensure the Groups revenue aspirations are not frustrated by land shortages in future years.
The forward land bank of plots with DPP available for completion in the Partially achieved following financial year grew by 12.8% during the year resulting in a partial 11% of salary awarded payment.
Health and safety No deterioration of the NHBC safety score from last year as a minimum and Maximum 7.5% of salary additional payments made for improvements in health and safety performance by reference to the NHBC safety score.
Improvements in health and safety performance are indicated by a lower NHBC safety score.
The Groups NHBC safety score in 2014 was 0.986.
The target for a maximum Partially achieved payment in 2015 was 0.836.
The actual score was 0.936, which exceeded 5.5% of salary awarded the threshold required for a partial payment but did not reach the target for amaximum payment.
Customer care No deterioration of previous years net assessment of customer satisfaction Maximum 7.5% of salary score as a minimum, with additional bonus opportunity for improvement in the Groups customer satisfaction score.
The Group score in 2015 was 55.9 compared with 56.7 in 2014.
Minimum score for payment narrowly missed.
No award Overall, the Committee is satisfied that the resulting bonus payment of 106.5% of salary out of 120% is reflective of the Companys record performance during the year.
