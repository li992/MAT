2 Half the award is subject to growth in the Groups IFRS operating profit.
Since the impact of the 2014 Budget created a year of discontinuity in the Groups growth plans and great uncertainty in the UK guaranteed income for life segment, the Committee agreed to base its target on growth in the two years following the Groups actual profit achieved in 2014 15.
If IFRS operating profit for the financial year ending 30 June 2017 exceeds operating profit for the financial year ending 30 June 2015 by 18.8% equivalent to 9% p. a. cumulative growth, 25% of the award will vest.
The award will vest in full for growth of 39.2% equivalent to 18% p. a. cumulative growth with payment on a sliding scale in-between these points.
No award would be made if cumulative growth is below 18.8% or if actual profit at 30 June 2017 is less than 80m.
Half of the award is subject to TSR performance relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts, mining companies and oil and gas producers.
Vesting of 25% of these awards will occur for median performance and the maximum 100% will vest for upper quartile performance or above, with straight-line vesting in between these points.
None of these awards will vest if TSR is below the median.
It should be noted that there was a typographical error in the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts in relation to the description of the relative TSR performance condition applying to the 2014 15 LTIP awards.
The Committees intention was that full vesting of this part of the award should occur for upper quartile performance: however the Report incorrectly stated for upper quintile performance.
A statement to this effect was published on the Just Retirement Group plc website on 14 November 2014 and a clarification statement sent to key corporate governance bodies, including IA, PIRC and IMA.
Payments made to past Directors during 2014 15 Audited There were no payments made to any past Directors during the year.
Payments for loss of office made during 2014 15 Audited There were no loss of office payments made during the year.
Directors shareholding guidelines Audited To align the interests of the Executive Directors with shareholders, each Executive Director must build up and maintain a shareholding in the Group equivalent to 200% of base salary for the CEO and 100% for the other Executive Directors.
Until the guideline is met, Executive Directors are required to retain 50% of any LTIP and DSBP JRG share awards that vest or are exercised, net of tax.
The Boards guideline for investment in shares of the Company by each of the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors is set at an amount equal to their annual fee, to be invested within two years of Admission on 15 November 2013 or, if later, within two years of their date of appointment.
