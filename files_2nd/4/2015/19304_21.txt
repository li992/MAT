The table below provides an overview of the most significant components of the relevant benefits.
Provision of Housing Director personal assistant and transport Ayman Asfari US$58,688 Marwan Chedid US$239,196 Annual bonus As set out in last years report, the Committee implemented a new annual bonus framework for 2015.
This framework is intended to ensure an increased transparency of outcomes, in line with best practice developments.
We also took the opportunity to increase the proportion of the bonus which is dependent on financial performance, such that this comprised 60% of the bonus framework for 2015.
The Committee considered the Groups performance during 2015 against the measures and targets under the new framework.
Our financial performance in 2015 was significantly impacted by two difficult projects, Laggan-Tormore and the Greater Stella Area.
As a result, earnings fell short of our expectations at the start of the year resulting in no pay-out under either the Group Net Income or Group ROCE target.
In terms of the other measures, the Company continued to attract significant new orders, leading to a record year-end order backlog and a broadly on-target pay-out under this measure.
We also increased the cash which we generated from our operations for the second year in succession and this contributed towards a maximum pay-out under this element.
As a result of this financial performance, the table below sets out the outcomes for the Executive Directors against our financial targets: Performance Actual 2015 Pay-out as % Measure Weighting Threshold Target Maximum outcome of maximum Group Net Income 25% US$417m US$485m US$553m US$9m 0% Group Order Intake 15% US$6.0bn US$8.9bn US$10.0bn US$8.6bn 48% 1 Group Free Cash Flow 10% US$629m US$472m US$315m US$271m 100% Group ROCE 10% 14.1% 15.7% 17.3% 3.0% 0% Total financial elements 60% 17% As a %of maximum 29% 1 C ash flow from operating and investing activities net of proceeds from disposal of subsidiary.
As the table highlights, our financial performance resulted in a pay-out against the annual bonus financial measures of 29% of maximum 34% of salary.
The remainder of the annual bonus 40% is subject to a balanced scorecard of measures, aligned with our business plan and key corporate objectives.
The scorecard captures key health & safety, operational, strategic and individual objectives.
The scorecard ensures that the Committee considers not only the financial achievements which were delivered but also the wider health of the Company, safeguarding future years performance, and the manner and behaviours by which our performance has been delivered.
Notable achievements under the balanced scorecard include: Strong safety performance, with zero fatalities during the year and continued improvement in our Lost Time Injury Frequency and Recordable Injury Frequency rates: Organisational restructuring exercise and associated cost saving targets achieved, as announced to the market in December 2015: and Delivery of a number of key operational project milestones.

The number of shares under award is determined by reference to a percentage of base salary.
Details of the actual number of shares granted are set out on page 95.
The following table provides details of the awards made under the PSP on 6 March 2015.

The Committee reviewed targets in early 2015 by reference to a number of internal and external reference points to ensure that they are positioned at a level which it considers appropriate and stretching in the context of the business strategy and earnings expectations for the next three years, whilst ensuring that they do not drive unacceptable levels of risk and encourage inappropriate behaviours.
There was no change to the EPS targets for the 2015 awards from those adopted for the 2014 awards, which were as follows: EPS growth per annum Percentage of EPS element vesting 7.5% or less 0% 10% 30% 15% or more 100% The TSR peer group used for this award is the same as outlined above, save that Maire Tecnimont is replaced by Baker Hughes as per the 2014 awards, FosterWheeler has been removed from the group on account of its acquisition by AMEC which has become AMEC FosterWheeler, and Jacobs Engineering has been added as a new constituent to retain a consistent number of companies.
The TSR outperformance requirements and associated vesting schedule remain unchanged from those adopted for prior year awards.

During 2015, Tim Weller participated in the Share Incentive Plan SIP and purchased 181 shares.
Payments for loss of office Stefano Cao and Roxanne Decyk ceased to be Directors from 29 April 2015 and 14 May 2015 respectively and no payment for loss of office was made to either individual.
Statement of Directors shareholding and share interests Directors shareholdings held during the year and as at 31 December 2015 and share ownership guidelines Following discussions with shareholders in relation to the VCP in 2012, the Committee introduced a shareholding requirement of 300% of base salary over a period of five years from the date of appointment for those Executive Directors participating in the plan.
At this time, there is no Executive Director with more than five years service who is yet to meet the guidelines.
Nevertheless, in view of the recent out-turns of the VCP and PSP, the Committee took the decision during 2015 to extend this time period for Executive Directors and will keep this position under review going forward.
Ayman Asfari was not a participant in the VCP and was therefore not subject to the formal shareholding requirement.
In any event, Ayman already had a substantial shareholding interest in the Company, significantly in excess of the required levels.
Until the relevant shareholding guidelines have been met, Executive Directors are encouraged to retain vested shares earned under the Companys incentive plans.
Unvested share awards are not taken into account when considering an Executive Directors progress towards the shareholding requirements.
Shareholding requirements and the number of shares held by Directors during the year and as at 31 December 2015 are set out in the table below: Directors interests in shares as at 31 December 2015 Interests in share incentive Shareholding requirement Shares owned outright schemes, awarded subject as a % of salary at 31 December 2015 to performance conditions Shares owned outright Target % achieved or at the date of leaving at 31 December 2015 at 31 December 2014 Director 1 Ayman Asfari No formal shareholding 62,958,426 335,620 62,958,426 requirement 2 Marwan Chedid 300% 1004% 1,540,092 203,610 1,393,092 2 3 Tim Weller 300% 56% 97,291 235,433 77,110 Thomas Thune Andersen 4,000 4,000 Matthias Bichsel Kathleen Hogenson Ren Mdori Rijnhard van Tets 100,000 100,000 Former Director 4 Stefano Cao 5 Roxanne Decyk 5,804 5,804 1 Although Ayman Asfari does not have formal shareholding requirements, he substantially exceeds the shareholding requirement set for the other Executive Directors.

Whilst at this time, Tim Weller has yet to meet the shareholding requirement fully, he has taken steps to acquire shares since his appointment.
Marwan Chedids shareholding requirement has been met in full.
For the purposes of determining Executive Director shareholdings, the individuals salary and the share price as at 31 December 2015 of 796 pence has been used.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 23 February 2016 100 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2015 Governance Policy report Looking forward Our Directors Remuneration Policy the Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 15 May 2014 for a period of up to three years.
In order to provide the context in which individual remuneration decisions have been made during the year, the approved policy table, and notes to the table, have been included below.
The full Remuneration Policy, as approved, is available at www.
The policy for Executive Directors is designed in line with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration for the wider Group and all our reward arrangements are built around common objectives and principles.
As a Jersey-incorporated company, Petrofac does not have the benefit of the statutory protections afforded by the UK Companies Act 2006.
While the Policy Report was not submitted as a binding resolution at the 2014 AGM, the Committee considers the vote of shareholders to be binding in its application.
However, if there is any inconsistency between the Companys Policy Report as approved by shareholders and any contractual entitlement or other right of a Director, the Company may be obliged to honour that existing entitlement or right.
