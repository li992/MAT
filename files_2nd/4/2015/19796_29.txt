Dividend equivalents Awards may incorporate the right in cash or shares to receive the value of dividends between grant and exercise in respect of the number of shares that vest.
The calculation of dividend equivalents may assume reinvestment of those dividends in Company shares on a cumulative basis.
Clawback and malus provisions The Committee has the discretion to scale back deferred share awards and performance share awards prior to the satisfaction of awards in the event that results are materially misstated or the participant has contributed to serious reputational damage of the Company or one of its business units or their conduct has amounted to serious misconduct or fraud.
Where Performance Share Plan awards are settled prior to the fifth anniversary of the grant of the award, the Committee shall have the discretion to claw back awards up to the fifth anniversary of the grant of awards in the circumstance described above.
Cash bonus payments can also be clawed back in the circumstances described above up to the third anniversary of payment.
Cash payments If the Committee considers it to be appropriate, it may determine that share awards may be settled in cash.
Terms of share awards The Committee may amend the terms of awards or the rules of share plans within the scope defined in the rules of the plans.
For share awards, in the event of a variation of the Companys share capital or a demerger, delisting, special dividend, rights issue or other event, which may, in the Remuneration Committees opinion affect the current or future value of awards, the number of shares subject to an award may be adjusted.
The Committee may amend performance targets in accordance with the terms of an award or if a transaction occurs which causes the Committee to consider taking into account the interest of shareholders that an amended performance condition would be more appropriate and would continue to achieve the original purpose.
Discretionary Share Option Plan Prior to 2011, Executive Directors were granted market value options under the Companys 2004 Discretionary Share Option Plan.
Outstanding awards are no longer subject to performance and may be exercised until the tenth anniversary of the date of award.
No further awards will be made under this plan.
Defined benefit pension Former Executive Directors, Philip Clarke and Laurie McIlwee, participated in a defined benefit pension plan which provides for a pension of up to two-thirds of base salary at retirement with a minimum 10% of salary per annum employee contribution.
Pension benefits are provided through registered arrangements up to approved HMRC limits, with the remainder provided through a secured unfunded arrangement.
In the event that an Executive Director retires early there will be no augmentation of pension benefits.
Payments outside policy The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out in this report where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration, and an award over shares is agreed at the time the award is granted.
Minor changes The Committee may make minor changes to this Policy for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without seeking shareholder approval for that amendment.
Selection of performance measures Annual bonus The annual bonus performance measures have been selected to provide an appropriate balance between incentivising Executive Directors to meet financial targets for the year and incentivising them to achieve specific strategic and operational objectives.
The particular bonus metrics are selected by the Committee each year to ensure that Executive Directors are appropriately focused on the key objectives for the next 12 months.
Performance Share Plan Performance measures for the PSP are selected to ensure that they incentivise Executive Directors to deliver long-term sustainable returns for all of our shareholders.
64 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Performance targets for both the annual bonus and Performance Share Plan where financial measures are used are set, taking into account internal budget forecasts, external expectations and the need to ensure that targets remain motivational.
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group are based on the same principle: that reward should be sufficient to attract and retain high-calibre talent without paying more than is necessary and that reward should support the creation of long-term shareholder value and promote the long-term success of the Company.
Tesco is one of the largest public company employers in the world.
Our colleagues undertake a variety of roles reflecting the countries we operate in and the range of skills we need to run our various businesses.
Reward packages therefore differ taking into account location, seniority and level of responsibility but they are all built around the common reward objectives and principles outlined previously.
The following is based on current practice which may change during the life of the policy.
Annual bonus Annual bonuses throughout the Group are linked to business success and individual performance and contribution.
A profit underpin is set below which no bonus awards will be made under the Plan.
Share incentives Currently our annual bonus is delivered in a mix of cash and deferred shares to create alignment with shareholder interests.
We have a shareholding policy for the Executive Committee and the next level of management within the business.
Clawback and malus Malus provisions exist within our incentive plans to adjust awards prior to release and we will be introducing clawback provisions into all our executive incentive plans.
Pensions Pensions across the Group vary widely according to local market practice.
In the UK all Tesco colleagues currently have the opportunity to participate in a career-average defined benefit scheme.
We communicated in January 2015 that we will consult colleagues on plans to close this scheme and to replace it with an alternative defined contribution plan.
This consultation began in April 2015.
Colleagues as shareholders It is an important part of the Tesco Values that all colleagues, not just management, have the opportunity to become Tesco shareholders.
More than 200,000 of our colleagues participate in our all-employee schemes and hold more than 119 million shares in our Share Incentive Plan and more than 127 million options over shares in our Sharesave scheme.
When determining Executive Director remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into account pay conditions throughout the Group to ensure that the structure and quantum of Executive Directors pay remains appropriate in this context.
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios Tesco remuneration arrangements have been designed to ensure that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of short-term and long-term goals that are aligned with our short-term and long-term strategic objectives and the creation of shareholder value.
The Committee considers the level of remuneration that may payout in different performance scenarios to ensure that this is considered appropriate in the context of the performance delivered and the value added for shareholders.
The charts below show hypothetical values of the remuneration package for Executive Directors under three assumed performance scenarios: CEO Dave Lewis CEO Dave Lewis million million CFO Alan Stewart CFO Alan Stewart million million 9 9 9 9 8,190k 8,190k 8 8 8 8 7 7 7 7 42% 42% 6 6 6 6 4,909k 4,909k 4,560k 4,560k 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 35% 35% 38% 38% 41 41% % 2,779k 2,779k 3 3 3 3 32% 32% 34 34% % 1,628k 1,628k 37 37% % 2 2 2 2 998k 998k 30% 30% 1 1 1 1 100% 100% 33% 33% 20% 20% 100% 100% 36 36% % 22% 22% 0 0 0 0 Minimum Minimum On-tar On-target get Maximu Maximum m Minimum Minimum On-tar On-target get Maximu Maximum m Fi Fixe xed d Pa Pay y Annual bonu Annual bonus s L Long-t ong-term inc erm incentiv entive e Fi Fixe xed d Pa Pay y Annual bonu Annual bonus s L Long-t ong-term inc erm incentiv entive e Performance scenarios Maximum award opportunities % of salary CEO CFO Annual bonus 250% 225% PSP 275% 250% Minimum No bonus payout No vesting under the Performance Share Plan On-target performance 50% annual bonus payout 50% vesting under the Performance Share Plan Maximum performance 100% annual bonus payout 100% Performance Share Plan vesting Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 65 Directors remuneration report continued Directors remuneration policy No share price growth or the payment of dividend equivalents has been assumed.
Potential benefits under all employee share schemes have not been included.
Fixed pay is based on current values as set out in the table below: Salary Benefits Pension Total fixed pay From 25% of appointment salary CEO Dave Lewis 000 1,250 65 313 1,628 CFO Alan Stewart 000 750 60 188 998 Benefits are calculated based on forecast full-year benefits excluding one-off costs.
The actual benefits for 2014 15 were Dave Lewis 97,000 and Alan Stewart 42,000.
Remuneration policy for new hires The Committee would generally seek to align the remuneration package offered to new Executives with our remuneration policy outlined in the table above.
When determining appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Committee will take into account all relevant factors including the experience and calibre of the candidate, the candidates current reward opportunity, and the jurisdiction the candidate was recruited from.
In respect of an Executive Directors appointment, the Committee may offer variable remuneration arrangements that it considers appropriate and necessary to recruit and retain the individual subject to the maximum variable limit outlined below.
Variable remuneration awarded in respect of an Executive Directors appointment shall be limited to the current aggregate annual and PSP award policy of 600% of base salary.
This limit includes awards granted under the normal policy outlined above but excluding any awards made to compensate the Executive Director for awards forfeited from their previous employer.
The Committee may make awards when appointing an Executive Director to buy out remuneration terms forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted e. g. cash or shares and the time over which they would have vested.
The Committees key principle is that buyout awards will generally be made on a comparable basis to those forfeited.
To facilitate buyout awards outlined above, in the event of recruitment, the Committee may grant awards to a new Executive Director under the Listing Rule 9.4.
2, which allows for the granting of awards, to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of an Executive Director, or under other relevant company incentive plans.
The Company will pay legal fees incurred by any new Executive Directors in respect of their appointment.
In the event that an internal candidate was promoted to the Board, legacy terms and conditions would normally be honoured, including pension entitlements and any outstanding incentive awards.
In the event of the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-executive Director, remuneration arrangements will normally reflect the policy outlined on page 68 for Chairmen and Non-executive Directors.
Executive Director service agreements and policy on Executive Directors leaving Tesco When determining leaving arrangements for an Executive Director, the Committee takes into account any contractual agreements including the provisions of any incentive arrangements, typical market practice and the performance and conduct of the individual.
The following table summarises our policy in relation to Executive Director service agreements and payments in the event of loss of office.
66 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Provision Current service agreements Notice period 12 months notice by the Company and six months notice by the Executive Director For new appointments, the Committee reserves the right to vary this period to 24 months for the initial period of appointment and for the notice period to then revert to 12 months after the initial 12 months of employment Expiry date Dave Lewis and Alan Stewart entered into service agreements with Tesco PLC on 19 July 2014 and 9 July 2014 respectively These are rolling service agreements with no fixed expiry date Termination payments does not apply if notice is provided, If the Company terminates a Directors agreement without full notice or it is terminated by an Executive Director as per the service agreement, or for termination by reason in response to a serious contractual breach by the Company then the Executive has the right to a termination of resignation or unacceptable performance or conduct payment to reflect the unexpired term of the notice Any termination payment in lieu of notice will be based on base salary and benefits only Benefits comprise car-related benefits, healthcare and health insurance and staff discount No account will be taken of pension when determining termination payments Termination payments will normally be subject to mitigation and paid in instalments to facilitate this other than for long-serving Executive Directors or in the event of a change of control of the Company where the termination payment is made in full on departure Where an Executive Director has less than eight years of continuous service then any termination payment will normally be made in 13 equal four-weekly payments.
Where an Executive Director has more than 15 years continuous service then the termination payment is made in full on departure.
For periods of continuous service between eight years and 15 years, termination payments will normally be split between initial payments and phased payments Payment in full on termination on change of control arises if the Company terminates or gives notice within 12 months after a change of control Where an Executive Director retires from the business they will not normally receive a termination payment The Companys obligation to continue making phased termination payments will cease when the Executive Director commences alternative employment In the event of termination, an Executive Director may have an entitlement to compensation in respect of statutory rights under employment protection legislation in the UK and potentially elsewhere Other information The Committee may determine that an Executive Director may remain eligible to receive a pro-rata bonus for the financial year in respect of the period they remained in employment.
The Committee will determine the level of bonus taking into account time in employment and performance.
Where an Executive leaves by reason of death, disability or ill-health, they, or in the case of death their personal representatives, are entitled to a pro-rata performance-based bonus for the year of leaving In the event that an Executive Director retires from the Company, they shall be entitled to retain their private medical cover and annual medical examinations in retirement.
Any Executive Directors appointed from 24February 2013 will not be entitled to this benefit Under the employment agreements, while in employment Executive Directors are also entitled to sick pay, paid holiday, maternity and paternity leave Where appropriate, the Company will meet an Executive Directors reasonable legal fees in connection with the termination of his employment and or the reasonable cost of outplacement services The service agreements are available to shareholders to view at the Companys registered office.
Share plan rules leaver provisions The treatment of outstanding share awards in the event that an Executive Director leaves is governed by the relevant share plan rules.
The following table summarises leaver provisions under the executive share plans.
In specific circumstances, the Committee may exercise its discretion to modify the policy outlined to the extent that the rules of the share plan allow such discretion.
The Committee will not exercise discretion to allow awards to vest where the participant is dismissed for gross misconduct.
Death Good leavers as determined by the Committee Leavers in other circumstances in accordance with the plan rules other than summary dismissal Good leavers are: injury, ill-health or disability, redundancy, retirement, the entity which employs the Executive ceasing to be part of the Group or any other reason determined by the Committee taking into account the circumstances of departure and performance Executive Unvested awards vest on death.

Under this plan, in the event that a participant leaves for good leaver reasons death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement, the entity which employs the Executive Director ceasing to be part of the Group or any other reason determined by the Committee awards will vest at leaving and participants will normally have 12 months from cessation to exercise awards in the form of options.
If a participant leaves in other circumstances other than in circumstances of gross misconduct awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date and participants will normally have 12 months from vesting to exercise awards in the form of options.
Philip Clarke and Laurie McIlwee hold vested options under the 2004 Discretionary Share Option Plan and 2004 PSP.
Under these plans, when participants leave, they have 12 months from leaving to exercise options.
Other vesting circumstances Awards may also vest early if: i a participant is transferred to a country, as a result of which the participant will suffer a tax disadvantage or become subject to restrictions on his award under the PSP and 2004 Executive Incentive Plan : or ii in the event of a takeover, winding-up or other corporate event affecting the Company, which may affect the value of share awards such as a demerger or special dividend.
The number of shares under an award which vest in these circumstances will be determined by the Committee.
In the case of the PSP, when determining the level of vesting the Committee will consider performance and the time elapsed since grant.
In the case of the deferred bonus shares under the 2004 and 2014 Executive Incentive Plan awards will vest in full.
Where an Executive Director leaves as a result of summary dismissal they will forfeit outstanding share incentive awards.

Non-executive Directors have no entitlement to compensation on termination.

68 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Considering colleagues views The Committee does not consider that it is appropriate to consult colleagues directly when developing the Directors Remuneration Policy.
A significant portion of our colleagues are shareholders so are able to express their views in the same way as other shareholders.
The Company undertakes an employee engagement survey, which occurs annually across Tescos global operations and semi-annually for colleagues in the UK.
This survey asks for feedback and comments on many aspects of employment with Tesco, including employee reward and benefits.
This insight, combined with feedback gleaned from social media channels, forms a key part of shaping future plans and taking action to improve.
The Committee reviews information regarding the typical remuneration structure and reward levels for other UK-based employees to provide context when determining executive remuneration policy.
Considering shareholders views The Committee believes that it is very important to maintain an open dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters.
The Committee regularly consults significant shareholders regarding potential changes to remuneration arrangements and the views of shareholders are important in determining any final changes.
Going forward, the Committee will continue to liaise with shareholders regarding remuneration matters more generally and Tesco arrangements as appropriate.
It is the Committees intention to consult major shareholders in advance of making any material changes to remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors.
