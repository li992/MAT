Except for investments in associates and fixed rate loans, the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost approximate to their fair value.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities within the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity balances.
