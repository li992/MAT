Directors Remuneration Report We have undertaken a review of our remuneration report to respond to regulatory requirements and in preparation for the first binding vote on our remuneration policy.
We have set out where we may need to exercise our discretion and it is important to recognise that no change to our existing, shareholder agreed, policy has been implemented.
Finally, as I will be retiring from the Board and therefore my role of the Chairman to the Remuneration Committee, we appointed one of my fellow committee members to the role.
Alison Wood will be taking up her new role as Chair of the Committee immediately following the AGM.
I hope that we can rely on your vote in favour of the Annual Report and Accounts on remuneration and our Directors remuneration policy for future years.

The market price of the Ordinary Shares as at 31 December 2013 was 274.5 pence per share and the closing price range during the year was 211.2 pence to 307.7 pence.
Dilution The Companys share schemes are currently funded through shares purchased in the market and have been since November 2010, prior to which they were funded through new issue shares.
Funding of awards through new issue shares is subject to an overall dilution limit of 10% of issued share capital in any ten year period.
Of this, 5% may be used in connection with the Companys discretionary share schemes.
As of 31 December 2013, 13.1m 1.21% and 8.6m 0.79% shares have been issued pursuant to awards made in the previous ten years in connection with all share schemes and discretionary schemes respectively.
Awards that are made, but then lapse or are forfeit, are excluded from the calculations.
Payments to past Directors audited information Payments to past Directors, after their termination date, in respect of unvested long term incentives during the year have been made to Andy Stevens as follows: No of shares No of shares Value of shares awarded vested vesting k PSP 2011 227,245 20,679 56.6 Total 20,679 56.6 The PSP will vest at 9.1% on 10 March 2014 based on the performance conditions measured over the three financial years ended 31 December 2013 and outlined on page 56.
As the awards had not vested at the date of this report, the average share price for the last three months of the financial year of 273.8 pence has been used to determine the value.
These payments have been made because Andy Stevens has been treated as a good leaver under the relevant plan rules.
The good leaver provisions allow the Remuneration Committee some element of discretion, which they exercised in this case as Andy Stevens retired from office on the grounds of ill health.
Andy Stevens BCP award did not vest due to performance conditions not being achieved.
