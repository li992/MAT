A summary of the Companys policy on Directors remuneration, broken down by Executive Directors, Chairman and Non-Executive Directors isset out in the tables below.
Executive Directors The Committees policy for the Executive Directors is to provide remuneration which is largely performance orientated, closely aligns the Directors interests with those of shareholders and which will retain a talented executive team who can deliver excellent long term Company performance.
To achieve the aim of this policy the remuneration of the Executive Directors is made up of different elements of fixed and variable pay, with a significant emphasis on performance-related pay for achievement of stretching targets.
If challenging performance conditions attached to variable pay are achieved in full, a substantial proportion of an Executive Directors remuneration will be performance related.
Overall, the Committees policy is to ensure that the balance of performance conditions in the annual bonus and long term incentive plan awards provides a good link to the Companys business strategy and continues to make the Company successful on a sustainable basis.

Future awards will be granted with an initial option price equal to the market value of a share, or 6.20 if higher.
Differences between the Executive Directors and general employees remuneration policy Performance-related pay makes up a significantly higher proportion of remuneration for the Executive Directors and senior employees than for employees generally, reflecting the role of these individuals in managing the business to achieve the Companys strategic objectives.
The Committee considers that the emphasis on performance related pay for Executive Directors and senior employees closely aligns the Directors interests with those of shareholders and helps to deliver excellent long term Company performance.
Legacy arrangements For avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors Remuneration Policy, the authority is given to the Company to honour any previously disclosed commitments entered into with current or former Directors such as the payment of pensions or the vesting exercise of past share awards.

Non-Executive Directors do not receive bonus, pension or salary supplement payments, share scheme awards or other benefits.
Recruitment and promotion policy The Companys policy is to promote internally where possible.
The Committees approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates with the appropriate skills for the housebuilding industry.
Any new Executive Directors remuneration would include the same elements of the existing Executive Directors and would be set in accordance with the terms of the Companys prevailing remuneration policy at the time of appointment.
The salary for a new Executive Director may be set below the normal market rate, with phased increases over the first few years as the Director gains experience in their new role.
The Committee may offer additional cash and or share based elements at recruitment when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and therefore shareholders to take account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would take account of the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms.
As described in the policy tables above, it may also be necessary to offer relocation benefits for external and internal appointments.
Service contracts The Companys policy is for service contracts with Executive Directors to have no more than a 12-month notice period.
The Committee reserves the discretion to offer a longer notice period initially to an Executive Director recruited externally.
In such cases where a longer notice period is given, the Executive Directors notice period would be reduced to 12 months once the initial period has lapsed.
The Executive Directors have a contract with a twelve month notice period.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are not employees, they have letters of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities: they do not have service contracts.
The Chairmans letter of appointment is dated 7 March 2011 but is effective from his appointment as Chairman on 21 April 2011.
The Chairmans continued appointment is subject to his re-election by shareholders at each AGM and may be terminated on six months notice.
The Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment are effective from their date of appointment.
A Non-Executives appointment is initially for a three-year term but is subject to re-election at each AGM but their appointment may be terminated on one months notice.
There are no change of control provisions in the Executive Directors service contracts.
The rules of the Companys share schemes provide for early exercise of awards on a takeover or change of control.
Policy on payment for loss of ofce An Executive Director is only entitled to payments of base salary and benefits in respect of the unexpired notice period for termination of employment where dismissed by the Company in breach of contract.
Such payments will be subject to mitigation by the Director and will not in any event exceed 12 months base salary and benefits.
In addition, if Mike Killorans contract is terminated in breach of contract by the Company, his contract states that his termination payment may include any payment for bonus earned for the period served prior to the date of termination.
Annual bonus payments would not otherwise be made unless the Executive Director is employed on the date of payment, except in good leaver circumstances for example, retirement, redundancy or ill-health, where a bonus may be payable on the normal date in respect of the period served only.
Long term incentive plan awards, Bonus Share Scheme awards and SAYE options are not contractual entitlements and Directors awards will lapse under the rules of those schemes on termination of employment save in standard good leaver circumstances.
In good leaver circumstances long term incentive plan awards would continue to be subject to the original performance conditions but the number of shares under award would be scaled back pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.
The Committee has the discretion to reduce any scaling back if it considers it inappropriate in a particular case.
Bonus Share Scheme awards and SAYE options would be exercisable within six months of an Executive Director leaving the Company under the standard good leaver circumstances.
Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 51 External appointments None of the Executive Directors currently have an external appointment.
The Directors recognise that external appointments can broaden an individuals skills and experience.
If an Executive Director wishes to take up an external appointment, he must first seek approval from the Chairman and or the Group Chief Executive.
Illustrations of application of remuneration policy The charts below illustrate the value of remuneration each of the Executive Directors could receive for 2014 under three scenarios being the minimum remuneration they will receive: the remuneration in line with expected performance, and the maximum achievable.
Fixed pay is base salary for 2014, plus benefits and pension salary supplements.
Annual variable pay is the annual bonus receivable.
Expected performance would deliver 50% of the maximum annual bonus.
The Committee is not intending to make long term incentive plan awards in 2014 and so no allowance has been made for long term variable remuneration in the illustrations below.
Awards have previously been made to Executive Directors under the 2012 LTIP but these have a 10-year performance condition linked to the return to shareholders of 6.20 per share over the period 2012 to 2021, with the first opportunity for exercise up to a maximum of 40% of the vested shares on 31 December 2017.

Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 54 Annual report on remuneration continued Directors pension entitlements Jeff Fairburn and David Jenkinson each earn pension in the Companys defined benefit scheme on a career average revalued earnings CARE basis and on a scheme capped salary currently 141,000.
The cap increases on 1 July each year in line with increases in the Retail Price Index.
Their scheme retirement age is 65 and their accrual rate is 60ths.
As Jeff Fairburn and David Jenkinsons pensionable salary in the DB scheme is capped, they also receive matching 9% contributions into a stakeholder policy, up to the HMRC annual allowance for pension saving.
In addition, because they do not earn pension on their total base salary, they are paid a salary supplement of 9% of the difference between their pensionable salary and their base salary.
Mike Killoran and Nigel Greenaway have both ceased membership of Company pension schemes.
Mike Killoran is paid a salary supplement of 30% of his base salary, which the Committee after taking advice considers is cost neutral to the Company based on the pension benefits Mike Killoran previously earned.
Nigel Greenaway receives a salary supplement of 9% of his base salary, being the supplement available to monthly paid employees who cease pension scheme membership due to reaching the HMRC Lifetime Allowance for pension saving.
No additional benefits are receivable by the Directors on early retirement.

LTIP Awards granted in 2013 During the year the Committee agreed that Jeff Fairburn, Nigel Greenaway and David Jenkinson should receive the following awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan 2012 2012 LTIP, in light of their respective promotions to Group Chief Executive and to the Board.
These awards have a maximum 10-year performance period specifically aligned to the Companys Capital Return Plan.
The intention with the 2012 LTIP is to make awards with much longer performance and vesting periods, rather than making lower annual awards with shorter performance periods.

This is the independent calculation of the fair value of the awards for such transactions in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and has been prepared using the Black Scholes option pricing model.
The awards were granted with an option price at full market value and will not vest and have value unless the performance condition ismet.
The regulatory value is required to be included using a strict calculation which is inappropriate for this award.
It should be noted that the regulatory value has been calculated using the share price on the date of grant, it takes no account of the fact the awards were market value options and makes no allowance for the exercise price that will be payable by the Director.
The date of grant for Jeff Fairburn and Nigel Greenaway was 19 April 2013 and the share price on that date was 11.30.
The date of grant for David Jenkinson was 13 December 2013 and the share price on that date was 11.36.
However, in accordance with the rules of the 2012 LTIP the market value for setting the initial option exercise price was the mid market price of a share on the day prior to the date of grant.
Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 55 The number of shares that will vest is the same for all awards made under the 2012 LTIP and is dependent on the payment of cash returns to shareholders for the period 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2021, which must be achieved by the Measurement Dates set out below.
Cumulative Cash Return targets Measurement Dates 1.70 per share or more by 31 December 2015 2.80 per share or more by 31 December 2017 3.90 per share or more by 31 December 2019 5.05 per share or more by 31 December 2020 6.20 per share or more by 31 December 2021 The initial exercise price will reduce by an amount equal to the value of cash returns to shareholders made by the Company during the period from date of grant to the earlier of 31 December 2021 or the date of exercise of an option.
The aggregate number of shares held under an option that will vest by each Measurement Date will normally be determined by reference to the fraction x 6.20, where x is the value of the Cumulative Cash Return paid by the relevant Measurement Date.
To the extent options vest on or before 31 December 2017, up to 40% of the total number of shares held under an option may be exercised from 31 December 2017 and the remainder of the vested options shall normally become exercisable on 31 December 2021.
If 6.20 per share is returned early, an option will vest and become exercisable on the date this is achieved, but no options will become exercisable before 31 December 2015.
In considering the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied, no options shall vest and become exercisable unless, in the opinion of the Committee, acting fairly and reasonably, the cash returns paid by the Company are financed out of retained earnings and the Company has an ungeared balance sheet at the relevant Measurement Date, except to take account of events and or circumstances which the Committee fairly and reasonably determines are appropriate the Underpin.
If the cash return of 1.70 is not met by 31 December 2015 the performance condition will not have been satisfied and the 2012 LTIP will expire on 31 December 2015 and all options will lapse in full on that date.
If the Cumulative Cash Return is not achieved by a Measurement Date except 31 December 2015 options will vest and become exercisable on the Measurement Date by which the Cash Return for that date has not been achieved and the number of shares that vest will be reduced accordingly.

Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 59 Remuneration Policy implementation for 2014 Executive Directors Base salaries After taking into consideration Group employees salary increases in 2013 monthly paid employees generally received a 3% base salary increase in 2013 plus general market conditions, the Committee has awarded salary increases of 3% to Executive Directors from 1 January 2014.
David Jenkinson received a base salary increase above 3% due to his promotion to the Board: his salary has been aligned to that of Nigel Greenaway as they have identical responsibilities.
Base salary from 1 January 2014 2013 Jeff Fairburn 618,000 600,000 Mike Killoran 468,390 454,750 Nigel Greenaway 329,600 320,000 David Jenkinson 329,600 n a Annual bonus The Committee was aware at the time of Jeff Fairburns appointment as Group Chief Executive that his base salary remained substantially behind the salary of his predecessor in the role and also behind the salaries of the Chief Executives of other major housebuilders.
The Committee wanted to see how Jeff Fairburn settled into his new role in 2013, with a view to reviewing his remuneration for 2014.
Taking account of Jeff Fairburns strong performance and leadership since he became Group Chief Executive and having consulted with major shareholders, the Committee has agreed that Jeff Fairburns remuneration should be changed for 2014.
The Committee agreed that although Jeff Fairburns 2013 base salary was only 80% of the market median for other large housebuilders, it was not appropriate to apply a large salary increase for 2014, but rather his annual bonus opportunity should be increased.
The Group Chief Executives maximum annual bonus has therefore increased from 150% of base salary to 200% for 2014.
The increase in annual bonus potential will be paid entirely in deferred shares, together enhancing the emphasis on pay for performance.
The Committee notes that Jeff Fairburns combined base salary plus maximum annual bonus remains below the market median.
The Committee has not changed the maximum annual bonus achievable for the other Executive Directors and this will continue to be set at 150% of base salary.
Any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary will again be paid in Bonus Share Scheme Awards for all Executive Directors, half vesting one year and half vesting two years after the announcement of the relevant years financial results.
In line with the Companys strategy to improve margins and return cash to shareholders under the Capital Return Plan, the Committee has decided that the most appropriate performance condition for 2014 annual bonus will primarily be based on profit before tax and cash generation measures.
This year the Committee will also introduce conditions relating to independently measured customer satisfaction, which will account for 10% of the maximum bonus opportunity and health and safety outcomes, which will act as a downward modifier of up to 10% of the bonus outcome.
The targets are based on figures which are commercially sensitive, but which will be disclosed in the next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Committee considers that the targets it has set are stretching.
The bonus continues to be subject to robust clawback provisions.
Long Term Incentive Plan Awards The Committee does not intend to make any additional awards to Executive Directors in 2014, unless a new Executive Director is appointed.
Pension Schemes There is no change to pension benefits for 2014, current arrangements are as set out on page 54.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2013 60 Remuneration Policy implementation for 2014 continued Chairman and Non-Executive Directors Fees The Committee has agreed that the Chairmans fee for 2014 should be increased by 3% making his fee for 2014 195,700.
The Board as a whole determines the fees of the Non-Executive Directors.
The Board has agreed that the fee for 2014 should increase by 3% to 54,590 plus an additional fee of 9,680 for extra responsibilities in chairing a committee.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the Chairmans and each Executive Directors remuneration.
The Committee is comprised of four Non-Executive Directors, who all served throughout the year except for Marion Sears who was appointed to the Committee on 20 February 2013.
Neil Davidson, previously a Non-Executive Director also served on the Committee until 18 April 2013, when he retired from the Board.
Current members Date of appointment to the Committee Jonathan Davie Chairman 1 January 2010 Nicholas Wrigley 18 December 2007 Mark Preston 27 February 2012 Marion Sears 20 February 2013 The Committee sought advice on Executive Directors remuneration matters from its independent remuneration consultants New Bridge Street NBS, a trading name of Aon Hewitt part of the Aon Corporation who were selected by the Committee due to their expertise in this field.
The Committee considers that the advice provided by NBS as an independent, professional remuneration consultant is objective and independent.
NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
Aon Hewitt also provides advice to the Company on the Companys pension schemes via its actuarial and pension consultancy division.
The Committee does not consider that the independence of NBS is compromised by this appointment as NBS is a separate division of Aon Hewitt based in London the actuarial and pension consultancy offices are in Leeds and Birmingham.
The amount of fees the Company paid to NBS for the services they provided in 2013 was 19,525, charged on a time spent basis.
In addition the Committee consulted with Jeff Fairburn, Group Chief Executive and Mike Farley when he was Group Chief Executive, but no Director was involved in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The Committee has also reviewed the remuneration of the Groups Divisional boards the level of management below Board level and of the Group Company Secretary.
