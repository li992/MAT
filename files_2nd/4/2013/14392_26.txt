Other The Chairman is provided with the use of a company car.
The non-executive directors are not eligible for benefits.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors are not eligible for bonuses or participation in share schemes or any pension provision Existing grants or entitlements It is the Companys intention to honour all pre-existing commitments at the date of this report and to honour all future obligations entered into, consistent with the approved remuneration policy.
Performance measure selection The combination of measures used in the LTIP reinforces Smiths current strategy to create value through four key drivers: revenue growth, operating margin which the Committee continues to advocate is best represented by EPS, cash conversion and ROCE currently incentivised by the CIP.
Relative TSR provides strong alignment with shareholders and the FTSE 100 Index excluding financial services companies continues to be considered a relevant and robust indicator of the relative value created by Smiths management for its shareholders.
This balance between both internal and external performance and between absolute and relative performance is considered to be important by the Committee.
Performance target setting The Remuneration Committee sets targets that it considers to be challenging but attainable and aligned to the Companys business objectives over the short term, as reflected in the annual business plan, and longer term, consistent with the strategic plan.
Difference in policy between executive director and other employees There is no difference in the reward policy for executive directors and other senior employees and the company does not currently operate any incentive plans in which only executive directors participate.
Service contracts The Companys policy is that executive directors are normally employed on terms which include a one-year rolling period of notice and provision for the payment of a predetermined sum in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances but excluding circumstances where the Company is entitled to dismiss without compensation.
Mr Bowman Mr Bowman is employed under a service contract with the Company dated 15 November 2007 and effective from 10 December 2007.
It may be terminated by 12 months notice given by the Company or six months notice given by Mr Bowman.
The Company may elect to terminate the contract by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to 150% of Mr Bowmans basic salary, this being a genuine pre-estimate of Mr Bowmans entitlement in respect of the unserved notice period, to cover: 1. salary: 2. annual pension contribution by the Company 42% of base salary : 3. the annual cost to the Company of providing all other benefits to which Mr Bowman is entitled under his contract, but excluding bonus.
In this event, the contract provides that Mr Bowmans bonus entitlement for the financial year in which termination occurs and for the unserved notice period will be the subject of a separate, good faith discussion between Mr Bowman and the Chairman: the contract also specifies that Mr Bowman would in this case be treated as a good leaver for the purposes of relevant share plans.
In certain constructive dismissal events, Mr Bowman is entitled to resign and be treated in the manner set out above.
Mr Turner Mr Turner is employed under a service contract with the Company dated 23 March 2010 and effective from 19 April 2010.
It provides for a rolling one-year notice period given by the Company or six months notice given by Mr Turner.
In the event of termination by the Company other than for cause, the Board is required to consider what sum should be payable as compensation to Mr Turner.
In doing so, the Board shall take into account a number of specific matters, including Mr Turners personal circumstances, the financial performance of Smiths Group, applicable corporate governance best practice, the likelihood of Mr Turner obtaining alternative employment, and various other matters relating to Mr Turners financial loss.
The amount of compensation, as so determined, will not be less than 12 months basic salary.
86 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2013 Chairman and non-executive directors The Chairman and the non-executive directors serve the Company under letters of appointment and do not have contracts of service or contracts for services.
Except where appointed at a general meeting, directors stand for election by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting AGM following appointment and then stand for re-election at every third AGM or such earlier AGM as the Board may determine thereafter under Article 49.
The Board has resolved that all directors who are willing to continue in office will stand for re-election by the shareholders each year at the AGM.
Either party can terminate the appointment on one months written notice and no compensation is payable in the event of an appointment being terminated early.
The dates of their original appointment are as follows: Expiry of Non-executive director Date of appointment current term Date of election last re-election B. F. J. Angelici 1 July 2010 2013 20 November 2012 D. H. Brydon 19 April 2004 2013 20 November 2012 D. J. Challen 21 September 2004 2013 20 November 2012 T. D. Fratto 1 July 2012 2015 20 November 2012 A. C.

Tebbit 14 June 2006 2013 20 November 2012 subject to the directors re-appointment annually at each Annual General Meeting Leaving and change-of-control provisions For those individuals regarded as bad leavers e. g. voluntary resignation or dismissals for cause, annual bonus awards are forfeited and matching awards under the CIP and outstanding awards under the LTIP automatically lapse.
A good leaver will typically remain eligible for a pro-rated annual bonus award to be paid after the end of the financial year and will also continue to be eligible to receive a pro-rated number of matching shares under the CIP subject to the normal performance criteria if the individual holds a pro-rated proportion of their invested shares until the end of the original three-year performance period.
LTIP awards will typically vest at the normal vesting date for good leavers to the extent that the TSR, EPS and cash conversion performance conditions are met, but will normally be pro-rated on the basis of actual service within the performance period.
LTIP awards automatically lapse for those not regarded as good leavers.
In the event of a change of control, for awards under the CIP and LTIP, performance would be measured over the performance period to the date of change of control and awards will vest to the extent that each of the performance conditions is met at that date.
Awards will also normally be pro-rated to reflect the time that has elapsed between the grant of the award and the date of change of control.
The rules of the plans provide the Committee with the discretion to amend the vesting level of CIP invested shares and in relation to the EPS and cash conversion elements of the LTIP, to adjust the vesting level if it considers that the performance conditions would have been met to a greater or lesser extent at the end of the full three-year performance period.
The Committee also retains discretion to vary these provisions on a case-by-case basis.
Approach to recruitment remuneration The Remuneration Committee approves the remuneration of each executive director on their appointment.
In setting remuneration on recruitment, the Committee will apply the following policy: Pay element Policy on recruitment Maximum Salary Salary on recruitment is determined based on the same principles as the annual salary review, as outlined in the policy table Pension As described in the policy table Benefits As described in the policy table and may include, but not limited to, car, medical insurance and life assurance Annual bonus As described in the policy table and typically pro-rated for proportion of year served 180% of salary CIP As described in the policy table 180% of salary LTIP May be considered for an award under the LTIP on similar terms to other executives 300% of salary Other The Remuneration Committee may make an award in recognition of incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Any such award will take account of relevant factors including performance conditions, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
The Remuneration Committee may make payments to cover reasonable expenses in recruitment and relocation, and any other miscellaneous expenses such as housing, tax and immigration support.
Annual bonus maximum shown is prior to mandatory deferral Maximum CIP shown assumes maximum bonus is earned in the first year of employment, and maximum performance over the performance period covering the following three years, i. e. warranting a maximum 2-for-1 match Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2013 87 Accounts Governance Risks and responsibility Business review Chairman and Chief Executive Group overview Directors remuneration report Continued External appointments Subject to the overriding requirements of the Company, the Committee allows executive directors to accept external appointments where it considers that such appointments will contribute to the directors breadth of knowledge and experience.
Directors are permitted to retain fees associated with such appointments.
Pay scenarios The graphs below provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunity for executive directors, and the potential mix between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Minimum, On-Target and Maximum.
For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for 2014.
It should be noted that any awards granted under the CIP and LTIP in a year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant.
This illustration is intended to provide further information to shareholders on the relationship between executive pay and performance.
Please note, however, that actual pay delivered will further be influenced by changes in factors such as the Companys share price and the value of dividends paid.

Annual bonus Executive directors are eligible to participate in an annual bonus plan based on a combination of corporate financial goals Group EPS and cash conversion and the achievement of personal objectives.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive is 180% of salary and for the Finance Director is 150% of salary.
The table below summarises the structure of the 2013 14 annual bonus plan and the awards receivable for performance in 2013 14.

Turner 75% 30% 45% 150% Co-Investment Plan CIP Under the rules of the CIP, there is a mandatory investment of 50% of any net earned annual bonus in Smiths shares for selected senior executives including executive directors.
Invested amounts can earn a 2-for-1 matching share award after three years based on the pre-tax amount of deferred bonus, subject to continued employment in the Group and the Companys average return on capital employed ROCE over the performance period exceeding the Companys weighted average cost of capital WACC, which the Committee regards as appropriately reflecting the operating efficiency of the Company.
Prior to the start of each award cycle, the Committee reviews the targets required for any matching shares to vest to ensure they remain appropriately stretching.
For CIP awards granted in 2013, matching share awards vest in full if ROCE exceeds WACC by an average margin of at least 3% a year: a 1-for-1 matching share award vests if ROCE is between WACC 1% and WACC 3% p. a.
Dividends accrue on matching shares that vest.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The LTIP is a conventional share plan under which an award over a capped number of shares will vest if demanding performance conditions are met.
LTIP awards of conditional shares are granted to selected senior executives including the executive directors with face values of up to 300% of salary.
Under the LTIP, the normal annual grants are 300% of salary for the Chief Executive and 200% of salary for the Finance Director.
Awards made in 2012 13 are disclosed on page 94.
LTIP awards to be granted to executive directors in 2013 14 will vest on the achievement of the following performance conditions: Threshold Maximum performance performance target target 25% vesting full vesting Performance measure Weighting of element of element 3-year EPS growth 50% 4% p. a.
3-year TSR rank vs. the FTSE 100 companies Upper excluding financial services companies 30% Median quartile 3-year average annual cash conversion 20% 85% 100% For performance between threshold and maximum, awards vest on a straight-line sliding scale.
To the extent that the performance targets are not met over the three-year performance period, awards will lapse.
No retesting of awards under either performance condition is permitted.
Dividends accrue and are paid in cash at the end of the vesting period, on shares that vest.
In addition, LTIP awards are subject to clawback in the event of a material mis-statement in the published results of the Group, or in the event of misconduct on the part of the participant.
