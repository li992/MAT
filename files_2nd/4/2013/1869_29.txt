In December 2013 the salaries of the executive directors were reviewed by the Remuneration Committee.
It was agreed that the base salary for Simon Pryce to take effect from 1 January 2014 would increase by 2.5% to 589,375.
Mark Hoads salary will be unchanged at 325,000 following three years of larger than normal increases as set out in previous reports.
The average base salary increase across the banded senior management population was 2.30% across the Group.
It is expected that the base salaries for executive directors will be reviewed in December 2014.
Non-executive directors fees have increased by 15% to 55,000 and took effect from 1 January 2014.
These are not expected to be reviewed again until December 2016.
The Committee does not expect to change the Pension and Benefit arrangements for the executive directors in 2014.
For 2014 the Committee has determined that the annual bonus opportunity for executive directors and senior executives will again be contingent on meeting both financial targets and personal objectives.
The Committee has reviewed targets for the year to ensure they remain appropriately stretching and relevant to the Companys business strategy.
In 2014, financial performance objectives will again represent 84% of bonus opportunity and personal objectives 16%.
The Committee will ensure that the performance measures for any future awards made under the LTIP remain appropriately stretching in light of the Companys expectations of performance and those of external analysts.
In 2014, Simon Pryces LTIP award will be 190% of salary.
As noted in the Chairmans statement Mark Hoad will leave BBA Aviation plc on 30 June and will not be entitled to an LTIP award or a bonus in respect of 2014.

indb 78 12 03 2014 12:45 Directors Report Policy Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This section of the report describes BBA Aviations remuneration policy for directors.
The following key principles govern the design of the Groups remuneration and reward structures: Relevance to BBA Aviation, the cyclicality of our businesses and the international markets in which we compete and operate.
Pay for performance, notably the effective execution of the Group strategy and delivery of exceptional, long-term sustainable value for all our shareholders and stakeholders.
Reward actions that support our vision, mission and values.
Remuneration should be commensurate with role and responsibilities and sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high calibre individuals with relevant experience.
Reward should be appropriate and easily understood, both internally and externally.
For executive directors a significant element of remuneration should be aligned to long-term business performance.
The reward structure is compatible with our risk policies and systems and must not create environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The remuneration policy will take effect, subject to shareholder approval, from the close of the Companys AGM in May 2014.
All contractual commitments or awards made which are consistent with the remuneration policy in force at the time that the commitment or award was made will be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled or awards vest.
Any contractual commitments entered into or awards made before the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 came into force or before a person became a director will also be honoured.
The tables below set out a clear and comprehensive summary of BBA Aviations remuneration policy for directors and how it operates.

Notes 1 T he performance measures selected for the purposes of the annual bonus plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plans are either Key Performance Indicators for the Group or are selected in order to encourage and reward directly or indirectly sustainable and long-term shareholder value creation.
Performance targets are set taking into account prior year performance, annual budgets, strategic imperatives, and external factors.
Threshold performance is set taking into account the highly cyclical nature of our business and the variability of results from year to year and our dependence on flying hours.
The maximum standard of performance is intended to be exacting and to represent a level of performance that places the Group among the best performers.
indb 81 12 03 2014 12:45 Directors Report 2 The elements of remuneration for executive directors are similar to those that apply to the management banded population in the Group.
Directors Remuneration Report Any differences that exist arise either because of market practice and or the Remuneration Committees assessment of business need and commercial necessity.
3 The Company also reimburses business expenses in accordance with the corporate business expenses policy which the Remuneration Committee has discretion to revise from time to time.
4 In addition to other benefits, the Remuneration Committee, where necessary, will provide support in accordance with BBA Aviations standard approach to relocation where a director is required to relocate to fulfil their responsibilities.
The primary purpose of the policy is to facilitate recruitment and relocation of key employees by protecting the individual and their family from costs arising directly from a move of residence, required for business reasons.
The elements of the policy include, but are not limited to, travel reimbursement of the cost of movement of household goods, housing, schooling and other reasonable costs.

indb 84 12 03 2014 12:45 Directors Report Levels of remuneration under the policy assuming different performance outcomes for 2014 Directors Remuneration Report For mid-point performance the chart below shows that: more than half of remuneration is performance related: and more than one third is linked to longer-term performance.
For maximum performance the chart below shows that: over 70% is performance related: and over 40% is linked to longer-term performance.
Half the annual bonus is deferred for three years and is subject to forfeiture.
He will only receive his salary for half of the year and this is reflected in the graph above.
This excludes any possible payments for loss of office.
For the purposes of this analysis the following assumptions have been made: Fixed elements comprise base salary and other benefits: Base Salary and benefits and pension reflect current levels: For the Group Chief Executive: base salary of 589,375, benefits of 21,000 and pension of 117,875: For the Group Finance Director: base salary of 325,000, benefits of 18,000 and pension of 65,000: For mid-point performance, an assumption of 50% of annual bonus is applied and 50% vesting for the LTIP has also been used.
No share price increase has been assumed.
Recruitment and Appointment Policy This recruitment and appointment policy will apply if any of the following are appointed to the Board: External candidate: Internal candidate: A non-executive director being appointed as Chairman or to an executive role: or An executive director being promoted.
All of the components in the existing policy would be considered in developing an appropriate remuneration package in accordance with the principles set out on page 79 and taking into account the following additional considerations: A full range of factors including, but not limited to, the calibre of candidate, the level of existing remuneration, the jurisdiction the candidate is recruited from and into, and the individuals skills and experience.
Internal relativities and appropriate market comparisons.
Any awards or payments made in consideration for remuneration that may be foregone by an external candidate will generally be share-based and subject to forfeiture if the executive leaves within a set period after the appointment.
The value assigned to any remuneration that may be foregone will take into account factors such as the vesting period and the probability of shares vesting and will be based on objective valuation methodologies.
As far as possible, the remuneration of new directors will be set in accordance with the existing directors remuneration policy, however, the Committee retains discretion to: use the current Listing Rule 9.4.
2R if required in order to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of a director but any arrangements of this kind will not exceed 400% of salary: and agree contract terms to reflect local market norms but will generally seek to apply the current policy in respect of contracts of employment and corporate governance guidelines.
indb 85 12 03 2014 12:45 Directors Report Service contracts Directors Remuneration Report The executive directors have contracts of employment which entitle them to 12 months notice from the Company in the event of termination other than for cause.
Executive Directors contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination with a payment in lieu of notice, or an enforced period of paid garden leave at the Companys discretion.
The Group Chief Executive is required to give the Company twelve months notice and the Group Finance Director, six months.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment.
The Chairmans appointment letter entitles him to six months notice from the Company and he is required to give the Company six months notice.
The Company may terminate the Chairmans contract immediately and pay him an amount in lieu of his fees for six months less statutory deductions.
Letters of appointment and service contracts are available for inspection by shareholders at each AGM and during normal business hours at the Companys registered office.
There are no contractual commitments over and above those disclosed in this Policy.

The Company will seek to avoid making any payment for failure.
The Company takes into account the circumstances of termination and seeks to strike an appropriate balance, considering all relevant matters, that it believes are in the best interests of shareholders.
In certain circumstances the executive directors may receive compensation on early termination of a contract which could amount to up to one years base salary, benefits in kind and pension rights.
The contracts allow for phased payments to be made on termination and include an obligation on the former director to mitigate loss.
This mechanism of phased payments allows for the amount of any phased payments to be reduced in circumstances where the former director secures a position during the period of phased payments.
A director who leaves as a result of poor personal performance will normally be treated differently than a director who leaves by reason of redundancy, retirement or ill health.
The Company will not make any payments for loss of office in the event of gross misconduct.
The Remuneration Committee will operate the share schemes in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the principles of the remuneration policy see table on page 87 for further details.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to reach agreement with departing directors and approve additional payments in connection with the termination of a directors office or employment where such payment is in the interests of shareholders including the settlement or compromise of any claim or threatened claim.
There is no contractual obligation to pay bonus which has not been superseded by the bonus rules and there is no entitlement to any bonus payments if an employee is under notice given or received at the end of the applicable financial year, although it is within the discretion of the Committee to award bonus, subject to the limits set out in the policy.
On termination, a non-executive director would normally receive his fee for the month of termination.
The Chairman is entitled to six months notice and benefits for that period if served notice by the Company.
The Company may purchase a small token leaving gift for departing directors.
indb 86 12 03 2014 12:45 Directors Report The table below sets out how each component of the payment may be calculated.
Directors Remuneration Report Element of payment Basis of calculation Annual base salary Calculated on a contractual basis.
Pension and other Calculated on a contractual basis and where the pay in lieu of notice clause is invoked, an amount benefits up to one years accrued benefits.
The Committee also make modest payments relating to outplacements.
Annual incentive No bonus is paid in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct.
Ordinarily individuals are only entitled to bonus when reasons for leaving are including, and not limited to, retirement, death, ill health, redundancy, or sale of an employing entity.
However the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to pay bonus depending on the exact circumstances of the termination.
Bonus is not included in the calculation of any payment in lieu of notice.
Bonus is calculated in accordance with the rules of the plan.
Long-term incentives On a contractual basis and in accordance with the scheme rules.
Unvested shares lapse under the Long Term Incentive Plan on termination unless it is for a permitted reason ill health, redundancy, etc.
or the Remuneration Committee makes use of the discretion under the rules of the plans to allow the shares to vest.
Any vesting is subject to the substitution of performance targets and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, through pro-rating to reflect the date of termination, relative to the performance periods of the outstanding shares.
Deferred shares under the annual bonus plan may or may not be forfeitable depending on the timing of the termination in the deferral periods.
In the case of the unvested Deferred Bonus Matching shares the award may be awarded on termination for a permitted reason e. g. ill health, redundancy etc or at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Any matching award will vest subject to performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise pro-rated for the period served as a director during the performance period at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The contracts of the Group Chief Executive and the Finance Director preclude any right to other compensation for any loss of any share-based pay beyond the rules of the schemes.
Compensation for Upon termination, any buy out awards would normally lapse.
However, the Remuneration Committee forfeited remuneration does retain the discretion to decide otherwise, provided the termination is not as a result of poor performance.
Other benefits, e. g. Will depend on what has been agreed on appointment, but the Remuneration Committee would not relocation allowances, expect any or all of these elements of pay to form part of any termination arrangement but has discretion international mobility to make payments in respect of them.
benefits and expenses All employee equity Directors will be treated in the same manner as any other member of staff in respect of those plans.
indb 87 12 03 2014 12:45 Directors Report Change of Control Directors Remuneration Report In the event of a change of control the Remuneration Committee will determine the extent to which any shares will vest taking into account all relevant factors including the performance criteria and the time elapsed since the date of grant.
Directors will be entitled to receive their conditional shares from the deferred bonus where the risk of forfeiture has lifted.
Employment Conditions Elsewhere in the Company In determining remuneration, the Remuneration Committee is mindful of pay and conditions across the Group.
Decisions concerning Executive Directors pay and benefits are generally in line with the practices and framework across the Group.
The Committee is briefed by the Group Chief Executive and Group HR Director on the overall pay and benefits framework for the Group and on changes made.
The Remuneration Committee uses external remuneration comparison measurements.
Employees Views Employees have not been consulted on the directors remuneration policy but are free to ask any questions they wish and to offer any opinions they have through our employee communications channels.
Employees who are also shareholders are able to vote on the Directors Remuneration Policy and Report.
Shareholders Views The Remuneration Committee supported by the Group HR Director actively engages with major institutional shareholders on a regular basis.
Recent consultations have highlighted the preference of many shareholders for greater simplicity and streamlining of executive directors pay and the evolution of BBA Aviations policy reflects both the needs of the business and, as far as possible, the views of all our largest shareholders.
