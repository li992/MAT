Directors Remuneration Report Directors Remuneration Report Dear Shareholder, As the new Chairman of the Remuneration Committee the Committee, I am pleased to introduce the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2013 which has been prepared by the Committee and approved by the Board.
Firstly, I would like to extend my thanks to David Tyler, who has provided strong leadership as chair of the Committee during the last five years.
I am delighted to be given the opportunity to lead the Committee as we continue to encourage the executive directors to deliver exceptional performance and shareholder value, by ensuring that the Groups remuneration policy is aligned to the business strategy and shareholders interests.
2012 13 has once again presented a challenging external environment for Burberry.
While we expect the external global environment to remain challenging, the team is intensely focused on optimising the significant opportunities that exist for the brand across geographies and product divisions, with particular emphasis on unlocking the potential of our digital platform and our newly-integrated fragrance and beauty business.
Against this backdrop, Burberry has continued its strong growth trajectory, with another year of record profits.
This sustained growth is the result of our strategic investment in the brand.
In 2012 13, Burberry grew revenue by 8% and adjusted PBT by 14% in a challenging global environment.
Managements consistent execution of key strategies and dynamic response to issues and opportunities delivered this solid performance.
The Committee aims to ensure that directors and senior executives remuneration is globally competitive so as to attract and retain high calibre individuals, and is also strongly aligned to performance and delivering a sustainable increase in shareholder value.
The Groups remuneration policy is set out on pages 94 and 95 and this will continue to be the policy for the coming year.
As part of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill, the UK Government released its draft remuneration reporting regulations during the year.
The Committee has been monitoring these developments and, in the coming year, will be reviewing executive remuneration arrangements and reporting in light of these proposed changes.
The Committees review will take into account the strategic plan, the performance and growth of the Group and the global luxury goods sector, other regulatory developments, shareholder expectations and global market practice.
Investors will be aware that John Smith has been appointed as Chief Operating Officer and that Stacey Cartwright will be departing Burberry at the end of July 2013.
Following his appointment as an executive director, John Smith resigned his membership of the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee will continue to engage with shareholders on any key changes to executive remuneration arrangements and looks forward to gaining your support on this report when it is put to vote at the Annual General Meeting in July 2013.
Ian Carter Chairman, Remuneration Committee 93 Directors Remuneration Report Committee Membership The following directors served as members of the Committee throughout the financial year ending 31 March 2013: Members Appointment Date Resignation Date Ian Carter Chairman from 12 July 2012 18 May 2007 David Tyler Chairman until 12 July 2012 23 March 2007 Philip Bowman 21 June 2002 Stephanie George 19 May 2006 Sir John Peace 21 June 2002 12 July 2012 John Smith 2 February 2010 3 March 2013 Role of the Committee The Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman of the Board and monitors the level and structure of senior executive pay.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Groups website at burberryplc.
The Board reviewed the performance of the Committee in the year.
This review concluded that the Committee operated independently and effectively.
The Board believes that the collective experience of its members enables the Committee to give a balanced view on remuneration matters.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter for the Board as a whole.
No director is involved in any discussions as to their own remuneration.
During the year, the Committee met formally on five occasions.
Details of attendance at those meetings are set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 85.
At the invitation of the Committee, except where their own remuneration was being discussed, the following people attended meetings and provided advice to the Committee: Sir John Peace Chairman, Angela Ahrendts Chief Executive Officer, Stacey Cartwright Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Michael Mahony Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Anne-Soline Thorndike Senior Vice President, Reward and Recognition and Catherine Sukmonowski Company Secretary.
Towers Watson has been the appointed advisor to the Committee since 2011.
Towers Watson provides advice on the ongoing operation of employee and executive share plans together with advice on executive remuneration.
A term of the engagement between the Committee and Towers Watson is that any additional consulting services provided by Towers Watson to management are reported on a regular basis to the Committee.
Where an actual or potential conflict may occur, such work is agreed by the Chairman of the Committee prior to commencement.
Since their appointment, Towers Watson has provided market benchmarking information to management in relation to a small number of roles which fall below the remit of Committee review.
Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group, which is responsible for the development and maintenance of the voluntary Code of Conduct that clearly sets out the role of executive remuneration consultants and the professional standards by which they advise their clients.
Remuneration Policy The Committee believes the Groups remuneration should be strongly linked to performance and internationally competitive, taking into account the global markets in which it operates and from which it recruits.
The Groups remuneration policy is based on the following principles: Shareholder value: remuneration should be closely aligned with long-term value creation for shareholders through thoughtful selection of performance measures as described on the following pages, emphasis on variable pay and delivery of a significant proportion of remuneration in shares, some of which are expected to be retained in accordance with the Groups shareholding policy.
Linked to success of the business: the overall remuneration framework should provide a balance between shortand long-term business objectives.
Variable pay for executive directors includes 1 an annual cash bonus based on Adjusted Profit Before Tax as per the audited income statement Adjusted PBT, and 2 long-term share based incentives linked primarily to increases in shareholder value and growth in Adjusted PBT.
Competitive in the global talent market: total remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain exceptional talent within the global luxury goods sector.
Total remuneration for executive directors and other senior executives is therefore benchmarked against Burberrys main global competitors and comparable UK companies.
The Committee recognises that, for each executive, the relative importance of each of these benchmarks may be different.
Benefits are based on competitive market practice for each executive, depending on individual circumstances.
94 Directors Remuneration Report The principle of shareholder alignment is reflected throughout the organisation through our all employee share plans, which are where possible extended to all eligible Burberry employees globally.
During its deliberations on executive remuneration, the Committee considered the reward framework for all employees worldwide, ensuring that the principles applied are consistent with the executive remuneration policy.
Merit increases awarded to executives also occur within the broader all-employee structure, and executive share plans are extended through the organisation to senior executives and high potential employees where appropriate.
Details of the remuneration policy for the Chairman and non-executive directors are set out on page 102.
Remuneration structure Remuneration is structured such that for executive directors and other senior executives, performance-related elements represent the majority of total potential remuneration.
