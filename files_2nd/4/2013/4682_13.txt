I 2 3 4 Report of Directors REMUNERATION REPORT An Introduction This report explains the groups remuneration policy and provides details of the remuneration DEAR SHAREHOLDER, paid to Executive and Non-Executive Directors for services to the company during the year.
ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD, I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT THE Overview The Committee sets the strategy, structure and DIRECTORS REMUNERATION levels of remuneration for the Executive Directors and reviews the remuneration of other members REPORT FOR 2013. of senior management in the group generally.
It does so in the context of the groups overall strategy and performance to align the financial interests of the Executive Directors and other management and employees with achievement of the groups objectives.
Paul Neep Base salary Chairman, Executive Directors Remuneration Committee Our longstanding policy is for base salaries of Executive Directors to be around mid-market levels.
Salary increases for Executive Directors in 2013 were limited to 2.7%.
This was consistent with the average of other pay rises elsewhere in the group.
Annual bonus The Committee believes annual bonus targets should be genuinely challenging, clearly linked to the companys strategy and performance, and designed to align the interests of executives and shareholders.
In 2013, our business plan sought profit growth in a challenging economic environment.
The Committee decided on two performance measurements: i Operating Profit: and ii Operating Cash Flow.
The Committee considers that some measure of earnings should always be part of the annual bonus targets.
Earnings growth is one of the ultimate aims of our strategy, and drives shareholder value.
The company encountered difficult trading conditions, particularly in the first half of 2013, and performance for the full year did not meet the targets set.
As a result, no annual bonus was paid.
Full details are set out on page 59.
50 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 We continue to monitor our approach to remuneration to ensure it remains relevant and consistent with our strategy and performance.
Long-term incentive scheme The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director received conditional awards under the 2003 Performance Share Plan in 2011.
The performance targets for these awards were partly based on EPS growth and partly on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR, measured across a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2013.
The Committee reviewed the performance of the company against these conditions in February 2014, and concluded that, while the TSR threshold had not been met, the EPS growth target was partially satisfied, and as a result limited vesting was approved.
A full explanation of the performance metric is shown on page 59.
The existing 2003 Performance Share Plan expired in 2013, and was replaced with a new scheme in substantially the same form but taking into account minor changes to bring it in line with current best practice.
The Committee consulted with the companys major shareholders and investor representative bodies regarding the new plan, and its introduction was well supported at the 2013 Annual General Meeting.
Details of the new plan in terms of award limits and performance targets are set out in the policy table on page 53.
Summary We continue to monitor our approach to remuneration to ensure it remains relevant and consistent with our strategy and performance.
The Committee believes the current policy, as set out above and as more fully explained in the attached report, remains appropriate.
The Board will be submitting this report, and our policy for executive pay, for approval by shareholders at our Annual General Meeting on 30 April 2014.
Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 51 I 2 3 4 Report of Directors REMUNERATION REPORT continued Policy Report This part of the Directors Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the company directors and has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
The Policy Report will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and the policy will take formal effect from 30 April 2014.
The Remuneration Policy The companys remuneration policy must enable it to attract and retain leaders with the skills, experience and drive to execute the companys business strategy within a framework which is aligned to the interests of the companys shareholders, for example, through the deferral of bonuses and the requirement to hold shares.
The Executive Directors Remuneration Committee the Committee believes that a significant proportion of Executive Directors remuneration should be performance related.
Each year, the Committee conducts a formal review of risk in the context of remuneration.
A review of pay for other employees across the group, particularly salary increases, is also carried out each year when reviewing overall remuneration policy and this is taken into account when setting policy for the Executive Directors.
No consultation process with employees was conducted in 2013 in respect of the directors remuneration policy.
The Committee welcomes dialogue with shareholders and consults with its major investors and investor bodies regarding changes to Executive Director remuneration policy.
Any views and feedback on arrangements from our investors will be considered by the Committee as part of its annual review of directors remuneration.

Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 53 I 2 3 4 Report of Directors REMUNERATION REPORT continued Notes to the Policy Table 1.
Annual Bonus Plan performance metrics Performance measures, the weighting between them and stretching targets will be set at the start of each year by the Committee, based on the companys financial KPIs and strategic priorities for the year and taking account of the business plan, budget for the year, and market conditions.
At least 80% will be based on relevant financial targets and up to 20% may be attributed to a relevant non-financial target.
Together, these targets are intended to incentivise and reward shorter-term performance, consistent with the interests of the shareholders and the overall strategy of the company.
PSP metrics The Committee selects performance measures for the PSP awards that are aimed at incentivising and rewarding performance over the medium term, aligned with the interests of the shareholders and consistent with the group strategy.
For a comparative TSR measure, the targets are as set out in the policy table with the Committee selecting the most appropriate comparator group at the time awards are made.
For EPS growth and any other relevant financial targets, the Committee will set stretching targets based on the companys budget, business plan, and external economic environment at that time.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan The Deferred Share Bonus Plan contains no additional performance conditions as any awards arise from an Annual Bonus which was itself subject to performance conditions.
Comparison with employees remuneration policy The key differences between Executive Directors remuneration policy and that of employees generally is that, for the Executive Directors, there is significantly more weighting to variable performance-related pay.
Variable pay is seen as more relevant for senior executives because of their greater ability to influence the overall performance of the company.
Shareholding guidelines To provide alignment between shareholders and directors, the Executive Directors are required to build up a holding of 100% of salary over time.
Any shares vesting from share incentive plans must be retained subject to sales to meet tax and incidental costs of sale until the target is reached.
Remuneration awarded prior to the effective date For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy Report, authority is given to the company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports including those share plan awards set out on pages 61 and 63.
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Annual Bonus Plan and PSP policy The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and PSP according to the rules of each respective plan and consistent with normal market practice and the Listing Rules of the London Stock Exchange, including flexibility in a number of aspects.
How the Committee will retain flexibility includes albeit with quantum and performance targets restricted to the descriptions detailed above : Who participates in the plans.
When to make awards and payments.
How to determine the size of an award, a payment, or when and how much of an award should vest.
How to deal with a change of control or restructuring of the group.
Whether a director is a good bad leaver for incentive plan purposes and whether and what proportion of awards vest at the time of leaving or at the original vesting date s. How and whether an award may be adjusted in certain circumstances e. g. for a rights issue, a corporate restructuring or for special dividends.
What the weighting, measures and targets should be for the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP from year to year.
The Committee also retains the discretion within the policy to adjust targets and or set different measures and alter weightings for the Annual Bonus Plan and to adjust targets for the PSP if events happen that cause it to determine that the metrics are unable to fulfil their originally intended purpose, provided the new metrics are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Any adjustments will be fully disclosed in the following years Annual Report on remuneration.
All historic awards that were granted under any current or previous share schemes operated by the company but remain outstanding detailed on page 61, remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms.
54 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Payment under different scenarios Under the new regulations, we are obliged to show a bar-chart indicating the level of remuneration which would be received by the Executive Directors in 2014 under different scenarios.
Three scenarios are shown below: Fixed pay is based on salary, benefits and pension contributions: Target pay is fixed pay, plus 50% of the maximum of variable pay: and Maximum pay is fixed pay, plus the maximum of variable pay.

Taxable benefits are based on those disclosed for 2013 3 Pension is 2014 policy applied to 1 April 2014 salaries 4 No share price appreciation is assumed in long term incentive awards Service Agreements and payments for loss of office of Executive Directors It is the companys policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term, which are subject to one years notice by the company and the director.
In the event of early termination including following a change of control in the company, the directors contracts provide for compensation in line with their contractual notice period.
In summary, the contractual provisions are as follows: Provision Detailed Terms Notice period 12 months by the company, 12 months by the director.
Termination payment There is no provision for specific payment.
If any existing contract is breached by the company, it would be liable to pay, as damages, an amount approximating to the net loss of salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period, subject to mitigation and phased payments where appropriate.
Any statutory amounts would be paid as necessary.
Remuneration entitlements Pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with vesting for outstanding share awards in certain circumstances see below.
In all cases performance targets would apply.
Change of control No Executive Directors contract contains additional provisions in respect of change of control.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the companys share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment under the Performance Share Plan is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, good leaver status may be applied.
For good leavers, awards will normally vest on cessation, or on the original vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions at that time and reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the three-year period actually served.
However, the Committee has discretion to determine that awards vest at a later date and or to disapply time pro-rating.
The default treatment under the 2009 Deferred Share Bonus Plan is that any awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, good leavers are entitled to retain their awards, and to vest after leaving, subject to the rules of the plan.
Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 55 I 2 3 4 Report of Directors REMUNERATION REPORT continued Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors are shown in the table below: Remuneration entitlement Notice period Notice period on termination Date of Date term from company from the director Termination of contract Termination on Director initial contract due to expire months months payment by company change of control P W B Page 25 April 2007 N A 12 12 No contractual 12 months 12 months termination notice notice: good S C Webb 14 January 2011 N A 12 12 payments other leaver status than detailed under share above schemes Recruitment and promotion policy for directors The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the companys prevailing approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as is required to attract the most appropriate candidate.
It may be set initially at a below mid-market level on the basis that it may progress towards the mid-market level once expertise and performance has been proven and sustained.
The annual bonus potential would be limited to 100% of salary, and conditional awards under the Performance Share Plan may be up to the plan maximum of 150% of salary or 200% on recruitment in exceptional circumstances.
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer.
It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the company will meet certain relocation and other incidental expenses as appropriate.
If appropriate the Committee may agree on the recruitment of a new executive, to a notice period in excess of 12 months but to reduce to 12 months over a specified period.
The fees for a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director will be reflective of experience, time commitment, responsibility and scope of the role, and will be consistent with the approved remuneration policy at the time.
