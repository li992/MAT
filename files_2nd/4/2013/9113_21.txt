Kentz Corporation LimitedAnnual Report and Accounts 2013 66 REMUNERATION REPORT INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE OVERVIEW OF EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES We have based Kentzs executive remuneration policy on the principle that it should encourage, reinforce and reward the delivery of sustainable shareholder value.
We believe that the application of the principle has helped to drive our exceptional performance.
In determining the Companys remuneration policy, theRemuneration Committee takes into account the external competitive environment, the Companys short and medium-term strategic objectives, shareholder expectations and best practice.
We are conscious that Kentz operates in a very competitive talent market in which BRENDAN LYONS, CHAIRMAN recruiting and retaining people in key leadership positions, REMUNERATION COMMITTEE particularly in the US, is challenging.
However, we believe that we continue to be successful in hiring and retaining the people who will continue to execute our strategy and to drive growth that meets shareholder expectations.
ATTENDANCE Executive Directors compensation comprises base salary and benefits, a short-term cash incentive based on annual Number of meetings held 3 performance, and a long-term incentive comprising equity awards, vesting after a three year period.
The Committee NUMBER OF MEETINGS ATTENDED seeks to ensure that there should be an appropriate balance between fixed pay and performance-related pay Brendan Lyons 3 and that both should be configured to realise the aim of David Beldotti 3 driving long-term shareholder value.

No long-term incentive plan LTIP awards vested during the year.
CHANGING APPROACH TO DISCLOSURE AND VOTING The regulatory landscape in the UK has evolved and we have increased disclosure in our Directors Remuneration Report.
Although the new UK disclosure regime does not bind Jersey-incorporated companies, Kentzs policy is to align ourselves with best practice as described in guidelines issued by UK institutional investors and to follow substantially the provisions on disclosure contained in The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.

As the Companys business grows in size and complexity, we need to ensure that Executive Director Shareholders will be given the opportunity to vote on the and senior staff remuneration levels remain competitive policy and on its implementation by way of ordinary and appropriate to the Company.
We have a clear commitment to governance and KEY REMUNERATION CHANGES FOR 2014 shareholder engagement so that our Executive Director While our past performance is outstanding, we continue pay is in line with the Companys needs, reflects the views tolook to the future.

The changes we plan include welcome your continued support.
deepening and broadening long-term incentive participation throughout the Group.
Yours sincerely, The Committee reviewed executive remuneration policy and determined upon the following changes effective for Brendan Lyons the 2014 financial year: Chairman Remuneration Committee To align Kentz further with UK best practice, the annual long-term incentive awards granted to Executive Directors will be 100% performance-based.
Contingent share awards, which constituted 50% of the award in 2013, will no longer be awarded to Executive Directors, other than in recruitment situations where the Remuneration Committee considers it appropriate and necessary to do so.
A clawback arrangement has been put in place for the first time for an element of the short-term incentive bonus.
Long-term incentive LTI measures were reviewed with Towers Watson.
It was concluded that the measures of Return on Equity RoE and Earnings Per Share EPS were still relevant and appropriate for 2014 to drive shareholder value, and will not be modified.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to review the executive remuneration policy during 2014 and continue to move to a position where overall packages and levels of disclosure are aligned with those required of UK-listed and registered companies.
A benchmark study led to a rebalancing of the CEO package 38% base salary increase in 2013 to reflect both the US and UK market norms.
Executive Directors received an annual cost of living base pay adjustment 3% CEO and 3.5% CFO for 2014, consistent with our Companys pay practice.

NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE WHY PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE CHOSEN AND HOW TARGETS ARE SET Executive Directors will be incentivised according to the Directors Remuneration Policy.
The overall short-term incentive range for pay-out Threshold to Stretch reflects the level of stretch built into the annual budget approved by the Board of Directors.
Threshold level metrics are aligned with market expectations and Kentzs incentive policy.
ANNUAL BONUS The performance targets are typically set to the most relevant metrics to deliver shareholder value for the year ahead, taking account of Company strategy, industry cycle and peer groups.
The performance measures used for the annual bonus plan have been selected by the Committee to support the performance against plan and aligned to the strategic direction of the Company.
Each year the Remuneration Committee will establish the financial performance criteria for the forthcoming year.
Themetrics and weightings used to calculate the bonuses for 2013 are shown in the Directors Remuneration Report below.
Some changes will be applied to the performance measures and weightings for 2014.
However, they will not differ markedly from those used for 2013.
The performance of Executive Directors against targets and the metrics and weightings used to measure their performance will be published in the 2014 Directors Remuneration Report.
com investor-relations Kentz Corporation LimitedAnnual Report and Accounts 2013 72 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN Performance vesting targets are set based on a sliding scale that takes account of relevant commercial factors.
Only modest rewards are available for delivering threshold performance levels with maximum rewards requiring substantial out-performance of our challenging plans.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE Earnings per share EPS and Return on Equity RoE have been selected by the Committee for the following purposes: EPS is commonly understood by investors as rewarding management for sustained performance improvement: RoE will reflect performance against internal goals rather than a relative test against a peer group and will be based on a balance of investor expectations and execution of the business plan.

SERVICE CONTRACTS The Executive Directors service agreements with the Group do not set a fixed term.
In normal circumstances, the agreements may be terminated by the relevant Group member or by the Director giving a period of notice as in the table below.
Notice period Notice period Executive Director Date of Contract Unexpired term by Groupcompany by Director Christian Brown 18 January 2012 No fixed term 12 months 12 months Ed Power 15 November 2010 No fixed term 6 months 6 months Strategic Corporate Financial Report Governance Statements Kentz Corporation LimitedAnnual Report and Accounts 2013 73 CHANGE OF CONTROL AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT PROVISIONS IN LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AND SERVICE CONTRACTS The rules of the LTIP provide that if any person obtains control of the Company, all outstanding unvested LTIP awards will vest immediately to the extent that performance conditions are satisfied and pro-rated to the extent that the vesting period for each outstanding award has been completed at that time unless the Remuneration Committee otherwise determines.
The rules of the LTIP also provide that, on termination of employment, all outstanding unvested LTIP awards normally lapse immediately other than in certain good leaver circumstances, where the Remuneration Committee may waive pro-rating for performance and time.
The Remuneration Committee notes that certain historic practices implemented in the service agreements of nine US-based senior individuals, including the CEO fall outside its discretionary powers, under the rules of the LTIP.
These practices provide that in the event of a change of control, all LTIP awards held by the individual will vest in full.
The CEOs service agreement also provides that his LTIP awards vest in full subject to satisfaction of performance conditions, where applicable if his employment is terminated by Kentz.
These historic practices were considered to be necessary by the Remuneration Committee on recruitment of US-based executives who were entitled to similar terms under their former US employment contracts.
During negotiations, it was established that removal of these terms would have precluded the recruitment of these US-based executives.
No amendments are planned to be made to the rules of the LTIP or the relevant service agreements.
However, future service agreements for new recruits will not provide for full vesting on change of control.
POLICY ON PAYMENT TO DIRECTORS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE INCLUDING CHANGE OF CONTROL The Remuneration Committees approach to exit payments is to take account of the relevant circumstances including the reason for termination, individual performance and the terms of the relevant remuneration documents such as service contracts and incentive plan rules.

Strategic Corporate Financial Report Governance Statements Kentz Corporation LimitedAnnual Report and Accounts 2013 77 VARIABLE ELEMENTS OF REMUNERATION ANNUAL BONUS PAY-OUTS IN RESPECT OF 2013 PERFORMANCE The Remuneration Committee established and agreed with the Executive Directors the parameters for performancebased awards for 2013.
The metrics encompassed Strategy, Safety, Sustainability and Profit.
The maximum bonus opportunity available to the CEO in 2013 was US$1,500,000 120% of target bonus.
The Remuneration Committee determined that, based on the achievements of targets, the CEO achieved targets that merited payment of 116.54% of the target bonus US$1,456,750.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee awarded the CEO a one-off bonus of US$500,000 following the announcement of the successful completion of the Class I transaction in acquiring Valerus Field Solutions.
The purposes of this payment include recognition of exceptional performance in executing the strategic acquisition: the step-increase in the size of the Company: and motivation to ensure the acquisition is successful.
The bonus is subject to full claw back if the financial performance of the Valerus business in 2014 does not meet a minimum EBITDA threshold and to proportional claw back if the EBITDA is above that minimum, but below a targeted amount.
The target bonus opportunity for the CFO was set at a target level of 500,000 and could range up to 130% of that figure.
Based on the CFOs achievements, the Remuneration Committee has determined that the CFO achieved targets that merited payment of 119.21% of the target bonus.
The detailed metrics used in calculating the bonuses are set out below.

For wider reference, the share option awards granted in 2009 to Hugh ODonnell and Ed Power vested on the 1 July 2012.
The share price at vesting was Stg3.800 and the exercise price was Stg1.545.
The performance period was set from 1 July 2009 to 1 July 2012.
Overall, 100% of the shares vested.
LTIP AWARDS GRANTED IN 2013 The Remuneration Committee decided to increase the performance-related element of equity awards for Executive Directors in 2013 so that 50% of awards were conditional on the satisfaction of performance conditions, compared to 30% in 2012.
A second performance measure, Return on Equity RoE, was introduced in 2013 alongside the earnings per share EPS measure.
The Committee also reviewed and amended the basis upon which the EPS test is operated for awards made in 2013 as described in the table below.
On 16 January 2013, 50% of the 2012 share awards were granted to the Executive Directors pursuant to the Companys LTIP.
This award constituted the contingent element of the total share award to Executive Directors.
The share awards have been granted on a conditional basis and no shareholder rights will be conferred upon the grantee until the awards have vested.
In order to satisfy the vesting conditions, the continued employment of the Executive Directors over the three year vesting period is required.
The remaining 50% of the share awards were granted pursuant to the Companys LTIP in the form of performance shares to the Executive Directors in April 2013.

LTIP AWARDS FOR 2014 LTIP performance awards are not linked to annual budget performance but at the level set by the Remuneration Committee consistent with the strategic plan.
Award levels for Executive Directors are in line with market data and calibrated to deliver the operating plan.
Awards are determined as a percentage of base salary, with the 2014 award being 115% of base salary for the CEO and 100% of base salary for the CFO.
100% of the LTIP awards in respect of the 2013 performance year will be granted in the form of performance share awards to the Executive Directors in April 2014.
Vesting of 50% of the initial face value of the award will be linked to the satisfaction of the revised EPS test.
25% of this portion of the award will vest if the average compound EPS growth over three years is equivalent to the median growth in a basket of ten international peers.
Full vesting will occur for performance equal to, or in excess of the upper quartile with performance between these points vesting on a straight line basis.
Vesting of 50% of the initial face value of the award will be linked to the satisfaction of internal return on equity goals.
25% of this portion of the award will vest for three year average return on equity of 25% rising to full vesting for average return on equity of 30%.
Straight line vesting will occur between these points.
Under both measures no vesting will occur for performance below the stated threshold.
Materially inaccurate reporting of financial statements are regarded as a misconduct event and would result in all unvested long-term incentive awards lapsing immediately.
