The size of award and the weighting of performance conditions vary by level, with specific measures incorporated where relevant.
All members of the senior management team have historically participated in the LTISP arrangement and from 2013 a smaller group of senior management will participate in the LTAP, in line with the Executive Directors.
2 The new Long Term Alignment Plan As set out in the Chairmans introductory letter, a new long term incentive plan, the Long Term Alignment Plan, is planned to be introduced for Executive Directors to replace the current LTISP.
In the context of recent organisational changes, the Companys strategic objectives and the current challenging external environment, the Committee carried out a review of Dairy Crests incentive arrangements and concluded that the LTISP should be replaced with a plan which aligns to the Companys forward-looking strategy.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2013 43 72236 Glasshouse p41-p55.
indd 43 04 06 2013 16:05 Governance Report of the Directors Directors remuneration report continued The proposed arrangement is intended to provide improved alignment with our stated strategic objectives.
These are to build market leading positions in branded and added value markets, to focus on cost reduction and efficiency improvements, to reduce commodity risk in order to improve the quality of earnings and to generate growth in the business through acquisitions and disposals.
The proposed design is also intended to recognise our position as a dividend stock which seeks to maintain delivery of value to shareholders by pursuing a progressive dividend policy.
The Board incorporated some changes to the LTAP following consultation with major shareholders.
The LTAP has now been proposed for adoption for the 2013 14 financial year, and will be subject to a shareholder vote at the 2013 AGM.
50% Award vesting based on 5090% Dividend pre-grant of salary underpin 50% criteria vesting Years 3 4 5 Details of the proposed Long Term Alignment Plan The proposed LTAP will operate as follows: 1.
Pre-grant performance scorecard Pre-grant performance conditions will be used to determine the level of the award based on a scorecard of measures aligned to Dairy Crests strategic priorities.
The scorecard will be reviewed annually and amended as the Committee deems appropriate, with the scorecard to apply for the next grant usually determined in May of each year.
The scorecard will always be weighted to ensure that at least 60% of the assessment reflects financial measures, and the make-up of the scorecard will reflect the strategic priorities deemed critical to the future of the Company.
Detailed disclosure will be given in the Remuneration Report each year in relation to the scorecard used to determine the next years grant, along with the Key Performance Indicators KPIs which will support each element and their respective weightings.
Detailed retrospective disclosure will also be provided, detailing how the grant level was decided based both on outcomes against the targets set and the context in which the grant decision was made.
The proposed scorecard for the initial grants under the award is provided below.
Award level Award levels under the plan will be between 50% to 90% of salary for Executive Directors dependent on the assessment of performance against the scorecard.
If performance falls below a minimum level against the scorecard no award will be made.
Vesting period Awards will be subject to a phased vesting requirement, with 50% of the award vesting in year 4 and 50% in year 5 following grant.
Awards will be subject to an additional dividend underpin over the first three years of the vesting period.
Under this element dividend progression will be measured on a spot to spot basis.
Clawback will apply in the event that the dividend declines over the three year period.
An amount of the award proportional to the percentage decrease in dividend will be clawed back in this case up to a decline of 50%.
For any dividend decline over this amount the Remuneration Committee will retain the discretion to determine the amount of appropriate clawback.
The clawback applied in this case will be not less than 50% and up to 100% of the initial award, taking into account the circumstances at the time.
Furthermore, dividend cover must be maintained in the 1.5 to 2.5 times range over the three-year measurement period.
In the event dividend cover is outside this range the Remuneration Committee will retain the discretion to apply additional clawback to awards as appropriate.
Shareholding requirement The shareholding requirement for Executive Directors will be increased to 200% of salary from 100%.

It is the Companys policy that Non-executive Directors should not normally serve for more than nine years.
A summary of the terms of appointment of Non-executive Directors is available on the Companys website.
Details of the Directors offering themselves for election and re-election at the forthcoming AGM are set out on page 35 with biographical details at pages 10 to 11.
In accordance with best practice as set out in the Code, all Executive Directors have a notice period not exceeding one year.
All such Directors service contracts provide explicitly for termination payments in the event of termination by the Company other than on grounds of incapacity or in circumstances justifying summary termination.
For Mark Allen, payments on termination are calculated as 90% of the value of annual salary, benefits, pension and bonus for the notice period.
For Martyn Wilks and Tom Atherton and for future appointments, payments on termination are calculated as the value of annual salary, benefits and pension for the notice period.
There is a mitigation clause in the service contract with respect to termination payments such that certain compensation payments are deferred.

Statement of consideration of remuneration elsewhere in the Company The Remuneration Committee has oversight on remuneration matters of the broader senior management group beyond Executive Directors.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views As set out in the details surrounding the operation of the new LTAP, the Board consulted with several larger shareholders on the proposal to replace the current LTISP.
In keeping with continuing dialogue with shareholders, the Remuneration Committee Chairman, along with the Company Chairman, met with a number of our large shareholders as part of a detailed consultation process.
The principles and rationale for change and a high level framework for the new plan were discussed.
After this initial stage, the Remuneration Committee and the Board considered the feedback received and consulted those shareholders with the final proposed plan.
The plan has now been proposed for adoption for the 2013 14 financial year, and will be subject to a shareholder vote at the 2013 AGM.

Bonuses detailed above include the full value of bonus entitlement including bonus to be deferred in shares being 12,941 for Mark Allen and nil for Martyn Wilks and Alastair Murray.
There were no deferred bonuses in 2011 12.
Cash allowances principally comprise pension related salary supplements.
Mark Allen and Alastair Murray were members of the defined contribution scheme throughout 2012 13.
The Company made contributions up to the 50,000 limit for employee and employer contributions.
Further cash supplements were paid such that the total of cash supplements and employer contributions amounted to 23% of basic salary.
Martyn Wilks was not a member of any Company pension scheme in the year ended 31 March 2013 and received a salary supplement of 23% of basic salary.
Bonus Payment of the bonus is subject to the achievement of demanding short-term financial targets and personal objectives.
To ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained between long-term and short-term reward, any bonus earned over 50% of annual salary is paid in the Companys shares and deferred for a three-year period subject to continued employment.
Stretching financial targets encompassing adjusted operating profit and net cash generation were partly met in the year 26% and 100% of maximum payout for these elements respectively.

Mark Allen decided to draw benefits from 31 March 2010 and receives an annual pension and received a cash lump sum of 221,510 in 2010 11.
Mark Allens accrued pension immediately before electing to draw it early was 63,931 per annum including seven months additional pension service.
The future pension payable at March 2011 was less than 63,931 per annum due to the application of an early retirement reduction and because some pension was exchanged for a lump sum cash payment.
Benefit accrual ceased on 31 March 2010 and Mark Allen and Alastair Murray are no longer paying contributions into the scheme.
The decrease in transfer value in the year is a result of an increase in the post-retirement discount rate assumption at March 2013 compared to March 2012.
Variable pay awarded during the financial year Long Term Incentive Share Plan 2012 The award made under the LTISP 2012 was made on the same basis as the awards made in 2010 and 2011, i. e. with 40% of the total award based on Adjusted EPS growth and 60% of the total award based on TSR performance against the FTSE 250 excluding financial service companies, real estate companies and investment trusts.
Performance against both Adjusted EPS and TSR is measured over a three-year period.

The termination payment to Alastair Murray on leaving employment will be 553,220.
Other emoluments made in connection with Alastair Murrays departure will include the release of deferred bonus shares and pro-rated release of outstanding LTISP awards that meet the required performance conditions at the end of the relevant performance periods.
The termination payment level calculated in accordance with the provisions of Alastair Murrays service contract, which entitles him to an amount based on his salary, non-cash benefits, pension benefits and 50% of the maximum annual bonus potentially payable in the financial year of his departure.
This amount is pro-rated by a factor of 0.9 for accelerated payment under a contractual formula.
On appointment to the role of Finance Director, Tom Athertons remuneration will comprise an annual base salary of 200,000.
This is below the current incumbents salary and the market practice for comparable roles in relevant comparator companies, and is reflective of his experience at the present time.
In line with our remuneration policy, his salary will be moved towards the median for comparable roles over time and is therefore expected to progress significantly ahead of market inflationary increases, subject to satisfactory performance and reflecting his development and increasing experience in the role.
Tom Athertons bonus opportunity for 2013 14 will be 100% of salary at maximum and 50% of salary for on target performance, with any bonus over 50% of annual salary deferred in Company shares in line with current Executive Director arrangements.
The long-term incentive award to be made in 2013 14 will be consistent with the policy for Executive Directors in respect of both quantum and performance conditions.
Tom Atherton will also be expected to build up a shareholding of 100% of salary increasing to 200% of salary on approval of the LTAP, over a reasonable period of time in line with Dairy Crests remuneration policy, and will also be eligible for pension and other benefits consistent with his role.
