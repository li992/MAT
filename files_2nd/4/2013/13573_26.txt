Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 66 Directors report DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Share retention policy subject to audit We believe it is important that the interests of the executive directors should be closely aligned with those of shareholders.
The deferred APRA award and the PSP provide considerable alignment.
However, participants in the PSP are also required to retain at least one half of the number of after-tax shares released from the PSP, until the value of their shareholding reaches the percentage of salary shown in the table below.
When this level is reached it must be maintained until retirement or departure from the Group.
The directors total shareholding, for the purposes of comparing it with the minimum shareholding requirement, includes shares held: by their connected persons: in the SIP: APRA deferred shares that have not vested: and PSP shares that have vested but does not included unvested PSP awards.
The shareholding requirement will increase in 2014 to 250percent of salary for the Chief Executive and 200percent of salary for the other executive directors.
APRA deferred shares will no longer count towards their minimum shareholding requirement.
As at 31 December 2013, the executive directors each complied with the 2013 minimum shareholding requirement as detailed in the table below: Minimum Actual shareholding Minimum shareholding as Base salary Total requirement shareholding % of minimum 1 000 shareholding as % of salary requirement requirement 2 James Guyette 508 447,868 150 74,462 601 Mark Morris 510 86,954 150 74,756 116 John Rishton 925 293,947 200 180,782 163 Colin Smith CBE 525 346,466 150 76,954 450 1 Salary divided by the March 2013 PSP grant price of 1023.33p multiplied by percentage of salary.
