Historic data for Ian Farmer is taken from the remuneration reports for the relevant years, but recast on the basis for the single figure prescribed in the Regulations.
His FY2012 CEO remuneration is for a period of 11 months, after which he ceased to act in that capacity as a result of serious ill-health.
Historic data for Simon Scott is taken from the remuneration reports for the relevant years, but recast on the basis for the single figure prescribed in the Regulations as far as practicable.
FY2012 relates to 1 month serving as Acting CEO, and FY2013 relates to 9 months serving in that capacity.
Ben Magara served as CEO for the 3 months commencing 1 July 2013.
For ease of comparison, an aggregate of pay to the Director undertaking the role of the CEO in each year is included.
Simon Scott joined the Company and Board in September 2010.
As our long-term incentives have three-year vesting periods, only one tranche of awards reached their vesting date during the period covered by the table.
Although Mr Scott had ceased to serve as Acting CEO prior to that date, the outcome is included for completeness.
Ben Magara joined the Company and Board in July 2013 and no long-term incentive awards have reached their vesting dates.

To help readers gain a fuller understanding of each element of pay for the Executive Directors: Base salary Ian Farmer has been paid a base salary of 579,000 per annum as CEO since 1 October 2011.
No increase was awarded on 1 October 2012 due to his absence from the business.
Simon Scott has been paid a base salary of 325,850 per annum as CFO since 1 October 2011, though this was increased to 425,000 per annum when he took up the role of Acting CEO.
No increase was provided on 1 October 2012 in response to President Zumas call for restraint in executive pay.
Mr Scott reverted to his CFO salary on 1 September 2013 at the end of a two month handover period.
Ben Magara commenced employment on 1 July 2013 on a base salary of 450,000 per annum.
Increases were provided to both Ben Magara and Simon Scott, effective 1 October 2013 of 2.7%, in line with UK CPI, taking their base salaries to 462,150 per annum and 334,650 per annum respectively.

The key focus areas for FY2013 were a safe and peaceful return to work, returning to full levels of production such that we fulfilled the promises made in the Lonmin Renewal Plan, and beginning to establish new ways of working for our 28,000 employees.
The BSC was therefore designed to ensure the Company focused on delivering these strategic objectives, which in their operational guise largely reflect the corporate Key Performance Indicators shown on pages 24 to 26.
The personal objectives for Simon Scott, the only Executive Director who served throughout FY2013, were set with these corporate imperatives in mind.
The operational results for the year and resulting bonus payment were calculated as follows: % of bonus Actual payment opportunity on for the year Target Actual offer for target % of bonus Strategic element Metric performance performance performance opportunity Safety: improvement in lost time injury Percentage improvement 5% 16% 15.0 5.6 frequency rate LTIFR, with factor on FY2012 LTIFR with improvement improvement applied for fatalities multiplier 0 2x, 1 1x, in LTIFR to 3.50, 2 0.5x, 3 0.25x, to 3.95 but three 4 or more 0x, and fatalities no payment Transformation: HDSAs in senior Percentage of HDSA candidates 36% 32% 7.5 0.0 management roles Grades D Upper in post at 30 September 2013 and above Transformation: progress in addressing Subjective assessment of Progress Planning well 7.5 3.8 housing and living conditions progress with the initiatives achieved, advanced, announced at the 2013 AGM with some engagement tangible under way but outcomes not enough tangible outcomes 1 Operational: Platinum production Troy ounces of finished 685,000 709,000 15.0 29.7 metal produced Operational: available ore reserves Square metres of UG2 ore 2,158,444 2,424,036 5.0 7.5 2 reserves available for mining Operational: instantaneous recovery rate Percentage of contained 82.4% 85.0% 5.0 7.5 metals recovered % Financial: Unit Costs per PGM ounce Cost in rand terms per PGM R8,932 R8,832 15.0 16.8 ounce produced 6E basis Financial: net cash at year end Net cash balance in US Dollars $145m $201m 10.0 15.0 on 30 September 2013 Sub-total: Corporate KPIs 80.0 85.8 3 Personal 3-4 stretching personal goals 20.0 25.7 Total 100.0 111.5 Footnotes: 1.

For ease of presentation this is the average of Ben Magara 21.5% and Simon Scott 30.0%.
As Ben Magara only joined the Company on 1 July 2013 and was encouraged by the Board to focus on assessing the key challenges facing the business and developing his strategic response during his first three months in office, the Remuneration Committee determined that the whole of his bonus opportunity should be based on the corporate elements of the BSC ie.
with his personal elements being deemed to be achieved at the same level as the corporate performance, on a time-apportioned basis.
Ian Farmer did not participate in any bonus plan for FY2013.
01 Strategic Report 02 Governance 03 Financial Statements 04 A Deeper Look 05 Shareholder Information Lonmin Plc 93 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Governance Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2013 Directors remuneration in FY2013 continued Executive Directors continued The bonus paid to Simon Scott for FY2013 of 402,956 equates to 116% of the target opportunity for the year, and 77% of the maximum that could have been earned.
The bonus paid to Ben Magara of 100,748 equates to 107% and 72% respectively.
Ben Magara and Simon Scott have chosen to invest 25% of their FY2013 bonus in Lonmin shares.
The Committee believes that this helps improve their alignment with shareholders.
Short-term incentives settled in shares: the ASAP awards will be made under the ASAP in early December 2013 with a face value equal to the bonus earned for FY2013.
The economic effect of this is equivalent to the deferral of a cash bonus into shares.
The eventual value of the awards will therefore be linked to the Companys share price to the date on which the option is exercised.
The vesting of ASAP awards is subject to continued service.
For further details of the ASAP, please refer to the policy table on page 76 and the section headed Directors shareholdings and scheme interests on page 97.
Long-term incentives the LTIP Performance conditions for long-term incentive awards The vesting of LTIP awards made to the Executive Directors is subject to performance conditions, and the Committee ensures that these are fully aligned with the corporate strategy.
Relative TSR has always been used by Lonmin as a performance condition, ensuring that executive remuneration reflects actual returns delivered to shareholders.
The relative nature of this test creates an objective metric of long-term value delivery to shareholders which is largely independent of the short-term variability introduced into reported results by volatile metal prices and exchange rates particularly between the South African Rand and the US Dollar.
Following meetings with key institutional shareholders in 2010, the Committee decided to introduce a performance condition recognising, at a low level, the sustained hard work required in difficult times before the result is recognised in the share price.
After exploring a number of options, and further shareholder consultation, the Committee concluded that the corporate elements of the BSC were well suited to this purpose, and adopted a performance condition based on both the corporate elements of the BSC and RTSR, in each case measured over three-year periods, and emphasising RTSR.
This approach has been used since 2010.
The matrix below illustrates the vesting outcomes as a percentage of the face value of the award, with full interpolation between the points shown for the LTIP awards made since 2010: % of face value vesting RTSR result Factor Average BSC performance over three years BSC result Threshold Threshold Target Stretch Max Factor 0.0x 0.5x 1.0x 1.5x RTSR performance Median 5% pa 0.0x 0% 0% 0% 0% Median 5% pa 0.5x 0% 8.33% 16.66% 25% Median 1.0x 0% 16.66% 33.33% 50% Median 5% pa 1.5x 0% 25% 50% 75% Median 10% pa 2.0x 0% 33.33% 66.66% 100% Factors are multiplied and, as maximum is 2.0 x 1.5 3, the result is then divided by 3 The matrix shows that the outcome emphasises RTSR even with every BSC item delivering at stretch over three consecutive years, if this resulted in median RTSR then only 50% of the award would vest.
RTSR is assessed independently using data normalised into US Dollars, sourced from Datastream or other independent providers.
The Committee regularly reviews the RTSR comparator group to ensure that it remains relevant and therefore properly reflects the returns delivered to shareholders.
For awards made from August 2010 onwards, we compare ourselves to a group of five listed primary PGM producers, four of whom also operate principally in South Africa: Aquarius Platinum Anglo American Platinum Impala Platinum Northam Platinum Stillwater Mining Given this small peer group, a ranking approach could lead to perverse outcomes were the results to be tightly clustered, with very small differences in RTSR potentially leading to large differences in rank.
Therefore Lonmins TSR performance is compared to the median of the group to calculate relative performance, expressed as a % per annum differential.
We believe that Stillwater is no longer a directly comparable business.
It mines PGMs in the USA, so operates in a different socioeconomic environment, is a palladium-dominated business and has also recently acquired base metal assets.
Royal Bafokeng Platinum, a South African platinum producer, is now listed on the JSE and we have substituted this company for Stillwater in the comparator group for awards made after 1 July 2013. www.
com 94 Lonmin Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Governance Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2013 Directors remuneration in FY2013 continued Performance conditions for long-term incentive awards continued During FY2013, awards held by both Ian Farmer and Simon Scott reached their normal maturity date, being the third anniversary of the date of grant.
Full details of these awards are set out below, in the scheme interests table on page 96.
The BSC factor across the three financial years FY2010 to FY2012 amounted to 73.3%, but the TSR was 10.0% per annum below median.
As performance fell short of the levels required for minimum vesting, no shares or cash were transferred to the Director concerned.
No discretion was applied by the Committee.
Other earnings of Executive Directors Ben Magara serves as a non-executive director of Foskor.
The Committee has resolved that he should be allowed to retain the benefits of the annual fee payable for this appointment which amounted to R44,400 during his service as a Director of the Company.
No other remunerated external appointment is held by either Executive Director.
Non-executive Directors Our Non-executive Directors are paid at levels we believe to be market median for a London-listed company of equivalent size and complexity, while reflecting the international travel commitment expected.
The basis of the fees is stated in the policy table on page 80, but is essentially a base fee plus additional fees for Committee service or Chairmanship.
Footnotes: 1 Roger Phillimore receives an additional fee for serving as Chairman, and Jim Sutcliffe receives an additional fee for serving as Senior Independent Director.
2 To 31 January 2013, the date of his retirement as a Director.
3 Mr Seedat provides ad hoc consultancy services to the Company under a separate consultancy agreement.
His payments in Rand pursuant to this agreement have been converted into pounds using the average ZAR:GBP exchange rate for FY2013 of 1 R14.4238 FY2012: R12.6827.
Following the Events at Marikana, Mr Seedat agreed to re-join the Executive Committee and increase very materially the number of days per month he committed to the Company.
His daily rate was increased to reflect the value of the services being provided to R25,000 per day, which the Committee was advised was in line with market norms.
Mr Seedat reverted to his originally contracted number of days per month and previous daily rate of R11,700 per day from 1 October 2013.
The basis of the fees payable to Non-executive Directors is set out in the policy report on page 80.
Phuti Mahanyele, Gary Nagle and Paul Smith were nominated as Directors by their employing companies, who hold shares in the Company or material subsidiaries.
In light of this relationship, no fees are payable to the individual but their respective employer invoices the Company for an amount equal to the fee that would otherwise have been earned for their service as a Director, including any membership of Board Committees, on a time apportioned basis as appropriate.
No part of this benefit passes to the individual concerned.

For the purposes of the table below, the remuneration of the person fulfilling the role of CEO in FY2012 relates to Ian Farmer to 31 August 2012 and Simon Scott for the month of September 2012, at the Acting CEO level of remuneration and for FY2013 relates to a combination of Simon Scott as Acting CEO to 30 June 2013 and Ben Magara from 1 July to 30 September 2013.
Year-on-Year Year-on-Year change: change: group CEO employees Item % % Base salary -23.8% 15.8% Taxable benefits -84.1% 13.6% Short-term incentives 3610.8% 12.8% The year-on-year comparator change relates to all employees of the Group, as required by the Regulations, and is on a per capita basis.
The year-on-year change in short-term incentives to the person fulfilling the role of the CEO reflects 1 that the person appointed as CEO for 11 months of FY2012 received no bonus and 2 that the individuals who acted or served as CEO in FY2013 both received bonuses.
Please see page 92 for an explanation of how FY2013 bonuses were earned.
Directors pension entitlements No Director who served during the year ended 30 September 2013 has any prospective entitlement to a defined benefit pension or a cash benefit arrangement as defined in s152, Finance Act 2004.
This disclosure has been subject to audit by KPMG Audit plc.
The Company closed its UK defined benefit pension scheme in June 2007, and subsequently wound this up on an orderly basis.
The Company increased the level of life assurance and income continuance insurance provided to employees who had participated in this scheme, which included Ian Farmer, to reflect respectively the loss of the spouses and ill-health early retirement pensions provided by the scheme.
The Company therefore provides a contractual life assurance benefit of eight times salary to Ian Farmer, and of four times salary to Simon Scott and Ben Magara.
All of these benefits are fully insured.
The Executive Directors are provided with a pension supplement, which may be taken either as a pension contribution to a defined contribution plan, or in cash.
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme for the benefit of its UK employees.
In South Africa the Company and Group participate in an industry wide defined contribution pension plan.
In FY2013 Ian Farmer received a payment equal to 30% of base salary, which he elected to take in cash.
Both Simon Scott and Ben Magara have opted to join the South African defined contribution plan and the Company contributes an amount equal to 20.52% of the 60% of the base salary paid to Simon Scott for his South African employment, and the 70% of Ben Magaras pay delivered through our South African payroll.
No element of any Directors remuneration other than base salary is pensionable.
Scheme interests awarded in FY2013 and held by Directors To aid year-on-year comparability and avoid repetition, the table below shows all scheme interests held by the Executive Directors, including those granted in the year ended 30 September 2013.
No awards of this nature were made during the year to, or are held by, any Non-executive Director.
The only awards structured as share options are those under the ASAP.
As noted on page 78, this plan superseded our previous practice of mandatory investment of half of participants after-tax bonus into Lonmin shares, the receipt of which was deferred for three years.
To retain the same economic effect and leave participants no worse off, we chose to utilise a nil-cost option structure, with the face value of the award equating to the bonus that would otherwise have been paid and deferred.
Key to plans: LTIP Nil cost restricted share awards granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan which vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant see page 77 : ASAP nil cost options granted under the Annual Share Award Plan which vest on the third anniversary of grant and may then be exercised until the tenth anniversary of grant, at the recipients discretion see page 76 : Recruitment and Special one-off nil-cost restricted share awards to acquire market-purchased shares, in each case made pursuant to LR 9.4.

Mr Magara was appointed as a Director from 1 July 2013.
Mr Magaras Recruitment Award is subject to vesting in three equal tranches on 31.05.14, 31.05.15 and 31.05.16.
For further details please see page 78.
Mr Scotts Special Award was made partly in lieu of an LTIP award, and in recognition of the exceptional circumstances of 2012.
Mr Farmer retired as a Director on 31 December 2012.
Subject to the Remuneration Committees discretion, dividend equivalents may be payable when LTIP awards vest.
Neither dividends nor dividend equivalents are payable in respect of ASAP options.

In the case of the CEO this is 300% of base salary, for other Executive Directors 200% of base salary and for Non-executive Directors 100% of their base fee.
In all cases this should be achieved within five years of the earlier of a the policy coming into effect on 1 August 2010 or b taking office or, once this has been achieved, within a further three years should the market value fall below the required level.
Using the Companys closing share price of 319.3p on 30 September 2013, compliance with these obligations by the serving Directors was as follows: Obligation Obligation to be met Achievement at Director multiple of salary NED base fee on or before 30 September 2013 Current Directors Len Konar 100% 1 August 2015 91% Jonathan Leslie 100% 1 August 2015 88% Ben Magara 300% 1 July 2018 14% David Munro 100% 1 August 2015 138% Roger Phillimore 100% 1 August 2015 407% Simon Scott 200% 27 September 2015 10% Mahomed Seedat 100% 1 August 2015 541% Karen fide Segundo 100% 1 August 2015 37% Jim Sutcliffe 100% 1 August 2015 107% Former Director 1 Ian Farmer 300% 1 August 2015 25% Footnote: 1.
Position stated at 31 December 2012, his date of retirement from the Board.
At that time Mr Farmer also held a significant number of options and awards over shares which, assuming performance conditions were met and the shares vested, would have enabled him to meet the obligation.
Phuti Mahanyele, Gary Nagle and Paul Smith are not remunerated by the Company for serving as Non-executive Directors.
As a result, the Board does not impose any shareholding obligation on them.
Their respective employing companies, who nominated them as Directors, have material financial investments in the Company or its operating subsidiaries.
Cyril Ramaphosa also served as a Director during the year, retiring from office on 31 January 2013.
He is a major shareholder in and chairman of Shanduka Group, which controls Incwala.
This latter company has an 18% equity interest in Lonmins principal South African operating subsidiaries, which comprise all of the Groups operational activities and substantially the whole of the Groups assets.
As a result, Mr Ramaphosa has a very significant, but indirect, personal interest in Lonmins business and the Board chose not to impose any shareholding obligation on him.
The interests of the Directors who served during the year during FY2013 as at 30 September 2013 or earlier date of retirement as a Director in the shares of the Company, or scheme interests in relation to those shares are as follows: Director Scheme interests: 1 2 Shares Options and awards over shares Subject to Not subject to performance performance Note conditions conditions Total Current Directors Len Konar 14,200 Jonathan Leslie 13,720 Phuti Mahanyele 3 Ben Magara 4 25,000 357,804 130,302 488,106 David Munro 21,560 Gary Nagle 5 Roger Phillimore 63,700 Simon Scott 10,000 406,658 68,949 475,607 Mahomed Seedat 84,730 Karen fide Segundo 5,852 Paul Smith 5 Jim Sutcliffe 16,700 Former Directors Ian Farmer 6 150,061 109,459 51,940 161,399 Cyril Ramaphosa 7 This table and associated footnotes have been subject to audit by KPMG Audit plc www.
