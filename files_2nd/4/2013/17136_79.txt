2 162,500 paid as supplement in lieu of pension contributions to the Company Scheme.
3 The other payment to Ralph Topping represents compensation for a June 2013 dividend payment, which would have been normally made on EBMS shares vesting in 2013.
Because of the 2013 Company Rights Issue the record date for the June 2013 dividend was moved from 3 May 2013 to 13 March 2013 which was then before the vesting date for EBMS shares 19 March 2013.
The Committee therefore agreed to pay compensation equivalent to the lost dividend for those participants who held 2013 vested EBMS shares until the original record date of 3 May 2013.
4 Executive directors are required to obtain the Boards prior written consent to accept external appointments.
