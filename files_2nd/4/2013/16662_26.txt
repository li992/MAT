67 corporate governance Directors Remuneration Report Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to update you on the Remuneration Committees activities in Vesuvius first full year as an independent public company.
I took over as Chair of the Committee from John Sussens, and I am grateful to him and Jan Oosterveld who both left the Committee at the 2013 AGM, for their expertise and judgement.
Nelda Connors joined the Committee on 1 March 2013.
The Committee has a broad, diverse and balanced set of skills to meet its ongoing requirements.
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides further detail about the work of the Committee in 2013.
During the year we laid the groundwork for Vesuvius remuneration arrangements as a stand-alone company, whilst maintaining overall continuity with the previous executive remuneration policy.
As a result, the remuneration policy detailed later is substantially similar to that adopted by the Committee at the demerger, with the exception of the elements highlighted below.
During the year, the key elements that the Committee debated were: Changing the measurement of the Vesuvius Share Plan EPS growth to compare to nominal global Gross Domestic Product growth, rather than an absolute target, thus reflecting the Companys strategy and growth ambition see page 70 of the Policy and page 71 for further detail : Agreeing that our Group Executive Committee, who are central to delivering the ongoing success of the Company, are included in the Vesuvius Share Plan: The payment of incentive awards in shares rather than cash to senior managers in the Medium Term Plan MTP : The agreement of financial targets for the 2014 annual incentive though we will not disclose targets set until after the relevant performance period because of commercial sensitivities : and The adoption of a longer-term horizon of 2-3 years for base salary increases for senior executives and Executive Directors to evaluate and reward performance over the medium term.
Clearly, it must be recognised that, when base salary rises are awarded under the new salary approach, they may be substantially higher than if made on an annual basis.
In line with this new approach, the Executive Directors requested that no increase in salary be awarded to them for 2014.
As described elsewhere in the Strategic Report, and in the financial highlights on page 05, the Company has enjoyed a successful year.
The annual incentive awards based upon Group Headline Earnings per share of 125% and 100% of base salary for the Chief Executive and CFO, respectively, reflect this solid trading performance.
In 2012 no performance-related annual incentives were paid.
The long term incentive awards made in 2011 under the Cookson LTIP matured at the end of 2013.
Under this plan, performance is measured equally in TSR relative to the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts and headline EPS over a three year period.
Relative TSR performance was between median and upper Quintile, resulting in a performance share award of 28.4% out of a maximum 50% and matching share awards of 1:0.621.
However, the EPS target for the three year period was not met and therefore none of the element of the award related to EPS performance vested.
In confirming the vesting of the relative TSR performance portion of the award, noted above, we reviewed the underlying performance of the Company to satisfy ourselves that the numerical outcome was justified.
The previous Committee Chairman and I talked with major shareholders to address any questions they had arising from the change of leadership, and as noted above, the proposed change of the Vesuvius Share Plan EPS growth measure.
I remain keen to hear shareholder views on remuneration matters and look forward to a continued dialogue.
The remuneration policy we propose is not materially different to the remuneration approach applied to Executive Directors in 2013.
Finally, I am delighted to present our first Remuneration Policy to our shareholders for a binding vote, and our Annual Report on Remuneration, as before, for an advisory shareholder vote.
The Committee recommends both elements to you for approval.
We look forward to another year of support from our investors.
Yours sincerely Jane Hinkley Chair, Remuneration Committee 4 March 2014 www.
com 22904-04 10-02-2014 Proof 3 Vesuvius plc 68 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors Remuneration Report continued Directors Remuneration Policy As reported on last year, the overarching philosophy for remuneration within Vesuvius is to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the calibre necessary to successfully implement our business strategy.
In particular, we ensure that incentives are appropriate to encourage enhanced performance and to avoid underperformance being rewarded.
In reviewing and setting Vesuvius remuneration policy, the Committee seeks to balance the interests of our employees and those of our long-term shareholders, to support Company strategy and foster a high performance culture, where a meaningful portion of remuneration is performance linked and subject to clawback.
In setting our policy for Executive Directors and senior managers the Committee seeks to emphasise pay for performance and to account for the broad international scale and nature of the Companys operations.
We also consider the approach taken to the pay and employment conditions of other Company employees, together with UK governance requirements and developments in governance practice issued by leading shareholders and shareholder advisory bodies.
The Committee reviews information on the remuneration of comparable roles at similar companies to provide a point of reference for determining remuneration levels.
Given that there is not a clear comparator group of companies for Vesuvius, this is judged in the context of other FTSE 250 companies and other relevant international sector-specific companies to reach a rounded judgement and deliver remuneration that is competitive.
Although Vesuvius is in its early stages as an independent company, the Committee is satisfied that the flexibility within the policy, and the ability to exercise discretion and judgement, will allow the Committee to ensure that an appropriate balance between the interests of employees and shareholders is maintained.
A separate resolution will be put to shareholders at the AGM to approve the Remuneration Policy which, if approved, will take effect from the date of the AGM on 15 May 2014.

com 22904-04 10-02-2014 Proof 3 71 corporate governance Selection of Performance measures Measures for the Annual Incentive are selected to reflect key strategic aims and the need for a rigorous focus on working capital management.
Each year the Committee will agree challenging targets to ensure that underperformance is not rewarded.
For the Vesuvius Share Plan, at the demerger, Vesuvius stated that the performance measures would be similar to those for the Cookson LTIP, to focus Executive Directors on the execution of long-term strategy and also align their rewards with value created for shareholders.
On this basis, the performance conditions for the Vesuvius performance share awards are based half on TSR performance and half on EPS performance.
The comparator for the TSR performance condition will be reviewed annually to ensure its continuing relevance for the Group.
In 2014 the Committee agreed the continuation of comparison to the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts.
In respect of the EPS measure, the Committee wished to align the target with the Companys ambitions to grow ahead of end markets.
As an international company, a global metric was deemed important by the Committee, and in 2013 an EPS target, based upon outperforming global Gross Domestic Product GDP growth was adopted.
This has been carried through to 2014.
Within the policy period, the Committee will continually review the performance conditions used, including EPS and other financial measures, used to ensure that awards are made on the basis of challenging targets that clearly support the achievement of the Groups strategic aims.

com 22904-04 10-02-2014 Proof 3 Vesuvius plc 72 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors Remuneration Report continued Recruitment Policy On appointment or promotion of a new Executive Director, the Committee will typically use the above policy to determine ongoing remuneration.
However, the Committee retains the discretion to make appropriate remuneration decisions outside the standard policy to meet specific circumstances.
Base salary levels will generally be set in accordance with the policy taking into account the experience and calibre of the appointee.
If it is appropriate to appoint an individual on a base salary initially below what is adjudged to be market positioning, contingent on individual performance, the Committee retains the discretion to realign base salary over the one to three years following appointment, which may result in a higher rate of annualised increase than might otherwise be awarded under the policy.
If the Committee intends to rely on this discretion, it will be noted in the first Directors Remuneration Report following an individuals appointment.
Other than in exceptional circumstances, other elements of annual remuneration will, typically, be set in line with this Policy.
The Committee retains the discretion to make the following exceptions: In the event that an internal appointment is made, the Committee may continue with existing remuneration provisions where appropriate: If necessary and appropriate to secure an appointment from an international pool of candidates, the Committee may make additional payments linked to relocation, above those outlined in the Policy Table and would authorise the payment of a relocation allowance and repatriation, as well as other associated international mobility terms.
Such benefits would be set at a level which the Committee considers appropriate for the role and the individuals circumstances: and In order to provide an immediate interest in the Companys performance, the Committee may grant, on recruitment, an award of Performance Shares with a market value of up to 200% of salary under the Vesuvius Share Plan and or an individual award agreement under Listing Rule 9.4.
Performance conditions for any such award will be set in line with the policy and the Committee will determine the vesting period that will apply to such awards at the time of award, taking into account the strategy and business circumstances of Vesuvius.
Service contracts will be entered into on terms similar to those for the existing Executive Directors, summarised in the service contract section below.
In addition to the annual remuneration elements noted above, the Committee may consider buying out incentive awards that an individual forfeits in accepting an appointment with Vesuvius.
The Committee will have the authority to rely on Listing Rule 9.4.
2 2 or to apply the existing limits within the Vesuvius Share Plan to make Restricted Share awards on recruitment.
In making any such awards, the Committee will review the terms of any forfeited awards, including, but not limited to, vesting periods, the expected value of such awards on vesting and the likelihood of the performance targets applicable to such awards being met, while retaining the discretion to make any buy out award the Committee determines is necessary and appropriate.
The Committee may also require the appointee to purchase shares in Vesuvius to a pre-agreed level prior to vesting of any such awards.
The value of any buy out award will be capped, to ensure its maximum value is no higher than the value of the awards that the individual forfeited on joining Vesuvius.
Any such awards will be subject to clawback.
With respect to the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-executive Director, appointment terms will be consistent with those currently adopted.
Variable pay will not be considered.
With respect to Non-executive Directors, fees will be consistent with the policy at the time of appointment.
Exit Payment Policy Vesuvius has the option to make a payment in lieu of part or all of the required notice period for Executive Directors.
Any such payment in lieu will consist of the base salary, pension contributions and value of benefits to which the Director would have been entitled for the duration of the remaining notice period, net of statutory deductions in each case.
Half of any payments in lieu of notice would be made in a lump sum, the remainder in equal monthly instalments commencing in the month in which the midpoint of their forgone notice period falls and are reduced or extinguished by salary from any role undertaken by the departing executive in this time.
Executive Directors are subject to certain non-compete covenants for a period of nine months, and non-solicitation covenants for a period of 12 months, following the termination of their employment.
Their service agreements are governed by English law.
Neither of the Executive Directors contracts contains any change of control provisions and they both contain a duty to mitigate should the Director find an alternative paid occupation in any period during which the Company must otherwise pay compensation on early termination.
The table below summarises how the awards under the annual bonus and Vesuvius Share Plan are typically treated in different leaver scenarios and on a change of control.
Whilst the Committee retains overall discretion on determining good leaver status, it typically defines a good leaver in circumstances such as retirement with agreement of the Company, ill health, disability, death, redundancy, or part of the business in which the individual is employed or engaged ceasing to be part of the Group.
Final treatment is subject to the Committees discretion.

In certain circumstances, the Committee may determine that unvested awards under the Vesuvius Share Plan will not vest on a change of control but will instead be replaced by an equivalent grant of a new award, as determined by the Committee, in the new company.
If employment is terminated by the Company, the Committee retains discretion to settle amounts reasonably due to the Executive Director, for example to meet the legal fees incurred by the Executive Director in connection with the termination of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement as provided for below and where the individual must seek independent legal advice.
The Company would pay any amounts to which the departing Director was legally entitled.
In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing Executive Directors including but not limited to settlement, confidentiality, restrictive covenants and or consultancy arrangements.
This would only be used where the Committee believed it was in the best interests of the Company to do so.
Service contracts The Committee will periodically review the contractual terms for new Executive Directors to ensure these reflect best practice.
Service contracts currrently operate on a rolling basis and are limited to a 12 month notice period.
Franois Wanecq is employed as Chief Executive of Vesuvius pursuant to the terms of a service agreement made with Cookson Group plc dated 17 October 2012.
Chris OShea is employed as Chief Financial Officer pursuant to the terms of a service agreement with Cookson Group plc dated 10 September 2012.
Both service agreements were assigned to Vesuvius upon completion of the Demerger on 19 December 2012.
Each Executive Directors appointment is terminable by Vesuvius on not less than 12 months written notice, and by each Executive Director on not less than six months written notice.
Considerations of conditions elsewhere in the group in developing policy The Company does not consult directly with employees on Executive Directors remuneration arrangements.
However, the Remuneration Committee will take into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when determining Executive Directors remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases.
The Remuneration Committee will also obtain information on the remuneration paid for comparable roles at other relevant companies to provide a point of reference for determining remuneration policy.
com 22904-04 10-02-2014 Proof 3 Vesuvius plc 74 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors Remuneration Report continued Remuneration policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors is designed in line with the remuneration philosophy set out at the beginning of this report which also underpins remuneration for the wider Group.
Remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors draw on the same elements as those for other employees base salary, fixed benefits, and retirement benefits with performance-related pay extending down into the management cadres and beyond.
However, given that remuneration structures for other employees need to reflect both seniority and local market practice, they differ from the policy for Executive Directors.
In particular, Executive Directors receive a higher proportion of their remuneration in performance-related pay and share-based payments and individual percentages of fixed versus variable remuneration and participation in share-based structures decline with seniority.
The process for delivering salary increases on a 2-3 year cycle for Executive Directors is also applied to members of the Group Executive Committee and their direct managerial reports.
While all employees receive an annual performance appraisal, other employees continue to receive salary reviews on an annual basis.
As with Executive Directors, middle and senior managers participate in the Annual Incentive Plan.
For operational employees, any potential award is based upon achieving three measures relating to Group performance, business unit performance, and individual achievement of personal objectives.
For functional employees, the award is predominantly based on Group performance, with the remainder awarded against achievement of personal objectives.
The awards for middle and senior managers are also adjusted to reflect the level of performance by the business with regard to its working capital management.
For certain senior and middle managers awards are made under the Vesuvius Medium Term Plan MTP.
Awards under the MTP are based on the same measures and targets as the Annual Incentive Plan for those managers.
Middle managers participate in the MTP at varying percentage levels, with awards being made in cash.
Senior managers have their MTP awards made over Vesuvius shares.
In each case, awards are granted following the end of the relevant financial year.
The MTP share awards vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continuing employment.
From 2014 onwards members of the Group Executive Committee who in 2013 were included in the above MTP in shares will instead participate in the Vesuvius Share Plan and receive awards of Performance Shares, which will vest in accordance with the same measures and targets as those for Executive Directors.
Levels of awards will differ from those of Executive Directors.
Consideration of shareholder views Vesuvius is committed to open and transparent dialogue with its shareholders on remuneration as well as other governance matters.
As Chair of the Committee, Jane Hinkley welcomes shareholder engagement and is available for any discussions investors wish to have on remuneration matters.
During 2013, Jane Hinkley undertook several meetings with investors for the discussion of remuneration matters, including changes to the EPS measure for the Vesuvius Share Plan and on the change of Remuneration Committee Chair.
The feedback was useful and was considered by the Committee.
In setting our remuneration policy, we have made no material changes to the way in which the policy has functioned for Executive Directors in 2013 and hence we have not undertaken specific shareholder consultation on the policy contained in this document.
Shareholding Policy Audited The Remuneration Committee encourages Executive Directors to build and hold a shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to at least one times base salary.
To this end, Executive Directors will normally be expected to retain at least 50% measured as the value after tax of any Performance Share Awards vesting under the Vesuvius Share Plan, until this criterion has been met.
New Executive Directors will be allowed four years in which to acquire this shareholding.
As at 31 December 2013, using the Companys share price at 31 December 2013 of 510p, the Executive Directors shareholdings against this guideline were as follows: Actual share ownership as a percentage Policy share ownership as a Director of salary at 31 December 2013 percentage of salary Policy met?
Franois Wanecq 1,122% 100% Yes Chris OShea 88% 100% Yes in the build-up period Clawback Arrangements The Executive Directors are subject to clawback arrangements.
In the event that a misstatement is identified in the Companys consolidated financial statements which requires the restatement of a prior years accounts in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards or any applicable law, then such portion as the Remuneration Committee deems appropriate of any variable executive remuneration being all Annual Incentive and Performance Share awards made under the Vesuvius Share Plan resulting from a measure of financial performance affected by the misstatement will be subject to clawback provisions.
The misstatement must be identified and notified to the individual in writing within three years after the end of the relevant performance period.

Policy for non-executive Directors The Company seeks to appoint Non-executive Directors who have relevant professional knowledge, and have gained experience in a relevant industry and geographical sectors, to support diversity of expertise at the Board and match the wide geographic spread of the Companys activities.
Non-executive Directors attend Board, Committee and other meetings, held mainly in the UK, together with an annual strategy review to debate the Companys strategic direction.
All Non-executive Directors are expected to familiarise themselves with the scale and scope of the Companys business and to maintain their specific technical skills and knowledge.
The Board sets the level of fees paid to the Non-executive Directors after considering the role and responsibilities of each Director and the practice of other companies of a similar size and international complexity.
The Non-executive Directors do not participate in Board discussions on their own remuneration.
No variable remuneration is available to Non-executive Directors.

Terms of Service The terms of service of the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors are contained in letters of appointment.
Each Non-executive Director is appointed subject to their election at the Companys first Annual General Meeting following their appointment and re-election at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
None of the Non-executive Directors is entitled to receive compensation for loss of office at any time.
During the first year of his appointment the Chairman is entitled to 12 months notice from the Company: thereafter, he is entitled to six months notice from the Company.
All Non-executive Directors are subject to retirement, and election or re-election, in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
The current policy is for Non-executive Directors to serve on the Board for a maximum of nine years, with review at the end of the three and six years, subject always to mutual agreement and annual performance evaluation.
The Board retains discretion to extend the tenure of Non-executive Directors beyond this time, subject to the requirements of Board balance and independence being satisfied.

The terms of reference are available on the Group website www.
The Committee and its members are also empowered to obtain outside legal or other independent professional advice at the cost of the Company in relation to its deliberations powers which were not exercised during the year and to secure the attendance at its meetings of any employee or other parties should it be considered necessary.
Role and Responsibilities The Committee is responsible for: Setting the appropriate remuneration for the Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary: Recommending and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management, being the first layer of management below Board level and their direct reports: and Overseeing the operation of any Executive share incentive plan.

Key activities in 2013 During the year, the overall objectives for the Committee were to set the tone for remuneration in Vesuvius first year as an independent public company.
In addition to the usual routine Committee matters, the Committee discussed and agreed changes in the following material key matters: Receiving the proposed vesting schedules and reviewing the appropriateness of the out-turn of share-based awards against overall financial performance to ensure that awards made under the 2010 LTIP and Deferred Share Bonus Plan were in line with financial performance: Reviewing, debating and approving financial performance criteria for Annual Incentive cash bonus awards and changes to the performance metrics for EPS under the Vesuvius Share Plan to compare with nominal global Gross Domestic Product growth rather than an absolute target: Aligning share-based incentive awards for members of the Group Executive Committee to those for Executive Directors, by including them in the Vesuvius Share Plan: Approving the payment of incentive awards in shares rather than cash to senior managers in the MTP: and Adopting longer-term horizons of 2-3 years for base salary increases for Executive Directors and senior managers.

It also meets the requirements of the UK Listing Authorities Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out how the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code are applied by the Company in relation to matters of remuneration.
We are happy to confirm that the Company has complied with these governance rules in the year under review.
Share Usage Under the rules of the Vesuvius Share Plan, as approved by shareholders on 26 November 2012, the Company has the discretion to satisfy awards either by the transfer of existing shares or by the allotment of newly issued shares, Treasury shares or other shares.
Awards made to senior managers by the Company over shares pursuant to the Medium Term Plan must be satisfied out of shares held for this purpose by the Companys employee share ownership trust ESOT.
The decision on how to satisfy awards is taken by the Board, which considers the most prudent and appropriate sourcing arrangement for the Company.
At 31 December 2013 the Company held 7,271,174 ordinary shares in Treasury.
As at 31 December 2013, 1,025,484 Vesuvius shares were held in the ESOT.
The Trustee of the ESOT purchases shares in the open market or can subscribe for newly issued shares as required, to meet obligations for the provision of shares to satisfy options and awards that vest.
The Vesuvius Share Plan complies with the current ABI guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a ten year period in relation to the Companys issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten year period on discretionary schemes.

The sum of basic salary, benefits and pension.
The Annual Incentive cash bonus payments to be made to the Executive Directors for their performance in the year under review, pay out at the maximum amount, being 125% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
This reflected the performance of the Company in the year under review against the target set for the Annual Incentive.
In 2013 the maximum financial performance target was Group Headline Earnings per share of 30.0p.
Group Headline Earnings per share for the financial year ended 31 December 2013 was 31.9p, thus justifying the maximum incentive payment.
The Cookson Group 2011 LTIP nil-cost awards consisted of both a Performance Share award and a Matching Share Award.
The vesting of the award is based upon 50% relative TSR performance and 50% on Headline EPS performance.
The TSR performance was based upon Cooksons TSR from 1 January 2011 to 18 December 2012 to which was added to the Vesuvius TSR from 19 December 2012 to 31 December 2013 for a combined figure, being 84.3% between Median and Upper Quintile, which allows vesting of 28.4% of the Performance Share Award and 1:0.621 for the Matching Share Award.
Following the demerger, the 2013 EPS targets, as previously reported, were set at 48.6p at threshold.
Headline EPS for the year ended 31 December 2013 was 31.9p.
Hence there is no vesting of either the Performance Share Award or the Matching Share Award for EPS performance and all awards lapse.
The Cookson Group LTIP 2011 award whose performance period ended 31 December 2013 for Franois Wanecq will vest on 1 April 2014.
Following the above performance, 42,105 Performance shares and 91,752 Matching Shares will vest, and 106,155 Performance Shares and 240,685 Matching Shares will lapse which, at an average Vesuvius share price from 1 October 2013 to 31 December 2013 of 478p, provides a total gain of 639,836.
Overall, of the total shares awarded, 27.8% will vest being 133,857 shares with the balance lapsing being 346,840 shares.
In addition, a further award of shares 15,402 shares, with a market value at an average market price of 478p of 73,621 will be made to cover dividends accrued between the date of grant and the date of vesting in accordance with the rules of the Plan.
Consequently, in total Franois Wanecq will receive 149,259 shares under entitlements from the 2011 LTIP to the value of 713,457.
The Cookson Group 2010 LTIP nil cost award for Franois Wanecq vested on 8 April 2013 and 104,272 Vesuvius shares vested at a share price of 330p, a gain of 344,097.
The performance period was 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012 and overall, 67.2% of the shares vested with the balance lapsing.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee also awarded a further 6,392 shares to the value of the dividends paid on the shares between grant date and the date of vesting, with a further market value of 21,094.

Employee Pay The table below shows the percentage change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive - comprising salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus - and comparable data of UK salaried employees.
The UK salaried employee workforce was chosen as a fair representation of a suitable comparator group as Franois Wanecq, the Chief Executive, is based in the UK albeit with a global role and responsibilities and levels of pay vary widely across the Group depending on geography and local market conditions.

The figure used for comparison excludes the sum of 361,871 relating to one-off relocation expenses 2012: 13,631 paid during 2013 for Franois Wanecq.
In 2012, based on Group performance, no bonus was paid to Franois Wanecq.
In the year ended 31 December 2013, a full bonus was paid.
Thus the percentage change in bonus does not present a meaningful comparison.

Operation of Policy in Following Year 2014 It is the Remuneration Committees intention that the operation of the policy should remain broadly similar to the current year.
No increase has been made to the Executive Directors base salary, cash bonus potential has remained the same with challenging targets set for maximum pay-out, based on Group Headline Earnings per share and awards under the Vesuvius Share Plan will be made at 200% of base salary, on the basis of measures for 50% relative TSR and 50% EPS, as with 2013.
We will report on these matters in our Annual Report on Remuneration in the 2014 Annual Report.
Prior to seeking shareholder approval to any changes in this Policy, the Remuneration Committee will discuss any proposed material changes by consulting with shareholders.

The appointment was made following a competitive tender process conducted by the Committee Chairman and Company Secretary.
The full Committee approved the selection of Towers.
The Committee is also advised by the Chief Executive, the Vice President Human Resources, the Company Secretary, and by the law firm Clifford Chance LLP Clifford Chance.
Towers was appointed directly by the Remuneration Committee to provide advice on executive remuneration matters, including remuneration structure and policy, updates on market practices and trends, and guidance on the implementation and operation of long-term incentive plans.
Clifford Chance was appointed by the Company Secretary to advise on the share-based incentives.
Towers has also provided the Remuneration Committee with remuneration benchmarking data for certain Executive Directors and has provided ongoing calculations of Total Shareholder Return to enable the Committee to be updated on performance of long-term share incentive plans.
Clifford Chance provides advice on the operation of executive share plans and the drafting of relevant documentation for incentive plans to the wider Group.
Towers is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct in relation to Executive Remuneration Consulting in the UK.
In addition to work undertaken for the Committee, Towers provides other remuneration and benchmarking advice to the Company, and Clifford Chance provides legal advice to the Company.
The Remuneration Committee does not believe that the provision of any of these services to the Company compromises the independence or integrity of the advice that it receives from Towers and Clifford Chance LLP.
During the year Towers fees, charged on a time spent basis, amounted to 111,876.
Their work was split between advice relating to the demerger 8,333, general advice to the Remuneration Committee 30,563, with the remainder 72,980 relating to advice on the content and preparation of the Directors Remuneration Report and fees for quarterly monitoring of TSR for awards outstanding under Long Term Incentive Plans.
The Committee has considered and concluded that it is satisfied that the advice provided on executive remuneration matters is objective and independent and that no conflict of interest arises as a result of other services provided to the Company.
