Directors remuneration report Remuneration Committee Chairmans statement Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the Companys Directors Remuneration Report for the financial year ending 31 December 2013.
During the year we undertook a comprehensive review of our executive Director pay arrangements.
We have concluded that the key principles and parameters of our remuneration policy do not need to change.
The key elements of pay are: A competitive base salary.
As part of the review we undertook a full benchmarking review of executive Director remuneration.
The conclusions were that base salaries and other xed pay elements are broadly competitive.
The incentive structure was reviewed in the context of supporting Synthomers strategy to build a strong platform for long-term profitable growth.
The key changes we have made to our policy are as follows: Addition of strategic measures under the annual bonus and the performance share plan.
A modest increase to PSP award opportunity.
A recognition that EPS targets under the PSP should be stretching, but must also calibrate with the expectations for the business.
We undertook extensive shareholder consultation on our proposals.
The Committee was very pleased with the constructive dialogue and responses from its shareholders to the new policy.
Out-turns for 2014 For 2014 base salaries have been increased by 2.5% which is lower than the average across the all-employee population.
Under the annual bonus plan, the threshold level of PBT performance was not met and no annual bonuses have been paid.
Directors Remuneration Report This is the first report presented in the new format as prescribed by the new reporting regulations.
Accordingly our Directors Remuneration Policy will be subject to a binding vote and our Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote.
We hope we will have the support of our shareholders for both reports.
Remuneration Committee I am delighted to report that Brendan Connolly, who joined your Board and the Committee in January 2014, has agreed to take over the Chair of the Committee next month.
I would like to thank the members of the Committee for their work and support during my chairmanship.
Neil Johnson Chairman 32 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013 Governance Directors Remuneration Policy principles The key principles for executive Directors remuneration at Synthomer are as follows: sufficient to attract and retain executive Directors of the ability and expertise necessary to achieve the strategic goals of the Company.
Incentivise executive Directors by rewarding performance and driving the right behaviours.
Align executive Director reward with the experience of shareholders.
In setting executive Directors remuneration, the Committee takes account of pay and conditions throughout the Company.
The Committee also considers corporate governance requirements and best practice in terms of remuneration structures and the process of setting executive remuneration.
The Committee reviews performance targets regularly to ensure that they do not encourage or motivate inappropriate risk taking.
Furthermore, the Committee, when necessary, will take into account any environmental, social and governance ESG events and the Audit Committees risk assessment when assessing performance.
The following diagram provides an overview of the key elements of reward for executive Directors and the performance measures used.

These awards are subject to TSR and EPS performance conditions.
An exceptional award was made in 2011 under the 2011 plan.
This award was subject to an EPS performance condition and will lapse in full prior to the effective date of the policy.
Shareholding The Company operates shareholding guidelines for executive Directors.
The current guidelines are detailed guidelines in the annual report on Remuneration page 42.
Provisions to withhold or recover sums paid under incentives are as detailed in the table above.
No other elements of remuneration are subject to recovery provisions.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
The 2011 Performance Share Plan shall be operated in accordance with the rules of the plan as approved by shareholders.
In accordance with the plan rules: The performance condition may be replaced or varied if an event occurs which causes the Committee reasonably to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance condition, in which case the Committee can vary or replace the performance condition provided that the amended performance condition is in its opinion, fair, reasonable and not materially less difficult than the original condition when set.
The Committee may determine that awards will be settled in cash.
The Committee may make adjustments to awards in the event of a variation of share capital, a demerger, rights issue, special dividend or other similar events.
Performance measures and targets Annual bonus The annual bonus performance measures are chosen to provide an appropriate balance between incentivising executive Directors to meet financial targets for the year and to deliver specic strategic and operational goals.
This balance allows the Remuneration Committee to effectively reward performance against the key elements of our strategy.
The bonus targets are set by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that executive Directors are appropriately focused on the key objectives for the next 12 months.
Targets are set by reference to the Companys business plan.
36 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013 Governance Performance Share Plan The performance measures under the PSP are set to align with the long-term strategy of the Company and long-term value creation for shareholders.
EPS growth reects the financial performance of the Company.
The Committee sets targets to be appropriately stretching, with regard to a number of internal and external reference points.
Relative TSR Total Shareholder Return TSR reects the Companys ultimate delivery of value to shareholders.
The Committee considers that this promotes alignment between the interests of executive Directors and the shareholder experience.
Strategic measures This element directly incentivises management to deliver the Companys key strategic priorities.
The Committee considers that this performance framework represents an appropriate and balanced basis on which to measure the performance of the Company.
Difference in policy for executive Directors and other employees The remuneration policy for our executive Directors is designed in accordance with the same principles that underpin remuneration for the wider employee population.
The wider employee group also participate in performance-based incentives.
Throughout the Group, base salary and benefit levels are set in accordance with the prevailing market conditions.
Differences between executive Director pay policy and other employee pay reect the seniority of the individuals, the prevailing market conditions and the corporate governance practices for executive Director remuneration.
The key difference in policy is that for executive Directors a greater proportion of total remuneration is based on incentives.
Non-executive Director fees NonThe Board reviews non-executive Director fees periodically.
When reviewing fee levels the Board executive may consider the scope and time commitment of the role, the skills and experience of the individual, Director fees and fee levels at other companies.
Non-executive Directors do not participate in the determination of their own fees.
Non-executives are paid differential fee levels based on their membership of Board committees, chairmanship of Board committees or role as Senior Independent Director.
Expenses incurred in the performance of non-executive duties for the Company may be reimbursed or paid for directly by the Company, as appropriate, including any tax due on the expenses.
Chairman The Remuneration Committee review Chairman fees periodically.
When reviewing fee levels they fees may consider the scope and time commitment of the role, the skills and experience of the individual, and fee levels at other companies.
The Chairman does not participate in the determination of the fee level.
Expenses incurred in the performance of duties for the Company may be reimbursed or paid for directly by the Company, as appropriate, including any tax due on the expenses.
Total fees to non-executives, including the Chairman, operate within the cap dened in the Articles of Association currently 750,000 per annum.
Recruitment policy Executive Directors The Committee would have regard to the following principles when agreeing the components of a remuneration package upon the recruitment of a new executive Director: Base salary will be set taking into account the principles set out in the policy table and may be set at a level higher or lower than the previous incumbent.
The Committee may, on appointing an executive Director, need to buy out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Any buyout would take into account the terms of the arrangements e. g. form of award, performance conditions, timeframe being forfeited in the previous package.
The form of any award would be determined at the time and the Committee may if necessary make use of LR 9.4.
2 of the Listing Rules for the purpose of buyout awards only.
The overriding principle will be that any replacement buy-out awards will, in the opinion of the Committee, be no more valuable than the entitlement which has been forfeited.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013 37 Directors remuneration report continued Annual bonus opportunity will be no more than the maximum set out in the policy table.
The Committee may determine that for the first year of appointment the annual bonus award will be subject to such conditions as it may determine.
PSP opportunity will be no more than the plan rules maximum set out in the policy table.
The exceptional maximum may be used for the purpose of recruitment.
The maximum variable pay opportunity on recruitment excluding buyouts is 400% of salary, consistent with the maximums in the policy table above.
The Committee may extend leaving arrangements to include a payment in lieu of notice to cover benets as well as base salary for the outstanding period.
Other For interim positions a cash supplement may be paid rather than salary for example a non-executive Director taking on an executive function on a short-term basis.
Where an executive is appointed from within the Company, the normal policy of the Company is that any legacy arrangements would be honoured in line with the original terms and conditions and that they would be appointed on a new service contract.
Similarly, if an executive Director is appointed following the acquisition of or merger with another company, legacy terms and conditions would be honoured.
Non-executive Directors and Chairman In the event of the appointment of a new non-executive Director or Chairman, remuneration arrangements will be in line with the principles detailed in the relevant table above.
Service contracts The current contracts in place for executive Directors are as follows: Director Date of contract A M Whiteld 22 November 2005 D C Blackwood 12 September 2007 There is no unexpired term as each of the executive Directors contracts is on a rolling basis.
Save in circumstances justifying summary termination the notice period for each of the above contracts is one year.
Service contracts for new executive Directors will be limited to 12 months notice.
The executive Directors are also entitled to 25 working days holiday plus public holidays per holiday year.
All non-executive Directors are appointed in writing.
Letters of appointment do not include entitlement to participation in the Companys share incentive plans or any other of its employee benets, and do not currently have a notice period.
The Company may add a notice period of no more than 3 months.
The non-executive Directors are subject to annual re-election.
There is no right to compensation for loss of ofce if they are not re-elected or if the Company terminates the appointment because the non-executive Director has accepted a position with another company without prior board approval and which the Board reasonably considers likely to give rise to a material conict.
The periods of appointment and the requirements for re-election of non-executive Directors are provided within the Performance Evaluation section of the Corporate Governance report on page 26.
Directors service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Companys registered ofce during normal business hours and will be available at the Annual General Meeting.
Policy on payment for loss of ofce The Committee takes a number of factors into account when determining leaving arrangements for an executive Director.
Where either party gives notice of the termination of an executive Directors employment, the Committee may make a payment in lieu of notice based on the base salary for the outstanding period.
Other than this provision, the obligation to pay accrued but untaken holiday and as outlined below regarding bonus and the Performance Share Plan, service contracts make no provision for pre-dened compensation on termination.
The Committee may include benets including pension for the payment in respect of the outstanding period.
The following principles shall apply when determining payments for loss of ofce for current and new executive directors.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the executive directors service contracts, the Committee may structure compensation payments in such a way as it deems appropriate for example, considering making phased payments and or requiring the executive director to mitigate his loss taking into account the circumstances of departure including performance and bearing in mind any potential consequences.
38 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013 Governance If employment is terminated by the Company the departing executive Directors may have a legal entitlement under statute or otherwise to additional amounts, which would need to be met.
In addition, the Committee retains discretion to settle any claims by or on behalf of the executive Director in return for making an appropriate payment and contributing to legal fees incurred by the executive Director in connection with termination of employment where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement and the individual must seek independent legal advice.
These arrangements will be used sparingly and only entered into where the Committee believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so.
While there is no entitlement to a bonus when a Director leaves employment or serves notice before 31 March following the year end except in the case of death or retirement, the Committee may award an annual bonus for leavers taking into account the circumstances of departure.
Any bonus would normally be subject to performance and time pro-rating and would not be made in circumstances of poor performance.
The treatment of outstanding share awards is governed by the relevant share plan rules.
The following table summarises the leaver provisions of the 2011 Performance Share Plan under which executive Directors may currently hold awards in the form of share options or conditional rights to receive shares.

In the event of death following cessation of employment all unvested awards shall vest on the date of death on a time-apportioned basis and subject to the achievement of performance conditions.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013 39 Directors remuneration report continued Vested shares under the 2002 Performance Share Plan are exercisable before the sooner of ten years from the date of grant of the original award or twelve months from the date of cessation of employment.
Where an award is made for the purpose of recruitment for example a buyout award then the leaver provisions would be determined at the time of award having regard to the circumstances of the recruitment, the terms of awards being bought out and the principles for leavers in the current policy.
On change of control or in the event of a demerger, special dividend or other similar event treatment will be in accordance with the rules of the 2011 Performance Share Plan.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, unvested awards may vest subject to achievement of the performance conditions and time pro-rating.
In such circumstances the Committee may elect to dis-apply or modify the time pro-rating of unvested awards.
In the event of an internal reorganisation the Committee may determine that unvested awards are automatically surrendered for a new award which the Committee determines is equivalent to the surrendered award including as to any performance condition except that it shall be over shares in the acquiring company or some other company.
In the event of a demerger, special dividend or other similar event which, in the opinion of the Committee, would materially affect the market price of shares, the Committee may allow awards to vest, subject to time pro-rating unless dis-applied and achievement of the performance conditions.

40 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013 Governance Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company When setting the policy for the remuneration of the executive Directors, the Committee has regard to the pay and employment conditions of employees within the Group.
The Committee considers salary increases within the business but does not formally consider comparison metrics.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when formulating the remuneration policy for executive Directors.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the remuneration policy during 2013.
The Committee consulted with its largest shareholders as part of this process, and shareholders comments were taken into account by the Committee in nalising the remuneration policy.
Annual Report on Remuneration Operation of the Executive Director Remuneration Policy for 2014 During 2013 the Committee undertook a comprehensive review of executive remuneration.
This review was on a clean sheet basis, with the aim of developing a long-term remuneration policy that supports Synthomers strategy and which will remain in place for at least three years see Policy Report, pages 33 to 41.
The key changes we have made to our policy are as follows: Addition of strategic measures under the annual bonus and the performance share plan PSP.
This reects a market review of total remuneration opportunity, against the background of the performance demonstrated by our highly experienced management team, and the increased size and scale of the Group.
The specic remuneration arrangements for 2014 are described below: Base salary Salary increases of 2.5%, effective 1 January 2014.
2014 salaries: A W Whiteld: 512,500 D C Blackwood: 320,441 Pension and benets No changes.

2014 cash allowances in lieu of pension contributions: A W Whiteld: 25% of salary D C Blackwood: 20% of salary Annual bonus For 2014, performance under the annual bonus will be measured on the following basis: 80% subject to performance against underlying profit before tax targets 20% subject to performance measures against key strategic and operational objectives.
Targets and objectives are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive.
However, the Committee will provide information on targets and objectives retrospectively.
2014 maximum award opportunity: A W Whiteld: 100% of salary D C Blackwood: 100% of salary Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013 41 Directors remuneration report continued Operation of the Executive Director Remuneration Policy for 2014 continued Performance share plan For awards made in 2014, performance will be measured as follows: 40% based on relative TSR performance versus FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts and financial services companies: 25% of this element will vest for median performance 100% vesting for upper quartile performance.
Vesting on a straight line basis between these points.
40% based on underlying EPS growth: 25% of this element will vest for EPS growth of 4.5% per annum, 100% vesting for EPS growth of 10% per annum.
This target range was set following consideration of the long-term strategy and the outlook for the markets in which we operate.
20% based on performance against three equally weighted measures directly linked to the delivery of the business strategy: Proportion of sales from new products, measured over the 5 years to the end of the performance period incentivising greater innovation through new product development.
Growth in Asia EBIT incentivising growing the scale and profitability of operations in emerging markets.
Cumulative Europe EBITDA incentivising the delivery of stable cash ows from our more mature European business to fund this international growth.
For each of these measures, 25% will vest for threshold performance.
The targets for these measures, and the level of performance achieved, will be disclosed following the end of the performance period.
2014 maximum award opportunity: A W Whiteld: 125% of salary D C Blackwood: 110% of salary Shareholding guidelines Executives are required to build unfettered interests in shares of at least 100% of salary.

Remuneration Committee Remuneration Committee membership since 1 January 2013: Neil Johnson Chairman from 7 February 2013 Jez Maiden Just Jansz Ishbel Macpherson until 7 February 2013 and Chairman until that date Brendan Connolly joined the Committee on 23 January 2014 and will become Chairman of the Committee on 1 March 2014 at which time Neil Johnson will step down.
The Committees composition was non compliant with the requirements of Code Provision D. 2 for most of 2013 as it was comprised of only two Independent non-executive Directors and the Company chairman was also chairman of the Committee.
This composition was adopted as an interim measure due to the Board not having available to it the resources to staff a fully compliant Remuneration Committee and in the circumstances it was considered most appropriate for the chairman to lead the processes required to meet the new Director remuneration reporting regulations.
Attendance at Committee meetings is set out on page 26.
Key duties of the Committee The Committee is responsible for determining, in agreement with the Board, the Companys policy on executive remuneration and the specic remuneration for the chairman and each of the executive Directors, including pension rights, within the terms of the agreed policy.
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the remuneration of senior executives throughout the Group.

The fees paid to Deloitte in respect of this work were charged on a time and expenses basis and totalled 93,850 for advice in 2013.

The Committee was satisfied that this did not compromise the independence of the advice received.
Both New Bridge Street and Deloitte are founding members of the Remuneration Consultants Group, and adhere to its code of conduct.

Shortly before the AGM, the Committee had appointed Deloitte LLP to assist in a comprehensive review of the executive Director arrangements.
The Committee considered shareholders concerns as part of this review.
The proposals were developed on a clean sheet basis taking into account the following perspectives: The strategy of the business, and ensuring that incentives and performance measures supported that strategy.
Best practice and corporate governance developments.
Market review against companies of similar size and complexity.
The Committee chairman consulted extensively with shareholders following the review before nalising the proposals.
It was appreciated that there were a range of views from shareholders on various matters.
However, the Committee was pleased with the dialogue and level of support received during this process.
A number of shareholders raised the question of increasing shareholding guidelines.
The Committee is currently satisfied that the current shareholding guidelines are entirely consistent with practice in comparable FTSE 250 companies.
The Committee will keep this area under review.
