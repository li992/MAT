Furthermore, 100 invested in SABMiller upon our listing in London in 1999 would nowbe worth 1,114.
In such circumstances, it might be expected that executive variable pay would have paid-out at maximum for the year.
However, while three-year adjusted EPS and five-year TSR performance conditions for long-term incentives have resulted in full vesting for 2013, the annual bonus payments to executives are well below the maximum, as has been the case in recent years, re ecting the very challenging performance targets set every year by the remuneration committee.
Details of the performance measures and payouts for 2013 are included later in the remuneration report.
A number of you had asked for greater disclosure concerning bonus assessment and the level of payouts: we are happy to provide that this year and intend to continue to do so in future years.
The remuneration report has been redesigned this year, and split into two sections, consistent with the draft remuneration reporting regulations proposedby the UK Department for Business Innovation & Skills.
The policy report describes our remuneration philosophy, andits alignment with our Miles Morland business strategy, and includes a summaryof the key elements of pay.
Chairman of the remuneration committee Theimplementation report details and explains the amounts paid in respect of the year and periods ended 31 March 2013, and includes information on our achievement as measured against the various performance conditions which determine payments to executive directors.
During the year the remuneration committee undertook a consultation, inviting our 50 largest shareholders to contribute to that process.
I was delighted that more than 30 shareholders and other representative bodies agreed to participate, and their input was extremely useful.
A wide variety of views were expressed, not all of which were mutually compatible, but as a result of those interactions, we have made anumber ofchanges to remuneration this year.

In addition, executive directors are required to own outright shares in the company having a value proportional to their base pay 300% of base pay for the Chief Executive, and 200% for other executive directors.
This provides further alignment with shareholder returns, by ensuring a reduction in their own wealth if there is a reduction in SABMillers share price.

The companys policy on service contracts and termination arrangements is set out below.
The companys overriding principle isthat there should be no reward for failure.
The committees approach, when considering payments in the event of termination, is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for termination, any contractual obligations, and the relevant share plan and pension scheme rules.
Service contract key items Notice period For executive directors, 12 months written notice by either party.
Executive committee members and other employees have notice periods of up to 12 months.
Termination payment Base pay and bene ts: paid in lieu for the remainder of the notice period, less any deduction considered appropriate and reasonable taking into account any accelerated receipt of payment and the employees duty to mitigate any loss.
Short-term incentives: not contractual, but normal practice is to pro-rate the annual bonus for the year in which an employee departs, subject to individual and business performance.
Long-term incentives: not contractual, but if an employee leaves by reason of retirement, injury, disability, ill-health or redundancy, any unvested share awards are pro-rated for time served during the relevant period, with vesting subject to the applicable performance conditions.
In the event of death, or if the company or business in which the employee works issold or transferred, any unvested share awards may vest in full, subject to the absolute discretion of the remuneration committee.
