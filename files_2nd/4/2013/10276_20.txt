Governance Overview Strategic report Remuneration Committee Report Group financial statements Further information Remuneration Committee Report Chairmans introduction During 2013, the Remuneration Committee the Committee met in order to review the effectiveness of the Groups remuneration policies and practices and the ability of those policies and practises to attract, motivate and retain a talented senior management team, whilst ensuring that the interests of Executive Directors and senior management are appropriately aligned with those of shareholders.
Throughout its deliberations, the Committee is mindful of the Best Practice Provisions on the Design of Performance Related Remuneration under Schedule A of the UK Corporate Governance Code, and has adopted changes required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
During the year, the Committee asked the Groups remuneration consultants, Kepler Associates, to advise on ways to improve executive motivation through pay and ways to improve the transparency of the Groups senior management remuneration policy.
As a result of this consultation and after subsequent discussions with shareholders, we have introduced a third performance condition governing the vesting of awards under the Groups long-term incentive plan LTIP.
This condition concerns changes in the Groups net asset value NAV, which is recognized as a key consideration for investors in the Companys shares.
NAV in this context is taken to include dividend payments to shareholders.
In addition, the Committee concluded that linking Group earnings per share EPS to the United Kingdom Retail Price Index was no longer a relevant performance measure for a company whose operations and assets lie mainly outside of the UK.
In place of the UK RPI link, we have introduced a new, cumulative three-year EPS target as described on pages 54 and 55 of this report.
The Committee also decided to introduce a clawback provision into the LTIP scheme as recommended in the Corporate Governance Code.
The annual bonus scheme includes clawback provisions.
At the end of the year, Susan Farr joined the Committee having been appointed to the Board on 12 December 2013.
Her experience and input will be valued.
Following the announcement of the Group financial results the variable remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer was considered and a bonus of 649,838 was awarded which is 67% of the maximum opportunity.
LTIP awards granted in 2011 will vest 50% as a result of the EPS growth over the three years to 31 December 2013 being 117%.
TSR performance did not meet the vesting criteria.
The Committee has decided that the salary of the Chief Executive Officer should remain unchanged at 650,000.
His current salary was set in June 2011 when he was appointed to the role.
The Board will place this report before the shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for approval and will ask the shareholders to vote for the first time on the Remuneration Policy set out herein.
45 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Remuneration Committee Report continued Our members Alexander Waugh chairs the Remuneration Committee which comprises the independent Non-Executive Directors listed in the table below.

The Remuneration Committee held 3 scheduled meetings in 2013 and a number of ad hoc meetings as required.
Attendance of the scheduled meetings is shown below: Committee members in 2013 Meetings Members Eligible to attend Attended Alexander Waugh Chairman 33 Shaukat Aziz 32 Nicholas George 33 Sean Collins 33 Susan Farr 0 0 The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are invited to attend meetings as appropriate but they are excluded when their own performance and remuneration is being discussed.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided by the Committee or involvement in the day-to-day management of the business of the Group.
Our role The Remuneration Committee has delegated authority from the Board to consider and approve the salaries, incentives and other benefit arrangements of the Chairman, Executive Directors and, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, executive management and to oversee the Groups share-based incentive arrangements.

html 46 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Governance Overview Strategic report Remuneration Committee Report Group financial statements Further information Directors remuneration policy Remuneration policy Policy for Executive Directors: Presently there is only one Executive Director, the Chief Executive Officer CEO, and a similar approach will be applied to any other Executive Directors appointed to the Board.
Base salary Purpose and link to strategy Salaries are a key component of the reward package in attracting, motivating and retaining executives.
Operation Salaries in the Group are based on the value of the individual, the level of responsibility, experience and market conditions.
Salaries are reviewed at least annually but are not necessarily increased.
In reviewing salaries, account is taken of market conditions, significant changes in role, pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group, ination and budgets.
Maximum The maximum salary payable is the amount agreed by the remuneration committee for the period.
The Committee does not prescribe a maximum salary for any employee in the Group as it wishes to retain the exibility to set levels of pay appropriate to roles and market conditions.
The establishment of maximum salaries could result in unrealistic expectations of employees and weaken the Companys negotiating position.
Annual bonus Purpose and link to strategy Executive Directors are eligible to participate in an annual bonus scheme to: U incentivise executives to drive Group strategy and performance over the short term: and U ensure that a significant proportion of the total reward of executives packages is linked to performance during the year.
Operation The performance period for annual bonuses corresponds with the financial year.
Bonus measures, weightings and targets are set annually at the start of the financial year by the Committee which retains discretion to revise any calculated bonus downwards, but not upwards, if it is felt to have become misaligned with the Groups performance.
Payment of the annual bonus is contingent on the employee still being employed by the Group at the time of vesting and not having served notice.
Annual bonus is not pensionable.
The Committee may defer and pay a proportion up to 100% of the annual bonus in shares which must be held for three years before vesting.
No performance conditions apply to such deferred bonus shares other than a requirement for continuous employment but such deferred bonus share awards would be eligible for a dividend equivalent.
In the event that annual bonuses are found to have been paid on the basis of any material misstatement of financial performance, the rules of the scheme provide for appropriate means of redress, including the adjustment of future bonuses and any unvested long-term incentive awards.
Maximum The level of bonus opportunity for Executive Directors is: Chief Executive officer Other Executive Directors Bonus as a % of base salary Threshold 0% 0% Target 75% 50% Maximum 150% 100% The maximum value of a deferred bonus share award is the value of the cash bonus that would otherwise have been paid.
1 Performance 70% of bonus potential will be linked to financial performance, with the remainder linked to personal objectives and individual contribution.
However, the Committee has discretion to vary those percentages by plus or minus 10% for any performance period to reect particular corporate objectives.
Financial measures may include, but are not limited to, operating profit, profit before tax, revenue and revenue per available room.
47 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Remuneration Committee Report continued Long-Term Incentive Plan Purpose and link to strategy The Company adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2006 which forms the long-term variable element of executive remuneration.
The Plan allows for the award of performance shares, nil cost share options and deferred bonus shares.
Performance share awards aim to drive and reward sustained performance over the long term, align the interests of executives and shareholders and support retention.
Operation Performance share awards are made annually and vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant subject to the achievement of performance conditions over three years and continued employment with the Group, subject to the rules of the plan.
The Plan provides for dividends or their equivalent to be paid.
In the event that performance shares are found to have vested on the basis of any material misstatement of financial performance, the rules of the scheme provide for appropriate means of redress, including the adjustment of future bonuses and any unvested long-term incentive awards.
Maximum The maximum value of an award of performance shares and nil cost share options is 150% of base salary, though 200% may be awarded in exceptional circumstances included but not limited to the recruitment of new Executive Directors.
The level of awards is otherwise determined by the Committee at the time of grant.
2 Performance The performance measures are Earnings per Share EPS, Relative Total Shareholder Return TSR and Net Asset Value plus dividends NAV.
The weightings applying to each performance measure may vary year-on-year reecting strategic priorities.
Whilst a number of performance measures are applied, weighting for any one measure is expected to range between 10% and 60%.
Under each measure, entry level performance will result in 25% of maximum vesting for that element, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting.
Pension Purpose and link to strategy The provision of retirement benets is an important element of executive reward packages in attracting and retaining executives and promoting long-term retirement planning.
Operation A dened cash contribution may be made into either a Company sponsored pension plan or a private pension plan or as cash in lieu of pension.
Maximum 20% of base salary and by exception up to 30% of base salary.
Other benets Purpose and link to strategy Help recruit and retain through the provision of cost effective benets consistent with market practice.
Operation Benets are determined to ensure they are competitive with market practice by location and the responsibilities of the individual.
These may comprise although are not limited to a motor vehicle and driver or an appropriate allowance, insurances for life, personal accident, disability and family medical cover.
Additional benets such as relocation, removal, tax equalisation, house purchase rental and childrens education may need to be offered to attract the right candidate in the event that an Executive Director is appointed on expatriate or international assignment terms.
Maximum There is no maximum.
The value of other benets is consistent with market practice and is kept under review by the Committee but would not be expected to exceed more than the equivalent of a months salary, other than in exceptional circumstances such as a relocation requirement.
Notes: 1 The Committee determines bonus performance measures, weightings and targets annually which are closely aligned with the Groups short-term strategic priorities.
Targets for financial measures are set by reference to the Groups budget, while the personal element of the bonus is driven by personal KPIs set at the start of the year.
2 The Committee determines the level of LTIP awards and the associated performance measures, targets and weightings annually.
The performance measures of EPS and relative TSR ensure that executives are aligned with shareholder interests and are consistent with FTSE market practice.
The introduction in 2014 of a third measure, NAV plus dividends, improves the alignment with the Groups strategic priorities by capturing a balance sheet measure.
The targets for the financial measures are set by reference to the Groups budget and strategic plans as well as taking account of broker forecasts for both the Group and other sector peers.
The TSR target measures comparative performance against a relevant benchmark which for 2014 will be split equally between the FTSE250 market index and an index of peer companies.
3 The Committee retains discretion to use 9.4.
2 2 of the Listing Rules of the UKLA to make awards in exceptional circumstances.
4 The Committee retains discretion to make non-significant changes to the remuneration policy without reverting to shareholders.

Remuneration on recruitment Reward packages for new Directors will be consistent with the policy set out in the above table, which describes each component of remuneration for the Directors of the Company.
Fixed remuneration elements would be paid only from the date of employment and any bonus will be pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year.
The maximum level of variable remuneration is as stated in the policy table above.
If, consequent to joining the Group, a new director forfeits elements of variable reward linked to their previous employment, the Committee reserves the right to make compensatory awards up to the maximum amount of the individuals loss.
Any such awards would be made taking into account the performance conditions and time horizon of the forfeited awards.
In the event that an internal candidate is appointed as an Executive Director, any contractual obligation in respect of a previous role will be honoured even if it is inconsistent with this policy at the time the obligation is fulfilled.
The Committee also reserves the right under this policy to apply listing rule 9.4.

The Senior Vice-President Global Human Resources does, however, ensure that the Committee is aware of pay and conditions throughout the Group and that these are taken into account when framing executive remuneration.
As a global group, in a sector with ready mobility, the more senior the role, the more reward needs to reflect the global market, whilst for the majority of employees it is set with greater consideration of local market conditions and practices.
The annual bonus scheme and awards under the LTIP are limited to the senior management team and those employees responsible for managing the hospitality business.
Shareholder views When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into account the views of investor representative bodies and those of its key shareholder and is committed to undertaking consultation before committing to significant changes in aspects of remuneration.

The targets set imply growth of 3% - 15% p. a. on underlying EPS.
In light of this implied growth representing a significantly higher level of stretch than FTSE market practice, the Companys strategic plan for the period, and the fact that the threshold target of 104p is slightly above current available analyst estimates, the targets are felt to be appropriately stretching and represent a similar level of difficulty to those applied historically.

The review identified a number of priorities including a requirement for additional training concerning recent changes to rules and practices around executive remuneration, a recommendation that the Committee receive more regular advice from external advisers and a request that the advice from internal advisers be more independent in nature.
These priorities will be acted upon in the forthcoming year.
Voting at 2013 AGM The 2012 Directors Remuneration Report was approved at the 2013 AGM, at which votes were cast as follows: U 73.6% for: U 26.3% against: and U 0.1% withheld.
The reason most referenced by shareholders and voting bodies for voting against the resolution to approve the remuneration report was the decision to award a discretionary bonus to the CEO.
Both the principle and the quantum of that award were raised.
Other reasons referenced were: U The CEOs total remuneration package in general: U A general concern unrelated to remuneration regarding a perceived unwillingness of the Company to address the gap between share price and NAV: U TSR performance condition not considered challenging and vesting scale not broad enough: and U Absence of any shareholding guidelines.
In response to those concerns the Committee amended the performance criteria for vesting of long-term incentive share awards and amended the weighting of the performance criteria for the annual bonus for 2014.
56 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Governance Overview Strategic report Remuneration Committee Report Group financial statements Further information Advisers The Committee regularly consults the Senior Vice President Global Human Resources and the Company Secretary.
