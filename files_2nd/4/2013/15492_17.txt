In doing so we aim to align the financial recruitment process: and interests of the executive directors and other management and Provide ongoing remuneration advice and support to the employees with the achievement of the Groups objectives.
UK Code Principles: There should be a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration and for xing the remuneration packages of individual directors.
No director should be involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.
Levels of remuneration should be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to run the company successfully, but a company should avoid paying more than is necessary for this purpose.
A signi cant proportion of executive Directors remuneration should be structured so as to link rewards to corporate and individual performance.

2 The Group aims to maintain excellent commercial relationships with its key business partners, customers and key suppliers.
In this regard the Group regularly utilises corporate hospitality at sporting and other entertainment events to build contacts and relationships.
The Committee does not consider attendance at such events by either a Director or his or her immediate family to constitute a taxable bene t of their employment with the Group.
If such attendance were determined to be a taxable bene t, the Company would cover the cost of attendance and be responsible for any tax thereon.
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of of ce including through the exercise of any discretions available to it where such terms were agreed before the policy took effect or before such individual joined the Board.
Under the deferred bonus and LTIP arrangements, awards may be increased to re ect the value of dividends that would have been paid in respect of any dates before grant and delivery of the shares.
Such shares are in addition to the stated caps.
The Committee has received advice that the new legislation requires the inclusion of caps for each element of remuneration.
In some cases, the caps have been set signi cantly higher than the current levels.
This is simply to include adequate exibility and does not represent an aspiration.
No elements of remuneration have been introduced since the prior year.

These targets have been selected as they align with key financial objectives for the year.
They are at levels considered by the Remuneration Committee to be stretching and will be published in next years report.
Consistent with our practice in prior years, the precise targets are not included in this report as both the Committee and Board consider these to be commercially sensitive with regard to the competition in the data centre market in which competitors are not required to publish such information.
The amounts payable at threshold and targets are 30% and 80% of salary respectively.
Nothing would be earned for these levels of performance under the revenue element which, as in 2013, only becomes payable for exceeding target performance.
Of amounts that become due, at least 50% will be satis ed by awards in the form of deferred shares and the balance will be satis ed in cash subject to such other arrangements as the Committee may determine appropriate in relation to leavers.
Performance measures, targets and weighting may be varied by the Remuneration Committee from year to year.
The Committee considers the set measures to be an appropriate means of measuring success and is satis ed that they do not create inappropriate incentives as regards environmental, social and governance factors.
Satisfaction of awards of annual bonus and deferred share awards granted in prior years forms part of the Companys Remuneration Policy.
72 Telecity Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Report of the Remuneration Committee continued Long-term incentive arrangements A summary of the two types of award that may be granted under the Remuneration Policy for executive Directors and other senior management is given in the table below.
Long-term incentive awards granted under the Companys previous LTIP were on a similar basis to Basic Awards under the current LTIP.
To the extent that new ordinary shares are to be issued to satisfy share awards under the new and previous LTIP and any sharesave scheme, no awards may be made if it would cause the aggregate number to be issued under those schemes during the preceding 10 years to exceed 10% of the Companys issued share capital.
This limit includes awards under any new scheme, although excludes awards made before or at the Companys IPO.
At 31 December 2013, there have been granted, and not subsequently lapsed, awards over 8,250,075 shares under these schemes, representing 4.07% of the then share capital of the Company.
In the event of a change in control, any outstanding LTIP awards will vest on a pro rata basis and subject to the application of the Committee of any performance condition on such basis as it considers appropriate.
In respect of the period between the date an award is issued and the date it is exercised the number of shares covered by such awards may be increased by up to the value of dividends as if these were reinvested in Company shares at the dates of payment.
Basic LTIP Awards Enhanced LTIP Awards Awards are made to executive Directors and senior management of the Group at the Awards may be granted on the following basis: discretion of the Committee.

The Committee considers these to represent appropriate measures of success.
Prior to 2013, awards on similar terms were granted under the Companys Performance Share Plan and satisfaction of such awards forms part of the Companys Remuneration Policy, as do prior year Basic LTIP awards.
Sharesave Scheme Awards The Group also operates an all-employee sharesave scheme.

Base salary The Committee believed it was appropriate to have salaries broadly in line with median salaries 1 of equivalent positions within the Comparator Group and has therefore increased by the level of 2.5% the salary of Michael Tobin.
This increase compares with increases, including those relating to promotions, averaging approximately 4.9% for the Groups employees generally over the past year.
Pension Company contributions to executive pension schemes or salary supplements paid in lieu are being maintained at 20% of base salary for Michael Tobin.
Bene ts Other bene ts including a car allowance of 17,800 and medical cover for Michael Tobin will remain unchanged for 2014.
These are in line with practice in comparable companies.
Annual bonus scheme In the context of no Enhanced Awards being made under the LTIP, the maximum annual bonus potential for Michael Tobin will remain at 150% of salary with the continuation of the new stretch revenue target introduced last year.
The payment for on-target performance remains, as in 2013, at 80% of salary.
The performance targets, and the proportions of the total potential payable for their achievement and overachievement are shown in the charts on page 71.
The proportion of the annual bonus to be satis ed in deferred shares is to remain at one-half of the total generally only vesting after two years.
Long-term incentives It is intended that Michael Tobin will be granted Basic Awards equivalent to 100% of salary, on similar terms and subject to the same TSR performance conditions as the basic awards in prior years.
The Committee has determined that it is unnecessary to grant Enhanced Awards to Michael Tobin this year.

Each of these measures has been rebased to 100 on 1 January 2009 with growth measured relative to this point in future periods.
For example, a reading of 200 in future years indicates a doubling of the value from 1 January 2009.
The TSR is also compared to a comparator group which, as in previous years, is the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
This is the comparator group used under our long-term incentive arrangements and therefore considered the most appropriate group against which to measure the Groups relative performance.
