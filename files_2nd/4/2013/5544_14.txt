Directors Remuneration Report Information not subject to audit: ANNUAL STATEMENT Dear Fellow Shareholders, I am pleased to introduce our Remuneration Report for the 2013 financial year.
This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the new regulations, introduced by the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills, which govern the way directors remuneration is voted upon and reported on.
The Directors Remuneration Policy will be subject to a binding shareholder vote at the forthcoming AGM, and the Annual Report on Remuneration and this Annual Statement to an advisory vote.
For the year under review, the business has made good progress, particularly given the challenging trading conditions including the adverse weather at the beginning of the year and the impact from the failure of our wines and spirits distributor.
As communicated previously to shareholders, Enterprises key strategic objectives for the 2013 financial year were to focus on improving likeforlike growth in net income and to reduce net debt through the management of cash and disposal of underperforming pubs.
In spite of the challenging conditions the business has continued to make progress, delivering likeforlike net income growth in our final quarter.
The Company has also successfully delivered on the disposal plan and that, coupled with the issuance of a new convertible bond, has resulted in a substantial reduction in the Groups bank debt position.
These achievements have been reflected in Enterprises share price, which has made significant gains over the year.
This performance has generated annual bonus payouts in the range of 29% to 31% of base salary.
The performance and matching awards granted under the longterm incentive plan LTIP in 2010 failed to meet the threshold total shareholder return TSR target and lapsed in January 2013.
The LTIP awards granted in 2011, which are based on TSR performance to January 2014, may not meet the minimum vesting target.
Ted Tuppen will be retiring from the Board at the AGM and Simon Townsend will be taking on the role of Chief Executive from that date.
Going forward there will be a reduction in the number of executive directors from three to two.
Ted will continue to be employed by the Company until at least 19 May 2014.
During the year under review, and as part of succession planning, the Remuneration Committee the Committee reviewed the appropriate package for a new Chief Executive Officer and appropriate arrangements for the possible retirement of the incumbent officer.
Details of the implications of these changes on their remuneration arrangements are set out on page 61 of the Annual Report on Remuneration.
We are not proposing any major changes to the remuneration policy for the 2014 financial year.
However, during the course of the coming year, the Committee intends to review the annual bonus and longterm incentive scheme arrangements as the current plans are due to expire in 2015.
The Committee encourages dialogue with the Companys shareholders and will consult with major shareholders ahead of any significant future changes to the remuneration policy.
We were delighted that the 2012 Directors Remuneration Report received a 99.6% vote in favour at the last AGM.
Shareholders are invited to approve the Directors Remuneration Policy, Annual Report on Remuneration and this Annual Statement at the AGM on 6 February 2014, details of which are set out on pages 119 to 124.
Susan Murray Chairman, Remuneration Committee 18 November 2013 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended.
This report sets out the Companys current remuneration policy for 2014 and beyond.
A binding resolution to approve this report will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
In terms of an approved policy, it will take effect from the date it is approved by shareholders.

indd 45 10 12 2013 14:20:02 SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION ACCOUNTS DIRECTORS REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT Directors Remuneration Report ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE The Committee is responsible for considering and making recommendations to the Board on the: general policy on executive and senior management remuneration: overall remuneration packages for executive directors including base salary, pensions, benefits and performance-related shortterm and longterm incentives: Chairmans remuneration: and design and operation of the Companys share incentive plans.
The Committee reports to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities and operates within agreed terms of reference, a copy of which is available on the Companys website or on request from the Company Secretary.
Details of the members of the Committee and of the advisers to the Committee are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 51 and 52.
Policy on executive director remuneration The Committee regularly reviews the executive directors remuneration packages to ensure that they take account of the Companys specific circumstances and are aligned to the Companys key strategic objectives as set out in the Strategic Report on pages 02 to 29.
In formulating the remuneration policy, the Committee: considers market practice both in terms of the size and structure of executive remuneration : takes into consideration pay practices elsewhere within the Company: encourages open dialogue and consults with major shareholders when looking to make material changes to the remuneration policy: and ensures, in line with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on responsible investment disclosure, that the incentive structures for executive directors do not raise any environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account ESG matters or indeed any other operational financial risks that relate to the Companys business.
The Committee continues to believe that the existing policy and approach described more fully in the policy table allows the Company to attract, retain and motivate the key individuals required to lead the business and remains both relevant and appropriate in terms of the balance between: fixed and variable pay, ensuring a significant proportion of the overall remuneration package is performancerelated: shortterm and longterm incentive pay: and cashbased and sharebased remuneration.
The Committee also believes that the performancerelated elements provide rewards which reflect an appropriate balance between the performance of the Group and individual performance and aligns the rewards of executive directors with the longterm interests of the shareholders and the Companys strategic goals.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account The Committee takes into account the views of shareholders.
When any significant changes are proposed to the remuneration policy, the Committee Chairman will inform major shareholders of these in advance, and will offer a meeting to discuss these.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years remuneration report and any matters discussed with shareholders during the year are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 60.

indd 46 10 12 2013 14:20:02 How employees pay is taken into account The Committee liaises with senior managers in the Group to ensure pay and employment conditions e. g. base salary levels and increases, pension provision, the structure of annual bonuses and longterm incentive provision of the wider Group as a whole are taken into account when framing the executive remuneration policy.
However, the Committee has not specifically consulted with employees when drawing up the policy or used any remuneration comparison measures between directors and employees.
Remuneration policy at a glance The charts below illustrate the potential future remuneration of the new Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer based on the arrangements that may apply from the date of the 2014 AGM the date that an approved remuneration policy would take effect.
They show that the performancerelated elements of the package comprise a very significant portion of the executive directors total remuneration.

The values assume a constant share price and do not take into account possible share price appreciation or dividends dividend equivalents that may be received on the share awards and therefore the amounts that ultimately vest to directors under the deferred bonus, performance and matching share arrangement may be higher or lower than that set out above.
The potential monetary rewards available for ontarget performance under the annual bonus and LTIP are provided for illustration only and do not reflect formal policy decisions that these amounts are received.
Salary levels on which other elements of the package are calculated are based on those applying from 6 February 2014 onwards 460,000 for Simon Townsend and 375,000 for Neil Smith.
The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost of supplying those benefits as disclosed for the year ended 30 September 2013.
The executive directors can also participate in all employee share schemes on the same basis as other employees.
The value that may be received under these schemes is subject to tax approved limits.
For simplicity, the value that may be received from participating in these schemes has been excluded from the above charts.

indd 49 10 12 2013 14:20:03 SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION ACCOUNTS DIRECTORS REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT Directors Remuneration Report Notes to the policy table: Choice of performance measures The annual bonus is based on a mix of financial and individual strategic targets.
The measures are based on the financial, operational and strategic priorities of the business and may vary from year to year as appropriate to reflect the changing needs of the business.
A sliding scale of targets is set for the financial measures so as to drive significant improvements in business performance.
TSR has been chosen as the performance measure for the performance shares and matching awards as it aligns the interests of management with the returns received by shareholders.
The TSR target has been set so as to require outperformance compared with the relevant comparator group.
Interaction with the policy for employee pay There are some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for the executive directors as set out above compared with that for other employees within the organisation.
This reflects differing levels of seniority and responsibility.
For example, there is an increased emphasis on performance-related pay for executive directors through a higher annual bonus opportunity and participation in the LTIP.
This aligns the interests of directors with the longterm performance of the Company and the interests of shareholders.
Service contracts It is the Companys policy that the period of notice for executive directors will not exceed 12 months and accordingly, the employment contracts of the executive directors are terminable on 12 months notice by either party.
The Company may terminate a directors employment without notice or compensation in the event of gross misconduct.
In the event of a directors departure, the Companys policy on termination payments is as follows: the Company will pay any amounts it is required to make in accordance with or in settlement of a directors statutory employment rights: the Company may pay salary, benefits and pension in lieu of notice and observe the other contractual entitlements of a director: the Company will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is warranted in each individual case and the Company will seek to apply the principles of mitigation to any proposed payment: there is no entitlement to bonus paid or associated deferred shares following notice of termination or cessation of employment and bad leavers will not receive any bonus in such circumstances.
However, the Committees normal policy is that where the individual is considered a good leaver, a performancerelated and time prorated bonus may be paid.
The performance measures used to determine the bonus payment may be on a different basis to that applying to the other executive directors depending on the timing and circumstances of the directors departure.
Time prorating will be based on the proportion of the bonus year for which the individual is employed and the bonus if any will be paid at the normal time.
If at the time the bonus is paid, the individual is under notice or has left employment, all of the bonus may be payable in cash: in the event of a directors departure, any outstanding share awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment under the LTIP and Deferred Share Award is that any outstanding awards will lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances such as death, injury, retirement, transfer of the employing company or business out of the Group, and any other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee taking into account the individuals performance and reasons for their departure good leaver status may be applied.
A good leavers unvested deferred shares and LTIP awards where the performance period has already ended will fully vest on leaving and be exercisable for 30 months but no later than the last date a remaining employee could exercise the award.
A good leaver will normally receive a prorated proportion of any outstanding LTIP awards prorated from the date of grant to the date of cessation of employment, normally subject to performance over the usual 3 year period and to be exercisable within 30 months of vesting but no later than the last date a remaining employee could exercise the award.
Exceptionally the Committee may decide to measure performance over a shorter period to the end of employment and may waive in whole, or in part, pro rating, but this would only be in exceptional circumstances: no LTIP awards will be made to someone who is due to leave within 6 months after the date the awards would be granted: and the Company may enable the provision of outplacement services to a departing director, where appropriate.
The contracts of the executive directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the Company or for liquidated damages.

indd 50 10 12 2013 14:20:03 Approach to recruitment and promotions The remuneration package for a new executive director will be set in accordance with the Companys approved remuneration policy as set out on page 46, subject to the discretions set out below.
The maximum level of variable remuneration that may be offered under the approved policy is 325% of salary.
In relation to the bonus, different targets may be set to those applying to the other executive directors in the first year of appointment, to reflect the point in the year when the individual joins and their specific responsibilities.
In addition, the Committee may offer further cash, benefit and or sharebased elements including awards under 9.4.
2 R of the Listing Rules as necessary to secure an appointment any such payments would take account of the remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer, for example, reflecting the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay or benefit element granted in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out or be provided according to its terms.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval at the next AGM.
The salary level for a new appointment will be set taking into account the individuals experience, the nature of the role being offered and their existing remuneration package.
Relocation expenses or allowances may be paid as appropriate.
Chairman and nonexecutive directors All nonexecutive directors have letters of appointment, the terms of which take into account best practice.
Their respective appointments continue on an annual basis from AGM to AGM, subject to reelection.
There are no special provisions in the nonexecutive directors letters of appointment for compensation in the event of loss of office.
A summary of the letters of appointment for nonexecutive directors is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 60.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports.
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise as required under the regulations.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION This Annual Report on Remuneration sets out how the Companys remuneration policy for directors was implemented during the year under review.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended and 9.8.
An advisory resolution to approve this report will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
The information on pages 52 to 58 as indicated has been audited.

Aon plc did not provide any other services to the Company during the year under review.
NBS is appointed by the Committee as its independent adviser.
NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Code of Conduct.
During the year, the Chairman of the Committee considered NBSs performance, in terms of the quality and independence of its advice, the potential for conflicts of interest which are actively managed within Aon plc and its knowledge and understanding of market practice.
Having reviewed these factors, the Committee chose to retain NBS as its adviser.
The total fees paid to NBS in respect of its services to the Committee during the year were 67,173.
The fees charged for major projects are normally negotiated in advance of the work being undertaken.
However, an element of the fees relates to sundry ongoing advice, in line with NBSs role to provide ongoing support to the Committee over the entire remuneration year and are predominantly charged on a time spent basis.
Fees for the chairman and nonexecutive directors The fee policy for the Chairman and nonexecutive directors for the year under review was as follows: Chairman 200,000 Base Board fee 55,500 Additional fees for chairing the Audit or Remuneration Committee 6,000 Additional fees for the Senior Independent Directorship 2,000 The following information has been subject to audit: REMUNERATION OUTCOMES DURING 2013 The table below sets out the remuneration received receivable in relation to the year ended 30 September 2013.

The bonuses were payable based on EPS performance and individual strategic targets.
Bonus payouts ranged from 29% to 31% of salary.
The bonuses are payable in a mixture of cash and deferred shares.
With the agreement of the Committee, Ted Tuppen and Simon Townsend have elected to take 100% of the bonus as deferred shares 2012: 100%, with Neil Smith electing to take 60% cash and 40% as deferred shares 2012: 60% and 40%.
The deferred shares vest after three years and are not subject to any further performance conditions.
Details of the awards made under the Bonus Plan are shown on pages 53 and 54. iv The performance period for the 2009 performance and matching awards ended on 7 January 2013.
The award was subject to a TSR performance condition and Enterprises TSR underperformed that of the FTSE250, therefore the awards lapsed.
v The SIP is an all employee share plan under which the Company matched on a two for one basis shares purchased up to a value of 1,500.
The two for one basis used in 2013 values the matching shares at the date of grant at 3,000.
Continued employment and a three year holding period applies to the matching element.
vi Robert Walker was appointed to the Board on 9 February 2012. vii Hubert Reid retired from the Board on 31 March 2012. viii David Harding retired from the Board on 31 January 2013. ix Peter Baguley was appointed to the Board on 31 January 2013.
Annual bonus 2013 The annual bonus plan the Bonus Plan has operated in its current form since 2005.
Awards under the Bonus Plan are subject to demanding performance targets.
For the year under review, 80% of the executive directors bonus was subject to a sliding scale of challenging annual adjusted basic EPS targets, with 20% subject to challenging individual strategic targets, although no bonus is payable under this element of the Bonus Plan unless a threshold level of adjusted EPS performance is delivered.
60% of any bonus earned is paid in cash, with at least 40% deferred into shares executive directors can choose to voluntarily defer more of the award into shares if they so wish.
A clawback provision has been established under which the Committee can seek appropriate means of redress in the event of material misconduct, material misstatement of results, and an error in the calculation or due to poor information used when calculating the reward outcome.
Redress can be sought through: i the lapsing of unvested Deferred Share Awards, which may result in a corresponding lapse of matching share awards under the LTIP: ii a reduction in future bonus payouts: and iii the reclaim of previously paid bonuses net of tax.
The adjusted EPS targets for the Bonus Plan were set at the beginning of the year and reflected the outlook at that time, taking into account the Companys plans to generate cash and pay down debt.
The targets for the proportion of the bonus based on EPS are set out in the table below.
For performance between the EPS targets specified, a straightline sliding scale applies.
Award level % salary EPS Below threshold 0% Less than 19.0p Threshold 16% 19.0p Target 40% 19.6p Maximum 80% 22.3p Actual Performance 16% 19.0p Each executive director was given a number of different personal and strategic objectives individually tailored to their role and the needs of the business in the year now under review.
Different weightings were applied to each objective.
The precise objectives and weightings are considered by the Company to be commercially sensitive.
In summary the objectives included: property management development of the portfolio, delivery of growth and return on capital, pub operations like-for-like net income growth, service culture and compliance, capital structure strategy for debt reduction and cash management, commercial customer interfaces and margin management and people development of the senior team.
The achievements against objectives were considered carefully by the Committee and weightings given to each individual component.
In total, payments of between 13% and 15% of salary were generated out of a maximum of 20% of salary.

As explained in the 2012 Remuneration Report, this figure was previously based on an estimated market value of shares.
iii The share price at which the number of deferred shares granted under the Bonus Plan is calculated will not be confirmed until after the date of approval of the accounts.
The number of deferred shares awarded for the 2013 financial year is therefore estimated by using the midmarket price of the shares on 30 September 2013, being 144.50 pence.
The number of shares granted along with the grant and exercise dates will therefore be revised to reflect the result on the actual date of grant.

Under the LTIP, two types of award can be made: an award of performance shares, worth up to 150% of salary each year: and an award of matching shares linked to the coinvestment of up to 25% of salary in investment shares, which are then matched on a 2:1 basis.
Shares that count as investment shares are: shares subject to a Deferred Share Award under the Bonus Plan: and shares acquired by participants using their cash bonus or other funds, up to a maximum of 25% of salary.

ii Plan Year 2010 The performance condition for the 2010 award is the same as for the 2009 award.
As with previous LTIP awards, vesting occurs in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant.
In addition, irrespective of the Companys TSR performance, awards will only vest if the Committee is satisfied that the TSR result is reflective of the Companys underlying financial performance over the relevant period.
Based on performance to 30 September 2013, the award may not meet the minimum vesting hurdle.
iii Plan Year 2011 and 2012 The performance conditions applying to the 2011 and 2012 awards are solely based on relative TSR performance, which compares the Companys TSR performance over the three year period commencing on the date of grant with the TSR of the FTSE250 as at the date of grant as follows: Companys TSR ranking v the FTSE250 Percentage of performance Level of matching share award matching over the three year performance period share award that vests award shares : investment shares Below median 0% 0:1 Median 0% 0:1 Upper quintile 100% 2:1 Straight-line vesting will occur if the Companys TSR ranking is between the median and upper quintile.
iv The 2010 and 2012 LTIP awards are based on a policy of using a 5 day average share price following the date of the announcement of the results for that year to determine the number of shares comprising the LTIP award.
This was 76.3p for the awards granted in December 2012 and 104.3p for 2010.
The 2011 LTIP award is based on a notional share price of 86.1p.
v Of the 503,355 shares awarded to Neil Smith, 167,785 of the shares were subject to the additional condition requiring him to acquire up to 83,892 shares by 20 January 2014.

Directors share interests The Committee has introduced share ownership guidelines for the executive directors which require them to build up and retain a holding of shares equal in value to their base salaries.
Executives are expected to build up the required shareholding by the later of: i the fifth anniversary of the introduction of the guidelines in 2011: and ii the fifth anniversary of them joining the Board: and they are required to retain 50% of the net of tax vested awards under the LTIP and or Deferred Share Awards until the guidelines are met.
The directors either already hold the required shareholdings under the guidelines or are not yet at the anniversary dates for them to do so.

indd 60 10 12 2013 14:20:05 APPLICATION OF THE POLICY FOR 2014 Base salaries and fees The Committee has reviewed the salaries for the executive directors, including Ted Tuppen, in light of the proposed changes to the Board structure.
Taking account of the factors set out in the policy report relevant to base salaries, the Committee has determined that the following salaries will take effect from the AGM date: Simon Townsend 460,000 Neil Smith 375,000 There are no changes to the base salary of Ted Tuppen or to the fees for the Chairman and nonexecutive directors.
The fee policy is as set out on page 52.
Annual bonus 2014 The Bonus Plan for the 2014 financial year will remain largely unchanged from the 2013 financial year.
The normal maximum bonus opportunity for all executive directors continues to be 100% of salary: 80% of the award will be subject to a sliding scale of adjusted basic EPS targets and 20% will be subject to personal and strategic targets.
The Committee considers that the forward looking EPS targets are commercially sensitive and has therefore chosen not to disclose them in advance.
Details of the targets will be set out retrospectively in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
However, the targets are considered to be demanding in the context of the Companys circumstances.
Performance and matching shares 2014 The performance and matching shares granted in December 2013 will be subject to a relative TSR performance condition using the same approach as for this years awards.
The intended grant level for the performance shares will be 100% of salary and the matching shares at up to a 2:1 ratio will be awarded in proportion to the shares worth up to 25% of salary acquired with the deferred bonus.
Ted Tuppens retirement from the Board On 18 November 2013, Ted Tuppen gave 12 months notice to the Board of his intention to retire.
Since a successor has been appointed, the Board has decided that he will retire as Chief Executive Officer on 6 February 2014 after the AGM on that day, allowing Simon Townsend to take over the role from that date.
Ted will continue as an employee until at least 19 May 2014, or later at the request of the Board, and will be engaged in, amongst other things, the orderly handover to the newly appointed Chief Executive Officer and matters arising in relation to the Government Consultation into pub companies.
He will be paid salary, benefits and pension in lieu of notice for any period after he leaves employment until 18 November 2014.
He will be eligible for a prorata bonus for the period from 1 October 2013 up until the date he leaves the Company and this will be based on personal objectives and EPS subject to achieving the threshold EPS target set in the bonus plan for 2014.
This will be paid in cash or deferred shares on the normal payment date.
As a retiree, he will be treated as a good leaver under the share scheme rules.
His outstanding deferred share bonus awards will vest on departure and the LTIP awards will vest subject to performance and time prorating and in accordance with the scheme rules.
Ted will not be granted any further performance share or matching awards, other than any awarded under all employee Share Incentive Plans, during 2013 or 2014.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the directors have prepared the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Companys and the Groups transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are also responsible for preparing the Directors Report including the Corporate Governance Report, Directors Remuneration Report in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable regulations, including the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Companys website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are disclosed on page 34, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge: the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and result of the Group: and the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Board considers the report and accounts, taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable and that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Companys performance, business model and strategy.
