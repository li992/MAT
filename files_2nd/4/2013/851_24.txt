Selection of performance targets Financial performance targets under the annual bonus plan are set so that the target level of bonus is paid normally for achieving the companys short-range plan.
To achieve maximum bonus, higher targets have to be met.
In determining targets, the committee takes account of the general business circumstances including the perceived difficulty inherent in the short-range plan and the need to balance stretch against risk.
The additional stretch bonus is subject to a profit target and only begins to be earned for performance that exceeds the maximum target that applies to other executives.
Profit is chosen as the most appropriate measure of the companys short-term performance and the cash measures are chosen both to reflect the conversion of profit to cash and the management of cash flow across the year.

66 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2013 Overview Strategic report Governance Financials Policy on notice and payment for loss of office Newly appointed executive directors will be employed on contracts that include the following provisions: The individual will be required to give six months notice if they wish to leave and the company will give up to 12 months notice of termination other than for gross misconduct or other circumstances where employment may be terminated without notice At the companys discretion, the individual may be placed on garden leave for some or all of the period between the giving of notice and termination in which case the company will continue to pay salary and benefits for the garden leave period but will not make new share or other incentive awards At any time, at the companys discretion, employment may be terminated before the end of the required notice period by making a payment in lieu of the balance and subject to mitigation as described more fully in the table below.
In the event of long-term incapacity, employment would not normally be terminated so long as the executive was entitled to payments under the companys group income protection insurance arrangements but the executive would be required to stand down from their role and as a director.
Payment for loss of office will be determined according to the following principles set out below and, for the current executive directors, having regard to their existing contractual terms as described following the table.
Notice The executive will receive base salary, pension and other benefits for any part of the notice period worked and any period of garden leave.
On termination, the executive will be entitled to payment for any accrued but untaken holiday pay.
The company may elect to pay a sum in lieu of notice for all or any part of the notice period, calculated by reference to the value of salary, pension and other contractual benefits excluding bonus.
In determining the payments to be made and the structure of such payments, the company will have regard to the executives ability to mitigate their loss.
In respect of any defined benefit pension rights, an augmentation of benefits for the relevant part of the notice period may be made.
The committee has discretion to continue to provide certain benefits to the end of the notice period rather than including them in the payment in lieu.
Where the employment is being terminated by the company for gross misconduct or other circumstances entitling the company to treat the contract as at an immediate end termination will be immediate and no payment in lieu of notice will be made.
Annual No bonus will be paid in the event of termination for gross misconduct.
bonus In all other circumstances, the committee will consider whether it is appropriate to make a bonus payment for the year in question taking into account all relevant circumstances, including performance and conduct.
Payment will usually be determined and paid in cash at the normal time.
Deferred Deferred bonus will be forfeit in the event of termination for gross misconduct.
bonus from In the case of death it will be paid in full to the estate as soon as practicable thereafter.
prior years In other circumstances, it may be paid at the normal time at the committees discretion depending on the circumstances of termination.
Performance All unvested awards will lapse on leaving in the event of termination for gross misconduct or other bad leaver Share Plan circumstances and any investment shares will be released.
An example of a bad leaver would be an individual resigning in order to take up a position with a competitor.
Awards will immediately vest in full in the event of death.
In other cases, unvested basic awards will be pro-rated for service, which may include any period for which payment was made in lieu.
Provided the associated investment shares remain lodged, matched awards will normally beretained in full unless the committee decide to pro-rate for service.
A further reduction may be made at the committees discretion to take account of relevant circumstances at the time of leaving.
The retained awards will vest in the normal way, taking account of the relevant performance conditions, and at the normal time subject to the committee being satisfied at that time that the individual remains a good leaver.
AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2013 67 Directors remuneration report continued Remuneration policy continued Policy on notice and payment forlossofoffice continued Other Redundancy pay in line with statutory provisions or those applying to employees generally in the country in which the director is based will be provided in the event of termination due to redundancy.
The cost of legal, tax or other advice incurred by the individual in connection with the termination and or support with seeking alternative employment may be met up to a maximum of 100,000.
Additional payments may be made where required to settle legal disputes or as consideration for new or amended post-employment restrictions.
Where an individual is in receipt of relocation or expatriation benefits, the costs of actual expenses incurred in relation to any arrangements that are subject to term contracts may continue to be reimbursed for up to six months or, at the companys discretion, a one-off payment made to cover the costs of premature cancellation.
Thecost of repatriation will also be covered where this was part of the original expatriation terms.
Sharesave options lapse unless the director leaves because of specified good leaver reasons in which case theycan be exercised for a limited period, to the extent of savings made to the date of exercise.
Samir Brikho and Ian McHoul are both employed under contracts dated April 2007 and September 2008 respectively with notice periods of twelve months from the company and which require them to give six months notice of resignation.
The contracts permit for payment to be made in lieu of all or part of the required notice period at the companys discretion but there is no prescribed methodology for calculating such payment in lieu or applying mitigation.
Should circumstances arise where notice is given and the executive is not required to work all or part of the notice period, the terms of the existing contracts would be honoured.
The individuals may be placed on garden leave for part of the notice period in which case the committee may determine that it is appropriate to pay an element of bonus for that garden leave period.
Existing directors service contracts The notice provisions for Samir Brikho and Ian McHoul are described above.
There are no specified change-of-control provisions.
The Chairmans engagement may be terminated on six months notice on either side.
The contracts of non-executive directors may be terminated by the individual at any time.
There are no specific provisionsfor compensation in the event of early termination by the company.
As noted on page 80, our practice is that alldirectors submit themselves for re-election on an annual basis, in line with the recommendations in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in company and shareholder views Our approach to the annual review of base salaries is to take account of personal performance, company performance, and pay levels more broadly within the company.
The increases for 2014 are within the range of increases awarded to AMEC staff in the UK generally.
External benchmarking is also taken into account, particularly for new appointments.
Any proposals to change remuneration policy are considered against the best practice guidelines produced by shareholder bodies and major shareholders are consulted directly when formulating any proposals for significant changes.
The committee did consider these guidelines as well as representations made by certain individual shareholders in formulating its policy.
There was no direct consultation with employees.
The Chairman of the company and the Chairman of the remuneration committee make themselves available at any time and also at each annual general meeting to discuss any issues raised.
Differences in policy for directors compared to other employees The structure of remuneration for executive directors is in line with other senior management.
The primary differences compared to other employees are the structure of variable pay, which for senior management is in the form of performance-related incentives and for other employees is largely in the form of overtime and allowances reflecting thedifferent emphases of the roles, and in the level of accrual under defined benefit arrangements.

The committee has discretion to take other factors into account and uses its judgement in determining the amount to be paid under this item.
None of the bonus earned for 2013 is subject to compulsory deferral, as the EBITA additional stretch minimum target wasnot met.
The original EBITA targets were adjusted to remove a provision for contribution from small acquisitions, following a change of priorities.
Performance Share Plan The LTIP amount shown in the 2013 single total figure of remuneration on page 71 is the award made under the Performance Share Plan in 2011.
Vesting does not take place until April 2014 and is subject to two performance conditions each measured over three-year periods: i earnings per share EPS growth between 2010 and 2013 and ii total shareholder return relative to a comparator group based on average share prices in the first quarter of 2014 compared tothose in the corresponding period in 2011 also subject to the committee being satisfied that there has been sustained financial growth of the company.
The two performance conditions operate independently on different parts of the award: half of the basic award is dependent on EPS and the other half on TSR: the matched award depends solely on EPS.
EPS for this measure means the diluted earnings per share expressed to one decimal place of AMEC plc before goodwill and intangible amortisation, the charge or credits associated with executive share awards and exceptional items.
Real growth means in excess of the changein the UK Retail Prices Index for December 2013 compared to December 2010.
The committee took account of the share buyback that took place during 2012 and 2013 in determining the outcome for the EPS element.
As the performance period for the TSR element has not yet been completed at the time of writing of this report, an estimated outcome has been used based on the average share price in the period 1 January to 31 January 2014.
The performance achieved against the EPS target and the estimated TSR outcome are as follows: Threshold Maximum Percentage of 2011 awards performance measure 25% vesting 100% vesting Outcome max achieved Real annual compound growth in EPS 5% 12% 5.1% Actual 25.6% Total shareholder return ranking Median Upper quartile 35th percentile 0% Estimated 72 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2013 Overview Strategic report Governance Financials The number of shares vesting based on the performance outcomes will be increased by 11.2 per cent to take account ofreinvested dividends during the period from award to vesting.
As the awards have not yet vested, the average share price in the final quarter of 2013 11.19 has been applied to the estimated vesting percentage to determine the value ofthe LTIP amount included in the single figure as set out below: Basic award Matched award Basic award vesting percentage vesting percentage Estimated total Estimated number of including dividend Matched award including dividend number of vesting value 2011 PSP awards shares adjustment number of shares adjustment shares vesting 000 Samir Brikho 128,533 14.24% 56,162 28.47% 34,282 384 Ian McHoul 71,449 14.24% 31,218 28.47% 19,056 213 The actual vesting outcome and value may be different to this and will be confirmed in next years report.
These awards were originally made as restricted shares but were amended during 2013 to be awards in the form of nil cost options with an 18-month exercise period post-vesting.
If the option has not been exercised before the end of that period, it will be exercised automatically at that stage.
The LTIP amount shown in the 2012 single total figure of remuneration on page 71 is the award made under the Performance Share Plan in 2010 that vested in April 2013.
The performance measures for these awards were the same as for those made in 2011 but in this case the full award was subject to both EPS and TSR each applying to half of the award and there was no adjustment for reinvested dividends.
The targets set and the outcomes against them were asfollows: Threshold Maximum Percentage of 2010 awards performance measure 25% vesting 100% vesting Outcome max achieved Real annual compound growth in EPS 3% 10% 14.5% 100% Total shareholder return ranking Median Upper quartile 36th percentile Nil 17 out of 26 Overall 50% The vesting values during 2013, including that to a former director, are set out below.

The TSR measure is based on AMECs ranking against the comparator group set out below based on the average share price over the final quarter of 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2012.
The threshold for any vesting to occur isthat AMEC needs to be ranked at median or higher.
If upper quartile ranking is achieved, full vesting will occur.
Vesting is on a straight line basis between these threshold and maximum targets.
