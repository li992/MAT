9.7 Details of directors service contracts The Executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment.
It is the Groups policy that executive directors should have 12-month rolling service contracts providing for a maximum of one years notice.
Due to the nature of the Groups businesses, the service contracts contain restrictive covenants.
The principal terms of the Executive Directors service contracts which have no fixed term effective during the year were as follows: Executive Directors service contracts Name of director Date of contract Notice period 2 April 1993 amended 26 January 1996 12 months Sir Brian Souter 8 August 2000 amended 29 November 2001 and 10 April 2003.
12 months Martin Griffiths Martin Griffiths entered into a new executive directors service contract on 22 February 2013, effective 1 May 2013 for his assumption to the role of Chief Executive, under which his annual basic salary for the 2013 14 year will be 600,000.
Other provisions, including a 12-month notice period are consistent with his current terms and conditions and comply with this Policy Report.
Ross Paterson assumed the role of Finance Director on 1 May 2013 and entered into an executive directors service contract dated 11 February 2013, under which his annual basic salary increased to 400,000 per annum, and the terms of which are consistent with and comply with this Policy Report.
The new contracts for the Chairman and Deputy Chairman effective of 1 May 2013 provide for six and three months notice periods respectively.
Other nonexecutive directors are appointed by a letter, which provide for one months notice.
The letters of appointment do not contain any contractual entitlement to a termination payment and the directors can be removed in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
9.8 Loss of office payment policy The Groups policy is to make severance payments on termination in line with any pre-established contractual arrangements.
If the Group terminates an executive directors contract, the costs for which the Group is liable will vary depending on length of service.
Service contracts provide that an executive director shall give and shall receive 12 months notice on termination.
The contracts also contain standard garden leave provisions which the Group can enforce in order to protect the Groups interests during a period of notice.
An executive would continue to be paid his basic salary and contractual benefits during any period of garden leave in the usual way save that he will not be entitled to receive awards under the EPP or the LTIP or similar, and any bonus in respect of any period of garden leave would be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee considering the specific circumstances.
In any event, the Remuneration Committee can decide that no such bonus will be payable if and to the extent it reasonably considers that the payment of a bonus could be perceived as a reward for failure.
There are no arrangements to require the enhancement or acceleration of pension benefits on termination or early retirement.
In the case of gross misconduct by an executive director, a provision is included in the executives contract for immediate dismissal with no compensation payable.
In the event an executive director leaves for reasons of death, ill-health, injury, redundancy, retirement with the agreement of the Group, or his employing company ceasing to be a member of the Group or other such event as the Remuneration Committee determines, then LTIP awards will be pro-rated for time and will vest based on performance over the performance period as determined by the rules of the LTIP.
For all other leavers, outstanding LTIP awards will normally lapse.
In the event an executive director leaves for reasons of death, ill-health, injury, redundancy, or his employing company ceasing to be a member of the Group, then deferred EPP awards will vest at the date of leaving for the benefit of the director.
If an executive director retires with the agreement of the Company, retirement is not a vesting event for the EPP, and so the awards will vest on their original vesting date.
In the event an executive director leaves for reasons of death, ill-health, injury, redundancy, retirement, or his employing company ceasing to be a member of the Group, then shares held under any BAYE awards will vest in accordance with the HMRC approved rules of the Scheme.
The following apply where there is a change in control of the Group: The Executive Directors are entitled to normal termination benefits as outlined above, except where the director is offered and has refused employment on terms and conditions that were no less favourable to those in place prior to the change of control: under the EPP, deferred shares would automatically vest on a change of control: under the LTIP, Incentive Units would vest on a pro-rata basis taking account of the proportion of the vesting period that had expired and the TSR performance condition.
under the BAYE, shares would be settled either as a cash benefit or by replacement shares depending on the nature of the consideration giving rise to the change of control in accordance with HMRC approved rules.

9.10 External appointments It is the Boards policy to allow the Executive Directors to accept directorships of other quoted companies as this will broaden and enrich the business skills of the directors.
Any such directorships must be formally approved by the Board.
The number of paid directorships should not exceed two and the time commitments should not have any detrimental impact on the ability of the director to fully fulfill his duties.
Details of external directorships held by the Executive Directors during the year ended 30 April 2013, together with the fees retained are as follows: Executive Director Company Role held Fees retained in respect of the year ended 30 April 2013 Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited Co-Chairman Nil Martin Griffiths Robert Walters plc Senior Independent Non-executive Director will step 62,400 down from role with effect from 1 August 2013 AG Barr plc Non-Executive Director 42,847 Implementation Report This section of the remuneration report provides details of how the remuneration policy was implemented during the year ended 30 April 2013.
9.11 Committee members The Remuneration Committee is composed of three independent Non-executive Directors who met three times during the year.
Attendance at meetings by individual members is detailed in section 5.9.
No Director is present when his own remuneration is being discussed.
The members of the Committee during the year ended 30 April 2013 and at the date of this report were: Phil White Chairman Garry Watts Will Whitehorn 9.12 Advisers The Committee retained Addleshaw Goddard LLP as its remuneration consultant to provide access to independent research and advice.

9.16 Pensions audited Under the terms of their service agreements, the Executive Directors are entitled to become members of one of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes or, if preferred, to receive payment of a proportion of salary for personal pension arrangements.
Defined benefit pensions may be accrued either under the HMRC approved pension scheme or the Groups funded pension arrangements.
For pension purposes, the Executive Directors have a normal retirement age of 60 and in accordance with HMRC rules accrued defined benefits may not be drawn before age 55.
Martin Griffiths ceased annual benefit accrual under the HMRC approved scheme in March 2012 and thereafter from 1 May 2012 accrued benefits under the Group funded pension arrangements.
Sir Brian Souter drew his accrued benefits from the approved scheme on a discounted basis in November 2011, and thereafter and only until 30 April 2012 accrued benefits under the Groups funded pension arrangements.
For the current year, 2012 13, he received a cash payment of 33.3% of his basic salary in lieu of further pension provision as included within Table 1 in section 9.13.
Life assurance of four times basic annual salary is provided under the arrangements for pension benefits.
Table 2 below shows benefits accruing during the year under the Groups funded pension arrangements.

9.17 Share based payments audited 9.17.1 Long Term Incentive Plan To be used for the Executive Directors and a select number of senior executives, the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan was approved at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
The LTIP introduces a stringent performance condition related to total shareholder return TSR over a three-year assessment period.
TSR is calculated as the movement in share value after taking account of re-invested dividends.
TSR is measured against a comparator group, which is the list of FTSE 250 companies.
Under the LTIP, executives are awarded Incentive Units at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee with each Incentive Unit having a nominal value equal to one of the Companys ordinary shares.
The maximum awards granted in relation to any financial year for an individual is limited to Incentive Units with an aggregate value at the time of award, not exceeding 1.5 times the individuals basic salary and for this purpose, the value of one Incentive Unit equals the market value of one ordinary share.
The Groups approach has been to settle all such awards in cash but it would support the settlement in shares including via an employee share ownership trust where executives wish to increase their holdings in the Companys shares.
The individual would also need to remain with the Company for three years from the date of an award in order to receive full entitlement to the LTIP units.
The number of Incentive Units that would be released after the three years is calculated as follows: If TSR exceeds the median of the comparator group, then only one-sixth 16.67% of the Incentive Units awarded will be released: For 100% of the Incentive Units awarded to be released then the TSR must be in the top decile of the comparator group: If TSR is higher than the median but less than the top decile then the proportion of Incentive Units to be released would be between 16.67% and 100% of the Incentive Units awarded depending on the actual ranking against the comparator group.
In addition the Committee has the authority to reduce any awards if it is not satisfied that the TSR performance is consistent with the underlying financial performance of the Group.
An independent third party calculates the TSR measures for the purposes of determining the extent to which the performance condition is satisfied.
Other than on retirement, if participants choose to leave the Group, the awards would lapse.
Given the successful operation of the LTIP since it was approved by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting to run for a period of 10 years through to 2015, it is proposed to seek shareholder approval at the 2013 Annual General Meeting to: i extend the term of the LTIP for 10 years to 2023: ii update clawback malus provisions for current practice to reduce or cancel awards in appropriate circumstances: and iii increase the flexibility to satisfy awards through the issue of shares, within ABI guidelines on the limits for satisfying awards with shares 5% in any 10 year period.
Stagecoach Group plc | page 47 96142 STC Front PRINT 96142 STC Front V14 02 07 2013 11:03 Page 48 Directors remuneration report Details of LTIP awards made to the directors are shown below.
Under the rules of the Scheme, LTIP awards vested on Sir Brian Souters retirement as Chief Executive on 30 April 2013.
An independent assessment of the performance criteria determined that three of LTIP awards vested having achieved TSR rankings and Total Shareholder Returns over the relevant performance period as follows: Grant TSR Rank Cumm.
TSR over % Award Date out of 250 performance period Released 28 Jun 10 72 38.73% 40.56% 09 Dec 10 45 55.78% 55.56% 30 Jun 11 61 12.34% 23.33% The performance conditions of the LTIP Awards require that where the awards vested part way through a three-year performance period, such as on retirement, any payout on the awards is restricted on a pro-rata time basis with credit only given for completed years within the performance period, and that the performance assessment period is then similarly restricted to complete anniversary years only from the award date.
As such the payout on the 2010 Awards noted above were subject to a one-third reduction and the 2011 Award was subject to two-thirds reduction resulting in the percentage of awards being released on vesting as noted above.
9.17.2 Executive Participation Plan The 2005 Executive Participation Plan was approved at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
The intention of the use of the EPP is to further align the interests of managers with shareholders by ensuring managers have a greater direct interest in the performance of the Groups shares purchased out of an element of their bonus awards.
The EPP is such that the executives can benefit from both capital growth i. e. increases in share price and dividend yield.
The EPP is also designed to provide an incentive for managers to remain with the Group and forms a core part of the Groups succession and management development plans.
Awards under the EPP can be made to the Executive Directors and other managers.
Participants are required to sacrifice part of their actual annual bonus award and are awarded deferred shares with an initial market value approximately equal to the amount of the actual cash bonus foregone.
Absolute and full entitlement to the shares is deferred for three years.
There are no specific performance conditions attaching to the release of deferred shares because the annual bonus is already subject to performance conditions and there are no awards of matching shares in respect of annual bonuses - the EPP requires executives to invest an element of their annual bonus normally a minimum of 50% of any annual bonus award in the Companys shares.
The EPP is an effective retention programme in that participants would lose their entitlement to the deferred shares if they left of their own volition, other than by retirement, during the three-year deferral period.
Given the successful operation of the EPP since it was approved by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting to run for a period of 10 years through to 2015, it is proposed to seek shareholder approval at the 2013 Annual General Meeting to: i extend the term of the EPP for 10 years to 2023: ii update clawback malus provisions for current practice to reduce or cancel awards in appropriate circumstances: and iii increase the flexibility to satisfy awards through the issue of shares, within ABI guidelines on the limits for satisfying awards with shares 5% in any 10 year period.

As the revised deferred vesting date was within a close period, the expected vesting date has been extended to the first available date after the announcement of the Groups preliminary results for the year ended 30 April 2013.
9.17.3 Buy As You Earn BAYE Scheme The introduction of an HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan was approved at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
The scheme operates under the title Buy As You Earn and was made available to all UK employees of the Group in September 2011.
The scheme enables qualifying UK employees including the Executive Directors to purchase partnership shares from their gross income before income tax and National Insurance deductions.
The Group provides two matching shares for every share purchased on the first 10 of every monthly investment.
The shares are held in trust and if they remain in the trust for five years from the date of purchase, no income tax or National Insurance will be payable.
Dividend shares accumulate while the employee participates in the plan.
The matching shares will be forfeited if the corresponding partnership shares are removed from the trust within three years from the date of award.
During the year ended 30 April 2013, one director held shares acquired under the BAYE scheme and details are shown below.

Following the end of each financial year, the Remuneration Committee determines the performance-related annual bonus for each executive director for the year just ended.
This is based on the directors performance in achieving the set objectives.
These comprise both financial objectives for the Group and individual business related objectives for each director.
For each executive director, the Group financial objectives for the year ended 30 April 2013 were to better the Groups financial targets with respect to measures of earnings before interest and taxation, earnings per share, and net debt.
For the year ended 30 April 2013, Sir Brian Souter and Martin Griffiths each had a maximum potential bonus of up to 100% of basic salary, with 70% allocated over a range of demanding key financial objectives and 30% for meeting individual business related objectives.
In making its judgement of performance for the last financial year, the Remuneration Committee had particular regard to the results as recorded elsewhere in the Annual Report, and relative total return to shareholders over the year, as well as other strategic developments and operating performance.
Performance related bonuses awarded to the Executive Directors in respect of the year ended 30 April 2013 are shown below.

Stagecoach Group plc | page 49 96142 STC Front PRINT 96142 STC Front V14 02 07 2013 11:03 Page 50 Directors remuneration report 9.19 Retirement of Chief Executive Sir Brian Souter retired as Chief Executive on 30 April 2013, and became Chairman on 1 May 2013, replacing Sir George Mathewson who also retired on 30 April 2013.
As Sir Brian Souter ceased to be a full time employee from that date, no new awards of Deferred Shares could be granted under the EPP and therefore the entire bonus award for the year ended 30 April 2013 will be paid in cash.
At the date of retirement, Sir Brian Souter held a number of outstanding awards under the LTIP scheme, which are subject to restricted vesting on retirement as described in section 9.17.1.
The Committee is satisfied that all contractual entitlements were settled correctly and confirm that no enhanced payments or benefits were made to Sir Brian on his retirement.
9.20 Directors shareholdings The Executive Directors and certain other senior executives are expected to accumulate significant shareholdings in the Company.
In the case of executive directors, they are each expected to accumulate an effective interest in shares in the Company with a value of at least 100% of basic salary.
These targets were first introduced in 2005 and the Executive Directors are allowed five years to accumulate the appropriate level of shares.
The Executive Directors have significant effective interests in the Companys ordinary shares ensuring alignment of the executive directors and shareholders interests.
The effective interests of the Executive Directors as at 30 April 2013 were: TABLE 7 EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS SHAREHOLDING Sir Brian Souter Martin Griffiths Ordinary shares excluding BAYE 86,900,445 202,417 Shares acquired under the BAYE scheme and held in trust 883 Deferred shares under Executive Participation Plan 159,223 509,283 87,059,668 712,583 9.21 Performance graph The graph below charts the performance of the Stagecoach Group Total Shareholder Return TSR share value movement plus reinvested dividends over the 5 years to 30 April 2013 compared with that of the FTSE Travel and Leisure All-Share Index, and the FTSE 250 Index.
