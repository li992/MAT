Board report on remuneration Introduction As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Committee I am delighted to present our Remuneration Report, based on the new policy and disclosure requirements on directors remuneration, as required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 the Regulations, for which we will be seeking your approval at our Annual General Meeting.
You will see that there are two main sections to the report.
The first part Section A summarises the policy of the Board with regard to the remuneration of the Directors and is a re-statement of the existing policy using the new guidelines.
The second part Section B describes how that policy has been implemented during the year and will be implemented in 2014.
In accordance with the Regulations, the policy section Section A will be put to a binding vote at, and will then be applicable immediately after, the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company in April 2014.
It is intended that the policy section will be put forward to shareholders every three years.
The Annual Report on remuneration will continue to be put to the AGM each year on an advisory basis.
2013 performance and remuneration outcomes Bodycote has made good and steady progress in 2013.
Reported revenues increased by 5.4% 3.0% at constant exchange rates.
Headline operating profit grew by 10.2% and our share price increased by 47.9% in 2013, compared to an increase of 28.8% in the FTSE 250 as a whole.
2013 base salary increases for the Executive Directors in the year were 2.7% for the CEO and 2.7% for the FD.
These increases were in the context of average 2013 salary increases across the Group of around 3%.
Annual bonuses for the Executive Directors, which are based on a mix of Group operating profit, Group cash flow and personal strategic objectives, paid out at the level of 59.1% and 43.9% of base salary for the CEO and FD, respectively equivalent to 50.6% and 48.8% of maximum opportunity.
Awards under the Co-investment Plan CIP made in May 2010 vested in May 2013 at 100% of maximum based on absolute Total Shareholder Return TSR growth of the three financial years ending April 2013.
Awards under the Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP made in February 2011 are due to vest in March 2014 at 98.4% of maximum based on a combination of ROCE and EPS growth over the three financial years ending December 2013.
Following a contractual review of pension provision during 2013, the Committee decided that the level of salary supplement in lieu of pension for Stephen Harris should be adjusted to 25% of salary.
For David Landless, the level will be adjusted to 25%, up to the cap of the defined benefit pension scheme: above that amount to his actual base salary, the salary supplement in lieu of pension remains at 16%.
Both of these changes will come into effect as of April 2014.
Changes to remuneration arrangements From 2013, the Committee decided that participants receiving awards under the CIP and BIP will be eligible to receive dividend equivalents on vested shares.
This change will more closely align the interests of Executives with those of shareholders as well as bringing this aspect of plan operation into line with typical market practice.
The Committee consulted with key shareholders on this point and they were supportive of the change.
Apart from this, the Remuneration Committee decided not to make changes to the remuneration framework and policy this year.
The decisions we have taken have been within the terms of our existing policies.

Therefore, the Executive Remuneration Policy is to set levels that attract and retain the talent responsible for executing strategy while ensuring the Company pays no more than is necessary.
Executive Remuneration Policy The table below shows the Policy to be approved by shareholders on 29 April 2014, taking effect once approved by the AGM in 2014 and which we expect to apply for a period of three years.

From April 2014, the Committee has determined that the entitlement should be 25% of salary for Stephen Harris and, for David Landless, 25% of salary up to the scheme cap and 16% above the cap.

Information on measures and weights that will apply for 2013 and 2014 are shown on page 57 of the Board report on remuneration.
The Committee considers the performance conditions selected for the annual bonus to appropriately support the Companys strategic objectives and provide a balance between generating profit and cash to enable the Group to pay a dividend, reward its employees and make future investments: and achieve other strategic goals to drive long-term sustainable return.

Targets for each award are set out in the relevant section of the Board report on remuneration.
Targets that apply to awards made in 2013 are shown on page 58.
The Committee considers the performance conditions selected for the BIP to appropriately underpin the Companys strategic objectives.
Due to the nature of the Companys activities the Committee consider ROCE to provide shareholders with an appropriate measure of how well the Company is performing and is being managed, while EPS provides a measure of the level of value created for shareholders.
ROCE and EPS are our top two KPIs as shown on page 58 of the Annual Report.
The Committee retains the discretion in exceptional circumstances to adjust the vesting outcome or the targets for awards as long as the adjusted targets are no less stretching.
In such an event the Committee will consult with major shareholders and will clearly explain the rationale for the changes in the report on remuneration.
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect of the shares which vest.

Targets for the cycle vesting in respect of the year are disclosed in the Board report on remuneration.
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect of the matching shares which vest.
The Committee considers it appropriate to use an absolute TSR performance measure for awards made under the CIP so that participants are incentivised to and rewarded for providing absolute returns for shareholders.
CIP awards are subject to the Committees Malus Policy as outlined on page 51.

Malus Not applicable The Malus Policy came into effect from 1 January 2013 and has To provide the been introduced to provide the Committee with discretionary Committee flexibility powers to use malus performance based remuneration should to adjust remuneration exceptional circumstances occur.
This Malus Policy is in respect levels in exceptional of annual bonuses and long-term incentive awards.
Exceptional circumstances circumstances necessitating malus would include: Fraud: Misconduct: Significant misstatement of financial results: or Miscalculation of performance conditions.
Should the Committee, in its opinion, consider such circumstances to have occurred during a performance period from 2013 onwards then the Malus Policy will provide the Committee discretion to determine that any amounts paid or awards vested by reference to the relevant period, shall be subject to malus.
Malus will start to apply to awards made from 2013.
The Committee expects the mechanism to use malus for any such amounts will be to reduce future annual bonus payments, reduce the value of subsisting awards that have, at the relevant time, not yet vested or by reducing the level of award to be made at the following grant date.
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out on page 53 where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company.
For these purposes payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment being agreed at the time the award is granted.
Executive Directors remuneration is reviewed annually and takes into account a number of factors.
The Company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the Company to pay any more than is necessary.
Senior and high performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, which are similar to those offered to the Executive Directors to ensure reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.

New Executive Directors will generally be appointed on remuneration packages with the same structure and pay elements as described in the pay policy table on page 48.
Each element of remuneration to be included in the package offered to a new director would be considered separately and collectively in this context.
On appointment to the Board or for a Non-Executive director taking an executive role: Base salary levels will be set in consideration of the new recruits existing salary, location, skills and experience and expected contribution to the new role, the current salaries of other Executive Directors in the Company and current market levels for the role: Pension will be considered in light of the retirement arrangements which are in place for the other Executive Director s with a contribution level considered by the Committee to be appropriate in light of the new recruits package as a whole, market practice at the time and on a broadly equivalent basis to existing provisions for other Executives: Other benefits will be considered in light of the provision in place for the other Executive Director s. If it is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders, the Committee may consider providing additional benefits, potentially including relocation costs, tax equalisation or advisers fees: The initial notice period may be longer than the Companys one year policy up to a maximum of two years.
However, this will reduce by one month for every month served, until the Companys policy position is reached: For annual bonus, the Company would consider whether it was appropriate for the new recruit to participate in the same annual incentive plan applicable to the current Executive Directors.
If this was considered appropriate, the same financial measures, weighting, payout scale and target as well as maximum bonus opportunity as a percentage of salary which apply to the existing director s would generally apply to the new recruit: The Committee will determine when long-term incentive awards will be granted during the year: and The Company is required to set out the maximum amount of variable pay which could be paid to a new director in respect of his her recruitment.
In order to provide the Company with sufficient flexibility in a recruitment scenario, the Committee has set this figure as 450% of base salary.
This covers the maximum annual bonus and the maximum face value of any long-term incentive awards.
This level of variable pay would only be available in exceptional circumstances, and in order to achieve such a level of variable pay, stretching targets would need to be met.
For the avoidance of doubt, this 450% variable pay limit excludes the value of any buyout payments or awards associated with forfeited awards.
For an external appointment, although there are no plans to offer additional cash and or share-based payments on recruitment, the Committee reserves the right to do so when it considers this to be in the best interests of the Company and shareholders.
Such payments may take into account remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attached to that remuneration.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buyout awards which will be forfeited on leaving the previous employer.
Our approach to this is to carry out a detailed review of the awards which the individual will lose and calculate the estimated value of them.
In doing so, we will consider the vesting period, the option exercise period if applicable, whether the awards are cash or share based, performance related or not, the Companys recent performance and payout levels and any other factors we consider appropriate.
If a buyout award is to be made, the structure and level will be carefully designed and will generally reflect and replicate the previous awards as accurately as possible.
We will make the award subject to appropriate malus provisions in the event that the individual resigns or is summarily terminated within a certain timeframe.
An explanation will be provided at the time of recruitment of why a buyout award has been granted.
Shareholders will be informed of any Director appointment and the individuals remuneration arrangements as soon as practicable following the appointment via an announcement to the regulatory news services.
Fee levels for a new Chairman or new Non-Executive Directors will be determined in accordance with the policy set out on page 48.
Termination remuneration policy It is the Companys policy that Executive Directors have service contracts with a one-year notice period and terminable by one years notice by the employer at any time, and by payment of one years basic salary and other fixed benefits in lieu of notice by the employer.
All future appointments to the Board will comply with this requirement.
Currently, under the terms of the Executive Directors contracts, the Company may at its choice, in lieu of giving notice, terminate an Executive Directors service contract by making a payment equivalent to: One years annual base salary, 25% of base salary in respect of all other remuneration and benefits other than annual bonus and incentives and annual bonus equal to the average bonus paid up to three years prior to the date of notice.
com 23065.02 11 March 2014 1:46 PM Design Shell Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Board report on remuneration continued Our policy is not to have a change in control clause in Executive Directors service contracts.
Stephen Harris does not have a change of control clause.
David Landless service contract was agreed in accordance with what was considered best practice at the time of its execution in 2001 and provides for one years remuneration if his employment is terminated on a change of control.
This provision has been preserved.
To the extent that executive contracts are renewed, or new appointments made, the Committee will continue to adopt a policy of not having change of control clauses in service contracts.
In any case, legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic salary, annual incentives and benefits, which may arise on the termination of employment of any Executive Director, other than payments made on a change in control or for payments in lieu of notice.
In the event that an Executive Director leaves the Company, the Committees policy for exit payments is to consider the reasons for cessation and consequently whether any exit payments other than those contractually required are warranted.
On cessation of employment, awards under the BIP and CIP will lapse in full, unless the Committee in its absolute discretion determines otherwise.
In instances where the Committee determines that awards should not lapse in full, the Committee will consider the performance conditions applying to any unvested awards and the performance period which has elapsed.
Awards will usually be subject to some form of time pro-rating reduction to reflect the unexpired portion of the performance or deferral period concerned.
Awards that are subject to performance conditions will usually only vest to the extent that these conditions are satisfied.
Awards which do not lapse on cessation of employment may either vest at that time or on their originally anticipated vesting date.
On termination, the accumulated funds invested in the Bodycote Investment Incentive Plan further information on this long-term savings vehicle is available on page 57 will normally be released to the participant subject to Committee discretion.
On change of control the awards will generally vest subject to performance and time apportionment as determined by the Committee and in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan.

It is the Boards policy that the Chairman and Non-Executive fees are reviewed on an annual basis.
The fees for the Chairman are reviewed by the Board in the absence of the Chairman.
The fees for the Non-Executive Directors are reviewed by the Chairman and Executive Directors.
When reviewing fees, the primary source for comparative market data is FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar size and complexity, as appropriate.
Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executives are set at a level that will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a significant contribution to the Groups affairs.
The Committee seeks to recruit Non-Executive Directors with the experience to contribute to the Board with a balance of personal skills that will make a major contribution to the Board and its committee structures.
The Companys policy is that the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive a fixed fee for their services as members of the Board and its Committees.
The fee structure may also include additional fees for chairing a Board Committee and or for further responsibilities for example, Senior Independent Directorship.
Fee levels take into account the level of time commitment and duties and responsibilities involved.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any incentive scheme.
In line with the Articles of Association, accumulative Non-Executive Director fees are capped at 500,000 p. a.

Stephen Harris has held such a position at Mondi plc since 1 March 2011 and in accordance with Group policy he retained fees for the year of 82,919.45.
David Landless was appointed a Non-Executive Director of Luxfer Holdings plc with effect from 1 March 2013 and retained fees for the year of 40,238.
In addition, David Landless was given 1,924 of Luxfer American Depositary Receipts valued at $30,000 at the date of grant on 1 March 2013.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company The Company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the Company to pay any more than is necessary.
Senior and high performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, similar to the Executive Directors to ensure reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when formulating Executive Director pay policy.
However, it does take into account information provided by the Human Resources function and feedback from employee satisfaction surveys.
In formulating Executive Director pay policy, the Committee receives information on all employee pay conditions throughout the Group.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views The Committee always welcomes the views of shareholders in respect of pay policy as well as those views expressed on behalf of shareholders by their respective proxy advisers.
The Committee documents all remuneration related comments made at the Companys AGM and feedback received during consultation with shareholders throughout the year.
Any feedback received is fully considered by the Committee and, where appropriate, amendments are made to remuneration policy.
During 2013, the Committee decided that participants receiving awards under the CIP and BIP will be eligible to receive dividend equivalents on un-vested shares payable at the time of vesting.

Base salary The base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed on an annual basis.
As described in the policy section, a number of factors are taken into account when salaries are reviewed, principally market level salaries payable in FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar size and complexity and the individuals role, experience and performance.
The 2013 base salary increases and comparative figures can be found in the Remuneration Committee Chairmans letter.
Base salaries are reviewed in January every year.

The plan is entirely cash based to provide an alternative long-term savings vehicle for senior Executives.
The Committee considers the plan an essential tool to aid retention while recognising the need for Executives to have flexibility in long-term financial planning.
Company contributions are discretionary, vary year-on-year and are made in lieu of other elements of pay and therefore are cost neutral to the Company and any risk in relation to the value of investments made in the plan is borne entirely by participants.
Annual performance-related bonus The annual bonus potential for the period to 31 December 2013 for Executive Directors was split 70% in respect of Group operating profit, 10% Group operating cash flow and 20% on personal strategic objectives.
The choice of these performance conditions, and their respective weightings reflected the Committees belief that any incentive compensation should be tied both to the overall performance of the Group and to those areas of the business that the relevant individual can directly influence.
The performance of the Company during the year included headline operating profit of 107.4m a 10.2% increase on the previous year and operating cash flow of 104.6m a 1.6% increase on last year.
In light of the above performance, the Committee concluded that 50.6% of maximum bonus is payable to the Chief Executive and 48.8% of maximum bonus is payable to the Finance Director.
As described in the policy section, 100% of annual bonus is payable in cash.
The Board has considered whether to include targets which applied to the bonus arrangements for Executive Directors in 2013 and which will apply for 2014 but determined that these figures are commercially sensitive.
It is the Committees intention to include the 2013 targets in next years Remuneration Report.
Personal objectives for the Chief Executive broadly cover driving growth, improving customer service, safety and implementation of major projects.

The threshold and maximum targets along with the vesting schedule are set out in the tables below: ROCE EPS Vesting of element Vesting of element Performance target % of maximum Performance target % of maximum Threshold performance 14.6% 0% 28.3p 0% Maximum performance 20.0% 100% 39.8p 100% Performance achieved 19.9% 96.9% 41.2p 100% In addition, if EPS at the end of the performance period was below 16p then no awards would vest.
Over the period, ROCE was 19.9% and the EPS figure for the year of 41.2p represented growth of 9.9%.
This performance resulted in the ROCE and EPS targets being achieved at a level of 96.9% and 100% respectively.
This resulted in an overall vesting level of 98.5%.
The number and value of shares which vested to each of the Executive Directors is set out on page 61 of this report.
Awards made in the year BIP awards of face value of 175% of salary were made to both Executive Directors in February 2013 and will vest in March 2016, subject to the achievement of ROCE and EPS growth performance targets.
The performance period will end on 31 December 2015.
The vesting of these awards will be based on ROCE and EPS targets summarised in the table below.
The Committee has reviewed the performance targets and these have altered accordingly to ensure that they remain stretching and underpin the Company objectives.

The Committee has decided that the ROCE figure of 23% is a good aspiration for the Group and is cognisant of the fact that overdriving incentives on capital employed can lead to unintended consequences in terms of short-term capital starvation for the business.
As of 2013 dividend equivalents are payable in respect of the shares which vest.
The number and value of shares which were awarded to the Executive Directors during the year is set out on page 61 of this report.

The 2014 base salary increases for the Directors from 1 January 2014 were 3% for the Chief Executive and 3% for the Finance Director.
As 2014 base salary increases for the Group take place after the publication of this report, the comparative figure for 2014 can only be provided in next years report.
As described in the Committee Chairmans introduction, following a contractual review of pension provision during 2013, the Committee decided that the level of salary supplement in lieu of pension for Stephen Harris should be adjusted to 25% of salary.
For David Landless, the level will be adjusted to 25% up to the defined benefit pension scheme cap.
Above that amount up to his actual base salary, the salary supplement in lieu of pension remains at 16%.
The Committee does not intend to change the benefit arrangements for the Executive Directors in 2014.
For 2014 the Committee has determined that the annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors and senior executives will again be contingent on meeting targets relating to safety, operating profit, cash management and personal objectives.
The Committee has reviewed targets for the year to ensure they remain appropriately stretching and relevant for the Companys business strategy.
The Committee will review the performance measures for awards under the CIP and the BIP in 2014 to ensure they remain appropriately stretching in light of the Companys expectations of performance and those of external analysts.
