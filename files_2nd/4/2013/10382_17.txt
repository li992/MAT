Save for certain operational and operational support roles where some, or all, of the annual bonus relates directly to the performance of the business or area for which the participant is responsible, a common EPS annual bonus target and weighting apply across all participating employees.
Retail Staff do not participate in any bonus scheme.
Around 60 senior employees including Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee participate in the PRSP.
No long-term incentive plans PRSP apply for any other employees.

TSR was chosen as relative TSR performance provides a measure of long-term success of the Company relative to the market in which it operates.
This part of the award is also subject to a share price underpin and may only be exercised where the Mitchells & Butlers share price has equalled or exceeded the share price at the date of award within six months of vesting.
