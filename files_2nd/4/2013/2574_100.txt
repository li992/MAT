Salary Salaries are reviewed annually.
Our policy is to set base salaries below the median for our comparator group.
The pay and conditions for all UK employees are considered when setting salaries for executive directors.
Salary increases for executive directors are set out on page 82.
Annual bonus Executive directors are eligible for an annual bonus.
The annual bonus is paid in two elements, a cash element, and a deferred element paid in shares.
The deferred share element is subject to clawback provisions and must be held for three years before vesting.
There are no performance conditions applying to the deferred shares other than a requirement for continuous employment.
There is no matching of deferred shares by the company.
Annual bonus is not pensionable.
The award of deferred shares helps to ensure that a significant proportion of the total remuneration package is variable and linked to performance.
It also acts as a retention measure and strengthens further the alignment of management interests with the long-term interests of shareholders.
The level of bonus opportunity for executive directors is: Chief Executive Other executive directors Annual cash bonus target 125% salary target 100% salary maximum 200% salary maximum 150% salary Deferred bonus in shares target 125% salary target 75% salary maximum 200% salary maximum 112.5% salary Total bonus target 250% salary target 175% salary maximum 400% salary maximum 262.5% salary The annual bonus weighting is set out on page 82.
Incentive Share Plan ISP The ISP forms the long-term variable element of executive remuneration with a performance period of three years.
Performance measures are based on: relative TSR measured against a comparator group containing European telecommunications companies and companies which are of a similar size or market capitalisation, and or a similar business mix to BT a free cash ow measure underlying revenue growth excluding transit revenue The use of TSR as a performance measure links reward for executive directors with BT performance against other major companies.
Targets for free cash ow reect the importance to the group of investment in the business, repayment of debt, support to the pension scheme and payment of dividends.
The revenue growth measures align with the groups aim to drive profitable revenue growth.
Further information on the ISP is set out on page 82.
Retention shares Awards of retention shares are used by exception only and are principally a recruitment and retention tool.
As a result, awards are not generally subject to a corporate performance target, with lengths of retention before vesting exible although this would normally be three years unless the committee agrees otherwise.
Share options No share options have been granted since 2004 and there is no intention to do so in 2013 14.
Clawback The rules of the executive share plans provide for clawback of unvested shares in circumstances where the committee becomes aware of facts which would, in its discretion, justify such a reduction.
Executive share ownership The committee believes that the interests of executive directors should closely align with shareholders.
Accordingly directors are encouraged to build up a shareholding over time by retaining shares received under executive share plans other than those sold to meet National Insurance contribution and income tax liability.
The Chief Executive is required to build up a shareholding of 2x salary and the remaining executive directors 1.5x salary.
Pensions For executive directors the company agrees to pay an amount equal to 30% of salary each year which can be put toward the provision of retirement benets.
Executive directors who are not members of the BTPension Scheme benefit from a death in service lump sum of 4x salary and a dependants pension of 30% of cappedsalary.

The TSR for a company is calculated by comparing the return index RI m at the beginning of the performance period with the RI at the end of the period.
The RI is the TSR value of a company measured on a daily 14 basis, as tracked by independent analysts, Datastream.
It uses the ofcial closing prices for a companys shares, adjusted for all capital actions and 12 dividends paid.
The initial RI is determined by calculating the average RI value taken daily over the three months prior to the beginning of the 10 performance period: and the end value is determined by calculating the average RI over the three months up to the end of the performance period.
This mitigates the effects of share price volatility.
