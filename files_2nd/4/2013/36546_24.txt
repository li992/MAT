DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT DEAR SHAREHOLDER The Remuneration Committee Committee is conscious of the need to have a remuneration policy with a structure and level of reward that will incentivise the Executive Directors to deliver the Companys strategy and annual targets as approved by the Board.
In 2013, overall performance was good with adjusted earnings per share growing by 10.5% to 23.1p, Group like-for-like NRI increasing by 2.1% to 290.2 million and controllable overheads reducing to 37.8 million.
The Company did not outperform the relevant IPD Indexes.
This level of financial performance, combined with the achievement of a number of significant personal objectives, suggested an average of 54% of maximum bonus for 2013 for the Executive Directors.
The Committee considered that this appropriately reflected the Companys performance whilst achieving a fair balance between the interests of shareholders and those of Executive Directors.
More about the detailed financial targets and personal objectives upon which Anthony Watson CBE Executive Directors were measured can be found on page 89.
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee During the year the Committee reviewed the remuneration policy and as a result a number of small adjustments have been made in order to clarify and align certain areas of the reward structure.
The arrangements for 2014 follow the same approach as for 2013 other COMMITTEE MEMBERS than in one material respect.
While the policy of granting to each Executive Director an Terry Duddy annual Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP award of shares worth twice their salary remains unaffected, the Executive Directors made a request to the Committee that their 2014 Judy Gibbons awards be reduced to one times salary only.
This reflects their wish to set an example David Tyler given the environment in which other cost control steps are being introduced within the Company.
The Committee will be making the 2014 awards at this lower level.
It is anticipated that awards in 2015 will, subject to any further review of the long-term incentive arrangements more generally, return to the policy level.
The Committee approved modest base pay increases of between 2% and 3.6% for the Executive Directors, effective from 1 April 2014, and consistent with the budget for employees generally.
This was the first inflationary increase in Executive Director base pay since 2011.
As reported last year, on 1 January 2013, Jean-Philippe Mouton was appointed to the Board, having joined Hammerson in 2003.
The Committee is satisfied that his reward structure is broadly in line with that of other Executive Directors.
In May 2013, the Committee considered the vesting of the LTIP awards which had been made in 2009.
For the first time in a number of years as a consequence of a good long-term sustained level of performance by the Company, the Executive Directors benefitted from a partial vesting.
Further details of this can also be found on page 90.
Like many other companies, the Company has kept a close watch on the debate on remuneration disclosure.
The GC100 and Investor Group Guidance has proved helpful in this regard and the Directors Remuneration Report has been prepared with those guidelines in mind.
Having served for a number of years as Chairman of the Committee, I am delighted that Gwyn Burr, a fellow Non-Executive Director joined the Committee on 14 February 2014 and will succeed me as Committee Chairman at the Annual General Meeting AGM in April 2014.
I hope that shareholders will find the remuneration policy, upon which they will be asked to vote separately for the first time at the AGM in April 2014, appropriate in light of both the Companys strategy and its key performance indicators for 2014 and the longer term.
