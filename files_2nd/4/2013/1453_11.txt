As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve this Directors Remuneration Report will be proposed at the AGM on 24 April 2014.
Terms of reference A copy of the Remuneration Committees terms of reference is available on our website, www.
The Remuneration Committee conducted a review of its terms of reference during 2013.
A small number of minor changes were recommended to the Board, principally to reflect the Regulations and updated guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers during the year.
The changes were approved by the Board in February 2014.
What did we pay our Directors?
Mr Dunoyer was appointed as CFO with effect from 1 November 2013, with an annualised base salary of 680,000.
The base salary for Mr Lowths position as CFO in 2013 increased from 660,000 to 710,000 with effect from 1 April 2013.
Mr Lowth ceased to be a Director on 31 October 2013.
Mr Lowth received a temporary base salary increase of 20,000 gross per month effective from June to September 2012 inclusive during his period as Interim CEO creating an annualised base pay figure of 900,000.
This temporary base salary increase was not pensionable.
2 Executive Directors may select benefits within the Companys UK Flexible Benefits Programme or can select to take all, or any remaining allowance after the selection of benefits, in cash.
In 2013, the Executive Directors principally took the allowance in cash 102,000 in respect of Mr Soriot, 9,000 in respect of Mr Dunoyer, and 44,000 in respect of Mr Lowth and selected other benefits including healthcare insurance, death-in-service provision and tax preparation advice.
3 One-third of the pre-tax bonus is deferred into Ordinary Shares.
These will be held for three years before being released, subject to continued employment.
The bonus is not pensionable.
4 For Mr Lowth, for 2012, this sum is made up of: a revised sum of 816,000 being the market value of shares on the date of vesting in March 2013 in respect of the 2010 PSP award three-year performance period 2010-2012 which, using an estimated market value based on the London Stock Exchange closing price on 30 January 2013, was reported as 771,000 in our 2012 Directors Remuneration Report: 126,000 being cash paid on the vesting of this PSP award in respect of dividends accrued: and 359,000 being the intrinsic gain on share options awarded in 2009 on the date of vesting in March 2012.
5 Equivalent to 24% of base salary, taken as a cash alternative to participation in a defined contribution pension scheme.
6 For Mr Soriot, for 2012, this sum is made up of: 991,000 being cash paid to compensate Mr Soriot in respect of his forfeited bonus opportunity for 2012 from his previous employer, paid at his previous employers target bonus rate and pro-rated from 1 January 2012 to 30 September 2012.
Mr Soriot was required to invest this sum, after payment of income tax, in AstraZeneca shares: and an award of 2,000,000 representing the value of an award of 69,108 restricted Ordinary Shares at a price of 2894 pence per share by way of compensation for the loss of LTIs from his previous employer.
27,644 shares representing 40% of the award vested on 31 October 2013 in accordance with the vesting schedule, and the remaining 60% of the award will vest in equal proportions subject to the Companys closed trading periods on 1 October 2014 and 1 October 2015.
The value and structure of the restricted share award mirrors the value and structure of the award that Mr Soriot forfeited on his departure from his former employer.
Accordingly, no performance conditions apply to the restricted share award made to Mr Soriot on his recruitment.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 105 Corporate Governance | Directors Remuneration Report Additional notes to the Directors single total figure remuneration table Annual bonus For 2013, the principal drivers of annual bonus opportunity were measures for Achieve Scientific Leadership 30%, Return to Growth 30% and Achieve Group Financial Targets 40%, together with individual performance, details of which are set out below.
The CEO had a target annual bonus of 100% of base salary range 0-180% and the CFO had a target annual bonus of 90% of base salary range 0-150%.
One-third of the pre-tax bonuses earned for the year will be deferred into Ordinary Shares which will vest three years from the date of deferral, subject to continued employment.
The performance measures for the annual bonus opportunity, the weighting, actual performance during the year and level of award are detailed in the tables below.
The precise targets or target ranges set at the beginning of the performance period are closely aligned to the Companys strategic priorities and, in the judgement of the Board, disclosure of these would compromise the Companys competitive position versus its peers and therefore be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its shareholders.
As the annual bonus and PSP performance measures are indicators of the Companys longer-term strategic priorities, we believe that the targets target ranges are and will remain commercially sensitive.
Our approach, therefore, is to disclose performance measures and weightings in advance ie for the current performance period and performance outcomes against those measures in arrears ie for the past performance period with an explanation of the reward consequences for the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion in judging the annual bonus award for an individual Executive Director, taking into account Group and individual performance against targets.
In 2013, the Remuneration Committee determined that Mr Soriots annual bonus should amount to 170% of base salary, representing 94% of the potential maximum.
The Remuneration Committee determined that Mr Dunoyers bonus should amount to 129% of base salary on an annualised basis, representing 86% of the potential maximum.
The Remuneration Committees decisions recognise the impact the new leadership team is having on actual and future performance of the Company, including the outcome of the 2013 Group scorecard.
Achieve Scientific Leadership These measures reflect the Companys ability to deliver innovation to the market.
In 2013, we made significant progress towards achieving scientific leadership and exceeded each of our pipeline targets.

Return to Growth These measures are based on quantitative sales targets for 2013 relating to the Companys five growth platforms: Brilinta, diabetes, respiratory, Emerging Markets, and Japan.
In 2013, we did not, in aggregate, meet our Return to Growth targets.

More information about the TSR performance of the Company, including the Companys peer group, is set out in the Total shareholder return section from page 110.
Twenty five percent of the award is based on the achievement of a cumulative free cash flow target.
Twenty five percent of the award is based on Achieve Scientific Leadership measures covering five areas: an NME target, which reflects the Companys ability to deliver innovation to the market: major life-cycle management approvals, which represent a good proxy for near-to-mid term growth: the volume of NMEs in Phase III and their registration: a target for peak-year sales, to track the value of pipeline output: and delivery from our research and early development organisation, assessed by Phase II starts.
Twenty five percent of the award is based on Return to Growth measures based on quantitative sales targets relating to the Companys five growth platforms: Brilinta, diabetes, respiratory, Emerging Markets, and Japan.
The precise targets or target ranges set at the beginning of the performance period are closely aligned to the Companys strategic priorities and, in the judgement of the Board, disclosure of certain of these may compromise the Companys competitive position versus its peers and therefore be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its shareholders.
As the PSP performance measures are an indicator of the Companys longer-term strategic priorities, we believe that these targets target ranges are and will remain commercially sensitive.

Mr Lowth was not eligible to receive an annual bonus for 2013 and all outstanding LTI awards made under the PSP and AZIP lapsed in accordance with the plan rules on resignation.
The Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion by determining that Mr Lowths Deferred Bonus Plan awards for 2010 10,281 shares, 2011 9,001 shares and 2012 11,728 shares would vest on their pre-determined vesting dates.

Remuneration context and our past performance Statement of change in remuneration of CEO compared to other employees Percentage change of CEO against 2012 Average percentage change for employees against 2012 1 Salary 0% 3% Taxable benefits 6% 3% Annual bonus 39% 17% 1 Mr Soriot was appointed as CEO with effect from 1 October 2012, with an annualised base salary of 1,100,000.
No increase in base salary was awarded to Mr Soriot in 2013.
David Brennan, who relinquished his responsibilities as a Director and as CEO on 1 June 2012, was eligible to receive an annualised base salary of 997,223 for 2012.
The employee comparator group comprises employees in the UK, US and Sweden.
We consider this to be an appropriate comparator group because it is representative of the Groups major functions Commercial, R&D, Manufacturing and Supply, and Enabling Functions and the employee populations are well balanced in terms of seniority and demographics.
To provide a meaningful comparison of salary increases, a consistent employee comparator group is used by which the same individuals appear in the 2012 and 2013 group.

Total shareholder return TSR The chart below compares the TSR performance of the Company over the past five years with the TSR of the FTSE100 Index.
This graph is re-based to 100 at the start of the relevant five-year period.
We have also included a Pharmaceutical peers average, which reflects the TSR of the current comparator group.
The additional chart below shows how the Companys TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the relevant companies in the comparator group from the first day in the three-year performance period in respect of the PSP award made during the year to 31 December 2013, and how the Company ranks against those other companies on this basis.

All of the Directors fulfil this requirement at the date of this Directors Remuneration Report.
In addition to this mandatory requirement, the Board imposes minimum shareholding requirements on the Executive Directors and SET members.
The CEO is required to build a shareholding and hold shares amounting to 300% of base salary, and the CFO is required to hold shares amounting to 200% of base salary, each within five years of their date of appointment.
At the date of this report, Mr Soriot has fulfilled this requirement but, in view of Mr Dunoyers recent appointment as CFO, he does not yet fulfil the shareholding requirement.
All other SET members are required to build a shareholding over time and hold 125% of base salary as shares while in office.
The Board also encourages each Non-Executive Director to build up, over a period of three years, a shareholding in the Company with a value approximately equivalent to the basic annual fee for a Non-Executive Director 75,000 or, in the case of the Chairman, approximately equivalent to his basic annual fee 500,000.
Genevive Berger, Graham Chipchase and Bruce Burlington are building their shareholding in the Company over time.
All of the other Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, had fulfilled this expectation as at 31 December 2013.

It is intended that the Policy will remain in force for three years unless earlier revision is required, and will be effective from 1 January 2015.
The Company will have regard to the proposed Policy in determining remuneration practices in the intervening period.
The Implementation Report, detailing the implementation of the Companys remuneration policy in the previous year, will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the Companys AGM each year.
Effective from 1 January 2014, Mr Soriots base salary was increased in line with increases in the UK employee population by 3% to 1,133,000.
Mr Soriots pension allowance will increase to 30% of base salary per annum with effect from 1 January 2014, in line with pension allowances provided in comparable roles in the FTSE30.
Mr Soriots target annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged at 100% of salary and his LTI plan target will remain unchanged at 250% of base salary.
However, the Remuneration Committee has exercised its discretion to grant an above-target LTI award for 2014 of 285% of base salary.
In view of the timing of Mr Dunoyers appointment as CFO on 1 November 2013, the Remuneration Committee expects his remuneration will next be reviewed, in line with the Policy, at the end of 2014.
Accordingly, for 2014, Mr Dunoyers annualised base salary will remain unchanged at 680,000, his target annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged at 90% of base salary and his LTI plan target award will remain unchanged at 200% of base salary.
The Remuneration Committee awarded Mr Dunoyer an LTI award for 2014 of 200% of base salary.
The performance measures and weightings for 2014 in respect of the LTI plans AZIP and PSP will be consistent with those described in the Long Term Incentives section in the Remuneration Policy Report from page 117.
The annual bonus measures and weightings for 2014 will be consistent with those set in 2013 as described in the summary table overleaf.
Individual performance for each of the Directors will be assessed by reference to individual objectives in line with the Companys objectives for the year.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 113 Corporate Governance | Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration Policy Report This section sets out the Remuneration Policy the Policy that will be put forward for approval by shareholders at the Companys AGM in April 2014.
It is intended that the Policy shall apply from 1 January 2015 for a period of three years, and that remuneration paid in the period between the date of the AGM and the effective date of the Policy will be substantially in line with the Policy.
Setting the Companys Policy The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting overall remuneration policy and makes decisions about specific remuneration arrangements in the broader context of employee remuneration throughout the Group.
All roles within the organisation are benchmarked against comparable roles in similar organisations and in the employees local market to ensure the Company is paying fairly at all levels.
Executive Directors remuneration arrangements are benchmarked against a global pharmaceutical peer group and the FTSE30.
Each year the Company actively engages with its employees, either on a Group-wide basis or in the context of smaller focus groups, in order to solicit feedback generally and on a wide range of specified issues, including pay.
While the Remuneration Committee did not consult with employees when determining the Executive Directors remuneration policy, it does annually review Group remuneration data including ratios of average pay to senior executive pay: bonus data: gender and geographical data in relation to base salaries and variable compensation: and aggregate data about the shareholding levels of senior managers.
Many employees are also shareholders in the Company and therefore will have the opportunity to vote at the 2014 AGM on this Remuneration Policy Report.
In reviewing the base salaries of Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee considers the overall level of any salary increases being awarded to employees in the Executive Directors local market in the relevant year.
In all aspects of its work, the Remuneration Committee considers both the external environment in which the Company operates and the guidance issued by organisations representing institutional shareholders.
It consults the Companys largest investors on general and specific remuneration matters and provides an annual opportunity for representatives of those investors to meet the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and other Remuneration Committee and Board members.
Major shareholders were consulted on the changes made to the LTI performance measures in 2013, and it is the Companys policy to seek input from major shareholders on an ad hoc basis where significant changes to remuneration arrangements are proposed.
Members of the Remuneration Committee met with major shareholders in December 2013 to discuss the more significant components of the Policy, as set out in this Remuneration Policy Report.
The Companys shareholders are encouraged to attend the Companys AGM and any views expressed will be considered by the Remuneration Committees members.
The Remuneration Committee works with the Audit Committee to ensure that the Groups remuneration policies and practices achieve the right balance between appropriate incentives to reward good performance, managing risk, and the pursuit of the Companys business objectives.
Legacy arrangements The Remuneration Committee may approve remuneration payments and payments for loss of office where the terms of the payment were agreed before the Policy came into effect, or at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company provided that, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the agreement was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
This includes the exercise of any discretion available to the Remuneration Committee in connection with such payments.
For these purposes, payments include the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration including awards over shares, on the basis of the terms agreed at the time the award is granted.
Minor amendments The Remuneration Committee may make minor amendments to the arrangements for the Directors as described in this Remuneration Policy Report for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes, or to take account of a change in legislation.
114 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors Fixed elements of remuneration: base salary, benefits and pension The Companys approach to determining and reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors and the employee population as a whole is the same.
On an annual basis, the salaries for individual roles are reviewed in the context of individual sustained performance and the external market.
AstraZeneca participates in annual global compensation surveys, which provide benchmarking data for all roles within the organisation, ensuring a robust salary review process for all employees.
The Company seeks to provide an appropriate range of competitive benefits, including pension, to all employees including Directors in the context of their local market.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 115 Corporate Governance | Directors Remuneration Report Variable elements of remuneration Annual bonus All employee bonuses are determined by reference to the Group scorecard and an assessment of individual performance.
The Group scorecard is designed to reflect the Companys strategy and the focus of its business activity and priorities in the performance year.
The performance measures are recommended by the CEO and determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each year.
They are designed to ensure that all eligible employees receive an element of reward based on the Groups overall financial and non-financial performance.
A scorecard approach ensures that all employees across functions and geographies are focused on the activities critical to delivering the business strategy.
The performance measures and weightings underlying the annual bonus plan will be disclosed in advance.
The outcomes against targets, for reasons of commercial sensitivity, will be disclosed in arrears.
The Implementation Report will identify, in arrears, the performance versus the objectives and the consequent levels of remuneration deemed appropriate by the Remuneration Committee.
For Executive Directors one-third of their pre-tax annual bonus is delivered in shares, which are deferred for three years, under the Deferred Bonus Plan.
Employees below SET level receive a bonus in cash and are not required to defer a proportion in shares.

The Board will consider Company performance against the Group scorecard objectives as well as the Executive Directors individual performance in order to determine the value of the bonus award.
Individual performance will be assessed by the Remuneration Committee on the basis of objective criteria established by the Chairman in the case of the CEO, and by the CEO in the case of the CFO.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to move the theoretical award up or down subject to the annual bonus award being no greater than the maximum percentage of base salary applicable to that award in the year in question.
The Remuneration Committee will use its discretion to ensure that a fair and balanced outcome is achieved, taking into account the overall performance of the Company and the experience of its shareholders.
Two-thirds of the annual bonus is delivered in cash and one-third is delivered in shares, which are deferred for three years as explained below.
The annual bonus, including the deferred share element, payable for target performance for the CEO is currently 100% of base salary and for the CFO is currently 90% of base salary.
For bonuses awarded in respect of 2015 and subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee will have discretion, for up to six years from the payment date, to claw back from individuals some or all of the cash bonus award in certain circumstances including i material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual.
However, in the case of i and ii the Remuneration Committee may only exercise its discretion for up to two years from the payment date.

116 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Long Term Incentives LTIs Overview: An Executive Directors target LTI award is considered annually and set at a level which takes account of market analysis.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to grant awards above or below target based on individual performance and potential.
The CEOs current LTI target is 250% of base salary on an expected value basis, and the CFOs current LTI target is 200% of base salary on an expected value basis.
An illustration of the expected value basis can be found in the Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors section from page 121.
The Companys variable long-term arrangements for Executive Directors currently comprise two LTI plans: the PSP and the AZIP.
Under each of these plans the maximum market value of shares that may be awarded is 500% of a participants base salary.
If the Remuneration Committee ever felt that it would be in the interests of shareholders to grant annual variable awards to an Executive Director with values exceeding the historical range of up to 500% in aggregate under the LTI plans, it would consult major shareholders in advance.
Currently when LTI awards are granted to Executive Directors, the split between the two plans is weighted in the proportion: 75% PSP and 25% AZIP.
When granting LTI awards the Remuneration Committee applies a target as a percentage of base salary on an expected value basis.
For the AZIP, the expected value on vesting is 100% of the value of the award at grant.
For the PSP, the expected value on vesting is 50% of the value of the award at grant.
The table overleaf explains the operation, minimums and maximums payable under each of these LTI plans.
Performance measures: Performance measures are recommended by the CEO and determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance measures in respect of the PSP are designed to drive long-term performance against the Companys strategic objectives, in terms of commercial, scientific and financial success.
In respect of the AZIP, dividend-based performance hurdles motivate the generation of returns for shareholders on a sustainable basis over an extended period of time, and will be set by the Remuneration Committee at a level it considers appropriate at the start of the performance period.
The combined eight-year performance and holding period is designed to reflect the development cycle of a medicine and therefore to align executive reward with successful product development.
When setting the performance measures at the start of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee will also determine an appropriate payout curve if any, for each measure.
The Remuneration Committee will assess performance against the performance measures to determine the level of payout.
The Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to increase or decrease the payout should it consider it appropriate, subject to the maximum percentage of base salary applicable in the year in question.
The intention of the Remuneration Committee is to exercise judgement appropriately, in particular so that the experience of shareholders over time is taken into account.
As a matter of good practice, certain major shareholders would be consulted before any material change to the performance measures for the PSP or AZIP are implemented.
The Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that, on the one hand, reward outcomes are not purely mechanistic: but on the other, that in exercising its discretion, that exercise is not seen by employees to be arbitrary or unfair.
The Remuneration Committees objective is to use reward arrangements to drive performance by employees which supports the creation of value for shareholders.
Cessation of employment and other circumstances: The LTI plans are governed by plan rules, which define how individual awards should be treated upon termination of an Executive Directors employment see Principles of payment for loss of office for Executive Directors section on page 124.
Provision is also made for the treatment of awards in respect of corporate activity including rights issues, sale of a business outside the Group and a change of control.
The treatment of awards in these circumstances is also subject to Remuneration Committee discretion.
In the event of a change of control an award will vest pro rata to the time elapsed between the date of grant of the award and the date of the event to the extent that the performance measures have been met up to the date of the event, subject to the Remuneration Committees discretion to make an alternative determination.
Other employees: Other employees at mid to senior levels globally are eligible for LTI awards in the form of PSP and or Restricted Stock Units.
The occupants of approximately 700 senior roles in the Company are currently eligible for PSP awards these are the leaders who have the ability directly to influence the delivery of the Companys strategic goals.
Awards under the AZIP are currently granted to SET members only including the Executive Directors.

During the holding period, no further performance measures will apply as performance has already been assessed.
All the performance measures have a payout curve.
The payout curves are structured in different ways depending on the overall objective they are intended to measure.
Typically, performance measures are structured such that 25% of the award will vest for threshold level of performance.
The relationship between threshold, target and out-performance will be determined by the Remuneration Committee at each grant of the PSP and is dependent on whether the performance measure is science, commercial or finance based.
An award will typically vest at 100% if the target usually set at upper quartile performance is achieved and threshold level of performance associated with any metric will be at or above a median level.
There will be other vesting points between the threshold and maximum of 100% vesting, typically on a straight-line basis where the performance measures permit.
The Remuneration Committee may acting fairly and reasonably adjust or waive a performance target if an event occurs that causes it to believe that the performance target is no longer appropriate.
Payouts can range from 0% to 100% of the original award.
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends accrued during the vesting period will be paid.
Subject to shareholder approval of the renewal of the PSP at the 2014 AGM, for awards granted under the PSP after the AGM and in subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee will have discretion: to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested award in certain circumstances malus, including i material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual: for up to six years from the third anniversary of the date of grant, to claw back from individuals some or all of the award in certain circumstances, including i material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual.

If an event occurs which causes the Remuneration Committee acting fairly and reasonably to consider that a performance measure is no longer appropriate it may adjust that measure.
The AZIP is operated over a four-year performance period, with a subsequent four-year holding period.
Performance periods commence on 1 January in the year of the award.
Holding periods run for a period of four years starting from the end of the performance period, and end on the eighth anniversary of the start of the performance period.
During the holding period, no further performance measures apply as performance has already been assessed.
If both measures are achieved in each year of the performance period, the award will vest in full at the end of the holding period.
If either or both of the measures are not achieved, the award will lapse.
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends paid during the performance and holding periods will be paid.
For awards granted under the AZIP prior to the AGM in 2014, the Company may reduce or cancel some or all of the shares that are the subject of a participants award at any time during the performance or the holding period if, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee acting fairly and reasonably, this is warranted by the underlying performance of the Company, the occurrence of an event that causes, or is very likely to cause, reputational damage to the Company, or serious misconduct by the participant.
In order to ensure consistency between our LTI plans, for awards granted under the AZIP on or after the AGM and in subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee will have discretion: to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested award in certain circumstances malus, including i material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual: for up to six years from the end of the performance period, to claw back from individuals some or all of the award in certain circumstances, including i in the case of material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 119 Corporate Governance | Directors Remuneration Report Restricted shares In certain circumstances, as part of the recruitment arrangements, an Executive Director may be awarded restricted shares.
There are no performance measures attached to awards of restricted shares because typically they will be awarded for the purpose of compensating newly recruited Executive Directors for loss of entitlements on leaving a previous employment.
However, the Remuneration Committee will consider whether the lost incentives were subject to performance measures and their likely vesting.
If foregone awards were subject to performance testing, then the compensatory AstraZeneca award will normally be granted under the PSP and or AZIP in order to align the performance conditions attaching to the award to the delivery of the Companys strategy.
Restricted share awards will generally be used only when the foregone compensation was not subject to performance testing.
The Remuneration Committee may divide an award of restricted shares into tranches vesting at different points and may apply performance measures bespoke to the individual if it considers it appropriate.
If it decides to attach performance conditions, the performance conditions and period will be defined at grant.
In most instances, there are no performance conditions attached to these awards.
They will therefore vest in full if the individual remains in office on the vesting date.
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of awards of restricted shares.
Restricted shares may be used for the same purpose on the recruitment of other employees.
AstraZeneca also operates another restricted share plan the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan to provide LTI awards to eligible employees globally.
Currently Executive Directors and other senior executives are not eligible to participate in this plan.

In order to compile the charts below, the following assumptions have been made: Minimum Consists of the fixed elements of remuneration only: base salary, taxable benefits and pension.
remuneration Base salary is latest known salary, ie that applicable in 2014 as the Remuneration Committee will not determine base salaries for 2015 until the end of 2014.
Taxable benefits is taken from the corresponding figure in the Directors single total figure remuneration table as set out on page 105, with such sum annualised in the case of Mr Dunoyer.
Pension measured as a cash payment equivalent to 30% of base salary in the case of the CEO and 24% of base salary in the case of the CFO.

For the AZIP, the expected value on vesting is 100% of the value of the award at grant, and for the PSP, the expected value on vesting is 50% of the award at grant.
When granting LTI awards for the CEO, we apply a target expected value of 250% of base salary weighted 25% in favour of the AZIP ie 62.5% of base salary which provides for an award at face value of 62.5% of base salary, and 75% in favour of the PSP ie 187.5% of base salary which provides for an award at face value of 375% of base salary.
Accordingly, the combination of the AZIP and PSP awards for the CEO at an expected value of 250% provides a maximum number of shares under the awards with a face value of 437.5% of base salary.
When granting LTI awards for the CFO, we apply a target expected value of 200% of base salary, weighted 25% in favour of the AZIP ie 50% of base salary which provides for an award at face value of 50% of base salary, and 75% in favour of the PSP ie 150% of base salary which provides for an award at face value of 300% of base salary.
Accordingly, the combination of the AZIP and PSP awards for the CFO at an expected value of 200% provides a maximum number of shares under the awards with a face value of 350% of base salary.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 121 Corporate Governance | Directors Remuneration Report Approach to recruitment remuneration for Executive Directors The Company seeks to pay no more than necessary to recruit the best candidate available for a role as an Executive Director.
On the recruitment of a new Executive Director, the Company seeks to put in place a remuneration package which is broadly in line with the remuneration package applicable to relevant incumbent Executive Directors.
However, in order to offer a competitive package to the most capable candidate, the Company may consider providing remuneration arrangements that exceed those of existing Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee may also agree to pay allowances to expatriates in line with the Companys international assignment policy which provides for support towards housing, schooling and other relocation or assignment related costs.
The remuneration package offered to new recruits may include any element listed in the policy table above, or any other element which the Remuneration Committee considers is appropriate given the particular circumstances, with due respect to the interests of the Companys shareholders.
In considering which elements to include, and in determining the approach for all relevant elements, the Remuneration Committee will take into account a number of different factors, including typical market practice, existing arrangements for the other Executive Directors and internal relativities and market positioning.
The Company may reimburse the costs of financial planning and tax advice to Executive Directors.
The Company also provides Directors and Officers Liability Insurance and an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and the Companys Articles to all Executive Directors.
The Company may find it necessary to compensate a new recruit for forfeiture of entitlements from a previous employer.
The value of such compensation cannot be anticipated and will depend upon a range of factors including the circumstances of the individual in question.
In such circumstances, the Company will seek to offer a package weighted towards equity in the Company.
However, the precise nature of the compensation package will depend on the type of entitlement that the recruit is foregoing and which the Company will generally seek to compensate in kind: the buyout might therefore comprise cash and or restricted shares and or LTI.
The Remuneration Committee will obtain and take into account independent valuations of the entitlements to determine the appropriate level of compensation.
Shares which could be offered to the new recruit would be granted under LTI plans available at the time or under a plan specific to that individual as permitted under the Financial Conduct Authoritys Listing Rules.
Performance measures may apply to such share awards.
The Companys policy seeks to link the performance of the Executive Director to the performance of the Company in any given period.
The precise targets and measures will depend on the objectives of the Company and the individual at that time and will be determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The Company will not offer cash or shares to newly recruited Executive Directors as a bonus, or golden hello on joining other than to compensate for the loss of a previous remuneration opportunity.
Where compensation is offered to a new recruit on his or her hire, the Company will explain the reasons for this to shareholders in a timely manner, and will provide details of the payments.
Ongoing annual variable remuneration will not exceed an award which comprises up to 250% of base salary under the annual bonus and up to 500% of base salary under the PSP and up to 500% of base salary under the AZIP.
If the Remuneration Committee ever felt that it would be in the interests of shareholders to grant annual variable awards to a new Executive Director with values exceeding the historical range of 0 680% of base salary comprising up to 180% under the annual bonus and up to 500% in aggregate under the LTI plans, it would consult major shareholders in advance.
The Company intends to honour all remuneration arrangements previously entered into in the case of Group employees who are promoted to the position of an Executive Director.
122 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Service contracts for Executive Directors Save as noted below, it is not intended that service contracts for new Executive Directors will contain terms that are materially different from those summarised below or contained in the Policy set out in this Remuneration Policy Report.
The contractual obligations below are applicable to each of the current Executive Directors unless stated otherwise, and to the Executive Directors only.
Notice period The Company may terminate the employment of an Executive Director by giving not less than 12 months written notice.
The Company may agree, on the appointment of a new Executive Director, that any notice given by the Company will not expire prior to the second anniversary of the commencement date of the Executive Directors appointment.
The Company agreed to such a provision in the case of Mr Dunoyer.
An Executive Director may terminate his employment on 12 months written notice.
Payment in The Company may terminate an Executive Directors contract at any time with immediate effect and pay him a sum lieu of notice in lieu of notice.
This sum will consist of i the base salary that the relevant Executive Director would have been entitled to receive during the notice period: and ii the cost to the Company of funding the Executive Directors flexible benefit arrangements for this period, including the Companys contribution in respect of pension.
The payment in lieu of notice may be paid as a lump sum or the Company may decide to pay the first six months of the payment in lieu in equal monthly instalments, with the balance paid within 30 days of the final instalment being paid.
Garden leave If an Executive Director has given or been given notice of termination, the Company has the right to place the Executive Director on garden leave.
Summary The Company may terminate an Executive Directors employment summarily, in particular defined circumstances termination such as gross misconduct, with no further payment.
Payments in If, on termination, the relevant Executive Director has exceeded his accrued holiday entitlement, the value of this lieu of holiday excess may be deducted by the Company from any sums payable.
If the Executive Director has unused holiday, entitlement, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to require the Executive Director to take such unused holiday during any notice period, or make a payment in lieu of it calculated in the same way as the value of any excess holiday.
Directors and Directors and Officers Liability Insurance and an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and the Officers Liability Companys Articles is provided to the Executive Directors for the duration of their employment and for a minimum Insurance of five years following termination.
Deemed In respect of awards made to compensate Mr Soriot for loss of remuneration opportunity at his previous employer, treatment if Mr Soriot gives notice of termination of his employment after the end of the performance period under the AZIP under AZIP but before the end of the holding period, the award under the AZIP will vest on the earlier of the end of the holding and restricted period and the end of the period of 24 months from the date of cessation of employment, unless the Remuneration share award Committee determines otherwise.
If Mr Soriots employment is terminated by the Company other than in the event of prescribed misconduct events, his restricted share award will continue to subsist.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2013 123 Corporate Governance | Directors Remuneration Report Principles of payment for loss of office for Executive Directors The Company does not make additional payments for loss of office, other than, as appropriate, payments in lieu of notice as described above or payments in respect of damages if the Company terminates an Executive Directors service contract in breach of contract taking into account, as appropriate, the Directors ability to mitigate his loss.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to award payments in certain circumstances, as set out below, depending on the nature of the termination and the Executive Directors performance.
The LTI plans are governed by plan rules, which define how individual awards under those plans should be treated upon termination of employment.
Provision is also made for the treatment of awards in respect of corporate activity including sale of a business outside the Group.
The treatment of awards in these circumstances may also be subject to Remuneration Committee discretion.
Generally, awards under LTI plans will only be allowed to vest for those Executive Directors who leave the Company by mutual agreement, for example in circumstances of ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement, or where employment terminates by reason of the Executive Directors death see the table opposite for further information.
In addition to any payment in lieu of notice, the individual components of remuneration and other payments which may be payable on loss of office are set out below, subject to the terms of any applicable bonus rules or share incentive plan rules: Annual bonus An Executive Director may receive a bonus for the performance year in which he leaves the Company.
Typically this sum will reflect an on-target bonus pro-rated for the part of the year in which he worked.
This is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and will depend on the circumstances, including an assessment of the Executive Directors performance in the relevant period and the circumstances of his departure.
The deferred share element of previous bonuses granted, and any deferred share element of the bonus awarded in respect of the departing year, may still vest for the benefit of the departing Executive Director at the end of the period of deferral despite the fact that the Executive Director did not work for the entirety of this period.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to accelerate and or retain the deferral period and allow shares to vest for the benefit of the Executive Director on his departure and or in accordance with the vesting schedule as the case may be.
