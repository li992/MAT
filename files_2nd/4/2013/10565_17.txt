DIrECTorS rEporT 59 rEporT oF ThE noMInaTIon CoMMITTEE rEMunEraTIon rEporT continued A statement to shareholders from the Chairman of the remuneration Committee I am pleased to present the Directors report on remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2013.
This is my last report to shareholders, as I will be retiring from the Board during 2014.
I have very much enjoyed my involvement with the group and seeing significant improvements in performance over the years.
I have been keen to ensure that the remuneration strategy has been appropriate and relevant throughout the range of market conditions the group has faced.
Shareholder interests have always been foremost in our thinking, and they will certainly remain so for my successor.
as noted earlier in this report, the groups markets in 2013 remained challenging.
Whilst percentage profit margins were increased, there was insufficient improvement in the reported level of profits for any incentive awards to vest.
no bonus is payable for the CEo, CFo and Coo in respect of 2013 performance.
This also means they will not be able to participate in the 2014 Bonus Deferral Share Matching plan BDSMp.
For the 2011 award of the BDSMp, vesting was based on the compound annual growth rate Cagr in EpS from the 2010 base year over the three years to the end of the 2013 financial year.
Whilst profits and EpS did increase over that time, the Cagr of just under 6% was below the 8% start point for any matching shares to vest.
In demanding trading conditions, the significant stretch required for a threshold payout for the 2011 BDSMp was not achieved.
Long-Term Incentive plan LTIp awards granted in 2011 were also part-dependent on EpS performance.
This element therefore also did not vest for the LTIp, and neither did the other two measures used for this award TSr and roCE.
The Committee is still of the view that incentive payments must reflect the achievement of stretching performance targets that are aligned with shareholder interests.
at the same time, the effective pursuit of strategic objectives must be continued in challenging, less predictable market environments.
To emphasise this, strategic personal objectives will be added to executive Directors bonus plans for 2014 weighted 20%.
The Committee continues to take the approach that a significant part of the executive Directors packages should be linked to the long-term success of the group.
For the 2014 share incentive award targets, we again reviewed EpS targets against internal and external reference points, and have once more set what we consider a challenging range particularly against the uncertain market outlook.
on this basis, the existing 8%-15% pa range for the LTIp and the 8%-20% pa range for the BDSMp represent demanding targets over the next three years and remain appropriate for the 2014 award cycle.
roCE targets for the 2014 LTIp awards have again been reviewed, so that they reflect the returns the Board would expect to ensure that the groups roCE levels are maintained and enhanced.
at the same time, they put a strong emphasis on profit growth via the challenging EpS metrics.
The target range for group roCE has again been set at 33% to 37%, which the Committee still believes provides a significant degree of demanding performance.
For the 2014 bonus year, the Committees view is that the likely macroeconomic environment will continue to make effective cash management more important.
The operating Working Capital Sales % measure applied to the executive Directors bonus targets in 2013 will remain for another year.
This will accompany the main element of the bonus target of operating profit before one-off costs, as well as the new strategic personal objectives, described in the report.
over the last 12 months, we have engaged with our shareholders, and we value the views and feedback we have received.
We have again written to those with the largest shareholdings about our annual incentive arrangements and proposals to renew the employee Sharesave scheme.
We also consulted shareholders about the treatment of unvested incentive plans when the two former operating divisions were restructured as part of the one Morgan strategy.
We do discuss and consider feedback, and reflect on how to ensure overall remuneration should both be in the longer term interests of shareholders and meaningful for management.
I hope you will again find this balance appropriately reflected in the report that follows.
During the year, the Committee met five times, and its activities included: Consideration of whether the groups overall remuneration structure supports the groups business strategy.
a review of external benchmarking of executive remuneration packages.
Determination of the remuneration packages for the executive Directors and other group executives.
a review of whether the measures for the bonus and share incentive schemes remain appropriate.
Determination of appropriate performance targets for bonus and share incentive schemes.
Determination of whether targets for the bonus and share incentive schemes were achieved.
The presentation of this report is intended to be consistent with the new reporting regulations for executive remuneration, and I therefore hope we have been successful in achieving even greater clarity and transparency for our shareholders.

The Company has complied with the principles and provisions relating to Directors remuneration in the uK Corporate governance Code, and this remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large & Medium-sized Companies and groups accounts and reports amendment regulations 2013.
In accordance with Section 439a of the Companies act, a binding resolution to approve the Directors remuneration policy will be proposed at the agM on 9 May 2014. a second, advisory resolution to approve the annual report on remuneration will also be proposed at the agM.
remuneration Committee The remuneration Committee is responsible for developing group policy on executive remuneration and for determining, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for the executive Directors and the Chairman.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the groups website.
The remuneration Committee consults the Chief Executive officer and invites him to attend meetings when appropriate.
The Director of human resources attends meetings of the Committee by invitation.
The Committee also had access to advice from the Chief Financial officer.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
no executive Director or other attendee is present when his own remuneration is being discussed.
Membership of the Committee is shown on page 67.
1. poliCy report key principles of the executive directors remuneration policy The remuneration Committee aims to ensure that all the remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior executives of the right calibre in order to run the group successfully, and to create value for shareholders.
The Committee takes a longer-term perspective on retention and motivation, and although the short-term is important, the Committees view is that this has to be put in the context of the groups long-term interests.
The policy of the Committee is to ensure that a significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity is performance-related, with particular emphasis on long-term performance, and based on the achievement of measurable targets that are relevant to and support the business strategy.
This is in order to create a strong link between performance and reward which should be beneficial to shareholders, employees and the group.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Committee also takes into account the packages offered by similar companies to ensure the remuneration of executive Directors is competitive against the market in which the group competes for talent.
For the purposes of such analysis, comparator companies are chosen having regard to: business sector: the size of the company eg in terms of market capitalisation, turnover and number of people employed : the diversity and complexity of its businesses: and the geographical spread of its businesses.
The Committee also considers the level of pay and employment conditions throughout the group when determining executive Directors remuneration.
The Committee believes that the current remuneration policy for executive Directors which is set out over the following pages and is intended to apply for a period of three years, subject to shareholder approval at the 2014 agM is appropriate and supports the business strategy.
The remuneration Committee will keep remuneration policy under periodic review to ensure it remains aligned with the groups strategy, and in line with the principles set out in the uK Corporate governance Code in relation to Directors remuneration, as well as the guidance of institutional investors and their representative bodies.

The Company will also honour any commitment entered into at a time prior to an individual becoming a Director if, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
Details of these awards are, and will be, disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
difference in policy between executive directors and other employees The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as those described in this report for the executive Directors.
annual salary reviews across the group take into account business performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in comparable companies.
all executives are eligible to participate in an annual bonus scheme.
opportunities and performance measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individuals role.
other members of the group Executive Committee participate in the BDSMp and LTIp on similar terms to the executive Directors, although award sizes may vary according to each individual, and by organisational level.
Below this level, executives are eligible to participate in the LTIp and other share-based incentives, by annual invitation.
use of discretion To ensure fairness and align executive Director remuneration with underlying individual and group performance, the Committee may exercise its discretion to adjust, upwards or downwards, the outcome of any shortor long-term incentive plan payment within the limits of the relevant plan rules for corporate or exceptional events including, but not limited to: corporate transactions, changes in the groups accounting policies, minor or administrative matters, internal promotions, external recruitment, terminations, etc.
any adjustments in light of corporate events will be made on a neutral basis, ie to not be to the benefit or detriment of participants.
any use of discretion by the Committee during the financial year will be detailed in the relevant annual report on remuneration.
performance measure selection The Committee considers carefully the selection of performance measures at the start of each performance cycle, taking into consideration the macro-economic environment as well as specific group strategic objectives.
For the 2014 annual bonus, the Committee has decided to introduce a strategic personal objectives element for executive Directors and group Executives.
This is to ensure the continued focus on strategic priorities during the bonus year that are crucial for the groups overall strategy.
The 2014 objectives are described in the Implementation section of this report on page 72.
These will constitute a maximum of 20% of the total bonus target, alongside 60% for the EBITa target and 20% for the operating Working Capital Sales % element.
EBITa is selected to achieve alignment with measures used throughout the group.
operating Working Capital Sales % is selected as the most appropriate measure of effective cash management, involving four quarterly calculations, where working capital management in every month matters in the calculation, incentivising year-round performance.
LTIp performance measures are reviewed periodically to ensure they continue to align with the Companys strategy, as well as provide an appropriate balance between growth and returns, internal and external performance, and absolute and relative performance.
The TSr comparator group comprises the circa 110 constituents of the FTSE all-Share Industrials Index.
This benchmark is robust to M&a activity and comprises companies that are subject to the same market influences as Morgan advanced Materials.
The vesting performance range is calibrated to be stretching and in line with common market practice for FTSE TSr-based long-term incentives.
EpS targets have been set taking account of multiple relevant reference points, including internal forecasts, external expectations for future EpS performance at both Morgan advanced Materials and its closest sector peers, and typical EpS performance ranges at other FTSE 350 companies.
LTIp EpS performance ranges are set to represent demanding and challenging performance targets over the three-year performance period.
roCE targets have been set using a similar approach referring to external reference points and reflecting the returns required to meet and exceed the groups internal strategic plan.
For the BDSMp, the EpS performance range is set at very demanding levels of stretch for full vesting in recognition of the maximum matching opportunity awarded on an executive Directors own investment in the plan.
Morgan aDVanCED MaTErIaLS annuaL rEporT 2013 annuaL rEporT 2013 Morgan aDVanCED MaTErIaLS finAnCiAl direCtorS StrAtegiC overview StAteMentS report report 64 DIrECTorS rEporT rEMunEraTIon rEporT continued Share ownership guidelines In order to encourage alignment with shareholders, individual shareholding guidelines are operated for executive Directors.
under such guidelines, executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain over time a shareholding in the Company equivalent to at least 100% of basic salary.
This policy is supported by the BDSMp under which participants are encouraged to invest their bonus in Company shares.
From 2013 the shareholding guideline for the Chief Executive officer was increased to at least 150% of basic salary, as reported last year.
Current executive Director shareholdings are set out in the annual report on remuneration on page 75. external appointments With the approval of the Board in each case, and subject to the overriding requirements of the group, executive Directors may accept external appointments as non-executive Directors of other companies and retain any fees received.
Details of external directorships held by executive Directors along with fees retained are provided on page 72. pay-for-performance: scenario analysis The graphs below provide detailed illustrations of the potential future reward opportunity for executive Directors, and the potential mix between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Below Threshold, Target and Stretch.

For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for 2014.
For the BDSMp, the award opportunities assume full voluntary investment in Morgan advanced Materials shares.
It should be noted that any awards granted under the BDSMp and LTIp in a year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant.
This illustration is intended to provide further information to shareholders on the relationship between executive pay and performance.
The values of the BDSMp and LTIp assume no increase in the underlying value of the shares, and actual pay delivered will further be influenced by changes in factors such as the Companys share price and the value of dividends paid.
Further, the BDSMp requires an investment from an individuals annual bonus payment.
In years where the bonus is zero, no BDSMp opportunity will be available for the subsequent three-year period.

Morgan aDVanCED MaTErIaLS annuaL rEporT 2013 annuaL rEporT 2013 Morgan aDVanCED MaTErIaLS DIrECTorS rEporT 65 details of executive directors service contracts The executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment with Morgan advanced Materials plc.
Contracts may be terminated on 12 months notice given by the Company or on six months notice given by the executive Director concerned.
Contracts end on each executive Directors anticipated normal retirement date.
The following table shows the date of the contract for each executive Director who served during the year: notice period Date of Executive Director position Date of appointment service agreement From employer From employee Mark robertshaw CEo 4 august 2006 15 august 2008 12 months 6 months Kevin Dangerfield CFo 4 august 2006 15 august 2008 12 months 6 months andrew hosty Coo 28 July 2010 17 august 2010 12 months 6 months exit payments policy The groups policy is to limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements comprising base salary and benefits only.
In the event that the employment of an executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
The group may terminate the employment of executive Directors by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to base salary, together with the fair value of any other benefits to which the executive is contractually entitled under his service agreement, for the duration of the notice period.
The remuneration Committee will exercise discretion in making appropriate payments in the context of settling legal claims or potential legal claims by the departing executive Director, including any other amounts reasonably due to the executive Director, for example to meet the legal fees incurred by the executive Director in connection with the termination of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement and the individual must seek independent legal advice.
on termination of an executive Directors service contract, the remuneration Committee will consider the departing Directors duty to mitigate his loss when determining the timing of when any payment in lieu of notice will be made.
There is no automatic entitlement to bonus or the vesting of long-term incentives on termination.
however, the table below summarises the policy on how awards under the annual bonus and LTIp will normally be treated in specific circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to Committee discretion: treatment of awards on cessation of employment and a change of control reason for cessation Calculation of vesting payment Time of vesting annual bonus all reasons The Committee may determine that a bonus is payable on cessation of employment.
The amount of bonus payable will be determined in the context of the time served during the performance year, the performance of the group and of the individual over the relevant period, and the circumstances of the Directors loss of office.
If group or individual performance has been poor, or if the individuals employment has been terminated in circumstances amounting to misconduct, no bonus will be payable.
LTIp awards & BDSMp matching awards Injury, disability, death, awards will normally be pro-rated for time and will vest based on at the normal vesting date, redundancy, retirement, performance over the original performance period unless the unless the Committee decides or other such event as the Committee decides to measure performance to the date of cessation.

Internal promotion to the Board In cases of appointing a new executive Director by way of internal promotion, the policy will be consistent with that for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to executive Director, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements even if there are instances where they would not otherwise be consistent with the prevailing executive Director remuneration policy at the time of promotion.

Consideration of employment conditions The group seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodies including trade unions and works councils as part of its broader employee engagement strategy, and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the group operates.
In making remuneration decisions, the remuneration Committee also considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the group, but the Committee does not currently consult with employees specifically on executive remuneration policy and framework.
prior to the annual salary review, the remuneration Committee is briefed by the Director of human resources about pay increase data that individual business units will consider when deciding local pay awards for their specific businesses and countries.
This also forms part of the considerations for determining executive Director remuneration.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee considers shareholder views received during the year and at the annual general Meeting each year, as well as guidance from investor representative bodies more broadly, in shaping remuneration policy.
The Committee keeps the remuneration policy under regular review, to ensure it continues to reinforce the groups long-term strategy, and aligns executive Directors with shareholders interests.
It is the remuneration Committees policy to consult with major shareholders prior to any major changes to its executive remuneration policy.

incentive outcomes for the year ended 31 december 2013 Annual Bonus in respect of 2013 performance Targets for the annual bonus are set by the remuneration Committee, taking into account the shortand long-term requirements of the group.
Challenging goals are set, which must be met before any bonus is paid.
This approach is intended to align executive reward with shareholder return by rewarding the achievement of stretch targets.
For 2013, the bonus targets for the CEo, CFo and Coo were split between group EBITa before restructuring weighted 80% and Third-party operating Working Capital to Sales % weighted 20%.
The targets were set to incentivise the executive Directors to deliver stretching profit and cash performance for the group.
In addition to the achievement of the targets set, in considering any awards to be made, the Committee also takes into account the quality of the overall performance of the group.
The table below sets out the total bonus entitlement for each Director for 2013.
The specific bonus targets for 2013 are shown below the table: group EBITa operating Working Capital Sales % Quarterly target Max bonus % max.

For the operating Working Capital Sales % element, the four quarterly targets were 22.0%, 21.1%, 21.3% and 20.6% respectively, with each quarter being measured independently.

2011 LTIP award vesting awards granted to the CEo and CFo in 2011 were subject to relative TSr and EpS performance targets.
The EpS target applying to 50% of each award required three-year EpS growth of 8% pa for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting for EpS growth of 15% pa or higher.
The TSr target applying to the other 50% of each award required Morgan advanced Materials three-year TSr performance to rank at median against constituents of the FTSE all-share Industrials Index for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan advanced Materials TSr ranked at or above the upper quartile against this Index.
The performance period for the 2011 LTIp awards ended on 31 December 2013. over the period: Morgan advanced Materials EpS growth for LTIp purposes was 6% pa, which is below the threshold performance target and accordingly none of the award vested under this criterion.
Morgan advanced Materials TSr was 39%, which was below median versus the FTSE all-share Industrials Index.
accordingly, none of the award vested under this criterion.
This combined performance resulted in none of the 2011 LTIp awards vesting.
For the award granted to andrew hosty in 2011, as CEo of the former Morgan Ceramics Division, half of the incentive was linked to group TSr as for the CEo and CFo and half was based on a Ceramics Division EBITa roCE matrix.
This Divisional portion of the 2011 LTIp would only vest if stretching performance was achieved, with no vesting occurring unless EBITa growth in the former Morgan Ceramics Division was at least 12% pa and roCE was 35.7% in 2013: full vesting would have occurred for EBITa growth of 18% pa and roCE of 40.7%.
The combined performance resulted in none of 2011 LTIp awards vesting.

For CSop awards, see the plan details on page 79. pensions The three executive Directors participate in The Morgan group Senior Staff pension and Life assurance Scheme which is a contributory, hMrC-registered, defined benefit, funded occupational pension scheme.
With effect from 6 april 2006 the basis of the scheme switched from final salary to career average and the normal pension age increased by five years.
Its main features are now: a normal pension age of 65. pension at normal pension age based on two-thirds career average pensionable salary, for those with at least 20 years 26 years and eight months for joiners since 2006 potential service to age 65 on joining.
Life assurance of four times basic salary.
pensionable salary is the members basic salary restricted to an earnings cap of 140,400 for Kevin Dangerfield and andrew hosty and 110,437 for Mark robertshaw for the 2013-14 tax year.
It is proposed that these earnings caps will reduce to 117,375 for Kevin Dangerfield, 128,200 for andrew hosty and 88,350 for Mark robertshaw for the 2014-15 tax year in response to the reduction in hMrCs annual allowance from 50,000 to 40,000.

The Committee discusses and reviews the performance criteria for new three-year LTIp awards before they are granted.
For the awards granted in 2013, the Committee considered its desire to have the most relevant balance of measures that reflected feedback from shareholders and directly related to the stretching objectives in the groups business plan.
The Committee decided to maintain the equal one-third basis of the three performance criteria introduced in 2012, as follows: group % of award % of award average % of award TSr against FTSE all-Share Industrials Index that vests EpS growth that vests roCE that vests upper quartile 33% 15% pa 33% 37% 33% Median 10% 8% pa 10% 33% 10% Below median nil 8% pa nil 33% nil Morgan aDVanCED MaTErIaLS annuaL rEporT 2013 annuaL rEporT 2013 Morgan aDVanCED MaTErIaLS Matching shares finAnCiAl direCtorS StrAtegiC overview StAteMentS report report 72 DIrECTorS rEporT rEMunEraTIon rEporT continued exit payments made in year The auditors are required to report on this information.

For 2014, executive Directors increases will be implemented with effect from 1 January.
In considering the level of increase, the Committee has been mindful of the range of increases to be awarded across the group of 3% on average, as well as the positioning of roles against the market.
Increases for all employees take into account local business unit commercial and market considerations.
The table below shows the salaries in 2013, and those which took effect from 1 January 2014: Base salary at: Increase Executive Director position 1 January 2014 1 March 2013 Mark robertshaw CEo 507,500 495,000 2.5% Kevin Dangerfield CFo 315,000 300,000 5.0% andrew hosty Coo 346,800 340,000 2.0% In agreeing the increase for Kevin Dangerfield, the Committee took into consideration his sustained strong performance, relevant market data, and the range of salary increases awarded to other strong performers in the group.
Annual bonus no changes will be made to the total annual bonus opportunity in 2014.
For 2014, the financial performance measures for executive Directors bonuses will be based 60% on EBITa before other one-offs and 20% on third-party working capital to sales.
In addition, and new for 2014, the Committee has decided to emphasise the need for continuing focus on strategic objectives during challenging, less predictable market environments.
To reflect this, strategic personal objectives will be added to executive Directors bonus plans for 2014, and will constitute up to 20% of the overall bonus.
The three strategic personal objective target areas for the executive Directors will be scored individually, and relate to technology, talent and portfolio reshaping.
The actual performance targets set at the beginning of the performance period are not disclosed as they are considered commercially sensitive at this time given the close link between performance measures and the groups longer-term strategy.
We will disclose these targets at such point that the Committee considers they are no longer commercially sensitive.
BDSMP award Executive Directors are unable to participate in the BDSMp for 2014 as no bonus was earned during 2013 and, therefore, there is no bonus to defer.

The earnings caps that apply to executive Director pensions will reduce to 117,375 for Kevin Dangerfield, 128,200 for andrew hosty and 88,350 for Mark robertshaw for the 2014-15 tax year.
pension allowances will also be reviewed by the Committee in light of this change to the annual allowance, consistent with the principle that the impact of any changes should be broadly cost-neutral.
Chairman and non-executive Director fees non-executive Directors fees were last reviewed in December 2012. at this time to the base fee was increased to 46,000 pa with effect from 1 January 2013.

The uK employee workforce was chosen as a suitable comparator group as the CEo is based in the uK albeit with a global role and responsibilities and pay changes across the group vary widely depending on local market conditions.
although similar remuneration principles apply across the wider group, pay decisions for this subset are impacted by similar external market forces eg wage inflation, local practice with respect to the provision of benefits, etc.

Morgan aDVanCED MaTErIaLS annuaL rEporT 2013 DIrECTorS rEporT 79 details of plans ltip plan Details For the CFo and Coo who, at the time of the award, was CEo Morgan Ceramics, awards were structured as an approved performance Share plan apSp and comprise three elements: i hM revenue & Customs hMrC approved options CSop over shares to the value of up to 30,000 with an exercise price of 205.1 pence per share: ii an LTIp award in the form of a conditional award of free shares to the value of the remainder of the award above this limit: and iii a funding award, also in the form of a conditional award of free shares, over such numbers of shares whose value at exercise at the approved option equals up to 30,000.
For the CEo, the 2010 award was structured as an LTIp award in the form of a conditional award of free shares.
2010 The provisions of these CSop options, funding awards and LTIp awards was linked so that the maximum aggregate number of shares that could be acquired on exercise of LTIp and CSop awards the funding award being used to pay the exercise price arising on exercise of the CSop was limited to that number of shares that had a market value on the date of the awards equal to 100% of Kevin Dangerfields 2009 base salary and 240,000 for andrew hosty.
Vested funding awards were not transferable to the participant.
Measures and targets are provided in the notes to the single figure table.
awards granted to the CEo and CFo in 2011 are subject to relative TSr and EpS.
The EpS target applying to 50% of each award requires three-year EpS growth above a threshold of 8% pa of that element to vest, commencing at 30% vesting for that element, rising to full vesting for EpS growth of 15% pa or higher.
The TSr target applying to the other 50% of each award requires Morgan advanced Materials three-year TSr performance to rank at median against the FTSE all-Share Industrials Index for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan advanced Materials TSr ranks at or above the upper quartile against the companies in this index.
2011 For the Coo who, at the time of the award, was CEo Morgan Ceramics, half of the 2011 incentive is linked to group TSr as for the CEo and CFo and half is based on a Ceramics Division EBITa roCE matrix.
This Divisional portion of the 2011 LTIp will only vest if stretching performance is achieved, with no vesting occurring unless EBITa growth in Morgan Ceramics is at least 12% pa and roCE is 35.7% in 2013: full vesting will occur for EBITa growth of 18% pa and roCE of 40.7%.
The award for the CFo was structured on the same basis as the 2010 award.
The awards for the CEo and Coo were structured as an LTIp in the form of a conditional award of free shares.
awards granted to the CEo and CFo in 2012 are subject to relative TSr, EpS and roCE.
The EpS target applying to a third of each award requires three-year EpS growth above a threshold of 8% pa of that element to vest, commencing at 30% vesting for that element, rising to full vesting for EpS growth of 15% pa or higher.
The TSr target applying to another third of each award requires Morgan advanced Materials three-year TSr performance to rank at median against the FTSE all-Share Industrials Index for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan advanced Materials TSr ranks at or above the upper quartile against the companies in this Index.

roCE is measured as the average annual roCE over the three-year performance period.
For the Coo who, at the time of the award was CEo Morgan Ceramics, 1 3 of the award was to vest on relative TSr, with the remaining 2 3 to vest on a divisional EBITa roCE matrix.
For the EBITa roCE element, there would have been 2012 no vesting unless EBITa growth in Morgan Ceramics was at least 6% pa and roCE is 41.0% in 2014: full vesting would have occurred for EBITa growth of 15% pa and roCE of 43.5%.
In May 2013, following the announced change in divisional structure, and following consultation with shareholders, it was decided to change these targets for andrew hosty to make them relevant to his new role as Coo.
prior to the announcement of the reorganisation, just over one year of the three-year 2012 LTIp performance period had elapsed.
To reflect the group-wide remit of his new role as Coo, and to help ensure his interests are aligned with those of the CEo, CFo and shareholders, it was agreed that the Ceramics divisional targets attached to his 2012 LTIp be replaced by group targets aligned with those attached to the 2012 LTIp awards awarded to the CEo and CFo, as detailed above.
It was also agreed that for the purpose of alignment across the executive Directors, performance against these revised targets will be assessed over the full, original three year performance period ie 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014. awards granted to executive Directors in 2013 are subject to relative TSr, EpS and roCE.
The TSr target applying to another third of each award requires Morgan advanced Materials three-year TSr performance to rank at median against the FTSE all-Share Industrials Index 2013 for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan advanced Materials TSr ranks at or above the upper quartile against the companies in this Index.
The roCE element has been set for a 33-37% pa range, vesting on a straight-line basis, with 30% of the measure vesting at the 33% threshold.
