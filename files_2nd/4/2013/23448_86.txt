Annual Report on Remuneration This is the first occasion that the Directors have submitted this report in accordance with the requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
An Ordinary Resolution for the approval of this report will be put to members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The law requires the Companys Auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited they are indicated as such.
Remuneration and Nomination Committee The Remuneration and Nomination Committee comprises all the non-executive Directors of the Company.
The Board considers it appropriate, given the number of non-executive Directors, that all Directors should be members of the Committee.
The Committee met three times in the year.
Ms L Webber was the Chairman of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and Senior Independent Director during the year until her resignation at the Annual General Meeting on 7 March 2013.
Ms K Barker was appointed Chairman of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and Senior Independent Director in succession to Ms Webber.
The Committee did not consider it necessary to recommend any changes to the existing fee arrangements during the year which are set out in the Future Policy Table of the Remuneration Policy.
Ms Barker proposed that she should not be paid the additional fees to which she would be entitled as the Chairman of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and the Senior Independent Director 3,000 and 6,000 respectively in full and the Committee agreed, in her absence, that she should be paid a total of 6,000 to cover both roles.
The Company has no employees.

The Directors were not entitled to any variable pay based on the achievement of performance conditions in future periods in the year ended 30 September 2013 2012: nil.
No payments were made to any person who was not a Director of the Company at the time the award was made but had previously been a Director of the Company, other than sums disclosed in the Single Total Figure Table in the year ended 30 September 2013 2012: nil.
No loss of office payments were made to any person who served as a Director of the Company at any time during the year ended 30 September 2013 2012: nil.
72 As the Company does not have a Chief Executive Officer or any employees apart from its Directors it is not possible to compare the percentage increase in remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer with that of all the employees of the Company as a whole.
Relative Importance of Spend on Pay 2012 2013 000 % 000 % Spend Profit retained 113,645 100.00 95,210 100.00 Overall expenditure on Directors Fees 302 0.27 323 0.34 The Directors consider it appropriate to compare the overall expenditure on Directors fees with the profit retained to demonstrate the relative scale of these figures to each other.
It is not meaningful to compare the overall expenditure on Directors fees with the amounts distributed by dividend or share buybacks and with employee remuneration as these amounts were nil for the current and previous financial years.
Total Shareholder Return The Directors consider that, since the Company invests in a broad range of commercial sectors, the FTSE All-Share Index is the most appropriate index against which to compare the Companys performance.
