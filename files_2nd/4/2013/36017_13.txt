James Fisher and Sons plc Directors Remuneration report Annual Statement Introduction by Malcolm Paul, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to present our Directors Remuneration report for 2013 for which we will be seeking your approval at our 2014 Annual General Meeting AGM.
The Directors Remuneration report is presented to comply with the new reporting requirements on directors remuneration and is in two principal sections.
The first section on the Remuneration Policy Report, summarises the policy of the Board for the remuneration of the Directors and is a restatement of the existing policy updated in light of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 Regulation.
The main changes relate to the policies for recruitment and termination.
The second section, the Annual Report on Remuneration, describes how that policy has been implemented in 2013 and how it will operate in 2014 and provides details on the Remuneration Committee.
We are seeking shareholder approval at the AGM of the Remuneration Policy Report by way of a binding resolution and plan to put this section of the report to a binding vote every three years, unless there are changes to our policy requiring shareholder approval.
The Annual Report on Remuneration will be put to the AGM each year on an advisory vote basis.
The Remuneration Policy will commence on 1 January 2014 but not become formally effective until the 2014 AGM, assuming shareholder approval is obtained.
During the year the Committee held three meetings.
Matters discussed included the annual salary review, bonus targets, long term incentive awards and prior year performance against targets.
The Committee also reviewed the remuneration arrangements of senior management across the Group.
The Committee has always endeavoured to be clear and transparent in matters of remuneration and consider that the new report format continues this approach by being easy to understand and informative.
Transition of Board structure and remuneration Tim Harris retired as Executive Chairman on 31 July 2012.
The Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee decided that his successor, Charles Rice, would be appointed on a non-executive basis but be expected to allocate the majority of his time to this role given the transition from the previous structure.
The number of Executive Directors then reduced from three to two - Nick Henry, Chief Executive Officer, and Stuart Kilpatrick, Group Finance Director - with a corresponding increase in their responsibilities.
During 2013 James Fisher and Sons plc also joined the FTSE 250 Index.
During this transition, the Remuneration Committee has implemented phased increases in the salaries of Nick Henry and Stuart Kilpatrick on 1 August 2012, 1 January 2013 and 1 January 2014 to bring them to a level more appropriate to their new level of responsibilities and the size of the Company.
The Committee consider that this adjustment phase has now been substantially completed with the 1 January 2014 review.
2013 performance and remuneration During the year ended 31 December 2013, James Fisher and Sons plc delivered another strong trading performance with revenue increased by 14% and underlying profit before tax up by 18% on previous year.
The decisions made by the Committee in relation to executive remuneration outcomes were taken in the context of this performance.
In the context of the transition process noted above, Charles Rices fee as Non-Executive Chairman was increased by 10% to 220,000 on 1 January 2013.
Fifty per cent of this fee, net of tax, is used to purchase shares to be held throughout his period in office.
Nick Henrys salary increased by 15% to 375,000 and Stuart Kilpatricks by 16% to 255,000.
Fees for Non-Executive Directors were increased by 3%.
Annual bonuses for the Executive Directors, which are based on a combination of the achievement of individual and Company objectives paid out at the maximum level of 70% of base salary.
Awards under the Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP made in 2011 will vest in full on 6 April 2014 having achieved the maximum target of earnings per share EPS growth over the Retail Prices Index RPI over the three year period to 31 December 2013.
Awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS made in 2011 are expected to vest in full in 2014 having exceeded the upper quartile target for total shareholder return TSR.
Remuneration policy for 2014 Other than as described above, the Remuneration Committee has decided not to make changes to the remuneration framework and policy this year.
The decisions we have taken within the terms of our existing policies have been designed to both reward performance that benefits shareholders and focus management on delivering the agreed business strategy.
As part of the transition phase, on 1 January 2014 Nick Henrys salary was increased by 9% to 410,000 and Stuart Kilpatricks by 8% to 275,000.
The annual fees of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors increased by 2.5%.
As appropriate, the Company will continue to engage and communicate to shareholders regarding the Companys remuneration policy and to take suitable action when required.
I hope you will join me in supporting the two resolutions in respect of this years Directors Remuneration report at the AGM on 1 May 2014.
Malcolm Paul Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 3 March 2014 30 Strategic report Governance Financial statements James Fisher and Sons plc Remuneration Policy Report Overview of Directors Remuneration Policy James Fisher and Sons plc operates in a competitive international environment.
For the Company to continue to compete successfully, it is essential that the level of remuneration and benefits offered achieves the objective of attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding the necessary high calibre of individuals at all levels across the Company.
The Company therefore sets out to provide competitive remuneration to all its employees, appropriate to the business environment in those countries in which it operates.
The remuneration strategy is designed not only to align with the Companys fundamental values of fairness, competitiveness and equity, but also to support the Companys corporate strategy, as a significant contributor to competitive advantage.
A cohesive reward structure with a timely pay review process, consistently applied to all employees, with links to corporate performance is seen as critical in ensuring all employees can associate with, and are focused on, the attainment of the Companys strategic goals.
In line with this the remuneration package for the Executive Directors is normally reviewed annually.
Where an Executive Directors responsibilities change during the course of a year, the Committee will consider whether a remuneration review is appropriate outside of the annual review process.
Executive remuneration reviews are based upon the following principles: Total rewards should be set at appropriate levels to reflect the competitive market in which the Company operates, and to provide a fair and attractive remuneration package.
Reward elements should be designed to reinforce the link between performance and reward.
The majority of the total remuneration package should be linked to the achievement of appropriate performance targets.
Executive Directors incentives should be aligned with the interests of shareholders.
This is achieved through setting performance targets to reward increase in shareholder value and through the Committees policy to encourage shareholding by Executive Directors.
How the Executive Directors Remuneration Policy relates to the wider Group The Remuneration Policy set out within this report provides an overview of the structure that operates for the senior executives in the Group.
Employees below executive level have a lower proportion of their total remuneration made up of incentive-based remuneration, with remuneration driven by market comparators and the impact of the role of the employee in question.
Long-term incentives are reserved for those judged as having the greatest potential to influence the Groups earnings growth and share price performance.
While the Remuneration Committee considers pay and conditions across the workforce when reviewing and setting the Executive Director remuneration policy, the Committee does not consult with employees on this matter at the current time.
How shareholders views are taken into account The Committee takes an active interest in shareholder views on our Remuneration Policy and is mindful of the concerns of shareholders and other stakeholders.

Notes: 1 The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus reflect the Committees belief that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging and tied to both the delivery of profit growth and personal objectives.
2 The TSR and EPS performance conditions applicable to the LTIP and ESOS were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term returns to shareholders and the Groups financial growth and are consistent with the Companys objective of delivering superior levels of long-term value to shareholders.
The TSR performance condition is assessed on the Committees behalf by New Bridge Street whilst EPS growth is derived from the audited financial statements.
3 The Committee operates its share plans in accordance with the plan rules and the Listing Rules and the Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the plans e. g. treatment of awards for leavers, change of control, adjustments to performance targets.
4 Consistent with HMRC legislation, the all-employee SRSOS does not have performance conditions.
5 In approving the Directors Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any past commitments entered into with current or former Directors such as the vesting of share awards granted in the past.

For external appointments, the Committee may offer additional cash or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive when leaving a previous employer.
It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments as soon as practicable following the appointment.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its original terms.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and incidental expenses as appropriate.
Loss of office The Committee has considered remuneration for Executive Directors leaving the Company and is committed to applying consistent and equitable approach to ensure the Company pays no more than necessary.
The loss of office policy is in line with market practice and will be dependent on whether deemed a good leaver or bad leaver.
The good leaver policy includes: payment in lieu of notice equal to one years basic salary or, if termination is part way through the notice period, the amount of salary relating to any unexpired notice to the date of termination.
There is an obligation on Directors to mitigate any loss which they may suffer if the Company terminates their service contract: bonus payments for the period worked may be made, subject to the original performance targets, at the discretion of the Committee.
Any such payments would be made on the normal payment date: vesting of share scheme awards is not automatic and the Committee retains the discretion to prevent awards from lapsing depending on the circumstances of the departure and the best interests of the Company.
Awards which do not lapse on cessation of employment may either vest at that time or on the normal vesting date.
These awards will usually be subject to time pro-rating to reflect the unexpired portion of the performance period concerned.
Awards that are subject to performance conditions will usually only vest to the extent that these conditions are satisfied: and Executive Directors will also be entitled to a payment in respect of accrued but untaken annual holiday entitlements on termination.
Good leaver reasons are death, injury, illness or disability, redundancy, retirement, transfer of business resulting in cessation of the individuals employment within the Group or change of control.
No compensation is paid for summary dismissal, save for any statutory entitlements.
33 James Fisher and Sons plc Directors Remuneration report Service contracts It is the Boards policy that Executive Directors are employed on contracts subject to no more than twelve months notice from either side.

Where there are substantial votes against resolutions in relation to Directors remuneration, the Company seeks to understand the reasons for any such vote and will report any actions in response to it.
The following table sets out actual voting in respect of our 2012 Directors Remuneration Report at the 2013 AGM: Votes withheld Resolution Text Votes for % for Votes against % against Total votes cast abstentions To approve the Directors Remuneration report 29,607,357 79.8% 7,499,985 20.2% 39,674,659 2,567,317 Following comments by corporate governance and proxy voting agencies on the treatment of Tim Harris 2012 bonus and his remaining LTIP and ESOS share awards on his retirement on 31 July 2012, a number of shareholders voted against the Directors Remuneration Report.
It was highlighted that the standard approach in respect of such matters is that they should be pro-rated for time, except in exceptional circumstances.
The Board took the view that exceptional circumstances did exist because: he had led the transformation of the Companys fortunes over ten years: during that time profits had risen 370% and the share price had increased sevenfold: underlying profit before tax in 2012 was over 20% up in the first half and 18% up over the year as a whole: and he had provided for an orderly succession enabling the Company to continue its rapid development.
The Board on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee therefore decided that while his 2012 LTIP and ESOS schemes would be cancelled in full, his 2012 bonus and his 2010 and 2011 share schemes, which were all more than half way through their qualifying periods, would be allowed to stand.
This was on the basis that any eventual awards under these schemes would anyway be dependent on the Company meeting its profit and performance targets.
In the case of poor performance these awards would not be payable.
