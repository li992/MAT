Strategic Report Governance Financials Shareholder information Melrose Industries PLC 75 Annual Report 2013 Governance Chief Executive Officers remuneration for previous five years In accordance with the new regulations governing the reporting of Directors remuneration the total figure of remuneration set out in the table below includes the value of long-term incentive vesting in respect of the financial year.
This means that the full value of the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan on 11April 2012 is shown for the year ending 31December 2012 and no value will be reflected in the total figure of remuneration for the 2012 Incentive Plan until the trigger date which will be May 2017 or an earlier trigger date determined in accordance with the arrangements.
The value of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan was earned over a period of approximately five years.
Therefore, in the view of the Remuneration Committee inclusion of this value in respect of the year ended 31December 2012 does not give a fair representation of the Chief Executive Officers yearly remuneration over each of the previous five years.
Therefore, an additional column has been added to the table below to show total remuneration excluding the value received on the maturity in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan.
No other long-term incentive plan vested in favour of any executive Director in any of the other years.

2 O n the crystallisation in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Shares awarded in 2009, participants in the 2009 Incentive Share Plan as a whole were entitled to 10% of the increase in shareholder value from 18July 2007 to 23March 2012.
As the value derived on the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Shares depended upon the shareholder value created over the relevant period, it is not possible to express the value derived as a percentage of the maximum opportunity.
The crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Shares was satisfied by the conversion of those shares into Ordinary Shares.

appointment, the Remuneration Committee will explain to shareholders the rationale for the arrangements implemented.
Element Approach Incentive remuneration The Remuneration Committees intention is that a new executive Directors incentive remuneration opportunity opportunity will consist of: an annual bonus up to a maximum of 100% of salary i. e. as applies for existing executive Directors : and an award of options over 2012 Incentive Shares, with the number of such shares awarded being equal to the number of such shares over which an existing executive Director was granted an option in April 2012, asreduced to take into account the proportion of the 2012 Incentive Plans life that has elapsed at the time ofthe new executive Directors appointment.
The Remuneration Committees intention is that a new executive Director would only participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan on this basis if he she had a similar level of experience and responsibility as the existing executive Directors.
If a new executive Director did not participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan, the Remuneration Committee may award a maximum annual bonus opportunity of up to 300% of salary until such time as a new longterm incentive arrangement is put in place for the executive Directors in which that new executive Director couldparticipate.
Compensation for Whilst considered unlikely, the Remuneration Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to forfeited remuneration buy out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Remuneration arrangements Committee will have regard to relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to such arrangements, the form of those awards e. g. cash or shares and the timeframe of such awards.
While such awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to below, the Remuneration Committees intention is that the value awarded as determined by the Remuneration Committee on a fair and reasonable basis would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements.
Where considered appropriate, buy-out awards will be subject to forfeiture or clawback on early departure.
Notice period The notice period will be the same as the Companys ordinary policy of 12 months.
Relocation costs Where necessary, the Company will pay appropriate relocation costs.
The Remuneration Committee will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary.
Retirement benefits The maximum contribution of 15% of salary referred to in the policy table on page 79 will apply to any new executive Director.
However, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to pay the contribution into any pension arrangement or to pay the amount as a supplement to base salary in lieu of a pension arrangement.
