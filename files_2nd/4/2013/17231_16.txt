For 2013 14, the Committee has increased the weighting for personal objectives metrics to 20%.
This is intended to drive greater emphasis on personal impact in the business.
Long term incentives are based on EPS and like-for-like sales growth to support a sustainable approach to growth.
The mix of the total remuneration package and the use of stretching performance targets ensures that there is alignment between pay and performance.
In 2013 14, in addition to the EPS and sales growth measures, we will introduce a ROCE underpin to reinforce a focus on efficient use of capital.
The like-for-like sales growth stretch target will be set at IGD 1% and the EPS performance range will be set at 1% to 10% above RPI, which the Committee believes remains challenging and reflects the structure and Johanna Waterous strategic growth priorities of the business.
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee As a Committee, we are mindful of our responsibilities and review executive remuneration arrangements with a critical eye on Dear Shareholder corporate governance.
We also welcome the recently published guidance from BIS in this regard.
With this in mind, we have raised the shareholding guideline for Executive Directors from 100% to The Remuneration Committee remains 200% of salary, to be achieved over five years.

Therefore no bonus payments will be made to Executive Directors for 2012 13 and the 2010 13 LTIP will not vest.
In addition, there will be no Johanna Waterous base salary increases for Executive Directors for 2013 14.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Remuneration Committee and I strongly believe that these remuneration outcomes are appropriate given the performance of the business, and it demonstrates to shareholders that incentives for executives will only pay out when stretching performance targets have been achieved.
Looking forward the Committee remains focused on encouraging a strong performance culture, positioning pay competitively whilst doing the right things for our shareholders.
In response to shareholders feedback, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed our reward policies and made a number of changes with effect from 2013 14.

Dilution and share usage Awards under the Groups share option scheme under which no options remain outstanding and the SAYE scheme are satisfied by the issue of new shares within the limits agreed by shareholders when the plans were approved.
These limits comply with the Association of British Insurers guidelines restricting dilution from employee share plans.
The overall limits under the guidelines are that no more than 10% of a Groups issued share capital may be used in any ten year period.
Within the 10% limit, up to 5% may be used for discretionary share plans.
As at 3 February 2013, the Groups share usage against these limits was 6.57% and 1.53%, respectively.
It is currently intended that awards made under the LTIP will be satisfied by market purchased shares which are held in an Employee Benefit Trust.
Market purchase shares will also be used to satisfy awards made under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan and restricted share plans.
