Except in exceptional circumstances where approved in advance by the Chairman of the Committee, if an executive director holds non-executive positions at more than one listed company then only the fees from one such company will be retained by the director.
No formal limit on other board appointments applies to non-executive directors under the policy but prior approval not to be unreasonably withheld from the Chairman on behalf of the Board is required in the case of any new appointment.
In the case of the Chairman, prior approval of the Nomination Committee is required on behalf of the Board.
