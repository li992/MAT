The 2011 PSP and the 2011 SMP awards for which the performance periods ended on 31 December 2013 did not meet their performance conditions and lapsed see page 95 for more detail.
As reported in the prior year, the 2010 PSP and SMP awards for which the performance periods ended on 31 December 2012 also lapsed.
5 The figures in this column have been calculated in line with the method set out in section 229 of the Finance Act 2004 using a capitalisation factor of 20 to assess the increase in the value of the pension promise over the year, net of inflation.
Therefore, these figures are sensitive tosalary increases and Consumer Prices Index CPI inflation as follows: Salary increase: As pensionable salary is averaged over three years, the figures for Peter Lynas still show the effect of the promotional increase following his appointment as Group Finance Director.
CPI inflation: In a year with high CPI inflation, the increase in the value of the pension promise would be lower than in a year with lower CPIinflation.
Linda Hudsons 2013 pension figure is impacted by the change in accrual rate as detailed on page 97.
6 This column includes i for Ian King, the value of Free Share awards under the UK all-employee Share Incentive Plan SIP and Matching Shares under voluntary investment in the SIP: ii for Peter Lynas, Free Share awards under the SIP and tax-exempt health-screening: and iii for Linda Hudson, the value of the 2013 grant under the Restricted Share Plan RSP and corresponding prior year figure.
This award formed part of Linda Hudsons 2013 LTIP allocation but is required to be reported under Other as it has no performance conditions attached see page 99 for calculation of the RSP figure.

2 The defined benefit figure includes both funded and unfunded arrangements for Ian King and Peter Lynas: and includes both Qualified and Non-Qualified plans forLinda Hudson.
3 Linda Hudson is a member of a US retirement plan which provides a cash sum at retirement equal to a percentage of career average pay.
The accrued benefit shown above is a cash lump sum payable at normal retirement age.
In addition, Linda Hudson participates in a Section 401 k defined contribution arrangement setup for US employees in which the company will match employee contributions up to a limit.
In 2013, the company paid contributions of 9,780 into this 401 k arrangement.
Current UK executive directors are members of the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme ExPS and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 2000 Plan which together provide a pension for executive directors payable at 62 of 1 30th of three-year final average salary for each year of service subject to the payment of members contributions currently 8%.
Benefits paid prior to age 62 will be subject to actuarial reduction.
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target benefit for executive directors payable from normal retirement age of 1 30th of Final Pensionable Pay FPP for each year of ExPS pensionable service subject to a maximum of two-thirds of FPP.
FPP is defined as annual base salary averaged over the last 12 months prior to leaving service in respect of service accrued to 5 April 2006 and 36 months prior to leaving in respect of service from 6 April 2006.
The ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-service benefit equal to four times base salary atdate of death, and a spouses death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of the prospective pension at normal retirement age.
Childrens allowances are also payable, usually up to the age of 18.
Spouses pensions and childrens allowances are also payable upon death in retirement and death after leaving the Companys employment with a deferred pension.
Once in payment, pensions are increased annually bythe rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum increase of 5% per year in respect of pre-6 April 2006 service and 2.5% per year inrespect of service from 6 April 2006.
96 BAE SyStEMS ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Governance GOVERNANCE The review of pension policies carried out in 2010 by the Committee concluded that the pension benefits should continue to be based on theCompanys registered pension schemes and that, in appropriate circumstances, the Company will continue to have the option to offer an unfunded pension promise so as to mitigate the impact of further reductions to the Lifetime Allowance introduced in 2006 and the impact of the reduced Annual Allowance.
The current executive directors were given the choice to remain in the current arrangement and pay the increased tax or to take an unfunded promise: they both elected for the latter.
The Committee has decided that in cases where the Company is to pay anunfunded promise, executives will be given the choice to commute some or all of the benefit for a taxable lump sum, or take it as pension.
Where an unfunded pension is taken, ten years after retirement, the executive will be given a further opportunity to commute the residual valueof the unfunded pension for a lump sum.
As stated above, Ian King and Peter Lynas already have an unfunded promise from the Company arising from the 2006 changes to the taxation of pension benefits, which has been extended to cover the reduced Annual Allowance at no additional cost to the Company.
Ian King and Peter Lynas are both members of the 2000 Plan, applicable to former employees of Marconi Electronic Systems MES, and members of the ExPS with a normal retirement age of 62.
The 2000 Plan provides a pension of 1 50th of Final Pensionable Earnings FPE for each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement age of 65 and members pay contributions of 8% of Pensionable Earnings.
FPE under the 2000 Plan is the best consecutive three-year average of base salary and bonus in the ten Plan Years prior to leaving, less an offset for State pensions.
The Company decided in 2006 to limit pensionable bonuses in the 2000 Plan in the 2006 07 Plan Year to 20% of base salary and to 10% of base salary for the 2007 08 Plan Year and thereafter.
However, there is a guarantee that the FPE figure for benefits in respect of service prior to 6 April 2007 will not be less than the FPE figure at 5 April 2007 to ensure that employees do not lose the benefit ofcontributions paid on past bonuses.
Ian King and Peter Lynas joined the ExPS in 1999.
Therefore, their individual total pensions are the sum of their 2000 Plan benefits plus the top up from the ExPS, most of which is provided through the unfunded promise referred to above.
Linda Hudson is a member of the 2006 Plan and a Non-Qualified Plan which provide a cash sum at retirement equal to a percentage of career average pay salary plus bonus subject to a maximum bonus of 150% of salary.
The cash accrual rate of the combined plans from 1 January 2010 was 14.1% of career average pay.
From 1 January 2013, future accrual in the US pension arrangements changed for all employees and Linda Hudson will now receive a $1,000 annual accrual from the 2006 Plan and, from the Non-Qualified Plan, a $500 annual accrual plus 4.1% of salary plus bonus subject to a maximum bonus of 150% of salary.
For benefits commencing prior to age 65, the accrued benefit is reduced for interest only from age 65 to the benefit commencement date using the 30-Year Treasury Rate from the October prior to commencement.
Linda Hudson also receives a company match on her contributions to her 401 k plan up to a maximum contribution of 6% of salary, up to regulatory limits for 2014 $260,000.
From 1 January 2013, the company match is 100%.
Jerry DeMuro is a member of the 2006 Plan and a Non-Qualified Plan which provide a cash sum at retirement equal to the sum of the annual accruals of $1,000 from the 2006 Plan and a $500 annual accrual from the Non-Qualified Plan.
Jerry DeMuro also receives a company match on his contributions to his 401 k plan up to a maximum contribution of6% of salary, up to regulatory limits for 2014 $260,000.
As at the date of this Annual Report, he has not made an election to contribute to the 401 k plan and is therefore not eligible for any company match.

BAE SyStEmS ANNUAL REPORT 2013 99 GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REMUNERAtION REPORt Description of share plans and summary of performance conditions PSP Shares under award vest after satisfaction of the three-year performance condition.
Shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting.
Awards that vest are exercisable in three tranches between the third and seventh anniversary of vesting being capable of exercise on a phased basis from the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of grant.
For US participants, the awards are automatically delivered at the end of years three, four and five, subject to the performance condition being achieved.
EPS TSR Awards made to the UK executive directors since 2008 have been weighted 50% on the PSP performance condition and 50% on the PSP performance condition.
Awards made to the US executive director were weighted in the same way until 2011.
In 2012 and 2013, the weighting EPS OCF for the US executive director was 50% on the PSP performance condition and 50% on the PSP performance condition.
The TSR comparator groups are shown below.
Plan Performance condition EPS PSP Rate of average annual EPS growth over the three-year performance period, with nil vesting at 5% average growth per annum and 100% vesting at 11% average growth per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between these two parameters.
TSR PSP The proportion of the award capable of exercise is determined by: i the Companys TSR share price growth plus dividends ranking relative to a comparator group of 12 other international defence companies over a three-year performance period.

SMP The SMP was a standalone investment plan linked to the award under the Annual Incentive Plan.
It operated for the final time in 2013 in relation to the annual incentive relating to 2012 performance.
Executive directors were required to invest at least one-third and maximum 50% of their annual incentive into the SMP and were granted a conditional award of matching shares against the gross value of the annual incentive invested.
The matching shares attract dividends during the three-year deferral period, released on vesting of any matching shares.
Plan Performance condition SMP In respect of a three-year performance period, nil match for average EPS growth of 5% per annum increasing uniformly to a maximum 2:1 match at11% growth per annum.
2012 ExSOP Options granted are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of their grant, subject to the performance condition being achieved.
Plan Performance condition 2012 ExSOP The proportion of the award capable of exercise is determined by the Companys TSR share price growth plus dividends ranking relative to a comparator group of 12 other international defence companies over a three-year performance period.

The shares are subject only to the condition that the participant remains employed by the Group at the end of the vesting date three years after the award date.
100 BAE SyStEMS ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Governance GOVERNANCE Statement of directors shareholdings and share interests Minimum Shareholding Requirement MSR Executive directors are compulsorily required to establish and maintain a minimum personal shareholding equal to a set percentage of base salary.
An Initial Value must be achieved as quickly as possible using shares vesting or options exercised through the executive share option schemes and Long-Term Incentive schemes by retaining 50% of the net value i. e. the value after deduction of exercise costs and tax of shares acquired under these schemes.
Once the Initial Value is achieved, a Subsequent Value must be achieved in the same way, except that a minimum of 25% of the net value must be retained on each exercise or acquisition.
Shares owned beneficially by the director and his her spouse count towards the MSR.
The MSR does not apply after the individual has ceased to be a director.
Anycase of non-compliance would be dealt with by the Committee.
The following table sets out MSR Initial Value and Subsequent Value: Director Initial Value Subsequent Value Ian King 150% 300% Peter Lynas 100% 200% Linda Hudson 175% 350% Ian King and Peter Lynas were both in excess of their Subsequent Value MSR at 31 December 2013.
Following the announcement in 2013 of Linda Hudsons forthcoming retirement, the Committee agreed to reduce her MSR to 175% and she subsequently retained a holding to that level.
There are no shareholding requirements for the Chairman or the non-executive directors.
