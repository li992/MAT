The fundamental structure of the package remains unchanged and we are not changing the annual bonus opportunity, deferred bonus matching and long term incentive opportunity or defined contribution rate for pensions.
Basic salary and fees Our approach on base salary continues to be to provide a fixed remuneration component which reflects the experience and capabilities of the individual in the role, the demonstrated performance of the individual in the role, and which is competitive in the markets in which we operate.
The Group has grown significantly over the last few years.
Over this period of substantial growth, base salaries have increased but have remained below lower quartile compared with both FTSE Small Cap and FTSE 250 companies.
The Remuneration Committee has therefore resolved to move base salaries progressively, over a three year period, to a level which is market competitive in general, positioned towards the lower end of the market range.
The proposed base salary increases for the Executive Directors with effect from 1 January 2014 are shown below: Year ended 31 December 2013 2014 % increase Ian Dinwoodie 232,000 260,000 12% Alex Bevis 151,000 169,000 12% Ted Wiggans 162,000 183,000 13% Richard Barham 166,000 183,000 10% 1 Ramon Borrell 145,000 N A N A 1 Ramon Borrell will step down from the Board on 1 April 2014.
