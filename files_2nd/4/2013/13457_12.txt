The pension value is set using a 6% of base salary contribution for the COO and FD the CEO waives his pension entitlement.
Element of remuneration Policy Base salary Base salary levels will be set based on the roles and responsibilities of the individual together with their relevant skills and experience, taking into account the market rates for companies of comparable size and complexity and internal Company relativities.
In some circumstances e. g. to reflect an individuals limited experience at a PLC board level it may be considered appropriate to set initial salary levels below the perceived market competitive rate.

Pension A defined contribution at the level provided to current executive directors.
Annual bonus An annual bonus would operate in the same manner as outlined for the current executives as described above and in the Annual Report on Remuneration, although it would be pro-rated to reflect the employment period during the bonus year.
The bonus maximum potential would not exceed 125% of base salary.
It would be expected that the bonus for a new appointment would be assessed on the same performance metrics as that for the current executives on an ongoing basis.
However, depending on the timing and nature of appointment it may be necessary to set tailored performance criteria for their first bonus plan.
Long-term incentives A new appointment will be eligible to receive an award under the PSP policy outlined in the policy table.
Share awards may be granted shortly after an appointment subject to the Company not being in a close period and would be measured against the same performance criteria as the current executives.
The ongoing award maximum would not exceed 200% of base salary.
For an internal hire, existing awards would continue over their original vesting period and remain subject to their terms as at the date of grant.
The new appointment would be eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plan under the same terms as all other employees.
Buy-out awards To facilitate an external recruitment, it may be necessary to buy-out remuneration which would be forfeited on leaving their previous employer.
When determining the quantum and structure of any buy-out awards the Committee will, as a minimum, take into account the following factors: the form of remuneration cash or shares : timing of expected payment vesting: and expected value i. e. taking into account the likelihood of achieving the existing performance criteria.
Buy-out awards, if used, will be granted using the Companys existing share plans to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
