In addition to the above TSR conditions, before any award is capable of vesting, there is an Underpin condition whereby the Committee needs to be satisfied that the underlying operational and economic performance of the Company is at a satisfactory level.
This evaluation includes consideration of ESG factors and safety performance, as well as financial performance.
Whilst the Committee intends currently to apply similar performance conditions including the Underpin to any future PCP awards, they are reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that the conditions continue to be appropriate and suitably stretching for future awards.
