Policy overview The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the Companys remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of the executive Directors of the Company and the Chairman.
In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account a number of factors, including: general trends in pay and conditions throughout the Group the positioning of remuneration levels against the external market the Committee is, however, aware of the risk of an upward ratchet in remuneration levels through overreliance on comparative survey data the balance between fixed and variable pay more specifically, variable pay should form a significant but not disproportionately high level of remuneration the strategy of the business.
In setting the overall remuneration policy, general trends and average increases throughout the Group are taken into account when setting executive Directors reward packages.
A key feature for the executive Directors is that a higher proportion of their remuneration package is delivered through performance related pay, which has a greater linkage to the results of the Group.
The areas covered in this Policy Report comprise: Consideration of shareholders views p69 Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group p69 Summary Directors remuneration policy from the 2014 AGM onwards p70 and p71 Remuneration scenarios for executive Directors p72 Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors p72 Service agreements and payments for loss ofoffice for executive Directors p73 External appointments of executive Directorsp73 Appointment of non-executive Directors p73 Consideration of shareholders views The Remuneration Committee considers feedback from shareholders received ateach AGM and any feedback from additional meetings, as part of any review of executive remuneration.
In addition, theRemuneration Committee engages pro-actively with shareholders and will ensure that shareholders are consulted inadvance, where any material changes tothe remuneration policy are proposed.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group In determining the remuneration of the Groups Directors, the Committee takes into account the general trends in pay and conditions across the Group as a whole.
Whilst employees have not been consulted formally on executive pay, due in part to the diverse geographic nature ofthe Company, the Committee seeks toensure that the underlying principles which form the basis for decisions on Directors pay are consistent with those on which pay decisions for the rest of theworkforce are taken.
These are focused for the most part on market competitiveness, business performance and personal performance.
In practice, the remuneration policy forexecutive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees, so that a significant proportion of their remuneration is dependent on Company performance.
Foremployees below Board level variablepay represents a lower proportionoftheir total remuneration, which is driven bymarket comparators and general performance.

Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors To ensure the ongoing leadership continuity of the Group, the appointment of high calibre executives may be necessary, either by external appointment or internal promotion.
The remuneration package for a new executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Companys remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the scope and complexity of the role, the experience of the individual, the prevailing market rate for that experience and the importance and immediacy of securing that candidate.
The salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract the most appropriate candidate.
The AIP potential would be limited to 120% of salary and grants under the PSP may be up to the plan maximum of 200% of salary.
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer.
It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal executive Director appointment, any remuneration awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and or incidental expenses as appropriate.
com ar2013 000 73 service agreements and payments for loss of office for executive Directors It is the Companys policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term, which are subject to one years notice by the Company and six months notice by the Director.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all executive Directors submit themselves for re-election at the AGM.
In the event of early termination, the Directors contracts provide for compensation in line with their contractual notice period.
In summary, the contractual provisions are to provide the following: Provision Detailed terms Notice period 12 months by the Company, six months by the Director.
There are no contractual compensation provisions for termination of employment.
However, other non-contractual considerations are asfollows: Notice payments If any existing contract is breached by the Company, it would be liable to pay an amount approximating to the net loss of salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period, subject to mitigation and phased payments where appropriate.
Remuneration entitlements Pro rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with vesting for outstanding share awards in certain circumstances see below.
In all cases performance targets would apply.
Change of control No executive Directors contract contains additional provisions in respect of change of control.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive Director under the Companys share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment under the PSP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, good leaver status may be applied.
For good leavers, awards will not be forfeited on cessation of employment and subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions, will vest under the normal vesting schedule, being reduced pro rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.
However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine that PSP awards vest at cessation and or to amend time pro rating.
Outstanding DBP awards will lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain good leaver circumstances, DBP awards will vest in full on the date of cessation.
external appointments of executive Directors The Committee recognises that benefits can arise from allowing executive Directors to take a non-executive directorship elsewhere.
Executive Directors are permitted to have one external appointment, from which fees may be retained with the approval of the Board.
Appointment of non-executive Directors Non-executive Directors are appointed by the full Board following recommendations from the Nomination Committee.
