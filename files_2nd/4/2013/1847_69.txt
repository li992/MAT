In addition to these performance measures, the Committee has retained the penalties for under-performance in respect of each of the customer service and health and safety targets.
Accordingly, in respect of customer service, 10% of the total bonus earned will be forfeited for failure to achieve 5 Star status for both the Recommend Score and the Quality Score under the Home Builders Federation Scheme: and a further 10% would be forfeited for failure to achieve the on-target health and safety performance target.
Consequently, if neither of these performance measures were to be achieved, in aggregate, 20% of the annual bonus earned would be forfeited.
Any bonus awarded for the 2013 14 financial year would be subject to the Clawback set out on page 64 of this Remuneration Report.
BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 69 REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT Discretionary Long-Term Incentives below Senior Management In addition to the 2013 14 LTPP for Executive Directors and Senior Management, the Committee has approved the grant of an award under the SMIS to approximately 100 employees operating below Senior Management the 2013 14 SMIS.
The main purpose of the SMIS is to seek to mitigate the impact of key employees below Senior Management level taking up new job opportunities with competitors operating nationally.
The 2013 14 SMIS will be subject to the same EPS performance condition as the 2013 14 LTPP and a continued employment condition.
In the event that the participant is still an employee of the Group at the end of the three-year performance period and the Group achieves the speci ed EPS targets, the participant will receive an equivalent number of shares to the amount of salary deferred.
By using the same stretching EPS targets as the LTPP, the Committee is ensuring that the SMIS is aligned with Our Strategic Objectives.
The 2013 14 LTPP and the 2013 14 SMIS are also subject to the Clawback conditions as described on page 64 of the Remuneration Report.

The Executive Directors earned a total bonus of 150% and 148.75% for the 2012 13 and 2011 12 financial years respectively.

If the Committee is not of this view, it has the authority to reduce the level of vesting as it deems appropriate.

BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 73 REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT Executive Directors share option plans Executive Share Option Plan The award granted under the Executive Share Option Plan the ESOP in 2003 at an exercise price of 357.37 pence per share vested in 2006, however, there are a number of participants, including Steven Boyes, who are still to exercise the options granted to them.
Under the rules of the ESOP no further options can be granted under this plan.
Details of the option granted to Steven Boyes in 2003 remain unchanged and are set out in Table 15.
Executive Share Option Scheme The Executive Share Option Scheme the ESOS is divided into two sub-schemes, one of which is approved under the Income Tax Earnings and Pensions Act 2003 and the other of which is not.
The exercise price is calculated differently for each sub-scheme in accordance with the rules of the ESOS.
The last grant made under the ESOS was the 2009 10 ESOS, which was subject to TSR and annual EPS performance conditions.
The Committee chose these targets as the most appropriate measure of financial performance for a housebuilder at the time of the grant, as they are a fundamental measure of the Groups underlying performance and are directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders.
The TSR element of the 2009 10 ESOS was tested in December 2012 and, as the result was below median, none of the TSR element of the award vested.
The EPS element of the award had three separate annual components with the Committee setting targets annually for the following financial year.
Performance against each annual EPS target was tested at the end of each relevant financial year during the performance period and each years EPS target determined the vesting level of one sixth of the total award.
It should be noted that the approach of using three one-year targets was adopted due to the uncertain economic conditions prevailing in 2009 when options under the ESOS were first granted.
The Committee has since reverted back to the policy of setting three-year targets.
Subject to the Committees overriding discretion to take into account, among other factors, performance relative to the sector and the underlying financial performance of the business, including free cash ow, when deciding if the level of vesting was justi ed, a cumulative total of 32.8% of the award vested on 10 December 2012 being three years from the date of grant and the remaining 67.2% of the award was lapsed on the same date.
Executive Directors and Senior Management have until 9 December 2019 to exercise their option and any options not exercised within this timescale will lapse.

As at 30 June 2013, the Company proposes to satisfy all outstanding Executive options and awards under the LTPP, 2009 10 ESOS, the DBP, the SRSOS and the unexercised options under the Executive Share Option Plan the ESOP through a new issue of shares, subject to the dilution limits described below.
Only awards made to individuals below Senior Management level will be satis ed through shares currently held or to be purchased in the market by the EBT.
The Company regularly monitors the number of shares issued under its schemes and the impact on dilution limits.
The Company is satis ed that as at 30 June 2013 its usage of shares is compliant with the relevant dilution limits set by the ABI in respect of all share plans 10% of the Companys issued share capital in any rolling ten-year period and discretionary share plans 5% of the Companys issued share capital in any rolling ten-year period.
In the event that the outstanding options under each of the schemes to be satis ed through a new issue of shares were to vest and had been exercised on 30 June 2013, the resulting issue of new shares would represent 3.23% of the Companys issued share capital as at that date.
Change of Control The rules of each share scheme operated by the Company contain provisions relating to a change of control.
In the event that a change of control does occur any unvested options awards will become vested on the date of the relevant event.
However, the number of options awards that vest will be pro-rated depending on the number of weeks completed within the relevant performance period and the level of performance conditions achieved during that period.
Options awards which have already vested as at the date of the relevant event may still be exercised within prescribed timescales set out in the rules.
Executive Directors pension arrangements The Companys pension policy for Executive Directors is that they can choose to participate in the Companys fide ned contribution money purchase pension plan or receive a cash supplement that does not count for incentive purposes.
Only the base salary element of a Directors remuneration is pensionable.
fide ned bene t section The fide ned bene t section of the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme was closed to new entrants in 2001 and on 30 June 2009, the Company exercised its consent under the rules of the Scheme and agreed to cease offering future accrual of fide ned bene ts for current members.
Members of the Scheme became eligible to join the fide ned contribution money purchase section of the Scheme with effect from 1 July 2009.
Up until 30 June 2009, Steven Boyes was a member of the fide ned bene t section of the Scheme.
This entitlement was based on a 1 60 accrual rate and a normal retirement age of 65.
The entitlement of Clive Fenton who left the business on 5 July 2012 was restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the Finance Act 1989 for service up to 5 April 2006 and thereafter was calculated by reference to his base salary.
Since 1 July 2009, Steven Boyes, as did Clive Fenton up until his resignation on 5 July 2012, has been entitled to receive a cash supplement equal to 30% of his base salary per annum.
Steven Boyes and Clive Fenton were members of the Scheme during the year ended 30 June 2013.
Details of their accrued bene ts are as follows: Table 16 Directors accrued pension bene ts Audited Transfer value of the increase in accrued pension Increase in over the year to accrued pension 30 June 2013 Increase in Transfer value Transfer value over the year to Total pension net of in ation accrued pension of accrued of accrued Change in 30 June 2013 accrued at the less Directors over the year to pension at pension at transfer value net of in ation end of the year contributions 30 June 2013 30 June 2013 30 June 2012 over the year Steven Boyes 156 307,228 3,588 7,633 6,182,661 6,252,591 69,930 Clive Fenton 22 46,933 457 1,168 890,490 880,815 9,675 Notes 1 The total pension accrued at the end of the year is the amount that each Director had accrued when the Scheme ceased to offer future accrual at 30 June 2009 plus revaluation in accordance with the Scheme rules.
2 The in ation gure of 2.6% is based on the change in RPI from September 2011 to September 2012, consistent with previous years.
3 All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Value Amendment Regulations 2008.
The transfer values of the accrued pension represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Schemes liability in respect of the Directors pension bene ts.
They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
4 The increase in the transfer value includes the effect of uctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and its Directors, such as market movements and the Trustees decision to update the assumptions used.
5 The gures do not take account of any retained bene ts the members may have.
