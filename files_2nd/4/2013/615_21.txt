The other elements of Executive Director Remuneration, including the Alent Share Plan, are expected to remain broadly unchanged from current practice.
We believe our proposals are balanced and fair, will help to incentivise the delivery of Alent strategy and support success for Alent and its shareholders.
Futhermore, the Company is committed to open and transparent dialogue with its shareholders on remuneration as well as other governance matters.
As a matter of course the Remuneration Committee will continue to consult with key institutional shareholders and various representative bodies about the pay and incentive arrangements of the Companys Executive Directors.
We look forward to a continuing dialogue on both the Alent business, and what we need to do in respect of overall remuneration practices for our Executive Directors and the Company as a whole.
I hope you have found this Annual Statement helpful, and will be able to support the Remuneration Policy Report and Annual Report on Remuneration at this years Annual General Meeting.

COM ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 ALENT 69 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Shareholding guideline The Remuneration Committee encourages Executive Directors to build and hold a shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to at least one times gross base salary.
For new Executive Directors, the target is to achieve this within a four-year period.
Difference between remuneration policy for executive directors and other employees The Remuneration Committee considers remuneration across Alent when setting remuneration policy for Executive Directors and the same principles apply to all employees when determining salary increases.
In addition, the Annual Incentive and Alent Share Plan are operated for employees who are not Executive Directors.
The key difference in policy is that variable remuneration represents a greater proportion of Executive Directors total package than it does for other employees.
Choice of performance measures and target setting For the Annual Incentive and Alent Share Plan, our policy is to choose performance measures which help drive and reward the achievement of Alent strategy, and also provide alignment between employees and shareholders.
Further detail on performance measures and targets is disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Non-executive Directors Remuneration Policy Table The following table outlines the remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors of Alent: Element of Remuneration Link to Strategy Operation Opportunity Performance Metrics Base Fees Reflects the individuals The Board sets the No prescribed maximum n a experience, role and remuneration of the annual increase.

Remuneration Committee Increases are only Chairman and the Senior made if justified by UK Independent Director.
Clawback Arrangements Variable remuneration paid to Executive Directors is subject to clawback arrangements in the event that a misstatement is identified in the Companys consolidated financial statements.
When a misstatement is identified by the Remuneration Committee which requires the restatement of a prior years accounts in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards or any applicable law, then such portion as the Remuneration Committee deems appropriate of any variable remuneration paid to Executive Directors including from both the Annual Incentive and the Alent Share Plan and on an after-tax basis resulting from a measure of financial performance affected by the misstatement will be subject to clawback provisions.
External Appointments Executive Directors are permitted to hold positions as Non-executive Directors of other companies provided that these do not lead to conflicts of interest.
The Board sanctions each such request on a case-by-case basis.
Fees received are retained by the Executive Director concerned.
Policy on Service Contracts and Letters of Appointment Our policy is to offer service contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of between six to 12 months.
Service contracts do not contain any change of control provisions.
In the event of termination upon notice by either the Company or an Executive Director, the Company has the option of making a payment in lieu of any notice due, a significant part of which is subject to offset against subsequent income earned by the Executive Director.
For the Chairman, appointment is terminable on six months notice.
All other Non-executive Directors appointments are terminable on three months notice on either side.
All Non-executive Directors are subject to retirement, and election or re-election, in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association and now stand for re-election annually.

Assumes that the threshold target is achieved for all performance conditions.
Detail on the performance conditions is set out in the next section.
Steve Corbetts 2010 Alent Shares Award was vested at 67.7% for his total Performance Shares.
The 2010 award represents 50% Vesuvius, 50% Alent shares with the same vesting conditions based on the performance of Cookson up to the 18 December 2012.
The information in the above table is audited by the Companys Auditor.
Further detail on the performance conditions is set out below.
PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS RELATING TO AWARDS MADE UNDER THE ALENT SHARE PLAN In the case of Alent Share Plan grants for which the performance period ends on 31 December 2014, these represent the grants made to Executive Directors in 2012 under the Cookson LTIP.
These awards over Cookson shares were rolled over to become awards over Alent shares of equivalent value.
Performance will still be measured over a three-year period, but by reference to Cookson performance up to the Demerger Effective Time and by reference to Alent performance thereafter to the end of the period.
The vesting of the awards, when originally granted, was based on Cooksons performance against specified performance conditions measured over a three-year period.
Vesting of 50% of shares awarded was based upon Cooksons three-year TSR performance relative to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 250, excluding Investment Trusts, and 50% on EPS growth over the three-year period.
The two measures operated independently.
The new Alent targets for measuring performance for the 2011 and 2012 Cookson LTIP awards, following the Demerger, have been determined as follows: As regards the EPS target, the Cookson headline EPS threshold and maximum vesting targets for the final year of the relevant three-year performance period have been split between Alent and Vesuvius by reference to their respective trading profit contributions to Cooksons total 2012 trading profit such that the new Alent and Vesuvius targets aggregate to the currently disclosed Cookson targets.
The respective Alent adjusted EPS values as reported for the final year of the three-year performance period will then be compared with these new threshold and maximum targets to determine the vesting outcome.

COM STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS INFORMATION As regards the TSR target, Cooksons TSR growth from the start of the relevant three-year performance period up to the time of the Demerger will be determined and added to the TSR growth of Alent from the Demerger date to the end of the three-year performance period.
This aggregate TSR growth will then be ranked against the TSR of the relevant comparator group and the resulting vesting outcome will be calculated against the TSR performance schedule in the Cookson LTIP.
COOKSON 2011 PERFORMANCE CONDITION Vesting of 50% of Performance and Matching Share Awards under the 2011 Cookson LTIP awards is based on adjusted EPS growth in accordance with the following schedule: Adjusted EPS for Performance Shares Matching Shares Vesting Ratio 2013 financial year Vesting Percentage Matching Shares: Investment Shares Less than 33.4 pence 0% 0 33.4 pence 12.5% 0.25 : 1 40.1 pence 50% 1.125 : 1 Between 33.4 pence and 40.1 pence Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1 Vesting of 50% of Performance and Matching Share Awards under the 2011 Cookson LTIP awards is based on Alent TSR relative to the FTSE250, excluding Investment Trusts, in accordance with the following schedule: Alent three-year TSR rank vs. FTSE250, Performance Shares Matching Shares Vesting Ratio excluding Investment Trusts at 31 Dec 2013 Vesting Percentage Matching Shares: Investment Shares Less than median 0% 0 Median 12.5% 0.25 : 1 Upper quintile 50% 1.125 : 1 Between median and upper quintile Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1 COOKSON 2012 PERFORMANCE CONDITION Vesting of 50% of Performance and Matching Share Awards under the 2012 Cookson LTIP awards is based on adjusted EPS growth in accordance with the following schedule: Adjusted EPS for Performance Shares Matching Shares Vesting Ratio 2014 financial year Vesting Percentage Matching Shares: Investment Shares Less than 34.6 pence 0% 0 34.6 pence 12.5% 0.25 : 1 42.7 pence 50% 1.125 : 1 Between 34.6 pence and 42.7 pence Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1 Vesting of 50% of Performance and Matching Share Awards under the 2012 Cookson LTIP awards is based on Alent TSR relative to the FTSE250, excluding Investment Trusts, in accordance with the following schedule: Alent three-year TSR rank vs. FTSE250, Performance Shares Matching Shares Vesting Ratio excluding Investment Trusts at 31 Dec 2014 Vesting Percentage Matching Shares: Investment Shares Less than median 0% 0 Median 12.5% 0.25 : 1 Upper quintile 50% 1.125 : 1 Between median and upper quintile Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1 Alent 2013 performance condition The performance condition for the 2013 award has already been set out on page 76 under the section variable pay and other share awards granted in 2013.
