The vesting period is set at a further threeto five years after each performance period, the resulting combined performance and vesting periods will then be six to eight years from the start of each performance period.
The number of shares subject to an award shall be increased by reference to dividends paid between the grant and vesting date of an award, and such shares shall vest only when the shares subject to an award vest.

Notes to the policy table: In implementing the above remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee shall have regard to all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the UKLA Listing Rules and, the Financial Conduct Authority Remuneration Code of practice on remuneration policies, the AIFM Remuneration Code, and to leading investor representative body guidelines including the ABI and NAPF.
Please note that any commitments made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy approved by shareholders will be honoured.
In addition to the elements of remuneration detailed in the policy table, the Remuneration Committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a different structure in order to facilitate the recruitment or retention of an individual, exercising the discretion available under the UKLA Listing Rules see details in paragraph 2.7.
Performance measures selection and approach to target-setting Annual objectives are set according to immediate priorities identified by the Board and management, and will be reviewed and adjusted annually to reflect changing priorities.
The long-term incentive measures are in line with the long-term strategic focus of the Company and will be reviewed as part of the annual Board strategic review.
Differences between executive directors and employees remuneration Executive Committee members are eligible to participate in the Executive Incentive Plan alongside executive directors to align the remuneration of the most senior management, although their incentive payouts are uncapped, in line with market practice in alternative investment funds.
Employee remuneration includes base salary, benefits, an annual performance bonus and, for senior contributors, share and fund-based deferrals.
The level of deferral increases as total compensation increases.
This provides alignment with shareholders and the future performance of the Company and with the interests of investors in funds managed by the Company.
Sales staff have a specific bonus scheme, which was reviewed in 2013, to reinforce asset gathering and retention whilst aligning interests on costs.
Shareholding guidelines The Chief Executive Officer is required to maintain a shareholding of 200% of base salary.
Other executive directors are required to maintain a shareholding of 100% of base salary.
Executive directors are required to build up this shareholding on joining the Board and after a reduction in share price.
Incumbents will build up to the prescribed shareholdings with post-tax vested shares where not already at or above this level.
In addition, the EIP has been designed so that executive directors have a significant holding of unvested shares subject to ongoing service at any one time.

Non-executive directors remuneration policy Non-executive directors have formal letters of appointment.
These do not contain any notice provisions or provision for compensation in the event of early termination.
The Chairman has a contract with the Company which provides that his appointment as Chairman is terminable on three months notice: there are no notice provisions relating to his appointment as a director.
The Boards policy is to appoint non-executive directors for an initial three-year term, subject to retirement and reappointment by shareholders annually at the AGM, which may be followed by a further three years by mutual agreement.
Any further extension will be subject to rigorous review.
The initial dates of appointment of the non-executive directors to the Board are shown on pages 26 and 27 of the Annual Report, and their current fee levels are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Non-executive directors are also encouraged to build a shareholding in the Company.
Details of the policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below.

The Chairmans remuneration is recommended by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board.
Neither the Chairman nor the non-executive directors take part in discussions or vote on their own remuneration.
Non-executive directors receive a base fee for Board service and additional fees for Board Committee membership and other responsibilities.
They do not participate in any share option or share incentive plans.
Illustrative pay for performance scenarios Although executive directors will be assessed individually for their short-term awards, the chart below provides an illustration of some of the potential future reward opportunities for executive directors, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: minimum, on-target and maximum.
Projected pay under three performance scenarios $000 Table R3 CEO Maximum 15% 35% 50% $7,052 On-target 26% 31% 43% $4,052 Minimum 100% $1,052 CFO $4,465 16% 35% 49% Maximum On-target 28% 30% 42% $2,590 Minimum 100% $715 $0 $1,000 $2,000 $3,000 $4,000 $5,000 $6,000 $7,000 $8,000 Salary & Benets Annual cash EIP Long-term EIP Strategic report 45 Corporate governance Man Group plc Financial statements Annual Report 2013 Other information Assumptions used: The minimum scenario reflects base salary, pension and benefits i. e. fixed remuneration which are the only elements of the executive directors remuneration packages not linked to performance during the year being reported on.
The on-target scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus bonus payout of 125% of salary corresponding to the Remuneration Committees assessment of an overall on-target performance and a long-term deferred bonus award of 175% of salary corresponding to the Remuneration Committees assessment of an overall on-target performance over the one, two or three-year performance period.
The maximum scenario reflects full bonus payout of the current maximum of 250% of salary for the short-term annual cash bonus award and the current maximum of 350% of salary for the long-term deferred bonus award.
The illustrations are based on initial award value and therefore do not reflect potential share price appreciation or any dividends received over the deferral periods.
Approach to recruitment remuneration External appointment Approach to recruitment remuneration Table R4 Component Approach Maximum grant value Base salary Base salary will be determined to provide competitive total None compensation in relation to relevant market practice, experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and their current compensation.
Pension Pension contributions or an equivalent cash supplement will normally be n a set in line with existing policy.
Benefits Benefits may include but are not limited to private medical insurance, n a life assurance, permanent health insurance and any necessary relocation expenses.
Sharesave New appointees will be eligible to participate in any all-employee share n a schemes the Company offers.
Executive Incentive Plan The remuneration structure described in the policy table will apply to 250% of salary Short-term annual cash bonus new appointees with the relevant maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year.
Executive Incentive Plan New appointees may be granted awards under the long-term deferred 350% of salary Long-term deferred bonus bonus on the same terms as other executives, as described in the policytable.
The performance periods used for determining the awards would be gradually increased until the new appointee has completed three full financial years at Man.
In determining the appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both Man and its shareholders.
With respect to a new appointment the Remuneration Committee may buy out incentive arrangements, including bonuses, forgone on leaving a previous employer, and awards made under such buy out arrangements may be in addition to the remuneration outlined in the table above.
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these incentive arrangements and the likelihood of those conditions being met.
In defining the size of this award, the Remuneration Committee would ensure that its fair value is no higher than the fair value of the incentive arrangements forgone.
The Remuneration Committee may also consider it appropriate to structure any such buy out award differently to the structure described in the policy table including whether appropriate performance conditions should apply, exercising the discretion available under the UKLA Listing Rules.
The Remuneration Committee does not intend that such awards will be made as a matter of routine: on the contrary, although the Remuneration Committee cannot anticipate every circumstance which it might face in the future, it is expected that any such awards under the UKLA Listing Rules will only be contemplated in exceptional circumstances, will be reviewed and approved by the full Board and described fully in the next subsequent years Directors remuneration report.
Internal appointment For the appointment of a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the Remuneration Committees approach will be consistent with the policy for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the Board, the Company will continue to honour these commitments.
Non-executive directors When recruiting a new non-executive director, the Board will utilise the policy as set out in table R2 on page 44.
A base fee in line with the prevailing feeschedule would be payable for Board membership, with additional fees payable for acting as Senior Independent Director or as a member or Chairman of a Board Committee.

Service contracts and exit payment policy Service contracts Table R5 Element Condition Contract dates Jonathan Sorrell: 28 September 2012.
Current appointment No fixed term.
Notice period by either Company Emmanuel Roman: 12 months.
or director Jonathan Sorrell: 6 months.
The Companys policy is that notice periods will not exceed 12 months.
Contractual entitlement to fixed None bonus or share-based incentive Provisions for contract termination Under both contracts the Company can opt to terminate immediately by making a payment in lieu of the notice period or part of it.
Emmanuel Romans contract requires payment of base salary only in lieu.
Jonathan Sorrells contract requires payment of base salary plus the value of pension contributions or alternative cash allowance and certain other insured benefits in lieu.
Payments in lieu are to be made in monthly instalments unless the Company and the executive agree otherwise.
Unless the Company decides otherwise both executives have a duty to mitigate their losses arising from termination of their employment: any replacement earnings earned in what would otherwise have been the notice period will reduce the obligation on the Company to make payments in lieu.
Short-term annual cash bonus The service contracts do not oblige the Company to pay any cash bonus to executive directors and bonuses are awarded at the Boards discretion following a recommendation from the Remuneration Committee.
Payment of any cash bonus is conditional upon the executive being in employment and not under notice atthe payment date.
Long-term deferred bonus and Treatment of deferred bonuses and long-term incentives is governed by the relevant plan rules as incentives explainedbelow.
To protect the Groups business interests the executive directors service contracts contain covenants which restrict the executives ability to solicit or deal with clients and their ability to solicit senior employees.
Emmanuel Roman has also entered into a broader non-compete covenant for an agreed period post termination.
Further the Board has the right at its discretion to require Jonathan Sorrell to comply with a broader non-compete covenant for up to six months posttermination to provide additional protection for the Group.
If the Board exercises this right, the Company will pay an additional amount up to sixmonths base salary and the value of pension contributions or alternative cash allowance and certain other insured benefits so that he is not left without income during the time when the Board wishes the non-compete to operate.
This amount is paid in two equal instalments and is reduced byany payments made in lieu of notice.
Executive directors service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.
When considering exit payments, the Remuneration Committee reviews all outstanding incentive awards and assesses outcomes that are fair to both shareholders and participants.
The table below summarises how awards under the Executive Incentive Plan are typically treated in specific circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the Remuneration Committees discretion.

External appointments With the approval of the Board in each case, and subject to the overriding requirements of the Group, executive directors may accept a limited number of external appointments as non-executive directors of other companies and retain any fees received.
Details of external directorships held by executive directors, including associated fees, are provided in the Directors remuneration report where applicable.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the company In assessing executive director remuneration, internal relativities within the Company are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee.
These internal reviews cover the individual elements of base salaries, benefits and total compensation.
The CEO and senior management also conduct regular town hall meetings, where all employees have an opportunity to ask questions or express opinions on various subjects, including remuneration.
Consideration of shareholder views The Remuneration Committee takes into account shareholder views received in relation to resolutions to be considered at the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more broadly.
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback an important input when forming remuneration policy and regularly reviews Mans remuneration policy against the guidelines of key institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
The Executive Incentive Plan takes into account a number of inputs received from our shareholders during the consultation process the Board undertook in late 2012 and early 2013, an example of which is the introduction of a cap on the long-term deferred bonus element of the EIP.
The Board also consulted with a number of shareholders in early 2014 on the proposed remuneration policy including the proposed Executive Incentive Plan and took into account inputs received in formulating the remuneration policy.

b Fund investment under the FPP is in the Man GLG Multi-Strategy UCITS product.
Details of former long-term incentive plans Both the former PSP and ESOS have a three year performance period with vesting subject to achieving performance conditions.
The PSP has a four year service period.
There are no re-testing opportunities should performance measures not be met at the end of the third year.
All share and option awards are conditional and subject to forfeiture if an executive director resigns or the service contract is terminated for misconduct.
The performance conditions for the plans are Net Management Fee Income Growth NMFIG and Adjusted Return on Equity AROE.
The three year performance period was chosen as appropriate for the business and the period over which growth and returns should be achieved.
Net management fee income is the product of two components, namely the funds under management and the net management fee margins.
Net management fee margins are after deduction of all fixed costs and variable costs not attributable to performance fees.
The net margin excludes adjusting items and net finance income costs.
The return performance condition measures the efficiency with which Man invests or returns capital.
The adjustment to the ROE measure is to calculate equity excluding the Boards determination of any surplus capital not currently being utilised in the business.
The surplus capital is additional capital in excess of a the minimum regulatory capital of the Group Pillar 1 capital adjusted by the Individual Capital Guidance percentage agreed with the FCA plus any specific add-on, plus b any capital planning buffer set by the FCA, plus c any Board cushion as set by the Board from time to time to give operating flexibility.
Notional interest incurred on surplus capital is deducted in calculating AROE.
Capital strategy is a matter for the Board: executive directors can only influence the policy within the Board framework.
The Remuneration Committee has previously considered using relative return performance measures.
However, since the Remuneration Committee is not aware of any listed companies of substantial size whose main business activities are comparable in nature and scale to that of Man Group, such measures were not considered appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee therefore sets performance conditions to target absolute returns for its shareholders that are designed to be both challenging and appropriate given the regulated nature of the Companys business.

Based on the experience of 2013, the Board has re-evaluated the targets for assessing investment performance.
For 2014, the representative fund used to assess GLG investment performance will change from GLG Multi Strategy as used in 2013 to GLG Alternative Strategies Dollar Weighted - Composite for 2014.
The benchmark against which this representative fund will be compared is unchanged.
For FRM, the representative fund remains FRM Diversified II but the Board has concluded that a more appropriate comparative benchmark is HFRI FoF: Conservative Index.
Shareholders should note that, had these changes been effective for 2013, the outcome of the performance metric for these categories would have been unchanged and would still not have beenmet.
