Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information D Diig gn niit ty y p pllc c 5 25 9 A An nn nu ua all R Re ep po or rt t & & A Ac cc co ou un nt ts s 2 20 013 13 Introduction This part of the Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy operated by the Group in respect of Executive Directors and has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 'the Act' and also in accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.
The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 and the views of our major shareholders and describes the policy to be applied in relation to the current financial year and future financial years.
The Policy Report will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and, given that shareholder approval is being sought for the policy detailed below at our AGM, the 'Effective Date' of the policy is intended to be the date of the AGM, subject to it receiving majority shareholder support.
REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will: Align rewards with the interests of shareholders: Motivate and encourage superior performance: Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy: Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management: and Ensure that the overall package for each Director is linked to strategic objectives of the Group.
The Remuneration Committee are confident that this policy will retain and develop further the Groups entrepreneurial culture, whilst also focusing executive remuneration on performance which the Committee believes will best serve shareholders interests.
It is therefore the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior performance by Executive Directors with that performance being measured against robust financial performance and returns to shareholders.
This is achieved by heavily weighting the overall remuneration package towards variable pay.

In terms of annual performance targets, underlying EPS is used as the primary performance metric reflecting the Company's objective of increasing earnings and shareholder value.
Total Shareholder Return is an important benchmark of the success of the business and provides a strong alignment with the returns received by shareholders.
The EPS measure ensures a focus on long-term profitability which the Committee believes is a driver of shareholder value.
Dignity plc 58 Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Report on Directors remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 27 December 2013 Bonus Plan and LTIP discretions The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and LTIP according to their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
A copy of the LTIP rules is available on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of these plans.
These include but are not limited to the following albeit with the level of award restricted as set out in the policy table above : Who participates in the plans: The timing of grant of award and or payment: The size of an award and or a payment: Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction: Determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate treatment chosen: Adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends : and The ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose whilst being no less stretching.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed previously to shareholders.
Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees The Committee is made aware of pay structures across the wider Group when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary review for the Executive Directors.
An annual bonus plan operates across all employees in the Group and all employees are eligible to participate in the SAYE scheme.
Overall, the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees.
This ensures that there is a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration received by the Executive Directors given it is the Executive Directors who are considered to have the greatest potential to influence Company value creation.
Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors The Company's policy results in a significant portion of remuneration received by Executive Directors being dependent on Company performance.
The graph below illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the Executive Directors vary under three performance scenarios: below target, on-target and maximum.
Fixed pay is the sum of basic salary, benefits and pension.
Fixed pay is constant across all three scenarios.
For Ontarget: assumed 70% of maximum bonus paid which is also the starttoearn point and 50% of LTIP vests.
For Maximum: assumed full bonus payment and LTIP vests in full.
No account has been taken of any changes in the Company's share price since the end of the period.

Salary levels for Executive Directors will be set in accordance with the Company's remuneration policy, taking into account the experience and calibre of the individual and their existing remuneration package.
Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, a series of increases to the desired salary positioning may be made over subsequent years subject to individual performance and development in the role.
Benefits will generally be provided in line with the approved policy, with relocation or other expenses provided for if necessary.
A pension contribution of up to 15 per cent of salary may be provided or continued participation in the defined benefit pension for a promoted employee who currently participates in the plan.
The structure of variable pay element will be in accordance with the Company's approved policy detailed above.
The maximum aggregate variable pay opportunity is 225 per cent of base salary.
Different performance measures may be set initially for the annual bonus in the year of joining, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial year that he or she joined the Board.
In the case of external recruitment, if it is necessary to buy out incentive pay or benefit arrangements which would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer, this may be provided, taking into account the form cash or shares, timing and expected value i. e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria of the remuneration being forfeited.
Replacement share awards, if used, may be granted using the Company's existing share plans to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the LSE Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal recruitment, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms of grant or adjusted as considered desirable to reflect the new role.
Fees for a new chairman or non-executive director will be set in line with the approved policy.
Service contracts and payments for loss of office The Company's policy is to have service contracts for Executive Directors that continue indefinitely unless determined by their notice period.
Under the Executive Directors' service contracts and in line with the policy for new appointments, 12 months notice of termination of employment is required by either party.
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of two years, subject to annual re-appointment at the AGM.
Appointments may be terminated with three months' notice.
The appointment letters for the Chairman and NonExecutive Directors provide that no compensation is payable on termination, other than accrued fees and expenses.
In accordance with the terms of the UK Corporate Governance Code all Directors submit themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting each year.
Service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.
Details of the service contracts with all Executive Directors and letters of appointment with NonExecutive Directors are as follows: Unexpired term of contract Name Contract date Notice period or letter of approval Mike McCollum 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract Andrew Davies 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract Richard Portman 1 November 2006 12 months Rolling Contract Steve Whittern 1 January 2009 12 months Rolling Contract Peter Hindley 7 December 2013 3 months 36 months Ishbel Macpherson 14 December 2012 3 months 12 months Alan McWalter 14 December 2012 3 months 12 months Jane Ashcroft 1 April 2012 3 months 3 months Martin Pexton 1 April 2012 3 months 3 months Dignity plc 60 Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Report on Directors remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 27 December 2013 For Executive Directors, the Company may in its absolute discretion at any time after notice is served by either party, terminate a Directors' contract with immediate effect by paying an amount equal to base salary for the then unexpired period of notice plus the fair value of contractual benefits subject to the deduction of tax.
An Executive Director's service contract may be terminated without notice for certain events such as gross misconduct or a serious breach of contract.
No payment or compensation beyond salary and the value of holiday entitlement accrued up to the date of termination will be made if such an event occurs.
There are no special provisions relating to change of control.
The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations and the Committee ensures that there are no unjustified payments for failure.
Any statutory payments required by law may be made.
The Group allows Executive Directors to hold a Non-Executive position with one other company or organisation, for which they can retain the fees earned.
Mike McCollum was appointed a non-executive director of CVS Group plc on 2 April 2013 and received remuneration of 40,000 per annum including an allowance for his role as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Treatment of incentives The treatment for share-based incentives previously granted to an Executive Director under the LTIP will be determined based on the plan rules.
The default treatment will be for outstanding awards to lapse on cessation of employment.
However, an executive will be treated as a 'good leaver' under certain circumstances such as death, illness, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, his employing company ceasing to be a Group Company or the undertaking business or division for which he or she works being sold out of the Company's Group, or any other circumstances at the discretion of the Employee Benefits Trust trustee having obtained the opinion of the Committee.
If treated as a good leaver, awards will vest, as normal, three years after grant after an assessment of the extent to which performance targets have been achieved.
The number of awards that would vest will be reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the three year period actually served.
How shareholder views are taken into account The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time, is then considered as part of the Company's annual review of remuneration policy.
For 2013, we were grateful for the constructive feedback received from major shareholders and representative bodies on our proposals to introduce an EPS measure alongside relative TSR under the LTIP for 2013.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Company, does not actively consult with employees on Directors' remuneration.
However, when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of other employees in the Group.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee The Code requires that a Group of the size of Dignity plc has a Remuneration Committee comprising a minimum of three nonExecutives.
The Committee is chaired by me, Alan McWalter, Senior Independent Director.
The Committee members comprise all the other NonExecutive Directors: Jane Ashcroft, Ishbel Macpherson and Martin Pexton.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no day to day involvement in running the business.
The NonExecutive Directors are not eligible for pensions and do not participate in the Groups bonus or share schemes.
The Remuneration Committee determines and agrees with the Board, within formal terms of reference, the framework and policy of Directors and senior managements remuneration and its cost to the Group.
The Committee considers the performance of the Executive Directors as a prelude to recommending their annual remuneration, bonus awards and share awards to the Board for final approval.
The Committee met four times during the year.
At those meetings basic salaries of Executive Directors and senior managers were reviewed, the targets and quantum of annual performance related bonuses for Directors were also agreed, as were awards granted under the Groups LongTerm Incentive Plan LTIP.
The meetings also approved the payment of the 2012 performance related bonus and dealt with the vesting of the shares awarded in 2010 under the LTIP scheme.
The Committee also receives advice from several sources, namely: The Chairman and the Chief Executive who attend the Remuneration Committee by invitation or when required and the Company Secretary, who is also the Corporate Services Director, attends meetings when required as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
No Executive Director takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benefits.

The Annual Remuneration Report will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM.
The information from the single total remuneration figure for Directors on page 62 to the end of page 65 has been audited.
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2014 Salaries Following the review of Executive Directors' base salaries during the last quarter of the financial period ending 27 December 2013, and after considering the levels of anticipated salary increases across the Group as a whole, the Committee decided to increase the Executive Directors' salaries as shown in the table below with effect from 1 January 2014.
The current salaries as at 1 January 2014 are: 2014 2013 Increase Mike McCollum 476,250 466,900 2% Andrew Davies 270,500 265,200 2% Richard Portman 230,000 212,200 8% Steve Whittern 265,000 235,000 13% Last year the Committee moved to correct Steve Whitterns below market base salary and to reflect his progress in his role of Finance Director.
The Committee has adopted a phased approach and his 2014 increase reflects this.
His salary remains below market levels and the Committee is satisfied the latest increase reflects his strong performance in the role over the last year and his increased experience.
As he continues to develop in the role the Committee may apply above inflationary increases to move his base salary to a market level.
Richard Portmans salary was adjusted upwards by eight per cent to reflect the size and scale of his role after comparison with market data.
Chairman and NonExecutive Directors' fees As set out in the Policy Report, the Company's approach to setting NonExecutive Directors' remuneration is with reference to market levels in comparably sized FTSE companies, levels of responsibility and time commitments.
A summary of current fees is as follows: 2014 2013 Increase Peter Hindley 163,250 160,000 2% Jane Ashcroft 44,000 41,000 7% Ishbel Macpherson 52,900 51,800 2% Alan McWalter 59,000 57,800 2% Martin Pexton 44,000 41,000 7% The base fees for NonExecutive Directors in 2013 were 41,000 for Jane Ashcroft and Martin Pexton and 43,000 for Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter.
The Senior Independent Director receives an additional fee of 9,000 and the Chair of the Audit and Remuneration Committees receive additional fees of 8,800 and 5,800 respectively.
The total fees for Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter disclosed in the 2012 Annual Report included pro-rated fees for their chairmanships of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee respectively from 1 April 2012.
Jane Ashcroft and Martin Pextons fees were initially increased by 2,000 to 43,000 to bring them into line with Ishbel Macphersons and Alan McWalters base fees for 2013 with effect from 1 January 2014.
All NonExecutive Directors including Jane and Martin and the Chairman then received an inflationary rise of two per cent so their fees for 2014 are as in the table above.
Going forward they will receive annual inflationary rises on the same basis as the Executive Directors.
Pension and Benefits Mike McCollum will receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 15 per cent of his basic salary.
Richard Portman will continue to participate in the Group's defined benefit plan and no contributions will be made for Andrew Davies or Steve Whittern in 2014 as they have chosen not to participate in the Groups pension arrangements.
Annual bonus The annual bonus will operate on the same basis as for 2013 and consistent with the policy detailed in the Policy Report in terms of the maximum bonus opportunity and clawback provisions.
All of the bonus will be based on EPS targets with nothing payable for performance below a minimum level of performance, 70 per cent payable for achieving a demanding target and a further 30 per cent payable for achieving a second, more demanding, target.
The EPS targets themselves are deemed to be commercially sensitive and have not been disclosed prospectively.
However, full retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year's remuneration report.
Dignity plc 62 Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Report on Directors remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 27 December 2013 Longterm incentives The maximum normal annual award limit under the LTIP is 125 per cent of salary and it is intended that awards will be granted in 2014 at this level to Executive Directors.
Clawback provisions will operate as set out in the Policy Report.
Consistent with the conditions applying to the 2013 awards, half of the 2014 awards will be subject to a relative TSR measure measured against the constituents of the FTSE 350 as at 1 January 2014 and the other half subject to EPS growth targets.
The performance period for both tranches will be the three financial years, 2014-2016.
TSR No part of this award vests if performance is below median, 25 per cent vests for achieving median, with 100 per cent vesting for upper quartile performance with straight line vesting in between.
For this part of the award, no vesting can occur unless the Committee considers that the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory.
EPS No part of this award vests if compound annual growth in underlying EPS above RPI is less than six per cent p. a.
15 per cent vests for six per cent p. a. real growth, 50 per cent vests for nine per cent p. a. real growth with full vesting for 11 per cent p. a. real growth or better.
Vesting is on a straight line basis for performance in between these points.
The Committee believes the EPS targets are sufficiently challenging in light of internal and external forecasts.
