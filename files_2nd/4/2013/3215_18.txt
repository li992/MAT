Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Performance Measures Shareholder Information Governance remuneration report On behalf of the Board Iam pleased to present the Remuneration Committees report for 2013.
The Committee is My summary of the year extends over the following two pages and includes a quick overview of performance targets, outcomes, the total remuneration working towards opportunity and total remuneration received in respect of the 2013 performance year for Executive Directors, together with the prior year for comparison purposes.
greater simplicity Total variable earnings opportunity in 2013 remained unchanged from the prior year.
However, the prior year figures for both opportunity and actual remuneration received have been restated to ensure the presentation complies and transparency with the most recent legislation finalised during theyear.
For 2013, the results achievement has fallen below the stretching targets set by in remuneration the Committee for British Gas, Direct Energy, Centrica Storage and the Group as a whole.
Centrica Energy exceeded its 2013 operating plan targets following plan design.
a particularly strong performance in midstream and power generation.
Performance against long-term targets for the three-year period ending with 2013 LESLEy KNox failed to meet the minimum threshold and, therefore, none of the awards originally chairman of the granted in 2011 will vest.
Total shareholder return TSR performance exceeded remuneration committee the FTSE 100 Index throughout the majority of the performance period.
However, proposals for future price controls and the potential for further political intervention had a material detrimental impact on the Groups share price in the final quarter of the year.
The Committee considered the formulaic result in the context of the current climate and alignment with shareholder experience and decided not to exercise any discretion in favour of the impacted executives.
The Committee noted Sam Laidlaws personal desire to donate any annual incentive award for the year to charity and took the necessary steps to facilitate that.
As a result, Sam will not be required to defer the usually mandatory portion 40% of his Annual Incentive Scheme AIS award and will instead donate the entire award received in cash.
The Board accepted Nick Luffs resignation on 7 January 2014 and he is working through his notice period.
In accordance with the rules of the AIS, as Nick tendered his resignation prior to the award date for the 2013 performance year, any award is forfeited unless the Committee decides otherwise.
Having considered the matter carefully and in the context of his contribution to the Group and consistent high individual performance, the Committee determined that Nick would receive an award in respect of 2013 performance.
However, in accordance with policy set by the Committee in 2011, the portion of his award that ordinarily would be mandatorily deferred, being 30%, would be forfeited.
The Committee also confirmed that in accordance with its policy, Nick would not be eligible for an annual incentive award for the 2014year.

futurE PoLicy As noted in the 2012 Remuneration Report and discussed with a number of shareholders during that year, the Committee is working towards greater simplicity and transparency in remuneration plan design and will present a new set of arrangements for discussion with shareholders during 2014 prior to seeking shareholder approval at the AGM in 2015 when the current plans approach the end of their ten-year life.
Therefore, whilst the Committee is seeking formal approval for the current policy as set out on pages 68 to 75 of this report, it is anticipated that these arrangements will apply for only one further year.
The new arrangements are expected to be significantly more simple and maintain the existing underlying principle of requiring substantial deferral of short-term performance related reward to ensure alignment with the Groups strategic objectives and shareholder value creation.
