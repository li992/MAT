In 2013, Amjad Bseisus about this change.
annual bonus was based solely on Company performance, while Jonathan Swinney had an 80% weighting on Company After due consideration of Company performance in 2013 performance with a separate 20% based on personal and other factors, it was considered by the Committee that objectives.
From 2014 it is proposed that Jonathan Swinneys the appropriate level of awards under the PSP would be bonus have separate corporate and personal elements with 200% of base salary for 2013 for Amjad Bseisu and 182% the outcome of the corporate scorecard subject to an of base salary for Jonathan Swinney.
Amjad Bseisus bonus will be based solely on the corporate scorecard.

I hope you will support the scorecard of Company metrics, each of which have threshold, resolution to vote for this Directors Remuneration Report target, and stretch objectives and performance outcomes for and look forward to receiving your support at the each component will be determined within these boundaries.
The maximum bonus will be increased from 200% to 225% for both Executive Directors.
This increase will be accompanied Helmut Langanger by a corresponding increase in the level of stretch required Chairman of the Remuneration Committee for a maximum payout.
On-target opportunity will remain the 25 March 2014 same.
These changes will increase the link to annual performance and enable Executive Directors to earn market appropriate levels of variable reward.
In line with best practice, we are also introducing clawback provisions into the annual bonus and PSP schemes from 2014.
More details of this are included in the report.
PSP EnQuests policy is that award levels should vary from year to year based on Company and individual performance.
For PSP awards made in 2013, relating to the 2012 performance year, the Committee felt that it was appropriate to grant levels of awards equivalent to 160% of 2012 base salary for Amjad Bseisu and 152% for Jonathan Swinney.
These awards were based upon the level of Company performance in the case of Amjad Bseisu and both the Company and individual performance in the case of Jonathan Swinney.
Awards under the PSP have been reviewed by the Committee to ensure that the overall remuneration for Executive Directors is consistent with long-term Company performance and our ability to retain our key executives.
As levels of fixed pay are currently positioned around the lower quartile of the marketplace, the opportunity to achieve appropriate levels of remuneration in return for upper quartile total shareholder return has been reviewed.
As such, it is proposed that the maximum levels of award under the PSP for stretch performance will be increased from 200% to 300% of base salary from 2015.
Annual awards will continue to be determined by the Committee taking account of Company and individual performance in the year prior to grant.
The increase in the maximum will provide the Committee with greater flexibility to reflect performance but it is only intended that awards in excess of 200% of salary would be made in years where stretch levels of corporate performance have been achieved.

This is the first time the Company has prepared the report in accordance with the amended regulations and the remuneration policy will take effect from the 2014 AGM.

During 2013, we clarified our principles and we believe that our remuneration structure continues to be aligned with our growth aspirations and the creation of shareholder value.
Remuneration principles During 2013, we reviewed our overall remuneration principles to ensure that they were aligned to our strategy.
EnQuests strategic objective is to achieve sustainable growth by focusing on exploiting its existing reserves, commercialising and developing discoveries, converting contingent resources into reserves, and pursuing selective acquisitions.
We also want to ensure that we operate within the appropriate culture and, therefore, the principles support and reinforce the EnQuest values.
Our principles are clear and simple, strengthen the link of reward for exceptional performance, as well as emphasise the importance of our values.
In summary, the principles underpinning our remuneration policy are that remuneration for Executive Directors should be: 1.
Fair, reflective of best practice, and market competitive.
Comprise of fixed pay set below the median, and variable pay capable of delivering remuneration at upper quartile.
Reward performance with a balance of short-term and long-term elements.
Executive Directors General approach The remuneration of the Executive Directors comprises base salary, participation in an annual bonus plan paid partly in cash and partly in deferred shares, the PSP, private medical insurance, and cash in lieu of pension and other benefits.
When setting remuneration for the Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the performance and experience of the Director, as well as the Company performance, employment conditions for other employees in the Company, and the external marketplace.
Data is obtained from a variety of independent sources.

`` The Chairmans fee is set by the Senior Independent Director and consists of an all-inclusive fee.
Note: Any awards vesting under the annual bonus or PSP will be subject to clawback in the event of a material misstatement of the Companys accounts, errors in the calculation of performance, or gross misconduct by an individual for up to three years following the determination of performance.
Shareholding requirement The Executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company, however there are no formal guidelines in place.
This shareholding is encouraged through the vesting of shares under the Groups share incentive plans.
Existing shareholdings and shares acquired in the market are also taken into account.
Performance measures and targets Annual bonus The annual bonus scheme is a weighted scorecard of key performance indicators with a number of categories, under which the performance of the Company, and therefore the Executive Directors annual bonus is determined.
The categories that form the scorecard may include, but are not limited to: ``Health, Safety, Environment and Assurance: ``financial including EBITDA, opex and capex : ``operational performance production: ``project delivery: ``reserves additions: and ``share price performance.
The measures in each category are selected by the Committee to support the creation of shareholder value.
These criteria are also aligned with the longer-term strategy of the Company and the performance conditions of the Companys long-term incentive scheme.
In addition to considering performance against objectives, the Committee will consider the overall quality of the Companys financial performance, and other factors, when determining annual performance pay awards.
63 STRATEGIC FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE REPORT STATEMENTS EnQuest PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 For Jonathan Swinney and other senior executives below Board level, the result against the corporate scorecard is subject to an individual performance modifier.
This ensures no bonus can be paid for individual performance unless corporate objectives have been achieved whilst ensuring bonuses are also geared to individual performance.
For Amjad Bseisu, the 2014 individual performance element will be based on the corporate scorecard.
This will increase the sensitivity of his bonus to corporate performance.
Executive Directors will receive any applicable annual bonus in cash and deferred shares.
Typically, two-thirds of the applicable annual bonus will be distributed in cash around the time of the announcement of full year results, with one third being converted to EnQuest shares without further performance conditions and deferred for two years subject to continued employment.
PSP The PSP is typically awarded annually and has a vesting period of three years.
Performance conditions are attached to the awards and have reflected the longer-term strategy of EnQuest since the Company formed in April 2010: namely: ``TSR relative to a comparator group: ``Production growth per share: and ``2P Proven & Probable Reserve additions per share.
In addition, in determining individual awards to Executive Directors, the Committee takes account of Company and individual performance in the year prior to grant.
This results in award levels for individual Directors varying from year to year increasing the link to performance.
Approach to recruitment remuneration In the event that the Company appoints a new Executive Director either internally or externally, when determining appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Committee will take into consideration a number of factors including, but not limited to, quantum relating to prior arrangements and the remuneration of other Executive Directors in the Company, appropriate benchmarks in the industry and the financial condition of the Company.
This ensures that the arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders without paying more than is necessary to recruit an executive of the required calibre.
Salaries for new hires including internal promotions will be set to reflect their skills and experience, the Companys intended pay positioning and the market rate for the role.
If it is considered appropriate to appoint a new Director on a below market salary initially for example, to allow them to gain experience in the role their salary may be increased to a market level over a number of years by way of a series of increases above the general rate of wage growth in the Group and inflation.
The ongoing remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the remuneration package offered with the terms of the Companys approved remuneration policy at the time.
Different performance measures may be set for the year of joining the Board for the annual bonus, taking into account the individuals role and responsibilities and the point in the year the executive joined.
Benefits and pensions for new appointees to the Board will normally be provided in line with those offered to other Executive Directors and employees taking account of local market practice, with relocation expenses arrangements provided for if necessary.
Tax equalisation may also be considered if an executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their employment with EnQuest.
Legal fees and other relevant costs and expenses incurred by the individual may also be paid by the Company.
The Committee may make additional awards on appointing an Executive Director to buy-out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Any such payments would be based solely on remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and would reflect as far as practicable the delivery mechanism, time horizons and performance requirement attaching to that remuneration.
The Groups existing incentive arrangements will be used to the extent possible subject to the relevant plan limits, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes, if necessary, and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms of grant.
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fees will be set taking into account the experience and calibre of the individual.
com 64 EnQuest PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 2013 CONTINUED Service contracts Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney entered into service agreements with the Company which are terminable by either party giving not less than 12 months written notice.
The Company may terminate their employment without giving notice by making a payment equal to the aggregate of the Executive Directors basic salary and the value of any contractual benefits for the notice period including any accrued but untaken holiday.
Such payments may be paid monthly and or subject to mitigation.
Executive Directors Date of appointment Notice period Amjad Bseisu 22 February 2010 12 months Jonathan Swinney 29 March 2010 12 months The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment providing for three months notice, the details of which are provided below.

In the event of termination by the Company other than as a result of a change of control, the Executive Directors would be entitled to loss of basic salary and cash benefit allowance for the notice period.
Such payments may be made monthly and would be subject to mitigation.
Depending on the circumstances of termination, the Executive Directors may be entitled, or the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to allow the Executive Directors, to receive a pro-rated proportion of their outstanding awards under the long-term share incentive plans.
Vesting would normally take place at the end of the original vesting period.
Where Executive Directors leave the Company with good leaver status, and they have an entitlement to unvested shares granted under the PSP, the performance conditions associated with each award outstanding would remain in place and are typically tested at the end of the original performance period.
Shares would typically then vest on their original due date in the proportion to the satisfied performance conditions and are normally pro-rated for time.
Annual bonus would not typically be paid to Executive Directors when leaving the Company: however, in good leaver circumstances the Committee has the discretion to pay a pro-rated bonus in cash, in consideration for performance targets achieved in the year.
Deferred bonus shares held by good leavers may, at the Committees discretion, vest on a pro-rata basis.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but their terms are set out in a letter of appointment.
Their terms of appointment may be terminated by either party giving three months notice in writing.
During the notice period the Non-Executive Director will continue to receive their normal fee.
Remuneration Committee discretion and determinations The Committee will operate the annual bonus scheme, Deferred Bonus Share Plan, Long-Term Incentive Plan, Restricted Share Plan and Sharesave Scheme according to their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC requirements, where relevant.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of these arrangements.
These include but are not limited to the following: ``who participates in the plans: ``the timing of grant of award and or payment: ``the size of an award and or payment: ``discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction: ``applying good leaver status in circumstances such as death, ill health and other categories as the Committee determines appropriate and in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan: ``discretion to disapply time pro-rating in the event of a change of control or good leaver circumstances: ``adjustments or variations required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, change of control, special dividends and other major corporate events : and ``the ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose.
65 STRATEGIC FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE REPORT STATEMENTS EnQuest PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 If an event occurs which results in any applicable performance conditions and or targets being deemed no longer appropriate e. g. a material acquisition or divestment, the Committee will have the ability to adjust appropriately the measures and or targets and alter weightings, provided that the revised conditions or targets are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Outstanding share incentive awards that remain unvested or unexercised at the date of this report, as set out on page 70, remain eligible for vesting or exercise based on their original award terms.

The key differences are as follows: ``Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee have their fixed pay set below market median for the industry currently around lower quartile for the Executive Directors.
Other employees typically have their salaries positioned at, or above, market median.
Specific groups of key technical employees may have their salaries set in the upper quartile of the industry.

Executive Directors are given cash in lieu of pension and benefits.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in pension or benefits arrangements.
``Executive Directors have an element of the annual bonus converted to shares and deferred.

``Employees may elect to participate in the Deferred Bonus Share Plan DBSP where they can defer a defined proportion of their annual bonus and receive a matching amount of shares that vest over the following three years.
Executive and Non-Executive Directors do not participate in this share plan.
``Executive Directors and other employees may participate in the HMRC approved Sharesave Scheme and benefit from share price growth.
Non-Executive Directors may not participate.
During the annual remuneration review the Committee receives a report from the HR Director which details the remuneration arrangements of other executive and senior management, as well as the overall spend versus budget for all employees.
This report helps to act as a guide to the Committee as to the levels of reward being achieved across the organisation so that they can ensure the Directors pay does not fall out of line with the general trends.
Employees have not previously been directly consulted about the setting of Directors pay.
Statement of shareholder views The Remuneration Committee welcomes and values the opinions of our shareholders with regard to the levels of Directors pay.
The 2012 Directors Remuneration Report was voted in at the AGM held in May 2013, where 98% of the votes cast were in favour of it.
No concerns have been raised by shareholders to the Remuneration Committee during 2013.

com 72 EnQuest PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 2013 CONTINUED Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2014 Base salary and 2013 pay review As stated in the annual statement to this report, the remuneration for the Executive Directors is geared towards variable pay, with base salaries currently set around the lower quartile benchmark for the oil and gas industry and comparable sized companies.
In the view of the Committee it is therefore important to ensure that the base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually and that any increase reflects the change in scale and complexity of the role as the Company grows as well as the performance of the Executive Director.
The table below shows the change to salaries for 2014: Name Salary for 2013 Salary for 2014 % increase Amjad Bseisu 410,000 430,000 4.9% Jonathan Swinney 264,000 280,000 6.4% Salaries for both Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney were increased to reflect the continuing growth and performance of EnQuest and the performance of the executives in the role.
The increases for both Executive Directors continues to position their base salaries around the lower quartile range of their peers.
Annual bonus The annual bonus scheme for 2014 will be amended as follows: ``Executive Directors and other executive management will have threshold, target, and stretch levels of performance objectives attributed to key performance objectives.
``Amjad Bseisus bonus will be determined solely by the performance of the Company.
Jonathan Swinneys will include a modifier based upon individual performance.
``Maximum levels of award for the Executive Directors will increase from 200% to 225% of annual base salary applicable in the year of performance.
``More stretching targets will apply at maximum to take account of this increase.
The 2014 targets, weightings and measures, which will affect the level of short-term incentive awards for the Directors are set out below: Company 2014 performance measures scorecard Category Weighting Financial targets 15% Production 25% Reserves 10% Alma Galia 20% Kraken 20% EnQuest share price performance 10% Notes: 1.
Precise targets are commercially sensitive and are not being disclosed at this time.
Performance in Health, Safety, Environment and Assurance is central to EnQuests overall results.
This category is used as an overlay on overall Company performance.

Jonathan Swinney 2014 performance measures scorecard Weighting Health, Safety, Environment and Assurance 5% Financial 30% Strategic development 20% Organisation 20% External relations 10% Cost and value management 15% The choice of performance targets for 2014, and their respective weightings, reflects the Committees belief that any shortterm annual bonus should be tied both to the overall performance of the Company and the individuals performance.
