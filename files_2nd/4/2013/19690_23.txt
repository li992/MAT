Executive directors will continue to have the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 125% of salary andwill receive long-term incentive awards to the same value.

Approved by the board and signed on its behalf by lesley James Chair of the Remuneration Committee rd 3 February 2014 St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 77 Corporate Governance directors Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Policy Report hoW thE CoMMittEE SEtS thE REMuNERAtioN PoliCy the primary objective of the Companys remuneration policy is to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre senior executives through competitive pay arrangements which are also in the best interests of shareholders.
Remuneration includes a significant proportion of performance-related elements with demanding targets in order to align the interests of directors and shareholders and to reward appropriately financial success.
the policy is structured so as to be aligned with key strategic priorities and to be consistent with a board-approved level of business risk.
in setting the remuneration policy for the executive directors, the Committee takes into consideration the remuneration practices found in other uK companies of comparable size and scope and has regard to the remuneration arrangements for the Companys employees generally.
in general, the components and levels of remuneration for employees will differ from the policy for executive directors which is set out below.
As a result, greater emphasis is placed on variable pay for executive directors and senior employees, although maximum opportunities are reduced at levels below the board.
Similarly, long-term incentives are offered only to those anticipated to have the greatest impact on Company performance.
the Committee does not directly consult with employees regarding the remuneration of directors.
however, when considering remuneration levels to apply, the Committee will take into account base pay increases, bonus payments and share awards made tothe Companys employees generally.
the Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with shareholders and seeks the views of its major shareholders when considering significant changes to remuneration arrangements.
the Committee also considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the directors Remuneration Report each year at a meeting following the AGM.
this feedback, plus any additional feedback received from time to time, is then considered as part of the Committees annual review of remuneration policy.
REMuNERAtioN PoliCy st the remuneration policy that is intended to apply, subject to shareholder approval, from 1 december 2014 is set out on pages 79 th to 83.
Remuneration arrangements for the financial year ending 30 November 2014 will be in line with the policy below: further information can be found on pages 95 and 96. the Committee retains the discretion to make any payments, notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out below, where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the policy came into effect, or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration of the individual becoming a director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are determined at the time the award is granted.
details of any such payments will be disclosed in the annual report on remuneration for the relevant year.
the Committee will operate the annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements according to their respective rules and in accordance with the listing Rules where relevant.
Consistent with market practice the Committee retains certain discretions inrespect of the operation and administration of these arrangements which include, but are not limited to, the following: the participants: the timing of the grant of an award or payment: the size of an award: the determination of the extent to which performance measures have been met and the corresponding vesting or payment levels: discretion required when dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group: determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the respective arrangement and the appropriate treatment chosen, including the pro-rating of awards: adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events and special dividends : the annual review of performance measures, weighting and targets from year to year: and the manner in which share awards can be satisfied i. e. through the use of new issue, market purchased or treasury shares or byway of a cash payment.
in addition, the Committee retains the ability to adjust the targets and or set different measures if events occur e. g. a material acquisition and or divestment of a Group business which cause it to determine that the conditions are no longer appropriate and theamendment is required so that the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Any use of the above discretions would be explained in the annual report on remuneration for the relevant year and may, asappropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Companys major shareholders.
78 St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Element bASE SAlARy to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the necessary calibre to execute the Companys strategy to provide competitive non-variable remuneration relative to the external market to recognise and reward performance, skills and experience st Operation Normally reviewed annually with changes effective from 1 december.
Review reflects: individual and corporate performance: the individuals level of skill and experience: increases throughout the Company including cost of living awards : internal relativities: and prevailing market conditions through periodic benchmarking for comparable roles in companies of a similar size and scope.
the Committee is mindful of institutional investors concerns on the upward ratchet of base salaries and does not consider benchmark data in isolation.
Opportunity Salary increases will normally be in percentage of salary terms in line with any general cost of living increase throughout the Company.
however, larger increases may be awarded at the Committees discretion to take account of individual circumstances such as: changes in scope and responsibility of a role: and where a new director is appointed at a salary which is at a lower level to reflect their experience at that point, the Committee may award a series of increases over time to achieve the desired salary position subject to satisfactory performance and market conditions.
Actual salary levels are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration for the relevant financial st year see page 95 for those effective 1december 2013.
Performance measures None, although overall performance of the individual is considered by the Committee as part ofthe annual review.

other benefits such as relocation allowances may be offered if considered appropriate and reasonable by the Committee.
Opportunity benefits are set at a level which the Committee considers to be appropriately positioned against comparable roles in companies of a similar size and scope and provides a sufficient level of benefit based on the role and individual circumstances.
St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 79 Corporate Governance directors Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Policy Report continued Element PENSioN to provide competitive post-retirement benefits in a cost-effective manner to assist with recruitment and retention Operation the Company offers an allowance expressed as a percentage of base salary which can be taken as: an employer contribution to the defined contribution section of the Companys pension scheme: a cash allowance which is not bonusable : or a blend of the two.
As a result of historic contractual commitments, retirement benefits for Steve burke are also delivered by membership of the defined benefit section of the Companys pension scheme which is closed to future accrual.
the Committee may amend the form of any executive directors pension arrangements in response to changes in pensions legislation or similar developments, so long as any amendment does not increase the cost to the Company of a directors pension provision.
Opportunity 15% of base salary for all executive directors.

th the specific measures that will apply for the year ending 30 November 2014 are described in the annual report on remuneration on page 95.
Measures for subsequent years will be summarised in the annual report on remuneration for the relevant year.
1 the Committee has discretion to recover some or all of the value of awards of annual bonus for a period of four years following the end of the bonus year in the event that a later restatement of accounts occurs or there is other discovered misconduct which, if known at the time, would have meant that a lower or nil bonus would have been paid.
2 the annual bonus metrics are designed to ensure that annual performance is focused on key financial measures which support the Companys strategic targets.
these are supported by individual performance measures to ensure that executive directors are incentivised to deliver across a range of objectives.
targets are set in line with the Companys budget and strategic plan for the year with a stretch element to reward substantial outperformance.
80 St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Element loNG-tERM iNCENtiVES to incentivise and reward the delivery of strong returns to shareholders and sustained, long-term performance Aligns the long-term interests of directors and shareholders Promotes retention Operation Awards of nil-cost options are normally made annually with vesting, in normal circumstances, dependent on the achievement of stretching performance conditions set by the Committee and measured over a three year period, and the director remaining in employment.
the Committee has discretion to decide whether and to what extent performance conditions have been achieved and must also be satisfied that two underpin conditions are met before permitting 1 awards to vest.
on the exercise of vested awards, executive directors receive an amount in cash or shares equal to the dividends paid or payable between the date of grant and the date of exercise on the number of shares which have vested.
2 Clawback provisions apply to all awards granted.
Certain executive directors have vested but unexercised awards granted under the Companys Executive Share option Schemes ESoS.
other than in exceptional circumstances as determined by the Committee, no further grants under the ESoS will be made to executive directors.
Opportunity Maximum award level permitted under the scheme rules is 150% of salary or 180% in exceptional circumstances.
the normal and current annual award limit is 125% of salary for all executive directors.
Awards vest on the following basis: on target performance delivers 25% of the shares awarded: and maximum performance delivers 100% of the shares awarded, with straight-line vesting between.
Performance measures Performance is measured over a three year period with no retesting against the following metrics: 50% of the award based on relative tSR performance: and 3 50% of the award based on absolute tSR growth.
th the specific measures that will apply for the year ending 30 November 2014 are described in the annual report on remuneration on page 96.
1 the conditions are i that the extent of vesting under the performance conditions is appropriate given the general financial performance of the Company over the performance period: and ii if no dividend has been paid on the last normal dividend date prior to the vesting date or if the Committee believes that no dividend will be paid in respect of the year in which the award vests, the award will not vest at that time and vesting will be delayed subject to continued employment until dividend payments are resumed.
2 the Committee has discretion to reduce some or all of the value calculated at vesting of any awards granted where the value of future annual bonus cash payments are insufficient to recover fully any clawback applicable to the annual bonus arrangements or, within a period of four years following the end of the performance period for an award, there is a material misstatement of the accounts or an error in the calculation of any performance condition which resulted in excess awards vesting to the participant or there is other misconduct which, if known at the time, would have meant that a lower or nil award would have vested.
3 the Committee believes that this combination of tSR measures provides strong alignment with the interests of shareholders and complements the focus on operational performance measures in the annual bonus arrangements.
targets are set to ensure that only modest awards are available for delivering on target performance with maximum rewards requiring substantial outperformance of the Companys budget and strategic plans.

however, the Committee retains the discretion to offer appropriate remuneration outside of the standard policy to facilitate the hiring of candidates of an appropriate calibre and to meet the individual circumstances of the recruitment.
this may, for example, include the following: where an interim appointment is made to fill an executive director role on a short-term basis: exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a non-executive director takes on an executive function on a short-term basis: an executive director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or long-term incentive award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance.
the quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may be transferred to the subsequent year so that reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis: an executive is recruited from a business that offered some benefits that the Committee might consider appropriate to buy out but that do not fall into the definition of variable remuneration forfeited that can be included in the buyout element under the wording of the Regulations: or the executive received benefits from his or her previous employer which the Committee considers it appropriate to offer.
the Committee will, however, seek to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders and to not pay more than is appropriate.
base salary levels for new recruits will be set in accordance with the policy set out on page 79, taking into account the experience and calibre of the individual recruited.
Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially to reflect the individuals experience at that point, the Committee may award a series of increases over time to achieve the desired salary position subject to performance and market conditions.
Pension arrangements will be in line with the policy detailed on page 80. unless the Committee deems it appropriate to tailor benefits to the unique circumstances of the appointment, benefits will be provided in line with those made available to other executive directors see policy table on page 79, with relocation allowances offered if considered necessary.
the Committee may structure a remuneration package that it considers appropriate to recognise incentive pay or benefit arrangements that the individual would forfeit on resigning from his or her previous employer.
this may take the form of cash and or share awards as appropriate.
in doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors including the form e. g. cash or shares, timing and expected value i. e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria of the remuneration being forfeited.
the Committee will generally seek to structure buyout awards on a comparable basis to awards forfeited.
Replacement share awards, if used, will, to the extent possible, be granted using the Companys existing share schemes, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the listing Rules which allow for the grant of awards tofacilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of a director.
the Committee may also apply different performance measures, performance periods and or vesting periods for initial awards made following appointment under the annual bonus and or long-term incentive arrangements, subject to the rules of the scheme, if it determines that the circumstances of the recruitment merit such alteration.
the maximum level of variable pay which may be awarded to new executive directors, excluding the value of any buy-out arrangements, will be in line with the policy set out on pages 80 and 81 i. e. at an aggregate maximum of 315% of salary, comprising 125% for annual bonus and 180% for long-term incentive arrangements.
Where a position is fulfilled internally, the Committee will honour any pre-existing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay arrangements in relation to the individuals previous role such that these shall be allowed to continue according to the original terms adjusted as relevant to take account of the board appointment.
Fees payable to a newly-appointed Chairman or non-executive director will be in line with the fee policy in place at the time of appointment.

Subject to review in each case, the boards general policy is that an executive director can accept one non-executive directorship of another company but not the chairmanship and can retain the fees in respect of such appointment.
No fees were th received by executive directors for external appointments during the year ended 30 November 2013.

Weightings were not given to individual corporate measures: since they are all of key importance to the shortand longer-term success of the Company, the Committee did not wish to distort behaviour by placing particular focus on any single element.
As noted in the Strategic Report, the Company delivered an excellent set of results for the year.
Performance highlights include: shareholders equity net asset value per share increasing by 11% to 279p per share: an increase in profit before all tax of 56% to 82.2m: realised property profits up by 37% to 40m: significant reduction in gearing to 54% following a successful equity placing: final dividend for the year increased by 10% to 2.67p per share, making a total distribution for the year of 4.00p per share: sustained valuation gains of 42m, of which 28m was as a result of active asset management and planning gains: and the disposal by St. Modwens KPi joint venture of the Elephant & Castle Shopping Centre for 80m, representing a yield of 4.25%.
in light of both corporate and individual performance, the Committee determined that each executive director should receive a bonus equal to 95% of the maximum opportunity for the year, representing 118.75% of salary.
bonus payments are conditional upon the executive directors undertaking to invest at least one-third of the bonus received, after payment of income tax and national insurance, in the Company shares and to retain those shares for a minimum period of three years.
in respect of bonuses paid for the 2011 12 financial year, bill oliver and Mike dunn satisfied this investment requirement through the acquisition of shares issued as part of the equity placing completed in March 2013 whilst Steve burke acquired shares both through the placing and the exercise of his 2009 and 2010 PSP awards.

in respect of the dividend underpin, an interim dividend of 1.33p per share was paid on 3September 2013 and the board th is recommending that a final dividend for the year of 2.67p per share be paid on 4 April 2014.
Furthermore, the Committee currently has no reason to believe that dividend s will not be paid in respect of the 2014 financial year, being the year in which the award will vest.
the Committee also considered the general financial performance of the Company over the performance period and noted the following: st th As at 1 As at 30 Key financial indicator December2010 November 2013 Improvement Profit before all tax 38.2m 82.2m 115% Shareholders equity net asset value per share 213.2p 278.7p 31% total dividend per share for the financial year 3.00p 4.00p 33% Gearing 72% 54% 24% See-through loan-to-value 39% 33% 15% the Committee therefore determined that 100% of the PSP awards granted in 2011 will vest and become exercisable on the third st anniversary of grant 21 March 2014 subject to continued employment.
