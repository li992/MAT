The packages for all our Executive Directors are weighted in favour of performance related remuneration at both the target and maximum performance levels.
Based on a target level of performance it is intended that around 60% of the package is performance related.
Based on maximum performance the weighting of performance-related remuneration increases to around 70% to 75% of the remuneration package.
