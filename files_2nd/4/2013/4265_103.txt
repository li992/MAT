Revenue and Underlying Profit excluding litigation expense are defined as the Companys revenue and profit for the purpose of the Plans performance targets.
The Committee may adjust the profit measure for exceptional items.
Personal objectives are set each year.
These relate to areas which the Committee considers are important to the medium and long term success of the Company and which ultimately will contribute to qualitative or quantative improvements.
For the 2013 financial year, the personal objectives included identification of specific opportunities with customers in respect of new technologies, Bluetooth Smart and Indoor Location which the Company has under development, enhancements that would support CSRs SOC development capabilities, improvements in technological innovation and reviewing the market opportunities for the Cameras business.
The Committee determined that these objectives had been partially satisfied, resulting in the level of award shown in the table above.

The UK group has been chosen because CSR is headquartered, and employs around one-third of its employees, in the UK.
Typical salary inflation in some other CSR locations is materially higher than the UK, which would distort the comparison.
Remuneration for these purposes includes the following elements: salary: taxable benefits: and annual bonus EIP Element A for the CEO.
