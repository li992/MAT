7 The 2010 PSP vested post year-end on 5 May 2013 and was based on 50% EPS and 50% on relative TSR performance for Ian Cheshire and Kevin OByrne, and divisional Retail Operating Profit for Philippe Tible.
The out-turn of the EPS and Divisional Retail Operating Profit elements of the award was 100% of maximum based on strong Group performance over the three-year performance period.
The TSR performance out-turn fell just below the median of the FTSE 100 comparator group and so failed to meet the threshold of median 1%.
Accordingly, the vesting levels for the 2010 PSP award were 50% of award for Ian Cheshire and Kevin OByrne, and 100% for Philippe Tible.
The award granted to Euan Sutherland will lapse in full following his departure from the Group on 31 March 2013.

Further details of the awards under the KIS Cash Scheme and KIS Share Scheme reflecting these outcomes for 2012 13 are set out on page 55.
Directors pension benefits Up until 30 June 2012, Ian Cheshire had an entitlement to part of his pension benefits through the Kingfisher defined benefit pension scheme, which closed to future accrual of benefits on 30 June 2012 subject to the scheme cap of 136,200 2011 12: 129,600 and part through a defined contribution scheme, for which the Company contribution is 30% of base salary.
From 1 July 2012 onwards his pension benefit was delivered solely through the Defined Contribution arrangement.
Kevin OByrne, Euan Sutherland and Karen Witts have an entitlement to a defined contribution pension, with a Company contribution of 20% of base salary.
The Company operates a policy to limit pension contributions during the tax year up to the Annual Allowance, with the excess being directed into a taxable monthly cash payment.
Following pension and tax legislation changes effective 6 April 2012 on the reduction of lifetime allowance from 1.8m to 1.5m, the Company has offered a fully taxable cash alternative, at no additional cost to the Company, to directors wishing to exit the Defined Contribution scheme completely.
Kevin OByrne chose to leave the pension scheme on 5 April 2012 and opted to receive the Company pension contribution as a taxable monthly cash supplement in full.
Philippe Tible is a member of a separate Group defined benefit pension scheme, for which eligibility requires him to retire with the Kingfisher Group.
There is therefore no concept of a deferred pension and if Philippe Tible left the Company for reasons other than retirement, none of the pension rights built up would actually crystallise.
The figures in the table below are based on a crystallised pension and have not been discounted in any way for the risk of forfeiture.
The following table shows details required under both Schedule 8 to the Regulations under the Act and the Listing Rules as they apply to Kingfisher for the year ended 2 February 2013.

com 56 GOVERNANCE Directors Remuneration Report continued Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP remains the primary long-term share incentive plan for senior executives, which allows a maximum annual award not exceeding 200% of base salary or 500% of base salary in exceptional circumstances.
Shares delivered on the vesting of an award receive additional dividend roll-up shares calculated on the basis of a notional purchase of shares on each relevant ex-dividend date using that days closing mid-market price.
Shares used to satisfy awards under the PSP are normally purchased in the market by the Kingfisher Employee Benefit Trust.
3 Following the calculation of the achievement of the performance conditions attaching to the award, 97.6% of the award became exercisable.
4 Following the calculation of the achievement of the performance conditions attaching to the award, 100% of the award became exercisable.
5 Vesting of the awards is based 50% on EPS and 50% on TSR conditions.
The EPS condition required EPS at the end of the three-year performance period to be at least 20p for 15.625% of that part to vest and 23p for vesting in full of that part of the award.
The TSR condition requires the Groups TSR to be at least median plus 1% for 15.625% to vest and upper quintile plus 1% for it all to vest.
In both cases, intermediate performance vests on a sliding scale basis.
Philippe Tibles award was based on the retail operating profit for his division the targets for which are aligned with the Group EPS targets.
The results which were confirmed after the year-end are shown in the Executive Directors Remuneration table.
6 Vesting of the awards is based 50% on EPS and 50% on Kingfisher Economic Profit KEP.
The EPS condition requires EPS at the end of the three-year performance period to be at least 25.8p for 15% of that part to vest and 31.2p for vesting in full of that part of the award.
The KEP condition required the aggregate KEP over the three-year performance period to be at least 229 million for 15% of that part to vest and 386 million for vesting in full of that part of the award.
KEP is defined as the Group post-tax retail profit less central costs, excluding exceptional items and property lease costs two point average of Group capital employed, including capitalised property leases and adjusted for pensions, multiplied by the Groups lease adjusted WACC.
50% of the vested shares will be released to participants in 2014 with the remaining 50% of the shares released in 2015.
