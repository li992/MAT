John Davis Helen Owers from 1 January 2014 Secretary Rupert Hopley ANNUAL STATEMENT Dear Shareholder On behalf of the Remuneration Committee the Committee, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report, for the year ended 31 December 2013.
As noted in the Strategic Report, 2013 was another solid year for Informa.
Highlights of the Groups financial performance include adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS from continuing operations growth of 5.0%, cash conversion of 99% and a total dividend for the year up 2.2% to 18.90p.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended and the Listing Rules the Regulations.
Although Informa is not incorporated in the UK, we are observing the Regulations as if we were.
In the event that the resolution to re-domicile to the UK is passed at the Annual General Meeting see the Directors Report on page 37, then these Regulations will then apply to Informa.
The balance of this report is split into two sections: 1.
Informas Directors Remuneration Policy for 2014 pages 51 to 56 : and 2.
The Annual Report on Remuneration for 2013 pages 56 to 65.
Resolutions in respect of both will be put to shareholders at the AGM on 23 May 2014.
During the year, the Committee undertook a number of activities that form part of the annual cycle.
In addition to these normal activities, 2013 saw Peter Rigby retire and Adam Walker resign.
Consequently the Committee has devoted time overseeing these departures, as well as approving remuneration packages and contractual terms for Peters successor.
Details of these are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration but in summary: The termination arrangements for Peter Rigby were in accordance with his service contract and the relevant plan rules on retirement: Adam Walker received salary, benefits and pension to the end of 2013 when he stood down from the Board: no payments in lieu of the balance of his notice period have been paid.
The Committee has agreed to pay a bonus in respect of his performance during 2013 and, in accordance with the plan rules, his outstanding unvested awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and his accrued but unvested shares under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP lapsed: Stephen Carter was appointed as CEO-designate on 1 September 2013 and became Group Chief Executive with effect from 1 January 2014: and The process of appointing a new Finance Director is progressing.
As I was due to step down from the Board at the May 2014 AGM, I decided to hand over the Committee chair with effect from 1 January 2014 to Geoffrey Cooper.
I would like to thank my fellow Committee members and those in management that have supported us for their hard work during the year and throughout my time as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Dr Pamela Kirby Committee Chairman INFORMA PLC 50 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY We describe below the proposed Remuneration Policy for 2014.
This continues to reflect Informas long-standing approach to remuneration which has been in effect since 2009.
The Remuneration Policy will be put to shareholders to vote on at the 2014 AGM.
In the interests of clarity and transparency, the following pages set out a summary of our existing Remuneration Policy in the form required under the new regulations.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors is designed to provide for a competitive compensation package which reflects the Groups performance against financial objectives.
Incentives reward above-average performance and are designed to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre executives.
The table below summarises the six key elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and the fees paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors: Overview and Element link to strategy Operation Performance Framework Maximum EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Base Salary Executive Directors receive Reviewed by the Committee prior Levels are not subject to the There are no prescribed maximum an annual salary which the to the beginning of each year and achievement of performance increases for base salary.

The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are covered under the Group accident and travel policy as it relates to work on behalf of Informa.
Expenses in line with Informa policy will be reimbursed.
Selection of performance measures and the target setting process The performance measures that apply to awards made under the Annual Bonus and LTIPs are selected to ensure that they align with the strategic priorities of the Group.
When setting targets, the Committee is mindful of a range of factors including internal budgets, strategic ambitions, analysts consensus views and investor expectations.
Depending on the nature of the measure, some of these factors will play a greater role than others.
Targets are set to ensure they are suitably challenging with the goal of contributing to longterm shareholder value creation.
The Committee also considers corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
In its judgement the remuneration policies for both Executive Directors and senior management do not raise environmental, social or governance operational risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviours.
Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 INFORMA PLC 53 GOVERNANCE Remuneration Report continued Pay for performance sensitivity The Companys policy is that a clear majority of the maximum potential remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance related.
The bar charts and table below illustrates the composition of remuneration under three performance scenarios: Minimum, which assumes no variable-elements of pay are awarded or vest: Expected, which assumes target bonus is paid linked to delivering budgeted financial performance and threshold vesting under the LTIP linked to ranking at median relative to the respective peer Groups : and Maximum, which assumes the variable elements of pay are awarded or vest in full.
At the time of the Annual Report being signed-off, the sole Executive Director was the Group Chief Executive and so the graph below illustrates his pay package for 2014.
Given the recent appointment of a new Group Chief Executive, benefits are based on anticipated levels for the 2014 financial year.
In line with Level of performance Minimum expectations Maximum Salary: 793,100 Fixed pay Pension: 25% of salary Benefits: 3,000 Annual bonus 0% 100% 150% Long-Term Incentives 0% 30% 150% Maximum 3,373,675 30% 35% 35% In line with expectations 2,025,405 49% 39% 12% Minimum 994,375 100% 4,000,000 0 500,00 1,000,000 1,500,000 2,000,000 2,500,000 3,000,000 3,500,000 Fixed Pay Annual bonus Long-term incentives No elements of pay for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are subject to performance, as set out in the policy table.

Annual Bonus At the start of the financial year, targets linked to the achievement of budgeted diluted adjusted EPS were set.
The Committee adjusted these targets to appropriately reflect the disposal of the Corporate Training business.
Diluted adjusted EPS for the financial year restated on a constant currency basis and using the budgeted tax rate was 38.6p, representing a decrease of 3.7% on 2012, which equated to performance between target and maximum as shown below: Threshold EPS Target EPS Maximum EPS Actual EPS 35.5p 39.5p 43.4p 38.6p Applying the sliding scale formula, a bonus of 88.5% of base salary was awarded to Stephen Carter and Adam Walker for the 2013 financial year.
In line with his contractual terms, Peter Rigby was not entitled to a performance-related bonus given his retirement: instead he received a bonus equal in value to his target bonus opportunity in accordance with the long-established terms of his contract agreed in 1996 which is summarised on page 59.

Awards vesting under the Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards were made to Peter Rigby and Adam Walker under the LTIP in March 2011 with a performance period that ended on 31 December 2013.
The value of Peter Rigbys 2011 award and other outstanding awards was crystalised based on performance up to 6 December 2013 in order for the Committee to approve the payments prior to his retirement in accordance with the Plan Rules.
Details of this are set out in the loss of office payments section below.
Given Adam Walker remained in service until 31 December 2013, his 2011 award lapsed based on performance to 31 December 2013.
Over the period Informas increase in absolute TSR was 46%.
While strong, on a relative basis this ranked below median against both peer Groups and so the awards lapsed in full.
At the end of the performance period the Committee also considered the general underlying financial performance of the Group.
It was determined that this did not require a discretionary adjustment to the outcome under the relative TSR measurement.
All-Employee Share Plan Stephen Carter did not meet the minimum service requirement of six months and so did not participate in the All-Employee Share Plan during the financial year.
Peter Rigby and Adam Walker were ineligible to participate as they were based in Switzerland.
Loss of office payments The following sub-sections detail the loss of office payments for the former Chief Executive and Finance Director.
The Committee acted in accordance with the relevant contractual obligations and plan rules.
Peter Rigby Peter worked until 31 December 2013 and received his contractual salary, pension and benefits in the usual manner.
Under the terms of his service contract, Peter was entitled to a guaranteed bonus worth 100% of salary on retirement and consequently was not considered for a performancerelated bonus during the year.
