These awards were based on the midmarket price of an ordinary share in the Company at close of business on the day immediately preceding the award.
Under the Share Matching Plan, the Executive Directors are required to pledge shares for a minimum period of three years: these shares are pledged on an after tax basis and awards are made on a pretax basis.
Under normal circumstances, the options will not become exercisable until the performance conditions are determined after the end of the threeyear measurement period which begins on the first day of the financial year in which the award is made, and provided the Director remains in employment.
The level of vesting is dependent on the achievement of specified performance criteria at the end of the threeyear measurement period.
The performance conditions for these awards are set out on pages 59 and 60.
Outstanding share based performance awards Set out below is a summary of the share based awards outstanding at 30 September 2013, including both share awards which have vested during the year based on performance and share awards which have been granted during the year.
All of the awards set out below were granted based on a face value limit of 100% of base salary.
No awards will vest unless the performance conditions set out on pages 59 and 60 are achieved over a three year measurement period.

To the extent that the awards vest, the options are then exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the award date.

The remuneration of the Executive Director is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to exercise the options to acquire the shares and the total value of the shares on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil cost options on the vesting date he may exercise the options at any time up to the day preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the underlying share price between the initial vesting date and the date of exercise of the option.
This increase or decrease in value is the result of an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
On 14 May 2013, Bruce Thompson exercised 499,760 options representing all of the remaining 2004 LTIP shares at a market price of 572.0p and the total proceeds before tax was 2,858,627.

Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Governance 65 Shareholding guidelines The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors, to encourage substantial long term share ownership.
These specify that, over a period of five years from the date of appointment, the Chief Executive Officer should build up and then retain a holding of shares with a value equivalent to 200% of base salary.
The guideline holding for other Executive Directors is 100% of base salary.
The guidelines also require that, in relation to LTIP awards, vested shares net of tax should be retained by the individual until the required shareholding level is reached.
As at 15 November 2013, all Executive Directors exceeded the applicable shareholding guidelines.
