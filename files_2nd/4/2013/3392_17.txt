64 directors remuneration report Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Dear shareholder As you will be aware, 2013 was another challenging year for the Group, with a change of both Chief Executive and Finance Director, sharp reductions in military budgets throughout our NATO markets, rapid destocking of consumables - which make up much of our sales - as troops withdrew from conflict areas such as Afghanistan, and the US Government shutdown as we approached our year end.
At the time of the appointment of the new Chief Executive and Finance Director, we made a number of temporary changes to our remuneration arrangements to reflect the uncertainties which they inherited and the fact that, in their first year, they would be operating under a budget, the preparation of which they had had no part in.
For the current year beginning 1 November 2013, we are returning to a more conventional policy and I summarise the key changes below.
The structure of the bonus plan was changed in 2013 from a 75% 25% split between financial measures and personal objectives to a 60% 40% split between the same metrics.
This was to reflect the uncertainties in the integrity of the Groups budget, and to reflect the number of key, shortterm actions which were required to be completed during 2013, to reposition the Company going forward.
In addition, Mark Papworth and Steve Bowers were guaranteed a minimum bonus in their first year equivalent to 50% of base salary because of the uncertainties outlined above and the need to attract strong replacements over a very short period of time.
The circumstances surrounding the appointment of these two executive directors were exceptional and this was fully disclosed to shareholders in last years remuneration report.
Mark Papworth and Steve Bowers will receive their guaranteed minimum bonuses for 2013 with Steve Bowers bonus being prorated to reflect his January 2013 start date and Sarah Ellard Group Legal Director & Company Secretary will receive a belowtarget bonus of 36% of salary.
40% of the payouts will be deferred in shares for three years.
The actual bonus payments due to the executive directors for 2013 are set out on page 77 of the remuneration report.
In 2014, the weighting on financial measures in the annual bonus will be increased, with a requirement for achievement of threshold financial measures before any element of the personal objectives can become payable.
The financial targets will again be based on a mix of earning per share EPS and cash flow.
The personal objectives will be measurable and consistent with the Groups longerterm goals.
Details of the personal objectives and performance against them will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2014 annual report.
When granting performance share plan awards to both the new executive directors and other senior executives in 2013, the Committee did not feel that they could set sufficiently robust three year EPS targets because of the uncertain conditions at that time and therefore absolute share price targets were set.
The policy for 2014 and beyond will be to use two metrics, namely growth in underlying EPS and relative total shareholder return TSR measured against an international peer group of defence sector companies.
These measures have been selected by the Remuneration Committee as they are aligned to the success of the Groups recovery.
EPS is a measure of the Groups overall financial success and TSR provides an external assessment of the Companys performance against companies of a similar size and complexity.
TSR also aligns the rewards received by executives with the returns received by shareholders.
Each will determine the vesting of 50% of the 2014 awards.
25% of each part of the award will vest for threshold or median performance, with full vesting of each part of the award for stretch or upper quartile performance.
The EPS performance targets for 2014 have not yet been determined but in accordance with our normal practice, will appropriately reflect market expectations for the Company at the time of grant, as well as our own internal expectations.
The performance targets will be disclosed in the relevant RIS announcement when the awards are granted.
In reviewing the salaries of Mark Papworth and Steve Bowers for 2014, the Committee was cognisant of the circumstances which prevailed at the time of their recruitment in late 2012.
We were very much aware that the condition of the Company at that time, combined with the deteriorating market conditions within the defence industry, meant that the Company was facing an extremely challenging and complex few years.
Mark and Steve were selected as we believed that they had the drive and character to deliver the recovery which the Company required.
However, we were aware of their relative inexperience and decided to adopt the principle outlined in our remuneration policy Chemring Group PLC Report and accounts for the year ended 31 October 2013 22918-04 6 February 2014 11:42 AM Proof 13 Strategic report Governance Financial s Financial st tat atemen ement ts s Other in Other inf formation ormation 65 of bringing them in below market rate, with a view to reviewing progress and bringing them up to that level when appropriate.
Against this background and acknowledging the tremendous progress made in addressing the underlying issues facing the Company in their first year, Mark Papworths salary has been increased by 5.6% to 475,000 and Steve Bowers salary has been increased by 9.1% to 300,000.
Sarah Ellards salary has been increased by 3.1% to 216,500, in line with the general level of increases received by other employees.
Now that the increased salaries are considered by the Committee to represent the correct level for each role, the Committee anticipates that these salaries will be increased in line with those of the general workforce for the next few years.
In 2014, we are also amending our policy on paying dividend equivalents on vested performance share plan awards and deferred bonus share awards.
Currently, participants do not receive the value of dividends on their awards, and in order to increase alignment with shareholders and bring our arrangements into line with market practice, dividend equivalents will be paid on vested performance share plan awards and deferred bonus share awards granted from 2014.
Since the start of the current financial year I have discussed these changes with a number of our largest shareholders and the Committee has listened carefully to their comments.
We welcome feedback from all interested parties and hope that you are able to support our policy and the way in which it has been applied in the year at the Annual General Meeting on 20 March 2014.
Ian Much Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Remuneration policy This report sets out the information required by Part 4 of Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended.
The report also satisfies the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions relating to directors remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Remuneration Committee has been established by the Board and is responsible for executive remuneration.
The Committees terms of reference are available in full on the Companys website or from the Company Secretary on request.
In determining remuneration for the executive directors and other senior managers, the Remuneration Committee seeks to maintain a competitive package of rewards, which enables the Company to attract and retain the highest calibre of executive, without being excessive by reference to market rates across comparator companies.
Performancerelated elements form a significant proportion of the total remuneration package of each executive director, and take into account the individual contribution of each executive and the performance of the business against financial objectives, details of which are set out below.
These variable elements are designed to align the interest of executives with shareholders, by ensuring that a significant proportion of remuneration is performancerelated and delivered in shares.
The table below summarises the Committees policy for the remuneration of executive directors, which, if approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting, will become binding immediately thereafter.
Further details of the full policy are set out below the table on pages 66 and 67. www.

A description of how the Company intends to implement the policy set out in this table for 2014 is set out in the annual report on remuneration on pages 76 and 77.
The remuneration policy for the executive directors and other senior executives is designed with regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole.
However, there are some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for senior executives.
In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the various categories of individuals.
They also reflect the fact that, in the case of the executive directors and senior executives, a greater emphasis tends to be placed on performancerelated pay in the market.

For the year ended 31 October 2013, Mark Papworth and Steve Bowers were each entitled to a minimum bonus of 50% of salary.
Allemployee share plans do not have performance conditions.
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the UK Sharesave Plan on the same terms as other employees.
Copies of the PSP rules are available on request from the Company Secretary.
As described on page 82, the Company operates share ownership guidelines requiring executive directors to acquire and hold a specified level of shareholding.
co. uk 22918-04 6 February 2014 11:42 AM Proof 13 68 directors remuneration report Committee discretions The Committee operates the Groups variable incentive plans according to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC rules where relevant.
To ensure the efficient administration of these plans, the Committee will apply certain operational discretions.
These include the following: selecting the participants in the plans on an annual basis: determining the timing of grants of awards and or payment: determining the quantum of awards and or payments within the limits set out in the policy table above : determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance: making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. change of control, rights issues, corporate restructuring events, and special dividends : determining good leaver status for incentive plan purposes and applying the appropriate treatment: and undertaking the annual review of weighting of performance measures, and setting targets for the annual bonus plan and PSP from year to year.
If an event occurs which results in the annual bonus plan or PSP performance conditions and or targets being deemed no longer appropriate e. g. a material acquisition or divestment, the Committee will have the ability to adjust appropriately the measures and or targets and alter weightings, provided that the revised conditions or targets are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Outstanding share incentive awards that remain unvested or unexercised at the date of this report, as detailed on pages 81 and 82 of the annual report on remuneration, remain eligible for vesting or exercise based on their original award terms.
Selection of performance metrics and targets The performancerelated elements of remuneration take into account the Groups risk policies and systems, and are designed to align the senior executives interests with those of shareholders.
The Committee reviews the annual bonus plan measures set for all of the Groups senior executives not just the executive directors every year, in order to ensure that they are aligned with the Groups strategy and to ensure consistent bonus arrangements amongst the senior executive team.
All financial targets are set on a sliding scale.
Nonfinancial targets are set at the beginning of the year based on individual and management team responsibilities.
The annual bonus plan performance metrics include a mix of financial targets and personal objectives, reflecting the key annual priorities of the Group.
The financial metrics determine the majority of the bonus and normally include cash flow a key measure of the Groups ability to invest in the business and pay dividends to its shareholders and EPS, which reflects the Groups financial performance and is a key measure for its shareholders.
The personal objectives agreed on an annual basis will be measurable and based on individual performance, and will be consistent with the achievement of the Groups longerterm goals.
The Remuneration Committee has decided to apply TSR and EPS performance conditions to awards to be made under the PSP in 2014 and future years, as these measures are directly aligned to the success of the Groups recovery.
EPS is a measure of the Groups overall financial success and TSR provides an external assessment of the Companys performance against its peer group.
The actual EPS performance targets for PSP awards to be granted in 2014 have not yet been determined but in accordance with the normal practice, will appropriately reflect market expectations for the Company at the time of grant, as well as the Boards own internal expectations.
Further details on the TSR targets for 2014 awards are set out on page 77 of the annual report on remuneration.
The Committee will review the choice and relative balance of performance measures and the appropriateness of performance targets prior to each grant of awards under the PSP.
The EPS targets are reset prior to each grant, following a review of internal and external expectations of future EPS growth for the Group.
The TSR comparator group is reviewed prior to each grant to ensure it remains appropriate.
The Committee retains discretion to set different targets for future awards, providing that, in the opinion of the Committee, the new targets are no less challenging in light of the prevailing circumstances than those set previously.

The Committee also receives information on general pay levels and policies across the Group.
The Committee, therefore, has due regard to salary levels across the Group in applying its remuneration policy.
How the executive directors remuneration policy relates to the wider Group The remuneration policy described above provides an overview of the structure that operates for the most senior executives in the Group.
Lower aggregate incentive quanta are applied at below executive level, with levels driven by market comparatives and the impact of the role.
Employees are provided with a competitive package of benefits, which typically includes participation in the Groups defined contribution pension arrangements.
Longterm incentives are provided to the most senior executives and those identified as having the greatest potential to influence performance within the Group.
However, in order to encourage wider employee share ownership, the Company also operates a Sharesave Plan in the UK and a Stock Purchase Plan in the US, in which all UK and US employees are eligible to participate on completion of six months service.
How shareholders views are taken into account The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received on the directors remuneration report each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally.
Shareholders views are key inputs when shaping remuneration policy.
In December 2013 and January 2014, the Committee consulted with the Companys largest shareholders on the proposed changes for 2014, including the choice and weighting of performance measures in the incentive arrangements and the level of salary increases for the executive directors.
The feedback received has been reflected in the policy that is presented in this report.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous directors remuneration reports.
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.

The executive directors will not receive either the target or maximum packages in 2014, as there are no performance share plan awards due to vest.
Minimum fixed pay only 2014 salary plus benefits plus pension cash supplement.
On target fixed pay plus target annual bonus of 62.5% of salary for the Chief Executive and 50% for the other executive directors plus target PSP awards of 37.5% of salary for the Chief Executive and other executive directors.
Maximum fixed pay plus maximum annual bonus of 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% for the other executive directors plus maximum PSP awards of 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and other executive directors.
The PSP awards section of the bars is shaded, as these awards are subject to performance in future years and cannot ordinarily vest until three years after grant.
Salary levels on which other elements of the packages are calculated are based on those applying to 31 December 2013.
The value of taxable benefits is based on an estimated cost of 22,000 for Mark Papworth, 20,000 for Steve Bowers and 16,000 for Sarah Ellard.
Pension provision is 20% of salary for each director.
The executive directors may participate in allemployee share schemes on the same basis as other employees.
The value that may be received under these schemes is subject to taxapproved limits.
For simplicity, the value that may be received from participating in these schemes has been excluded from the above charts.

2014 Target fixed pay 2014 salary plus benefits plus pension cash supplement plus target annual cash bonus of 37.5% of salary for the Chief Executive and 30% for the other executive directors.
Maximum maximum annual cash bonus of 75% of salary for the Chief Executive and 60% for the other executive directors.
Policy on payments for loss of office All new executive directors appointed will have service contracts which are terminable on a maximum of twelve months notice.
Provisions permitting the Company to make any termination payments by instalments, and requiring directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances, will be included in each contract.
The Remuneration Committee will exercise discretion in determining whether termination payments should be paid by instalments, taking account of the reason for the departure of the director and their prior performance.
Other than in gross misconduct situations, the Company would expect to honour the contractual entitlements of terminated directors.
Other than in certain good leaver circumstances including, but not limited to, redundancy, illhealth or retirement, no bonus would be payable unless the individual remains employed and is not under notice at the payment date.
Any bonuses paid to a good leaver would be based on an assessment of their individual and the Companys performance over the period, and prorated for the proportion of the bonus year worked.
With regards to longterm incentive awards, the PSP rules provide that other than in certain good leaver circumstances, awards lapse on cessation of employment.
Where an individual is a good leaver, the Remuneration Committees policy for future PSP awards will be to permit awards to remain outstanding until the end of the original performance period, when a pro rata reduction will be made to take account of the proportion of the vesting period that lapsed prior to termination of employment, although the Committee has discretion to partly or completely disapply prorating and the performance conditions in exceptional circumstances.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to deem an individual to be a good leaver.
In doing so, it will take account of the reason for their departure and the performance of the individual.
Deferred bonus share awards will also normally lapse on cessation of employment, unless the executive director is deemed to be a good leaver by the Remuneration Committee, as referred to above.
The Committee will have authority to settle legal claims against the Company e. g. for unfair dismissal, discrimination or whistleblowing that arise on termination.
The Committee may also authorise the provision of outplacement services.

Mark Papworths contract originally contained additional provisions in the event of a change of control: however, these ceased to apply from 5 November 2013.
The executive directors service contracts are available for inspection at the Companys registered office.
Recruitment of executive directors Salaries for new hires including internal promotions will be set to reflect their skills and experience, the Companys intended pay positioning, and the market rate for the applicable role.
Where it is appropriate to offer a below median salary initially, the Committee will have the discretion to allow phased salary increases over a period of time for newlyappointed directors, even though this may involve increases in excess of the rate for the wider workforce and inflation.
Benefits will be provided in line with those offered to other executive directors, taking account of local market practice, with relocation expenses or arrangements provided if necessary.
Tax equalisation may also be considered if an executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their employment with the Company.
Legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual may also be paid by the Company.
The aggregate incentive opportunity offered to new recruits will normally be no higher than that offered under the annual bonus plan and the PSP to the existing executive directors.
Different performance measures and targets may be set initially for the annual bonus plan, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual and the point in the financial year at which they join.
Any increases in incentive quantum offered above this limit will be contingent on the Company receiving shareholder approval for an amendment to its approved policy at its next general meeting.
Current entitlements benefits, bonus, share schemes may be bought out on terms that are no more favourable than a likeforlike basis with a comparable time horizon, fair value and subject to performance conditions.
The Groups existing incentive arrangements will be used to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes, if necessary, and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms of grant adjusted as relevant to take into account the Board appointment.

The salary increases, which took effect from 1 January 2014, are set out below.
The background to the increases applied to Mark Papworths and Steve Bowers salaries are set out in the statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on pages 64 and 65.
The percentage increase applied to Sarah Ellards salary was consistent with the average salary increase to UK employees.
Salary as at 1 January 2013 or date of appointment, if later Salary as at 1 January 2014 % Increase Mark Papworth 450,000 475,000 5.6% Steve Bowers 275,000 300,000 9.1% Sarah Ellard 210,000 216,500 3.1% fees for the Chairman and nonexecutive directors As detailed in the remuneration policy, the Companys approach to setting the nonexecutive directors remuneration takes account of recognised practice, and is set at a level that is sufficient to attract and retain highcalibre nonexecutives.
Details of the fees are set out below: Fees as at 1 January 2013 Fees as at 1 January 2014 % increase 1 Chairmans fees 170,000 187,000 10% Other nonexecutive directors base fee 55,000 55,000 Audit Committee Chair fee 8,000 8,000 Remuneration Committee Chair fee 8,000 8,000 Notes: 1.
The Chairmans annual fees of 187,000 have been fixed for his current three year term of appointment, which expires on 30 June 2016.
His previous annual fee of 170,000 was also fixed for his original three year term.
Annual bonus plan performance targets The annual bonus plan for 2014 will largely operate on a similar basis to 2013.
However, in 2013, the weighting of personal objectives was increased to 40% of the total bonus opportunity on an exceptional basis, reflecting the importance of delivering key strategic and operational goals in the year.
For the 2014 bonus plan, the weighting of personal objectives for Mark Papworth and Sarah Ellard has reverted back to 25% of the total bonus opportunity.
However, Steve Bowers personal objectives will contribute to 35% of his bonus opportunity for 2014, as the Committee feels that a slightly greater weighting on personal objectives is appropriate for Steve, given the importance of addressing the currently complex position in relation to debt holders and improving financial management in the business.
The personal objectives set for Steve will reflect these priorities, and will include targets relating to the Groups discussions with debt holders and restructuring the balance sheet.
In 2014, the performance measures and weightings for the annual bonus plan will therefore be as follows: Measure As a percentage of maximum bonus opportunity Mark Papworth Steve Bowers Sarah Ellard EPS 37.5% 32.5% 37.5% Cash flow 37.5% 32.5% 37.5% Personal objectives 25.0% 35.0% 25.0% No bonus will be payable in respect of the personal objectives unless threshold performance has been achieved against both the EPS and cash flow targets.
Further details of the targets are not being disclosed prospectively as these are commercially sensitive.
A detailed description of the personal objectives and performance against them will be included in next years annual report on remuneration.
The 2014 bonus plan is consistent with the policy detailed in the remuneration policy in terms of maximum bonus opportunity, deferred share arrangements and clawback.

Each metric will determine the vesting of 50% of the 2014 awards.
The EPS performance targets for 2014 have not yet been determined but in accordance with the Committees normal practice, will appropriately reflect market expectations for the Company at the time of grant, as well as the Boards own internal expectations.
The defence sector peer group for the 2014 awards comprises: Alliant Techsystems: BAE Systems: Cobham: Cohort: Esterline Technologies: Finmeccanica: FLIR Systems: L3 Communications: Manroy: Qinetiq Group: Raytheon: Rheinmetall: Rockwell Collins: and Ultra Electronics.

No bonuses were paid to executive directors for 2011 and 2012, and the executive directors did not receive maximum bonuses in any of the prior three years.
As disclosed last year and as described in the Statement by the Committee Chairman as part of their recruitment terms, Mark Papworth and Steve Bowers each had an entitlement to a minimum bonus of 50% of salary for 2013 only.
In 2013, the annual bonus plan threshold performance was not achieved in relation to either the EPS or cash flow targets, as a consequence of the difficult trading conditions which impacted the Groups performance during the year.
The actual financial performance targets are not disclosed, as they are considered to be commercially sensitive.
