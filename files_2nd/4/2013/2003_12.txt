HIGHLIGHTS BUILDING HOMES FOR EVERYONE RUNNING A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS TRADING & FINANCIAL REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT The Board of Directors presents its Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 April 2013, which has been prepared on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee the Committee.
An advisory resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code, Schedule 8 of the Large & Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008, and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.
INTRODUCTION Berkeleys strategy places an emphasis on achieving two operational measures with which the Committee aims to align to the Executives remuneration.
The first is achieving superior and sustainable pre-tax returns on shareholder equity ROE.
The second is enhancing the value of the land bank.
The combination of these two targets is designed to provide a balance between earnings in the near term and creating a long term, sustainable business.
In considering the level of the Executives Annual Bonus Plan the Committee has discussed the principles with major shareholders and aims to set these at a level that is both challenging and sector leading.
The Groups ROE compared with the sector over the last six years illustrates the relative performance of Berkeley: Return on Equity Company 2007 08 2008 09 2009 10 2010 11 2011 12 2012 13 Berkeley 26.6% 16.2% 13.3% 15.3% 21.2% 22.4% Sector highest 26.6% 16.2% 13.3% 15.3% 21.2% 22.4% Sector lowest 0.7% 73.4% 44.2% 6.2% 0.4% 3.4% Sector average excluding Berkeley 18.2% 26.0% 18.1% 1.0% 4.8% 8.5% The Committee sets annual targets that have a strong operational correlation with the performance of the business.
Whilst the Committee considers total shareholder return TSR to be a helpful tool to measure performance over the long term, it believes that setting the right operational targets on an annual basis and putting in place a long term share based remuneration policy aligned to creating shareholder value above a hurdle level of return is the best way to deliver value for shareholders and to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives.
The TSR for Berkeley, expressed as the value of 100 invested in the Company, both from 25 June 2004, being the date on which the previous Scheme of Arrangement and consequential returns of surplus capital to shareholders was announced, and from 1 May 2010, the date on which the current Annual Bonus Plan was introduced, to 30 April 2013 is as follows: Value of 100 invested on Company 25 06 2004 01 05 2010 Berkeley 526 252 FTSE 250 298 150 FTSE 100 197 129 Barratt 101 250 Bellway 230 189 Bovis 183 186 Persimmon 245 252 Redrow 97 143 Taylor Wimpey 63 233 Sector average excluding Berkeley 153 209 Berkeley has consistently out-performed the sector average and generated additional value for shareholders over a difficult and challenging period.
At the 2011 AGM shareholders approved the Boards strategy to return 1.7 billion 13 per share to shareholders over the next 10 years, which has the following key features: It strikes the right balance between maximising shareholder returns and an acceptable level of operating risk: It provides a long term framework which has embedded flexibility between investment and cash and takes into account the cyclical nature of the property market: It allows Berkeley to operate at its natural size: The model provides a performance stretch relative to the sector: It supports an added value model which the Board believes delivers best returns to shareholders over the long term: and Berkeley can generate the returns without introducing unnecessary financial risk in a cyclical market.
BERKELEY ANNUAL REPORT 2013 61 2 P10 BERK AR13 RemRep 61 77. indd 61 22 07 2013 16:56 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT KEY ELEMENTS OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY The objective of Berkeleys remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives and ensure their actions are aligned with the Companys strategy.
The core philosophies of the policy are: Fixed remuneration The Committee sets salaries for the Executive Directors based on their experience, role, individual and corporate performance.
Salaries on appointment to the Board are set at a lower quartile level of the comparator group which, based on appropriate levels of individual and corporate performance, will be increased with experience gained over time.
Annual performance related pay The Committee believes that shareholders interests are best served by remuneration packages that have a large emphasis on performance-related pay which encourage the Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy.
The chart below summarises the relative importance of the various components of annual remuneration for each Executive Director for 2012 13, illustrating that the majority of this remuneration is performance related: A W Pidgley R C Perrins N G Simpkin G J Fry K Whiteman S Ellis 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Fixed: Performance related: Salary Benefits Pensions Annual Bonus Plan The Committee is responsible for determining the performance measures, annual performance targets and bonus awards under the Annual Bonus Plan.
The specic performance measures under the Annual Bonus Plan, being a return based measure Return on Equity and a value based measure Land Bank Growth ensure that there is a balance between incentivising the Executives to provide a sustainable ongoing level of return to shareholders whilst ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Company, thereby creating long-term shareholder value.
The performance targets are set on an annual basis taking into account the above considerations and reflecting an appropriate level of risk.
Long-term sustainable performance The long-term incentives which extend to 2021 have been designed to lock-in the Executive team for a far longer period than is typical in most publicly listed companies.
This helps to ensure that the Executive team are focused on generating long-term sustainable value for shareholders, not just on meeting short term performance targets.
The chart below sets out the proportion of annual to long term remuneration of the Executive Directors: A W Pidgley R C Perrins N G Simpkin G J Fry K Whiteman S Ellis 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Annual Long term 62 BERKELEY ANNUAL REPORT 2013 2 P10 BERK AR13 RemRep 61 77. indd 62 22 07 2013 16:56 HIGHLIGHTS BUILDING HOMES FOR EVERYONE RUNNING A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS TRADING & FINANCIAL REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS GOVERNANCE The Companys long term incentive plans are designed to align the interests of shareholders and the Executive Directors over the long term.
They are summarised below: 2009 LTIP This was approved by over 85% of shareholders at an EGM in April 2009, and incorporates two parts: a.
Part A replacing the balance of the shares originally awarded under the previous 2004 b LTIP, exercisable on 31 January 2014 subject to continued employment with the Company and an exercise price of 2.85 per share b.
Part B requiring maintaining a minimum net asset per share of 5.94 over a six year period, vesting in two equal tranches on 15 April 2015 and 2016 with an exercise price of 8.25 per share 2011 LTIP This is a ten year plan introduced in September 2011, and amended at the 2012 Annual General Meeting, to support the Companys long term plan to return 1.7 billion to shareholders, representing 183% of the Net Assets per Share at 30 April 2011 7.09 share, through a combination of dividends 13 per share and share buybacks, by September 2021.
This plan was approved by over 91% of shareholders at the 2011 Annual General Meeting and the amendment approved by over 92% of shareholders at the 2012 Annual General Meeting.
The plan aims to make significant returns to shareholders in cash over a sustained period, ensuring the Group remains at the right size and balances investment and returns to shareholders.
These plans are set out in more detail later in this report.
Risk adjustment The Companys reward arrangements should contain the following elements of risk adjustment, in line with best practice: a. a focus on long-term sustainable performance this is set out above.
b. the weighting of the reward package towards building substantial equity holdings which the Executive team are required to earn and hold over long periods: The final shares from the previous 2004 b LTIP will not vest and sale restrictions be fully removed until 31 January 2014, ten years after awards were granted under the Plan.
The 2009 LTIP provides longer than market standard vesting periods for example options granted in 2009 under Part B of this Plan will vest 50% on 15 April 2015 and the balance on 15 April 2016 subject to the Net Asset Value per share being a minimum of 5.94 at the first of these two dates.
c. the deferral of a significant proportion of annual incentive awards and clawback where there is a material deterioration in performance: The Annual Bonus Plan, whilst based on annual performance periods: defers 50% of a rolling balance each year in notional shares until the final payments are made at the end of a five year period: and ensures that 50% of these rolling balances are at material risk each year due to forfeiture if minimum threshold levels of performance set in each year are not achieved.
d. no reward for failure: Under the 2011 LTIP all options lapse, no shares vest and the LTIP terminates on 1 October 2015 if 568.7 million has not been distributed to shareholders by 30 September 2015.
Substantial equity holdings In order to align the interests of Executives and shareholders, the reward strategy is designed so that, provided performance is delivered, the Executive team become material in relation to their overall compensation shareholders in the Company.
The current shareholdings of the Executive Directors as a percentage of salary, based on the share price at 30 April 2013, are set out on page 71 of this report.
REMUNERATION REVIEW The Committee reviews on an annual basis whether its remuneration policy remains appropriate for the relevant financial year.
Factors taken into account by the Committee include: market conditions affecting the Company: the recruitment market in the Companys sector, other comparable companies and the FTSE 250: aligning remuneration to the corporate strategy and delivering value to shareholders by encouraging long-term sustainable performance: changing market practice: and changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies and Corporate Governance best practice.
BERKELEY ANNUAL REPORT 2013 63 2 P10 BERK AR13 RemRep 61 77. indd 63 22 07 2013 16:56 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT There have been no changes to the policy following the review in the year, with the only changes to individual remuneration being in respect of salaries as set below.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Composition and role At 30 April 2013, the Committee comprised of three Independent Non-executive Directors, Alan Coppin Chairman, Sir John Armitt and Glyn Barker.
Glyn Barker was appointed to the Committee on 13 June 2012 and David Howell retired from the Committee on the same date.
Glyn Barker became Chairman of the Committee on 14 June 2013.
During the year the Committee met on two occasions and there were no absences.
The members of the Committee have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee is able to seek independent advice at the expense of the Company: no advice has been sought by the Committee during the year under review.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted with the Group Chairman, Tony Pidgley, the Group Managing Director, Rob Perrins and the Group Finance Director, Nick Simpkin.
No Director played a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
In addition, the Committee had access to information on executive reward provided to the Board by  LLP, who acquired Halliwell Consulting, the previous advisers, in December 2008 and who have extensive knowledge of the Group and its structure.
The Executive Directors hold no external appointments.
The key responsibilities of the Committee are to: determine and agree with the Board the broad policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
This includes salary, annual bonus plans, share options, other share based incentives and pensions: determine the performance targets for the Annual Bonus Plan operated by the company and approve the total annual payments made under this plan: determine all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders: take into account the views of shareholders when determining plans under the remuneration policy: ensure that the contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, are fair to the individual and the Company and that failure is not rewarded: and note annually the remuneration trends and any major changes in employee benefit structures across the Company or Group.
The Committee has formal terms of reference which describes its full remit.

The Committee has taken account of the following factors in setting individual salary levels: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular those companies within the comparator group, other comparable companies and the FTSE 250: the performance of the individual Executive Director and the Group: and the pay and conditions throughout the Group.
On appointment to the Board and promotion, the Committee sets salaries at a lower quartile level which, based on appropriate levels of individual and corporate performance, will be increased with experience gained over time.
In reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors, the Committee has also taken account of the employment conditions and salary increases awarded to employees throughout the Group, which were on average 5.3% this year.
BERKELEY ANNUAL REPORT 2013 65 2 P10 BERK AR13 RemRep 61 77. indd 65 22 07 2013 16:56 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT ANNUAL PERFORMANCE-RELATED BONUS The Berkeley Group Holdings plc Bonus Plan Overview of the Bonus Plan At the beginning of the plan period of five financial years, participants will have a plan account to which Company contributions will be made.
No Company contribution will be made to a participants plan account unless the annual performance criteria are met.
The Company contribution will be set annually as a percentage of salary for each Executive.
There will be two types of performance condition, Group and Divisional.
The Group performance condition will be a matrix of Return on Equity ROE and Land Bank Growth.
The Divisional performance condition will be based upon Divisional profit before Tax PBT.
Having regard to the strategy of the Company, the Committee will set: the performance levels including minimum performance thresholds for the performance conditions for each plan year: and the maximum annual Company contribution for each participant for the plan year.
These criteria will be disclosed in full in the relevant Committee report along with the annual contributions earned and deferred balances for each participant.
Where the minimum threshold performance criteria on both measures are not achieved, 50% of the deferred balance in a participants plan account will be forfeited.
Participants will be entitled to an annual payment of 50% of their plan account at the end of each financial year.
All balances will be deferred in shares or notional shares.
At the end of the five year plan period 100% of the balance of participants accounts will be paid.
Key features of the Bonus Plan The Committee designed the Bonus Plan based on the following rationale: Two targets the balance between operating a return based measure ROE and a value based measure Land Bank Growth should ensure that the Executives are incentivised to provide a sustainable ongoing level of return to shareholders whilst ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Company, as follows: the Bonus Plan incentivises the delivery of increased profits in order to achieve ROE at the same time as growing the land bank.
It should be noted that the ROE will be set from a challenging base as the Company has not needed to take any land write downs as is the case with the majority of its competitors: ROE is a compound measure and therefore if shareholder funds are reinvested and not paid as dividends, earnings growth will be compounded to achieve the targets: the fact that the Bonus Plan targets also include growth in the land bank value, means that Executives are encouraged to acquire land in the current market on favourable terms as well as maximise sustainable profit growth: and ROE as a measure highlights the inefficiency of retaining surplus cash on the balance sheet.
In order to deliver the targeted level of returns, this will encourage the Company to invest or return cash to shareholders.
Level of targets the Committee incentivises the Executives to achieve a good level of returns to shareholders whilst ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Company.
Therefore the targets set have to take into account an appropriate level of risk.
The Bonus Plan allows a close tailoring by the Committee of the performance conditions to the budget and performance of the Company for each financial year.
At the outset of the Plan, the Committee set the annual performance requirements targeting an average ROE of 12.5% p. a. and average Land Bank Growth of 10% p. a. over the full five years of the plan, which were considered challenging and stretching targets at that time, effectively doubling pre tax profits and growing the land bank gross margin to 3 billion over this period.
Over the course of the Plan there is likely to be annual variability in the performance requirements actually set to reflect the environment at the time see performance targets for 2012 13 and 2013 14 operation of the plan set out later in this report.
These are reviewed each year by the Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging and fully aligned to the strategy of the Group.
The maximum performance targets set and actual performance over the first three years of the plan are set out below: Return on Equity Land Bank growth Target Actual Target Actual 2010 11 13.5% 15.3% 10.0% 13.1% 2011 12 16.5% 21.2% 8.0% 12.0% 2012 13 18.5% 22.4% 10.0% 10.5% In respect of the Return on Equity target, if Berkeley had performed at the median of its competitors for these years, then no bonuses would have been awarded to the Executive Directors.

This adjustment mechanism ensures: performance must be maintained over the five years of operation of the Bonus Plan or the value in the participants plan account will not increase: and if there is a material deterioration in performance there is a claw back of 50% of the balance of the participants account.
Operation of the Bonus Plan for the year ended 30 April 2013 The bonus payable to each of the Group Chairman, Group Managing Director and Group Finance Director is determined by reference to the Group performance condition.
For the Divisional Directors, 50% of the potential bonus payable is determined by reference to the Group performance condition and 50% by reference to the Divisional PBT performance condition.
The maximum bonus potential for the year ended 30 April 2013 is set out in the table below: A W Pidgley R C Perrins N G Simpkin G J Fry K Whiteman S Ellis Maximum Potential % age of Salary 300% 300% 220% 175% 175% 175% The following tables set out: the performance conditions for the Bonus Plan for the year ended 30 April 2013: the level of satisfaction of those performance conditions.
2 There will be straight line bonus vesting between points.
3 If the minimum threshold levels for either are not met, no contribution is made to the Bonus Plan account.
If the minimum threshold levels of performance are not met for both performance conditions, 50% of the participants plan account will be forfeited.
Structuring the performance conditions in this way will ensure consistent levels of ROE at the same time as the Group invests and adds value to the land bank.
4 ROE is dened as profit before tax divided by average shareholders funds.
5 Land Bank Growth is dened as the annual percentage increase in the development margin in the land bank.
This is the anticipated future gross margin to be earned from plots controlled and included in the Groups land bank.
To be included in the land bank, management must have reasonable certainty that the plots will come forward for development, either benefiting from a planning consent or being on land zoned for development.
For the avoidance of doubt, the land bank excludes plots subject to strategic land options.
Calculated plot by plot, the development margin is measured on a consistent basis according to prevailing sales prices for revenue, historic cost for costs already incurred and prevailing prices for costs still to be incurred.
It is separately disclosed within the annual report.
Each year the land bank gross margin is reduced naturally by the amount of gross margin sold in the year.
Therefore, zero % growth in the land bank means that replacement matches usage.

Messrs Simpkin, Fry and Ellis receive a 15% pension contribution.
All payments in lieu of pension are subject to income tax and national insurance.
These payments are not included in salary gures for the purposes of determining any other benefit entitlement.
Full details of pension costs for Executive Directors are set out in the audited section of the report on page 75.
LONG TERM REMUNERATION This section of the report sets out the share incentives for the year ended 30 April 2013.
On 15 April 2009, at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company, over 85% of shareholders approved the introduction of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which incorporated and replaced Element 2 of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2004 b LTIP and the previously approved 2007 LTIP, as set out below.
2009 LTIP PART A The balance of the shares originally awarded under the 2004 b LTIP i. e. 3 12 of the shares, totalling 5,330,340 shares, were replaced by options with an exercise price of 3 per share granted under the 2009 LTIP.
This new option is identied as Part A of the 2009 LTIP.
These options were awarded on 29 June 2009, at which time the Element 2 awards under the 2004 b LTIP were surrendered.
4,441,950 options are currently outstanding, which will become exercisable on 31 January 2014 subject to the relevant Executives continued employment with the Company.

The grants under Part B of the 2009 LTIP are market priced options which will vest subject to: continued employment to the relevant vesting date: and the satisfaction of the underpin condition that Net Assets Per Share are at least 5.94 at 15 April 2015.
Vesting of these options will be in two tranches: 50% on 15 April 2015: and 50% on 15 April 2016.
A total of 6,120,000 options are outstanding.
Shareholder approval was received at the 2011 AGM to amend the rules of the 2009 LTIP covering both Part A and Part B so that the terms of existing options granted can be adjusted in the event of the payment of a cash dividend or dividend in specie.
This provides that where such a dividend is paid the adjustment will be a reduction in the exercise price of an option by the amount or value of the dividend provided that the exercise price can never be less than zero and a reduction will only be made to the exercise price of an option that is not then capable of exercise.
2011 LTIP The Company announced in June 2011 as part of a strategic review of the business a long term plan to return approximately 1.7 billion to shareholders over the next 10 years.
A new long term remuneration plan was proposed to support this strategy, the 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan 2011 LTIP, which was approved by over 91% of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in September 2011.
The rules of the plan were subsequently amended, and approved by over 92% of shareholders at the 2012 Annual General Meeting, to allow the returns to be made through a combination of dividends 13 per share and share buy backs distributions.
The cumulative distributions required by the plan on or before the relative milestone dates are set out below: Cumulative Distributions 30 September 2015 568.7m 30 September 2018 1,136.1m 30 September 2021 1,703.6m The key features of the 2011 LTIP are: if the Company returns 1.7 billion to shareholders over a ten year period via a series of dividend payments 13 per share and share buy backs by the dates referred to above, participants will be entitled to exercise options and receive a number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company at the end of the ten year period.
the maximum number of shares capable of being earned by all participants are 19,616,503 shares, being 13% of the fully diluted share capital of the Company at the date of approval of the plan.
These are set out by participant in the table below: Participant Position Number of shares subject to award A W Pidgley Chairman 5,000,000 R C Perrins Group Managing Director 5,000,000 N G Simpkin Group Finance Director 3,250,000 G J Fry Divisional Director 1,866,503 K Whiteman Divisional Director 2,250,000 S Ellis Divisional Director 2,250,000 Total 19,616,503 the exercise price of options granted under the 2011 LTIP will be 13 per share less an amount equal to the value of all dividends paid between the date of approval of the 2011 LTIP and 30 September 2021, provided the exercise price cannot be less than zero.

Where the cumulative distributions on or before 30 September 2018 is less than 1,136.1m, the following 30 September 2018 1,136.1m process determines the number of shares vesting:- 1 The number of shares capable of vesting is calculated on the level of dividend paid and capable of being paid as at 30 September 2018.
2 The exercise price of the shares capable of vesting is set by reducing the original exercise price of 13 by the level of cumulative dividend actually paid on or before 30 September 2021.
3 No shares will vest until the end of the 2011 LTIP period on 30 September 2021 subject to the participants continued employment at this date.
For example:- A participant is granted an award over 3 million shares On 30 September 2018 it is determined that an additional 3 per share is capable of being paid as well as the actual payments made on or before 30 September 2015 of 4.34: giving a total of 7.34.
Therefore the number of shares capable of vesting on 30 September 2021 is as follows:- 3 million shares x 7.34 1,693,846 shares 13 with an exercise price initially per share of 8.66 13 4.34.
If, however, the actual dividend payments made on or before 30 September 2021 exceed 4.34 the exercise price will be reduced to 13 minus the actual level of dividends paid.
For example if the actual dividend paid was 10 the exercise price would reduce to 3 13 - 10.
The number of shares capable of vesting would, however, remain unchanged with the balance incapable of vesting having lapsed on 1 October 2018.
30 September 2021 1,703.6m The process is the same as above with the relevant date being 30 September 2021.
1,703.6m paid in 1,703.6m In circumstances where 1,703.6m of cumulative distributions including 13 share in full prior to 30 dividends are made prior to 30 September 2021 awards shall vest in full.
September 2021 Participants will be able to exercise their awards of options from the date this cumulative including 13 share target is met and may also sell any shares necessary to pay their tax liability on exercise.
in dividends In respect of the balance of their shares participants shall only be able to sell a maximum of 10% p. a. of this balance until 30 September 2021 at which date the sale restrictions shall lapse.
OTHER SENIOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY The Companys business comprises of a number of operating Divisions.
The Committee in conjunction with the Board has, therefore, implemented both annual and longer term cash based compensation arrangements for these other senior employees of the Company linked to the performance of the relevant Division for which they work.
Some elements of the cash bonus plans are annual while other elements are deferred to ensure long-term consistent delivery by each Division.
The Committee, in line with best practice, continually reviews with the Board the policy behind the compensation plans at this level in the Company to ensure they remain appropriate to the market and the Companys current circumstances.
It is the view of both the Committee and the Board as a whole that these arrangements are very effective at ensuring the delivery of Divisional performance for which these senior employees are responsible.
Both the Committee and the Board believe that having senior employees focused on the delivery of Divisional results is an excellent way of driving shareholder value.
A number of senior employees of the Company have also been granted awards under the 2009 LTIP Part B. SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENT The Company has a shareholding requirement for both Executive and Non-executive Directors and these requirements and the actual shareholdings of the Executive and Non-executive Directors as at 30 April 2013 are set out in the following tables: A W Pidgley R C Perrins N G Simpkin G J Fry K Whiteman S Ellis Shareholder requirements as a % age of salary to be met within 5 years of appointment 400% 200% 200% 200% 200% 200% Current shareholding as a % age of salary based on 30 April 2013 share price 14,976% 5,330% 180% 6,348% 245% 68% BERKELEY ANNUAL REPORT 2013 71 2 P10 BERK AR13 RemRep 61 77. indd 71 22 07 2013 16:56 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT J Armitt D Howell A C Coppin A Nimmo G Barker V Wadley Shareholder requirements as a % age of net fees to be met within 3 years of appointment 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% Current shareholding as a % age of net fees based on 30 April 2013 share price 328% 396% 213% 131% 510% 144% DILUTION The 2009 LTIP and 2011 LTIP were special arrangements, approved by shareholders at the EGM in April 2009 and AGM in September 2011 respectively.
In considering dilution under the 2011 LTIP the Committee took account of the long term nature of the plan which extends beyond the length of normal incentive plans.
In addition, the Committee took into account the significant priority returns of 1.7 billion 13 per share, representing 183% of Net Assets at 30 April 2011, that shareholders will receive from the plan over this 10 year period, with the actual value of the awards to the Executive Directors based on the ongoing value of the Group following this significant realisation of current value to the existing shareholders.
Historically the Company has operated all its share plans within the ABI dilution limits.
There has been no dilution other than under these special arrangements for the purposes of the ABI dilution limits in the year ended 30 April 2013.
OTHER REMUNERATION MATTERS All Employee Share Plans The Company has regularly consulted widely with the management and individuals in its operating Divisions on whether it was appropriate to introduce all employee share plans.
The consensus view remains that employees preferred the opportunity of receiving annual cash bonuses based on the performance of their respective Divisions rather than participate in a Group based all employee share plan.
The Board, therefore, does not believe it is in shareholders interests to incur the income statement and dilutive cost of share arrangements which would not have the desired effect on employees.
Accordingly the Company will continue to operate appropriate annual bonus arrangements in all of its Divisions.
Non-executive Directors Fees All Non-executive Directors have specic terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association.
The following table sets out the fee rates for the Non-executive Directors in the year ended 30 April 2013 and those rates which will apply in the year ending 30 April 2014: J Armitt D Howell A C Coppin A Nimmo G Barker V Wadley Total Fee Rates 2013 14 103,000 69,000 56,500 56,500 69,000 56,500 1 Total Fee Rates 2012 13 100,000 67,500 67,500 55,000 55,000 55,000 % Increase of basic fee 3.0% 2.7% 2.7% 2.7% 2.7% 2.7% Breakdown of 2013 14 Fee 2 Basic Fee 103,000 56,500 56,500 56,500 56,500 56,500 Chair of Committee Fee 12,500 12,500 Committee Chair Sustainability and Audit Remuneration Health & Safety 1 Where Directors assumed additional responsibilities during the year, fees have been annualised to allow a direct comparison 2 Sir John Armitts basic fee reflects his role as Deputy Chairman, Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Sustainability and Health & Safety Committee.
The Board reviews the fees of the Non-executive Directors annually taking into account the following factors: the workload and level of responsibility of the Non-executive Directors under the changing corporate governance expectations of shareholders and their representative bodies: and the current market rate for fees for Non-executive Directors.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share incentive plans or performance based plans and are not eligible to join the Companys pension scheme.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CONTRACTS The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations.
The only event on the occurrence of which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on cessation of employment: with the maximum payment being 12 months salary.
No payment is due on either a Company takeover or in the event of liquidation.
In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
Further, the Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
None of the Executive Directors contracts provides for liquidated damages.
There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company.
Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Directors cessation of employment with the Company.
