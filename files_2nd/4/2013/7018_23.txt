The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, retain and motivate the high calibre executives needed to manage the Group successfully and align their interests with those of the shareholders by rewarding them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The packages also seek to reward achievement of stretching performance targets without driving unacceptable behaviours or encouraging excessive risk taking.
The performance measurement of the executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Remuneration Committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors and senior management: Element of How this supports Opportunity Performance Changes for remuneration the strategy 2012 13 measures structure 2013 14 Salary Provides xed remuneration CEO 450,000 Reviewed annually from 1 April.

As described above and below, executive Directors may earn annual bonus payments of up to 100% of their basic salary together with the benets of participation in share plans which are subject to a maximum value, in the year of grant, of 140% of basic salary.
Each executive Director currently holds shares in the Company in excess of the guideline of one years salary see page 80.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 75 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Executive Director pay mix 2012 13 The split of the actual package in the year under review reects modest outcomes of between threshold and target under the annual bonus plan and the full vesting of the 2009 PSP awards in relation to the achievement of top quartile TSR performance and ROTIC of more than 14% p. a. over the past three years.
The Committee is satisfied that this outcome is closely aligned with, and reective of, Halmas strong underlying performance over this period.
Split of package expected % Split of package actual % Salary base 42% Salary base 26% Pension employer Pension employer contributions 6% contributions 4% Annual incentive expected 26% Annual incentive paid 19% Equity incentive expected value Equity incentive vested 51% at grant 26% Basic salary Prior to the beginning of each year, each executive Directors basic salary is reviewed by the Committee against the market, Company performance and future strategy and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
The Chief Executive is responsible for assessing the performance of each senior executive taking account of the complexity of the operations under their control, their opportunities for advancement with the Group, their remuneration relative to other executives in the Group and their bonus earning potential.
He then formulates a remuneration proposal for the Committees consideration.
In deciding appropriate remuneration levels, the Committee also considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective external research which gives information on a comparator group of companies.
As noted earlier, having reviewed the salary trend over the past few years, the Committee noted a drift towards and below lower quartile salary levels amongst the executives and sought to address an element of this trend with salary increases marginally higher than ination.
The Committee does not expect to make such adjustments each year, but periodically as appropriate.
Basic salaries are reviewed in February of each year with increases, as appropriate, taking effect from 1 April.
Executive Directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual bonus payments During the year the Committee carefully assessed existing incentive arrangements and determined that incentive levels are appropriately set.
The Committee established the economic value added EVA objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid.
In setting appropriate bonus parameters the Committee determined that bonuses of approximately 60% of salary are payable on the achievement of targeted levels of growth.
The maximum performance-related bonus that can be paid is 100% of basic annual salary.
For the Chief Executive and Finance Director, bonuses are calculated as above but based on Group profit exceeding a target calculated from the profits for the three preceding financial years after charging cost of capital, including the cost of acquisitions.
In the case of a Divisional Chief Executive a bonus is earned if the profit of the Division for which they are responsible exceeds a target calculated from the profits of the three preceding financial years.
The profits calculated for this purpose regard each Division as a standalone group of companies charging it with the cost of capital it utilises including the cost of acquisitions.
Executive Director bonus payments for 2013 totalled 834,000 versus 725,000 in the prior year reecting the Groups performance in terms of reported profit, EVA and the relative contributions of organic and acquisition growth.
This performance-related bonus plan, which applies to executive Directors and Divisional Chief Executives, is reviewed annually by the Committee and approved by the Board.
EVA calculation profit for each year Minus Minus Plus minus Minus Equals a charge on cost a charge on unrealised profit the resultant bonus itself the Economic of acquisitions working capital in inventory to make it self-nancing Value Added EVA for each year The elements of the EVA calculation performed for bonus purposes reinforce the Groups business model as outlined on page 11.
The profit for the year is a function of the extent to which the Company has achieved both its organic growth target and its success in identifying appropriate acquisition targets in current and past years.
Ensuring that the cost of funding acquisitions is reected in the bonus model means that executives share the benefit of an acquisition that outperforms expectations, but equally bears the cost of overpaying for an acquisition all in their bonus.
Equally, good or poor management of working capital is reected in the final EVA and impacts on the bonus earned in a year.
As the EVA for each year is utilised for a further three years in the comparator calculations, executives cannot ignore the medium-term interests of the Group without the potential for an adverse impact on their capacity to earn a bonus.
Transitional provisions exist for divisional restructuring to ensure Divisional Chief Executives remain appropriately incentivised.
Subsidiary directors participate in bonus arrangements similar to those established for senior executives.

The Committee, recognising the need to assess and evaluate such incentives, adopted a performance share plan following shareholder approval at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
This PSP replaced the existing share option plans in respect of future share awards.
The Committee has responsibility for supervising the PSP and the grants under its terms.
How the PSP works Performance criteria determine the amount to be granted and, after three years, the amount to vest as illustrated below: Stages Award criteria Award assessment Vesting criteria Final shares vested Process Performance criteria determine the The assessment of the 50% of the amount granted is subject Awards vest on a sliding number of shares to be granted out individuals achievement of to TSR growth relative to the FTSE 250, scale, as set out in the PSP of a Maximum Award level.

Halma FTSE 250 FTSE 350 Electronic & Electrical Equipment Share option plans The 1999 share option plan provided for the grant of two categories of option both of which are subject to performance criteria.
No further grants may be made from this plan which has been replaced by the PSP approved by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
The granting of options was spread over the life of the plan.
Dilution The total dilution effect under these various discretionary share plans is less than 5%.
The Company does not operate any long-term incentive plans other than the share plans described above.
No significant amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a Director to share options or performance share awards.
Pension arrangements Except as noted below, the executive Directors participate in the appropriate section of the Halma Group Pension Plan the Plan.
This section is a funded final salary occupational pension plan registered with HM Revenue & Customs, which provides a maximum pension of two-thirds of final pensionable salary after 25 or more years service at normal pension age 60.
Up to 5 April 2006, final pensionable salary was the greatest salary of the last three complete tax years immediately before retirement or leaving service.
From 6 April 2011, final pensionable salary was capped at 139,185 and is increased annually thereafter by CPI currently 149,644.
Bonuses and other uctuating emoluments and benets-in-kind are not pensionable nor subject to any pension accrued supplement.
The Plan also provides for life cover of three times salary, pensions in the event of early retirement through ill-health and dependants pensions of one-half of the members prospective pension.
Early retirement pensions, currently possible from age 55 with the consent of the Company and the Trustees of the Plan, are subject to actuarial reduction.
Pensions in payment increase by 3% per annum for service up to 5 April 1997, by price ination subject to a maximum of 5% through to 31 March 2007 and 3% thereafter.
78 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Overview 02-09 Business review 10-59 Go Gov five ern rnan anc ce e 60 60- -8 86 6 Financial statements 87-147 Whilst pension benets are accruing, executive Directors receive pension supplements to compensate them for the fact that their pension accrual entitlement under the Halma Group Pension Plan dened benefit arrangements is limited by a pensionable salary cap introduced from 6 April 2006.
The Company introduced a pensionable salary cap in order to address changes affecting the Plan made in the Pension Act 2006.
Without the introduction of such a cap, there would, effectively, have been no benefit limits.
This could have resulted in benets in excess of prescribed levels with some individuals suffering penal rates of tax and potentially causing a limitation on the tax deductibility of employer contributions.
The Company obtained external advice regarding the changes to the Plan and executive pension arrangements and required each affected executive to obtain independent advice prior to implementing the changes.
These changes reduce the Plans future liabilities and their associated funding risk.
Prior to receiving pension payments, to the extent that an executives current salary exceeds the Plan salary cap, the Company compensates him at an annual rate of 26% of the excess.
In April 2006, Kevin Thompson chose to cease entirely future service accrual in the Halma Group Pension Plan in return for the pension supplement on his full salary.
Benets-in-kind The executive Directors receive certain benets-in-kind, principally use of a car and private medical insurance.
Directors contracts It is the Companys policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one years notice.
The details of the Directors contracts are summarised in the table below: Date of contract Notice period Andrew Williams April 2003 one year Kevin Thompson April 2003 one year Neil Quinn April 2003 one year Adam Meyers July 2008 one year In the event of early termination, no predetermined compensation is provided for in the Directors contracts.
Non-executive Directors Unless otherwise indicated, all non-executive Directors have a specic three-year term of engagement which may be renewed for further three-year terms if both the Director and the Board agree.
Stephen Pettit, who is the Senior Independent Director and is proposed for re-election, had his terms of engagement extended for a third three-year term in 2009 and has agreed to remain on the Board for an additional period to provide stability and continuity following the appointment of Paul Walker as Chairman Designate.
The Board will continue to evaluate this mandate annually.
The remuneration of the Chairman and the non-executive Directors is determined by the Committee and the Board based on independent surveys of fees paid to the Chairman and the non-executive Directors of similar companies.
The Chairman receives a basic fee and the non-executive Directors receive a basic fee supplemented by additional fees for membership and or chairmanship of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
The contract in respect of Paul Walkers services provides for termination, by either party, by giving not less than six months notice.
Stephen Pettit, Jane Aikman, Norman Blackwell, Steve Marshall and Daniela Barone Soares have contracts in respect of their non-executive Director services which can be terminated, by either party, by giving not less than three months notice.
Geoff Unwin has tendered his resignation to be effective at the close of the Annual General Meeting on 25 July 2013 and the Board has accepted his resignation.
The Chairmans and the non-executive Directors fees, as detailed below, were reviewed by the Board in April 2013 with increases taking effect from April 2013.

The Companys Register of Directors Interests, which is open to inspection at the Registered Ofce, contains full details of Directors shareholdings and share options.
There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for share options during the financial year.
The closing middle market price of the Companys ordinary shares on Thursday, 28 March 2013, the last trading day preceding the financial year end, was 518p per share and the range during the year was 373.1p to 531.5p.
Directors pension entitlements Two Directors are accruing benets under the Companys dened benefit pension plan as follows: Years of Accrued Accrued pensionable pension Increase in pension Age at service at 2012 the year 2013 30 March 2013 30 March 2013 000 000 000 Andrew Williams 45 19 50 5 55 Kevin Thompson 53 18 103 5 108 The accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 60 based on service to the end of the year.
Kevin Thompsons increase in accrued pension relates entirely to ination as he ceased future service accrual in 2006.
Increase in value Directors net of Transfer value contributions contributions Transfer value 31 March 2012 000 000 30 March 2013 Andrew Williams 691 16 109 816 Kevin Thompson 1,938 218 2,156 The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension plan.
The transfer values are Gilt related and depend upon the relative standings of the Gilt market at the respective valuation dates.
The increase in transfer values is predominantly due to the significant reduction in the yields available on UK Gilts over the year.
The fall in yields has been widely attributed to the Bank of Englands continued policy on Quantitative Easing and the Euro crisis.
Other factors that have increased the transfer values are the impact of any additional service, revaluation in line with ination and any real salary increases as well as the anticipated ageing of the members.
These values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
