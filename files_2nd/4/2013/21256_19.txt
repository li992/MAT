Discretionary compensation payable GOVERNANCE: entirely in deferred shares that vest DIRECTORS REMUNERATION over a two-year period.
Discretionary compensation is dependent on both REPORT Group performance and the executive achieving his key performance indicators KPIs in each financial year.
The fact that we pay no cash bonuses is another distinguishing feature of our structure.
Executives are employed under threeyear employment contracts which fix the annual cash salary and the number of shares to be issued annually as deferred share salary over the three-year term.
With discretionary compensation also in the form of deferred shares, the result is that, for our Al Breach executive management, deferred share Chairman of Remuneration Committee compensation is the dominant component of overall remuneration.
We believe that this policy achieves a direct and natural alignment of shareholder and executive management interests.

In 2013, Mr. Gilauri exercised options in respect of 93,000 BGH shares and sold 220,000 BGH shares.
As at the date of this Annual Report, Mr. Gilauri holds 153,631 BGH shares held directly, 0 vested but unexercised BGH shares held under option and 322,000 unvested and unexercised BGH shares held under option, resulting in a total number of interests in BGH shares of 475,631, representing 1.32% of the share capital of BGH.
There have been no changes in interests in BGH shares since 31 December 2013.
At year-end 2012 and 2013, Gemstock Growth Fund, which Mr Breach manages, held 20,000 BGH Shares.
At year-end 2012 and 2013, the Firebird Group, which Mr Hague manages, held 2,852,921 and 1,373,066 BGH Shares, respectively.
At year-end 2012 and 2013, the East Capital Group, Mr Loikannens employer, held 6,328,417 and zero BGH Shares, respectively.
The nature of the deferred share compensation structure results in executive management having large holdings of unvested shares.
Because of this, the Group does not require executive management to hold a specified number of shares in BGH.
On the contrary, it encourages executive management to diversify their financial holdings by selling a portion of their shares as they vest given that the cash salary received by executive management is modest.
Subject to restrictions imposed by the Model Code for Share Dealing, no shares acquired by Mr Gilauri upon vesting and exercise of his share compensation are required to be held for any specified period of time.
None of Mr Gilauris connected persons have interests in any BGH shares.
The Group does not require Non-Executive Directors to hold a specified number of shares in BGH.
Notwithstanding this, some Non-Executive Directors have chosen to become shareholders.
2.12 Details of Non-Executive Directors terms of appointment Letters of appointment are entered into by BGH with each Non-Executive Director, generally for three-year terms.
The letters of appointment require Non-Executive Directors to provide one-month notice prior to termination.
New BGH letters of appointment for each Non-Executive Director were signed on 10 April 2014, with each Non-Executive Director subject to annual re-election at the AGM.
A succession plan adopted by the Board provides for a tenure of six years on the BGH and Bank Supervisory Boards.
Upon the expiry of such six-year tenure, the appointment of the relevant Director will generally cease at the next upcoming AGM.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board determines that, in order to maintain the balance of appropriate skills and experience required for the Board, it is important to retain a Director on the Board beyond the relevant six-year period, the Board may offer the Director a letter of appointment for an additional one-year term.
Such a one-year re-appointment may be renewed no more than two times, with the effect that the usual six-year tenure may be extended to a maximum of nine years if circumstances were to warrant such extension.

Senior Officer Remuneration In addition to the CEO of BGH and the Bank, in 2013, there were seven senior officers.
These individuals include the Banks Deputy CEOs responsible for the following directions: Finance, Retail Banking, Corporate Banking, Investment Management, Legal and Affordable Housing, as well as the CEO of Aldagi.
Key information regarding remuneration for senior officers is disclosed below in the interest of transparency, but the remuneration of senior officers is not subject to the Regulations or to the Directors Remuneration Policy described in section 6 of this Directors Remuneration Report, nor is it subject to shareholder approval.
The principles and remuneration structure described in the Directors Remuneration Policy are currently applied in broadly the same way to senior officers.
This means that, as for Irakli Gilauri, senior officers receive remuneration based on two components: salary, which includes both a modest cash sum and deferred share compensation which vests over a five-year period: and a discretionary award, payable 100% in deferred share compensation vesting over a two-year period, which is dependent on both Group performance and the executive achieving his KPIs.
3.1 Single total figure of remuneration for senior officers The table below sets out the remuneration received by each of the Banks senior officers for 2013 in respect of his employment with the Bank.
The figures show the value of BGH shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of service in 2013.
The value is calculated by reference to the share price of US$21.36 per share based on the official share price of 13.80 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5480, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date as at 18 February 2013, the date of the service contracts.
Under the deferred share programme, the option awards in respect of deferred share salary are formally granted in January of the year following the work year even though the number of deferred salary shares is fixed in the contract.
For 2013, options were awarded on 25 February 2014.
The share price on 25 February 2014 was US$39.79 per share based on the official share price of 23.85 per share converted into US Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.6682, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date.
