The policy will be displayed on the Companys website while it remains in force.
The committee will consider the Directors Remuneration Policy annually, to ensure that it remains aligned with business needs and is appropriately positioned relative to the market.
However, there is currently no intention to revise the policy and seek shareholder approval more frequently than every three years.
Market benchmarks We benchmark total potential remuneration against remuneration packages paid by peer group companies.
Two peer groups are used for this purpose, namely: i FTSE100 companies of a similar size by market capitalisation: and ii large European insurers.
The peer groups are kept under review to take into account different companies that enter the market or those that change their size or the main characteristics of their business.
We also look at remuneration arrangements in other types of UK-based financial sector companies.
Balancing shortand long-term remuneration Based on our view of current market practice and our remuneration principles, we have established the remuneration policy set out in this report.
Fixed annual elements, including base pay and benefits, recognise the status of our executives and ensure current and future market competitiveness.
STI and LTI arrangements are designed to motivate and reward them for making the Company successful on a sustainable basis.
Executive directors are also expected to retain sufficient of the vested shares from LTI and deferred STI share incentive awards, over a five-year period from the time of their appointment, to meet their respective shareholding requirements.
The shareholding linkage cements the relationship between the executive directors personal returns and those of the Companys investors.
The committee has discretion to amend the weighting of STI and LTI measures from year to year, in order to ensure that the executive directors are incentivised to drive performance in line with the Companys core strategic objectives.

Malus provision All LTI and deferred STI awards contain a malus provision, which gives the committee the power to reduce awards if the results on which they were based were misleading or materially incorrect or were subsequently found to have relied on poor risk management or material misrepresentation of performance.
111 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued Notes to the Directors Remuneration Policy table Performance measures and targets The committee selects performance measures that are central to the Companys overall strategy and are used by the executive directors and Board in overseeing the operation of the business.
The performance targets for STI are determined annually by the committee and are set in a range around the business plan for the year, as agreed by the Board.
The committee believes that the current STI targets EPS in constant currency and RoE are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them either at the start or end of the performance period.
External directorships Executive directors are, subject to prior clearance by the Board, permitted to hold one external non-executive directorship of a listed company and are entitled to retain the fees payable to them for doing so.
Treatment of incentive awards on termination or change of control For all deferred shortand long-term incentives, the share incentive plan rules provide for automatic Good Leaver status on termination of employment in the event of: i death: ii retirement: iii injury or disability: iv redundancy: v the employing company or business ceasing to be a subsidiary or business of Old Mutual plc: and vi certain takeovers and other corporate events.
In addition, the committee has discretion to award Good Leaver status for any other reason discretionary Good Leavers.
In these circumstances, the committee has discretion to apply less generous terms than would apply under the automatic Good Leaver reasons.
The committees determination will take into account the particular circumstances of the executive directors departure and the recent performance of the Company.

Anyone who is not a Good Leaver or a discretionary Good Leaver Changes to Remuneration Policy from 2013 There have been no changes to the remuneration policy that applied in 2013.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Companys approach to executive director and wider employee remuneration is based on a common set of remuneration principles and a governance structure, which has been implemented across all major subsidiaries.
This includes subsidiary remuneration committees with agreed terms of reference, who have oversight over local matters and ensure that the remuneration principles and policies are implemented consistently.
Although the committee does not consult directly with employees on executive director remuneration policy, it reviews proposals in the context of a detailed understanding of remuneration for the broader employee population.
The structure of total remuneration packages for executive directors, and for the broader employee population, is similar, comprising base pay, pension and benefits and eligibility for a discretionary STI based on performance in the financial year.
The level of STI and the portion deferred are determined by role and responsibility.
The Group LTI plan applies to executive directors and senior executives based at the Groups Head Office in London, and other LTI plans are in place for senior executives in subsidiary companies.
Annual base pay increases for the executive directors are limited to the average pay increase for employees in their home country, unless there has been a change in role or salary progression for a newly appointed director.
Old Mutual plc 112 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Governance Approach to remuneration in connection with recruitment The committees approach to remuneration in connection with recruitment is to pay no more than is necessary to attract appropriate candidates to the role.
It should be noted that the Company operates in a specialised sector and many of its competitors for talent are from outside the UK.
Remuneration terms for any new executive directors will be based on the approved remuneration policy and would include the same elements, and be subject to the same constraints, as those of the existing executive directors as shown below: Element of remuneration Maximum percentage of base pay Base pay Benefit allowance for retirement, elective benefits or in cash 35% Other benefits Dependent on circumstances and location STI 150% LTI 250% 400% in exceptional circumstances When it is necessary to buy out an individuals unvested awards from a previous employer, the committee will seek to match the expected value of the awards by granting awards that vest over a time frame similar to those given up, with a commensurate reduction in quantum where the new awards will be subject to performance conditions that are not as stretching as those applicable to the awards given up.
Existing annual incentive given up may be bought out on an expected value basis or, at the discretion of the committee, through a guaranteed STI award for the first performance year only.
Where appropriate, the committee will agree reasonable costs of relocation in line with the Groups mobility policy, which based on individual circumstances, provides for a settling-in allowance and costs incurred such as travel, shipping, immigration and tax advice, temporary housing, transaction costs on home sale purchase, home school search and school fees and, if in relation to a temporary assignment, tax equalisation and a housing allowance.
All of these costs will be covered gross of tax incurred by the executive, where applicable.
Service agreements and payment for loss of office Executive directors service agreements are designed to provide an appropriate level of protection for the executive and the Company by: i setting out individual entitlements to elements of remuneration consistent with policy: ii summarising notice periods and compensation on termination of employment by the Company: and iii describing the obligations in relation to confidentiality, data protection, intellectual property and restraint on certain activities.
Service agreements for the current executive directors are available on the Companys website www.
In the event that the employment of an executive director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with the terms of the service agreement between the Company and the executive director, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
The Companys policy is to make payments in accordance with pre-established contractual arrangements, but with consideration of individual circumstances.
These circumstances may include the reason for termination and, for deferred STI and LTI share incentive awards, some discretion in the determination of Good Leaver status for vesting of such awards.
The policy in this respect is set out in the table below: Standard provision Policy Details Other provisions in contract Notice Policy is to provide a maximum of In certain cases, executive directors will not Current contractual terms were agreed 12 months notice.

A significant proportion of the potential remuneration of the executive directors is variable and is therefore performance-related and at risk.
60% of total remuneration is variable when performance is in line with expectations, and 74% at maximum award.
An LTI award has been shown in respect of the Group Finance Director, in order to illustrate the full-year remuneration, however, no LTI award will be granted to Philip Broadley because of his planned departure from the Group during 2014.

Consideration of shareholder views The committee considers shareholder feedback in relation to the Directors Remuneration Report for the prior year at its first meeting following the AGM.
This feedback, as well as any additional feedback received during any other meetings with shareholders, is then considered as part of the Companys annual review of remuneration arrangements for the following year.
Where any significant change is proposed, the Chairman of the committee will inform major shareholders in advance, and will offer a meeting to discuss these.
During 2013, the committee took into account feedback it received from investors in consultation, firstly in relation to the vesting outcome of the OMSIP that specifically dealt with the strategic initiatives undertaken by the Group for the period 2010 to 2012, and secondly on the new LTI performance measures introduced in 2013 which will continue in 2014.
In relation to the Directors Remuneration Policy, no significant changes are proposed and accordingly, no detailed consultation has been undertaken.
115 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued Annual Report on Remuneration Market benchmarks Two peer groups are used for benchmarking executive directors on a total remuneration basis.
The primary peer group comprises large European insurers and, for 2013 and 2014, included Prudential plc, Aviva plc, RSA Insurance Group Plc, Legal & General Group Plc, Standard Life plc, Allianz Group and Axa Group.
The secondary peer group is based on FTSE100 companies by market capitalisation and, for 2013 and 2014, the committee used the 25th to 75th ranked companies by market capitalisation.
For non-executive directors, benchmarking is performed against the Deloitte Directors remuneration in FTSE100 companies survey, using the whole of the FTSE100 as well as an extract of companies by market capitalisation.
Single total figures of remuneration for executive directors Audited In order to provide clarity to shareholders and in recognition of the then draft proposals by the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills BIS, a single total figure of remuneration was published in 2012 for each of our executive directors.
Since the 2012 report was published, BIS has finalised the methodology for how the single total figure should be calculated.
The single total figure disclosure for 2013 has accordingly been revised to align with the requirements and the corresponding revised single total figures for 2012 are also provided.
The notes below explain the changes.
We now include the elements shown in the table entitled Taxable benefits and these amounts represent the gross value of benefits that are chargeable to UK income tax.
The column headed Other represents various incidental benefits, which are not considered to be significant in value.
STI STI awarded in relation to performance in the year, including 50% that is deferred for three years in the form of a share incentive award.
Vesting of the share incentive award is not subject to the achievement of performance targets.
LTI The 2012 Directors Remuneration Report reflected the value of LTI vesting based on the average Old Mutual plc share price over the final quarter of 2012 172.8p as the options had not vested at the time of publication.
The figures have been updated to reflect the actual market value of 50% of the award that vested in May 2013, namely 216.3p per share, while the balance of 50% which vests in May 2014 remains valued as it was in 2012.
The 2013 LTI values have been calculated using the average share price over the final quarter of 2013 194.3p and, for the 50% of the award that will vest in April 2014, will be restated in the 2014 Directors Remuneration Report.
Philip Broadleys LTI value for 2013 has been calculated on a pro-rata basis for the 50% of the award that is due to vest in 2015, assuming he leaves the Group on 13 June 2014, which is consistent with the basis of calculation used for the remuneration disclosure made by the Company on 13 December 2013.

Shares in trust and shareholder dilution There are currently 136,831,473 shares held in employee share ownership trusts ESOTs for the purposes of collaterising some of the obligations under the Groups employee share incentive schemes.
The strategy is to ensure that, with the exception of Black Economic Empowerment-related ESOTs, at least sufficient shares are held to satisfy restricted share forfeitable shares awards.
In calculating dilution limits, any awards that are satisfied by transfer of pre-existing issued shares such as shares acquired by market purchase through ESOTs and any shares comprised in any share option or share award that has lapsed or has been cash-settled are disregarded.
At 31 December 2013, the Company had 2.07% of share capital available under the 5%-in-10-years limit applicable to discretionary share incentive schemes and 6.37% of share capital available under the 10%-in-10-years limit applicable to all share incentive schemes.
The Company has complied with the limits at all times.
Directors shareholdings and share interests Audited Within a period of five years of appointment to the role, the Group Chief Executive is required to build up a holding of shares in the Company equal in value to 200% of base pay, and the equivalent figure for other executive directors is 150% of base pay.
Unvested share awards or share options and vested but unexercised share options are excluded for the purposes of the calculations.
There is no requirement for executive directors to hold shares or share interests in the Company once they have ceased employment with the Group.
The following table illustrates that both Julian Roberts and Philip Broadley met their respective requirements at 31 December 2013.
Shares have been valued for these purposes at the year-end price, which was 189.1p per share.
There have been no changes to the directors shareholdings between 31 December 2013 and 28 February 2014, however, 15.9% of the nil cost share options granted in 2011 lapsed due to the partial achievement of performance targets, as set out in the 2011 LTI awards due to vest to the executive directors section of this report.

The split in financial metrics and personal scorecard objectives remains 75% in respect of financial metrics and 25% in respect of personal scorecard objectives for Julian Roberts, and 50% in respect of financial metrics and 50% in respect of personal scorecard objectives for Philip Broadley.
In accordance with the Groups announcement that Philip Broadley will leave the Group during 2014, it has been agreed that a pro-rata STI for the period worked in 2014 will be calculated at the end of the year in the normal way, based on the outcome of the financial metrics, as set out on the following page, and personal scorecard objectives for 2014.
Any award will be paid in cash in March 2015.
The agreed financial measures for 2014 are EPS in constant currency and RoE.
These have been used as the core measures of financial performance for a number of years, as they are the most meaningful central measures of the efficient use of capital and annual profit.
The committee believes that the STI targets are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them either at the start or end of the performance period.
The committee has discretion to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues, to the extent relevant, when setting executive directors remuneration.

123 Strategic objectives Financial DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued The committee will apply its discretion in determining the final outcomes in relation to the 2014 LTI, and in this regard: It will receive a report from the Chief Risk Officer to confirm that the performance of the Group has been achieved within the stated risk appetite.
Where the risk appetite has been breached, the committee will have discretion to reduce the level of vesting accordingly It will exercise its discretion to make adjustments where there is a significant negative impact on underlying financial performance which is not adequately reflected in AOP results for example, where LTIR adjustments create any inconsistency between AOP and IFRS basic earnings.
Where the Group undergoes a significant change, such as a large disposal, acquisition or restructuring, the committee will review the targets to assess whether they need to be adjusted to reflect the change, or whether they should be replaced altogether.
TSR multiplier A TSR multiplier will be used to adjust the weighted average outcome of the LTI scorecard in the table shown on the previous page, as follows.
TSR will be averaged at the start Q4 2013 and end Q4 2016 of the three-year performance period.

Danuta Gray will replace Alan Gillespie as Chairman of the committee at the conclusion of the Companys AGM on 15 May 2014.
The committee Chairman has access to and regular contact with the Group Human Resources Department independently of the executive directors.
During 2013, the committee met six times.
The Board accepted the recommendations made by the committee during the year without amendment.
Paul Forsythe, Assistant Company Secretary, acted as Secretary to the committee.
Advisers to the committee The committee assesses the quality of the advice received from its independent adviser annually and has a policy to renew such appointment from year to year.
As part of its annual assessment, the committee reviews whether the independent adviser is giving advice that is objective and independent.
Following its review at the end of 2012, the committee renewed the appointment of Alan Judes as its independent adviser for 2013, through his consultancy Strategic Remuneration, and has also done so for the first six months of 2014, at which time a further review of the role of independent adviser will be undertaken once Danuta Gray has taken over from Alan Gillespie as Chairman of the committee.
A copy of Alan Judes letter of engagement is on the Companys website.
Any work that the Company wishes Alan Judes to do on its behalf, rather than for the committee, is pre-cleared with the committee Chairman with a view to avoiding any conflicts of interest.
