52 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Directors remuneration report continued Annual report on remuneration continued 2013 annual bonus award Executive directors had the potential to receive an annual bonus of up to 120% of base salary.
The primary driver of any award is based on Group EBITDA performance relative to targets set at the start of the financial year.
In assessing the final award, the required Group EBITDA isadjusted up or down dependent upon the actual market size relative to the plan.
The market size is measured based on the independent Land Registry data as at the end of September, plus full year indicative estimates.
Group EBITDA is also adjusted for any significant benefit andcosts associated with major unplanned initiatives such as acquisitions.
To receive an award, an executive director also has to have performed at an individual level.
In determining the 2013 annual bonus award, the Committee considered: Group EBITDA of 86.6 million, which represents significant outperformance of the target Group EBITDA of 74.1 million in the plan: Y an estimated market size considerably larger, 13%, than anticipated: Y the achievement of significant projects, including the IPO, multiple acquisitions including LSH, ongoing efficiency, IT transformation Y programme: and the strong contribution from each executive director.
Y Whilst performance against the original plan would have triggered a maximum bonus of 120% of base salary, the larger than expected market size resulted in a flexing downwards of the annual bonus award to 100% of base salary.
The following table illustrates the performance measures and Group targets, their significance in terms of value and the respective outcomes: Performance required Measure Weighting Threshold 0ntarget Maximum Actual Payout Flexed Group EBITDA 100% 69.2m 84.1m 89.0m 84.3m 83.3% of maximum Scheme interests awarded during the year LTIP Awards On 6 September 2013, the following LTIP awards, the first set of awards under the annual grant policy, were granted to executive directors: % of face value Share price at Face value that would vest Vesting Normal vesting Type Basis of date of grant Number of award at threshold determined by exercise Executive of award award granted pence of shares 000 performance performance over date 150% of EPS: 1 January 2013 Grenville Turner 129,545 712 Nil cost salary 31 December 2015 6 September 2016 option 550 25% TSR: 19 March 2013 6 September 2023 130% of Jim Clarke 70,909 390 March 2016 salary Performance targets for these awards are as follows: absolute EPS twothirds 25% of this part of an award will vest for EPS of 36 pence increasing prorata to 100% vesting for EPS Y of44pence for the year ending 31 December 2015: and relative TSR onethird the Companys TSR measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding financial services companies Y and investment trusts.

53 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Scheme interests awarded during the year continued IPO options Prior to the IPO, management participated in a management incentive plan MIP arrangement which was typical of those arrangements operated by private equitybacked companies.
Rather than crystallising the MIP arrangement at IPO and therefore significantly reducing the retentiveness of senior executive packages, following discussions with the Companys major shareholders at the time, MIP awards were rolled over into a new arrangement with awards granted over Countrywide plc shares IPO Options to ensure that the management team continued tobe appropriately retained and incentivised to deliver earnings growth and shareholder return in the years immediately following IPO.
