Booker Group plc annual report & accounts 2013 REMUNERATION REPORT Chairmans Introduction to the Remuneration Report I am pleased to present the Report of the Remuneration Committee for 2013, which sets out the remuneration paid to the directors in the financial year ended 29 March 2013 and the policy for the forthcoming year.
In 2012 the Department for Business Innovation and Skills BIS announced a programme of legislative reforms to executive pay.
These proposals will change the way that we are required to report to you on directors remuneration in the future and the Remuneration Committee has agreed to adopt some of the key requirements in advance of the formal regulations coming into force.
The Report therefore follows a new structure this year and includes this summary statement which the Committee hopes you will find informative.
The work of the Remuneration Committee in 2013 was influenced by the shareholder vote in respect of the Remuneration Report at the 2012 AGM where 76.2% of votes cast were in favour of the resolution to approve the Report.
Following the AGM, the Committee sought feedback from the Companys major shareholders.
This feedback indicated that the votes against the Report were largely as a result of an objection to the single performance condition required under the Performance Share Plan PSP, which was based on the share price exceeding certain pre-determined targets for at least sixty consecutive days at any time during the three year vesting period.
The Committee considered the points raised by shareholders and decided to change the performance conditions for future PSP awards so that they are more similar to those in other FTSE companies equivalent plans.
The Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration policies of the Company are in line with the BIS proposals, whereby: Directors should not be rewarded for failure and incentives for senior management should be closely linked to performance, thus aligning the interests of executives and shareholders: and Directors rewards should be correlated with those received by other employees of the business.
The Committee believes that the Companys remuneration system conforms with these objectives whilst retaining and attracting individuals capable of promoting the success of the business.
Alignment between the senior management and shareholders is also significantly increased by personal shareholdings.
Directors, senior managers and colleagues own in aggregate over 8% of the issued share capital of the Company.
The Committee is of the view that we have a structure of reasonable base pay, bonuses and long term incentives which are aligned to the creation of shareholder value.
The Committee believes that this remuneration system is simple to understand, has a proven track record of encouraging strong performance, does not reward failure and reflects the Companys goal of creating value for shareholders.
Moreover, we believe that the remuneration policy and incentive framework in place is working well to support the Companys strategy, is helping to retain and motivate our management team and is helping to drive strong returns for our shareholders.
We look forward to hearing your views in the future and hope to receive your continued support at this years AGM.
On behalf of the Board Karen Jones Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 22 May 2013 23 Booker Group plc annual report & accounts 2013 REMUNERATION REPORT continued The Remuneration Committee Role of the Committee The Remuneration Committee has defined Terms of Reference which were reviewed in May 2011 and can be found in the Investor Relations legal Documents section of the Groups website.

In November 2012, the Chairman of the Committee approached major shareholders outlining potential changes to future PSP performance conditions.
Meetings and conference calls were held with many of them, as well as shareholder representative organisations, at which details of the changes were discussed.
voting in respect of the Remuneration Report at the 2012 AGM was as follows: For Against Withheld Total Approve the Remuneration Report 934,228,466 291,167,313 57,277,131 1,225,395,779 External Advisors  llP PwC at the request of the Committee provided benchmarking information on executive remuneration and advice in relation to the operation of the Companys PSP.
PwC did not provide any other services to the Group during the year.
Policy: Remuneration policy for the 2014 financial year In this forward-looking section we describe our reward principles along with a description of the elements of the reward package and an indication of the future value of this package for each of the Executive Directors.
Key remuneration principles The principles supporting the Executive Directors reward package are reviewed each year to ensure that they continue to underpin the Groups strategy.
The Committees overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages.
The Company wishes to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior management of the requisite quality.
Accordingly, the Committees policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward Executive Directors and senior employees fairly for their individual contribution.
The Committee will take into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when determining Executive Directors remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases.

Fixed and variable pay mix Individual reward elements for all Executive Directors excluding Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, who does not participate in any incentive schemes are designed to provide a balance between fixed remuneration and variable at risk reward, linked to the performance of the Company.
Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen from the outset not to participate in the bonus scheme.
The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arises from his significant shareholding in the Company.
The usual pay mix for Executive Directors is as follows at target and maximum levels: 26 Booker Group plc annual report & accounts 2013 Target Maximum Opportunity Executive Director Fixed Pay % Variable Pay % Fixed Pay % Variable Pay % Charles Wilson 100 0 100 0 Jonathan Prentis 48 52 32 68 Mark Aylwin 48 52 32 68 Guy Farrant 48 52 32 68 Bryn Satherley 48 52 32 68 Fixed pay comprises base salary and pension contributions equivalent to 15% of base salary.
variable pay comprises the annual bonus and the long term incentive opportunity delivered via the PSP.
Target performance assumes Bonus award is at target 50% of salary and PSP award is valued at 75% of salary, measured at the time of grant.
Maximum performance assumes Bonus award is at maximum 100% of salary and PSP award is valued at 150% of salary, measured at the time of grant.
Salary and benefits Base salary is the only element of remuneration which is pensionable.
In addition to salary, certain usual benefits are provided to Executive Directors.
All colleagues are eligible for an annual pay award and in the past year the average pay increase for the Groups employees was 2.23% year on year.
Due to the enlargement of the Group following the acquisition of Makro, the responsibilities and workload of the Executive Directors increased.
To address this the Committee engaged PwC to conduct a benchmarking review of Executive Directors remuneration and, as a consequence, the base salary of four Executive Directors was increased.
Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, did not receive a salary increase.
The average pay increase year on year of the Executive Directors was 10.87%, although following these increases all Executive Directors salaries remain at or below the median benchmark.
With effect from 1 April 2013, subject to the annual pay rise, the Executive Directors annual salary in relation to the Company will be as follows: 2013 Executive Director 000 Charles Wilson 510 Jonathan Prentis 345 Mark Aylwin 315 Guy Farrant 335 Bryn Satherley 280 Bonus The bonus scheme covers Executive Directors, senior managers, branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 1,200 employees of the Group.
The aggregate bonus pool is determined each year by the level of improvement in Group EBIT year on year previously EBITDA and no bonus is paid unless there is an improvement.
The maximum bonus achievable for an Executive Director is 100% of basic salary.
Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen not to participate in this bonus scheme.
Payments to Executive Directors are based upon a percentage of basic salary and do not form part of pensionable earnings.
The proportion of the bonus pool accruing to Executive Directors is less than 15%.
Of the Groups average 9,658 employees excluding Makro, over 6,000 employees are eligible for a bonus payment based on customer satisfaction.
Customer satisfaction is measured independently by calling 10,000 customers selected at random covering retailers, caterers, delivered and collect across our 172 branches each quarter to ask them to rate key areas of service.
Around 1,300 logistics employees are eligible for a quarterly bonus payment based on achieving productivity and efficiency targets at the site at which they are employed.
From 2014 the Groups bonus schemes will be extended to cover Makros employees.
27 Booker Group plc annual report & accounts 2013 REMUNERATION REPORT continued PSP The PSP allows Executive Directors and approximately 900 employees to receive share awards, subject to the achievement of performance targets set by the Committee, measured over a three year period.
Awards are made annually and, other than in exceptional circumstances, will not be more than 150% of annual salary for Executive Directors.
For the 2010 13 and 2011 14 PSP cycle, the performance measures were share price based.
Details of structure and outcome are set out on page 36.
For the 2012 15 PSP cycle, the Committee resolved to grant maximum awards at 150% of base salary for the Executive Directors.
vesting for points between Threshold and Maximum will be calculated on a straight line basis, as follows: 50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting at 8% growth per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting for 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 years from the award date.
50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving Absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as measured between March 2012 and March 2015.
In setting the TSR performance target, the Committee has taken into account the TSR returns achieved by companies in the FTSE350 commencing with the three year period to May 2002 and then walking forward on a weekly basis with the last data point being the returns of each company through to July 2012.
There is no re-testing of performance targets under the PSP, and awards lapse if they are not met.
The performance measures for the 2013 16 cycle for the Executive Directors excluding Charles Wilson are expected to be similar to the 2012 15 PSP cycle.
From 2014 the Groups PSP schemes will be extended to cover Makros employees.
Pensions The Company operates and has open to all permanent employees the Group defined contribution personal pension plan.
As an alternative to the pension arrangement, pensionable pay may be paid into the Executive Directors own personal pension arrangement.
The normal retirement age for Executive Directors is 65.
All Executive Directors are entitled to a pension contribution at the rate of 15% of pensionable pay.
Pensionable pay is set at the prior years basic salary.
A salary sacrifice arrangement was introduced for the Group Personal Pension Scheme in order to maximise benefits available to the Schemes members.
Other benefits Benefits for Executive Directors comprise car or car allowance, life cover of four times basic salary, private medical insurance and permanent health insurance for themselves and their families.
Clawback in incentive plans For awards made from 2013, the Bonus schemes and PSP allow the Committee discretion to claw back bonus and unvested share awards in the following circumstances: misconduct that causes significant damage or potential damage to the Companys prospects, finances or brand reputation: and or actions that lead to material misstatement or restatement of accounts.
This feature helps ensure alignment between executive rewards and shareholder returns.

All figures are calculated in accordance with our understanding of the requirements of the current draft BIS regulations on disclosure of executive pay.
Executive shareholding requirement Alignment to shareholder interests is a key element of the Groups remuneration policy which maintains commitment over the long term and ensures that the interests of the Executive Directors are aligned with those of shareholders.
The Committee sets shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors.
The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal and or spousal holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least the Directors annual base salary.
The Executive Directors currently meet these guidelines.
Details of the share interests of all Directors are shown below.
Shares held outright by each Executive Director at 29 March 2013 with no restrictions: Director Ordinary Shares Charles Wilson 108,241,986 Jonathan Prentis 10,413,807 Mark Aylwin 1,100,000 Guy Farrant 668,547 Bryn Satherley 8,363,486 29 Booker Group plc annual report & accounts 2013 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Bonus In 2013 the bonus scheme covered Executive Directors, senior managers, branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 1,200 employees of the Group.
The aggregate bonus pool was determined by the level of improvement in Group EBITDA year on year and no bonus would have been paid if there were no improvement.
The maximum bonus achievable for an Executive Director was 100% of basic salary.
Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen not to participate in this bonus scheme, and the Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arises from his significant shareholding in the Company.
The level of pre-bonus EBITDA achieved in 2013 gave rise to the following awards to the Executive Directors: Director EBITDA award as % of salary Jonathan Prentis 55.26 Mark Aylwin 55.26 Guy Farrant 55.26 Bryn Satherley 55.26 Bonus payments awarded to each Executive Directors, other than Charles Wilson who received no bonus, as a proportion of salary in the three previous financial years.

In addition 1,951 employees participate in the 2012 and 1,821 are in the 2011 SAYE scheme in which the Executive Directors have chosen not to participate.
The high number of employees participating in these schemes is consistent with the Groups policy of ensuring that the remuneration of the Executive Directors is aligned with that of the overall workforce and with the interests of shareholders.
Since 2007, when the reverse takeover of Blueheath was completed and the Company became admitted to trading on AIM, the equity value of the Company has increased from approximately 300m to over 2,100m.
The value of the PSP options awarded has been equivalent to 2% of the value generated.

31 Booker Group plc annual report & accounts 2013 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Other matters Performance Graph The Companys performance from 28 March 2008 to 29 March 2013 measured by Total Shareholder Return TSR, is compared in the chart below with the performance of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and FTSE AIM All Share Index.
These are considered the most appropriate indices against which to measure performance following the reverse acquisition of Blueheath in June 2007, which was at that time listed on AIM, the Companys admission to listing on the Official list and to trading on the london Stock Exchange plcs main market for listed securities in July 2009 and its inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index in December 2009.
TSR is defined as the return a shareholder would receive if they held a notional number of shares and received dividends over a period of time.
Assuming dividends are reinvested into the Companys shares, it measures the percentage growth in the Companys share price together with any dividends paid.

The Board has determined that the time commitment of Non-Executive Directors should be 12 days per annum, other than the Chairman whose time commitment should be 24 days per annum.
The time commitment for Non-Executive Directors is set out in the relevant Non-Executive Directors letter of appointment.
The Non-Executive Directors do not receive bonuses or pension contributions and are not entitled to participate in any of the Companys share schemes.
They are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties as Directors of the Company.
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors other than the Chairman are determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors, having regard to fees paid to Non-Executive Directors in other comparable UK quoted companies, the time commitment and responsibilities of the role.

The service contracts of each of the current Executive Directors provide for such a period of notice.
Termination None of the contracts except for Charles Wilsons contract provides for specific contractual termination payments other than payment in lieu of notice.
Under Charles Wilsons contract, in the event of a change of control of the Company, Charles Wilson has the right to terminate his employment on 30 days notice and to receive a payment equal to his gross salary for his contractual notice period.
It is the Committees policy to ensure that a Directors duty to mitigate his loss is taken into account in the calculation of any termination payments.
The Companys approach to the termination of contracts of service of Executive Directors is dictated by the relevant events, bearing in mind the circumstances of termination and the interests of the Company.
External appointments Executive Directors are not permitted to hold directorships or offices of companies whose shares are listed on a recognised stock exchange and, accordingly, no Executive Director serves as a Non-Executive Director of any such company.
Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of 3 years subject to termination on one months notice.
In addition, the Code requires that all Non-Executive Directors stand for re-election annually.
Non-Executive Director appointments are also subject to the Articles of Association of the Company.

As a result of concerns expressed by shareholders during 2012, the Committee decided to review the structure of the PSP performance conditions so that they were more in line with equivalent plans used by other FTSE companies.
As a result new performance conditions relating to the 2012 PSP awards were adopted and will apply as follows: 50% of each award would be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting at 8% growth per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting for 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 years from the award date.
50% of each award would be linked to an Absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving Absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as measured between March 2012 and March 2015.
The options granted will vest and become exercisable three years from the date of award, subject to continued employment and the performance conditions outlined above being satisfied and will lapse if not exercised within 10 years of the date of award.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 22 May 2013.
