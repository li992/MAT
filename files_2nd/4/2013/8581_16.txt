Performance measures and target setting The annual bonus is assessed against both financial and individual targets determined by the Committee.
This enables the Committee to reward both annual financial performance delivered for shareholders, and performance against specific financial, operational or strategic objectives set for each director, which are closely linked to the strategic priorities of the business.
The Committee sets targets for the long-term incentive plans taking into account external forecasts, internal budgets and business priorities.
Targets are set to be appropriately stretching in this context with maximum performance being set at a level which is considered to be the delivery of exceptional performance.
When considering performance outcomes the Committee will look beyond formulaic results to ensure the outcomes align with the overall business performance.

The package will be competitive to attract and retain the best candidate for the job.
Where possible, the Committee will always seek to align the remuneration package with the remuneration policy outlined above.
However, where appropriate, elements of the package may be outside of this policy to meet the circumstances of the individual upon recruitment.
The Committee will ensure that the arrangements are in the best interests of both ITV and its shareholders and remain subject to the overall variable pay limits set out below.
Ongoing remuneration In determining an appropriate remuneration structure and levels, the Committee will take into account all relevant factors to ensure they are able to recruit the best candidate for the job and that the arrangements are in the best interests of both ITV and its shareholders.
The Committee will typically seek to align the ongoing remuneration package with the ongoing remuneration policy outlined in the table on pages 85 to 87.
The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted to a new director upon appointment excluding any buy-out awards for forfeited remuneration will not be greater than 550% of salary the sum of the maximum bonus and maximum new LTIP opportunities.
Buy-out awards for forfeited The Committee may make awards to buy out a candidates remuneration arrangements that are remuneration forfeited as a result of leaving their previous employer.
In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attaching to forfeited awards, the likelihood of the awards vesting and the form and timing of the awards.
The Committee will typically seek to make buy-out awards on a comparable basis to those that have been forfeited.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee may grant a buy-out award under a structure not included in the policy but that is consistent with the principles set out above.
The Committee will take all relevant factors into account including the candidates location, the calibre of the individual, external influences, internal relativities and the overall business context when determining the new remuneration package and seek to ensure that no more is paid than necessary.
In the Remuneration Report following the appointment, the Committee will fully explain to shareholders the remuneration package for the appointed individual and the rationale for such arrangements and will display such information on the ITV plc website and announce via a regulatory information service as soon as practicable following the appointment.
Service contracts and loss of office Executive Directors Executive Directors have rolling service contracts that provide for 12 months notice on either side.
There are no special provisions that apply in the event of a change of control.
A payment in lieu of notice, including base salary, contractual benefits and contractual provision for an income in retirement may be made if: the Company terminates the employment of the executive with immediate effect, or without due notice: or termination is agreed by mutual consent.
The Company may also make a payment in respect of outplacement costs, legal fees and the cost of any settlement agreement where appropriate.
com Stock code: ITV With the exception of termination for cause or resignation, Executive Directors will be eligible for a bonus award prorated to reflect the proportion of the financial year for which they were employed and subject to performance achieved, provided they have a minimum of three months service in the bonus year.

Adam Crozier is currently a non-executive director of G4S plc.
Employment conditions elsewhere in the Company When setting the policy for directors remuneration, the Committee considers the pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere in the Company.
The Company does not consult directly with employees in respect of determining the Directors remuneration policy.
However, the Committee does receive general feedback from employees via the HR function as part of the output from the employee engagement survey and receives a report on employment practices elsewhere in the Company.
Shareholder views The Committee maintains regular and transparent communication with shareholders.
We believe that it is important to regularly meet with our key shareholders to understand their views on our remuneration arrangements and what they would like to see going forward.
We welcome feedback from shareholders at any time during the year.
Where we are proposing to make any significant changes to the remuneration framework we seek major shareholders views and take these into account when determining any changes to the remuneration policy.

The personal targets include a combination of specific financial metrics and key strategic deliverables.
