Over the year, all elements of the package for executive directors were reviewed by the Remuneration Committee.
After careful consideration, no material changes have been recommended to the policy.
However, the committee has reviewed the policy for executive directors in the context of the Operating Board comprising the nine most senior executives, including the executive directors and the broader employee group generally.
A number of principles have been clarified, as follows: Remuneration arrangements for the Operating Board should align the interests of shareholders and senior executives by using performance metrics that provide a strong link to the business strategy and support the creation of shareholder value.
Share ownership guidelines for the Operating Board should encourage the acquisition and retention of Home Retail Group shares.
Remuneration packages for the Operating Board and the wider leadership team should contain performance-related elements, the potential value of which increases proportionately with seniority.

For Richard Ashton, they were provided through the Groups main defined benefit pension scheme until 31 January 2013 and through a non-contributory unapproved unfunded retirement benefit scheme for earnings above 137,400 to 30 April 2013.
From 1 May 2013, pension provision for both executive directors is provided in the form of an annual cash allowance, as described in the key features of the remuneration policy table on page 42.
Annual bonus plan As detailed in the policy report, the annual bonus plan is a short-term incentive in which performance is measured over a single financial year, with metrics based on benchmark PBT and adjusted cash flow.
For the benchmark PBT element of the bonus, the profit performance delivered was at the mid-point of the target range.
In relation to the adjusted cash flow element, actual adjusted cash flow exceeded the top end of the range and therefore generated maximum payment for this part of the scheme.
Overall, the bonus payment for each executive director was 118.5% of salary, out of the maximum opportunity of 150% of salary.
However, in consideration of the alignment of the level of reward with overall Group performance, the executive directors agreed with the committee that the bonus payment would be reduced by one third to 79% of salary.
In addition, Terry Duddy has agreed that his full bonus payment be deferred in shares for three years.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to adjust the payment under this plan in the event that an exceptional event outside of the directors control occurs which, in the committees opinion, materially affected the bonus payment.
On this occasion, the committee did not need to apply such discretion.
Current Long-Term Incentive Plans Home Retail Group Performance Share Plan For 2013 PSP awards, the benchmark EPS element 60% of award will require CAGR of 15% at threshold for 25% vesting and vesting at 100% will require CAGR of 35%, with both growth rates being measured over a three-year period.
For the TSR element 40% of award, threshold vesting at 25% will require median performance rising to 100% vesting for performance at the 90th percentile, on a straight-line performance basis.
The comparator group for the 2013 plan is as follows : Dixons Retail Topps Tiles Mothercare Debenhams Dunelm Group Next Travis Perkins WH Smith Carphone Warehouse Group J Sainsbury Halfords Group Marks & Spencer Group Kingfisher Tesco Morrison WM Supermarkets Amendments have been made to the comparator group to reflect Signet Group cancelling their listing and the delisting of Game Group.
