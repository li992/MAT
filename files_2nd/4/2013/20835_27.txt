Directors remuneration report Sir Mark Wrightson, Committee chairman Dear Shareholder, The Committees key objectives continue to be to attract and retain high-calibre executives: reward performance in the context of appropriate risk management: align the interests of executives with those of shareholders: and to build and maintain a sustainable performance culture.
We are, for the first time, setting out the full details of aspects of our remuneration approach that have not been formulated into a policy before.
Following major shareholder consultation in early 2014, we believe these policies will not be controversial.
The aim of this report is to provide relevant and transparent information about the policy and remuneration of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
There have been no substantial changes in the year to either the remuneration policy or the Executive Directors remuneration.
Page 95 provides a summary of remuneration paid in the year, including, as in previous years, a single figure for the remuneration of each of the Executive Directors.
The Company has started a Group-wide review of remuneration that aims to arrive at a suitable reward and remuneration structure, recognising the review of the Groups strategy in 2013.
Resulting from the remuneration review and the planned consultation with leading shareholders and their representative bodies, it is likely that the new remuneration arrangements will require shareholder approval in late 2014.
This is to ensure our new arrangements will be in place for the beginning of the next financial year, enabling and supporting our strategy for the following three years.
Yours sincerely Sir Mark Wrightson 28 February 2014 84 Amlin plc 2013 Annual Report STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Executive remuneration levels 10 year CEO Total Remuneration vs TSR In setting and reviewing executive Amlin plc TSR CEO Total Remuneration remuneration levels, the Committee TSR rebased to 100 CEO Remuneration 000s takes into account Amlins remuneration strategy.

Amlin plc 2013 Annual Report 95 Directors remuneration report continued Details of variable pay earned in the year Group Bonus Scheme For those Executive Directors and other employees who are not directly involved in underwriting activities, the Groups shorter-term performance incentive is a cash bonus scheme.
The Group Bonus Scheme rewards and incentivises participants against a mixture of business and personal performance.
The business performance is measured by reference to the Groups ROE compared with target returns set by the Committee at the beginning of each year.
The individuals performance is measured against agreed stretching personal objectives.
The mix of business and individual bonus elements varies by seniority, with 70% of the potential target reward at the most senior role levels including participating Executive Directors being rewarded on Group business performance, and 30% on personal performance.
The total target and maximum bonus levels also increase with seniority.
For 2013, the Executive Directors scale was 75% for on-target performance, rising to a potential maximum of 165% of base salary if the Group business and personal performance elements reached their maxima.
For Directors and those at other senior management levels, any amount of annual bonus above the base salary maximum percentage for the relevant management level for example, 120% for Executive Directors will be deferred for three years from the usual date of payment.
Total or partial claw-back of such deferred cash bonus will also apply in the event of either the Committee finding that a participant has not complied with internal standards or controls: or has caused reputational damage to the Company: or if any results or accounts on which the bonus was based prove to be incorrect or are required to be re-stated.
Provisions also apply whereby a leaver during the three-year deferral period will forfeit the deferred bonus, unless they leave for one of a number of specified good leaver reasons, including circumstances the Committee agrees to be exceptional.
The business performance targets for the 2013 annual bonus and performance against them are set out below.

It consists of a cash profit share in respect of each underwriting year.
Participants are from the UK and Bermudian businesses, and include certain Executive Directors of Amlin plc.
PC is paid on an underwriting-year basis, usually partly related to the business unit in which the relevant participant works and partly to wider Syndicate 2001 and Amlin Bermuda underwriting performance.
PCs structure comprises two elements: profit award and performance award.
For Amlin London and Amlin Bermuda, the profit award is made up of a profit pool, comprising two elements: business unit award 50% of profit pool and divisional award 50% of profit pool.
100% of Amlin UK profit award comprises a divisional profit pool.
The performance award is calculated on a combination of Group and personal performance during the Groups accounting year, as measured against pre-determined objectives.
PC payments are capped as a percentage of annual salary, based on job role.
A retrospective loss clause is also incorporated to ensure any loss in one year is offset against profits in another year.
PC for an underwriting year is calculated over a 36-month period from the start of the underwriting year, allowing for a more informed assessment of reserves.
Payments for this are paid in two tranches.
The first 30% of the estimated payment is made in the second year following the year of account: and a further balancing payment of 70% of the estimated payment is made in the year following the year of account.
Employees based in Switzerland participate in a separate local scheme, which is operated on a similar basis to the UK PC scheme.
The Swiss PC is based on an accounting GAAP Generally Accepted Accounting Principles year basis.
Eligible employees in Amlin Europe participate in an annual bonus scheme.
For underwriting participants, this includes a performance measure against underwriting profitability.
Simon Beale moved to a Group Underwriting role during 2012 and, reflecting his change in responsibilities, he moved from the Amlin Syndicate PC scheme, covering Amlin London and Amlin Bermuda, to a Group PC Scheme in 2013.
This aligns Mr Beales shorter-term incentive to the Groups performance rather than just divisional performance.
The Group scheme is accounted for on a GAAP year basis and, unlike his historic awards, is paid in the year following the performance period rather than over a 36-month period as detailed above.
Therefore in 2014 and 2015 Mr Beale will receive a deferred payment under his historic awards as well as a payment from the Group Scheme.
Mr Beale will receive his final payment in respect of 2011, an interim payment in respect of 2012 and his payment for 2013 all during 2014.
The 600% cap for each scheme will still apply and any award in excess of 300% will still be deferred as detailed in the Policy table.

The Committee believes the Capital Builder Plan is a significant retention and recruitment tool for underwriters who are likely to be most significant in determining the Groups underwriting profitability and development over each performance period.
Awards have been made under the Plan to between 50 and 60 participants from Amlin London, Amlin UK, Amlin AG and Amlin Bermuda in 2006 to 2013 inclusive.
Payments under the Plan may be made at the Companys discretion in either cash or shares.
There is a cap of 1 million on the total amount that may be paid to a participant in respect of each rolling five-year performance period.
Payments will be made over the two years after the end of each performance period.
Awards were made in each of the years from 2009 to 2013 inclusive in respect of performance periods of five underwriting years commencing in the year each respective award was made.
Forecasts of rewards in respect of all performance periods are subject to change, particularly regarding later performance periods.
Subject to that caveat, the forecast rewards based on earned premium and reserving as at 31 December 2013, for the periods stated to date, are as set out below.
Where a positive result on the Syndicate creates a shortfall against the demanding return targets on individual classes, no payment will be due.
Share awards made in 2013 PSP awards The Amlin Performance Share Plan 2004 PSP helps recruit, retain, motivate and reward a small number of key senior executives who are not underwriters, including relevant Executive Directors.
Awards have been made each year since 2004.
During 2013, awards were made to a total of 19 participants 2012: 27 over an aggregate of 675,314 shares 2012: 968,510.
The rules of the PSP provide that no individual may receive an annual award over shares valued on grant at more than 100% of base salary.
During 2013, the maximum such value was awarded to the Chief Executive, the Group Finance & Operations Director and the Group Chief Underwriting Officer.
Once the vesting level is determined after five years in accordance with the performance condition, and provided the relevant participant is still employed by the Group, an award can be exercised within the following 30 months.
The amount to which PSP awards vest would depend on a sliding scale of the Groups average annual post tax return on net tangible assets return on NTA over the ensuing five years, as set out on page 96.
Amlin Long Term Incentive Plan 2006 LTIP The LTIP replaced grants of executive share options from 2007 onwards.
Senior underwriters and senior non-underwriters, including Executive Directors, participate in the LTIP.
Awards were made in 2013 to 110 participants in all parts of the Group 2012: 118, over a total of 1,721,567 shares 2012: 2,208,290.
The LTIPs primary performance condition is a relative TSR measure.
The Committee sets performance conditions at the time of each award.
For all the awards made to date, the extent to which awards vest depends on the Companys TSR over the ensuing three years relative to an index of TSRs.
The following is the comparator group of insurers in respect of the 2013 grant: Axa, Hannover Ruckversicherung AG.
Royal Sun Alliance Insurance Group plc, SCOR S. E, Swiss Re, Zurich Financial Services Limited, Beazley plc, Catlin Group Limited, Hiscox plc, Novae Group plc, Ace Group, Argo Group International Holdings Limited, Chubb Corporation, Everest Re Group Limited, Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited, Markel Corporation, PartnerRe Limited, RenaissanceRe Holdings Limited, Validus Holdings Limited, White Mountains Insurance Group Limited, W. R. Berkley Corporation and XL Group plc.
Irrespective of relative TSR, no award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Companys financial performance over the performance period has been satisfactory.
The performance period is always a single three-year period with no provision for re-testing the performance conditions.
98 Amlin plc 2013 Annual Report STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Awards may be made each year at the discretion of the Committee, based on seniority and with no individual receiving awards over shares having a market value on grant exceeding 100% of annual base salary or, exceptionally, 200% for a senior new recruit.
In 2013, the maximum such value awarded was 100% of base salary to the Chief Executive, the Group Finance & Operations Director and the Group Chief Underwriting Officer.

Shareholding targets When the LTIP was introduced in 2006, an objective was set that Executive Directors would retain or build up shareholdings in the Company to the value of at least 125% of their base salaries, and other senior executives to the value of at least 50%.
All the Executive Directors shareholdings were above the target throughout 2013, mostly by a substantial margin.
Of the other senior executives covered by the policy the Group Management Committee, most have met their shareholding targets and the rest are expected to do so as incentive plans vest.
The Committee reviewed the targets during the year and re-affirmed that they remain appropriate.
The Committee believes that the combination of these shareholdings and the structure of performance incentives continue to ensure the interests of management and shareholders in the Companys success are closely aligned.

An annual offer was made in September 2013.
Sharesave offers are made under the plan to staff in all jurisdictions where local tax and regulation makes this practicable without amending the plan, which does not include Continental Europe.
The 2013 SAYE offer was open to all applicable employees employed by the Group on 1 July 2013.
Exercises are not subject to any performance condition.
Since 2007, the Company has also operated an HMRC-approved all-employee SIP, allowing offers of shares at no cost to employees.
Such free shares are offered or allocated to all Group staff meeting an employment qualification period.
The Committee has a policy of making an award of free shares each year, on an equal basis to all eligible Executive Directors and staff subject to a pro-rata adjustment, where permitted, for part-time employees, based on the annual results.
The quantum, between nil and the annual maximum level currently permitted by HMRC of 3,000 worth of shares per employee, is decided in light of the ROE achieved in the previous year.
In 2013, an award of 2,000 was made to eligible employees.
The Committee considers that the plans are successful in encouraging staff at all levels to build up interests in the Company, at an acceptable accounting and administrative cost to the Company.
Amlin plc 2013 Annual Report 99 Directors remuneration report continued Executive share option schemes Executive share options were granted at the discretion of the Committee under the Approved and Unapproved Amlin Executive Share Option Schemes each year from 1997 to 2006.

Using unissued and existing shares for incentive plans The rules of the Companys incentive plans, which result in issuing or transferring shares to participants, include limits on the overall number of unissued shares over which options may be granted.
The only employee schemes under which either unissued or treasury shares are committed to be issued are the executive share option schemes, the Sharesave plans, and the schedules to the PSP and LTIP applying to awards to participants in Continental Europe.
New shares were also issued in 2007 to the trustee of the Share Incentive Plan as SIP Free Shares.
However, in subsequent years, such shares were purchased in the market.
Shares awarded under the PSP and LTIP are intended to be satisfied from shares held, or to be purchased by the Groups Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT, unless overseas requirements dictate otherwise.
Grant of options over new and or treasury shares under any selective plan, after deducting any such options which have lapsed, are limited to 5% of the issued share capital in any ten year period.
Grants over new treasury shares under any scheme are also limited to 10% over ten years.
The percentages of the year-end shares in issue, together with the equivalent percentages a year earlier, relating to each of these limits are shown in the table below.
