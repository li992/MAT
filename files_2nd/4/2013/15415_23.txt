The bonus structure described here applied to the year ended 31 March 2013: we propose to retain this structure for the coming year.
Chief Financial Officer How the bonus is determined 1 21% Fixed pay 1 Before any bonus is payable, a minimum level of profit has to be achieved by the 2 79% Variable pay Company, regardless of performance against other metrics.
2 For each performance metric, there is a corresponding multiplier, which varies between threshold, target and stretch levels of performance.
Once the minimum profit threshold is achieved, bonuses are calculated by applying the multipliers which have the effect of increasing or decreasing the value of the bonus depending on performance against each metric in turn.
Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2013 53 Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued To achieve the maximum payout, performance against all three factors must be at or above the stretch level.
Target bonus PBTEA Net sales Cash Bonus % of base salary performance less cost of conversion achieved Chief Executive 75% multiplier raw materials cycle as % of Chief Financial once profit exceeds the performance performance base salary Officer 50% minimum threshold multiplier multiplier Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Relative weighting of bonus metrics PBTEA is the most important of the three metrics, so multipliers for the PBTEA factor are more heavily geared than for the other two metrics, that is, improvements in PBTEA have the greatest impact on bonus payments.
All multipliers and their weightings are agreed by the Committee when targets are set at the start of the year, reflecting the importance of each of the metrics in the context of the progress made against the Companys long-term business strategy.
The following charts illustrate the relative weighting associated with each metric at threshold, target and stretch levels of performance.
Threshold Target Stretch 1 Profit 1 1 1 3 2 Net sales growth 3 2 3 Cash conversion 2 Bonus outcomes for the year ended 31 March 2013 The table below shows, for each metric, the performance required to achieve maximum bonus and the actual 2013 result relative to the prior years performance.

On the basis of these performance outcomes, an annual bonus was awarded by the Committee of 32% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 22% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
Any bonus amount up to 100% of base salary is paid in cash.
Any excess above 100% of base salary is paid in the form of deferred shares.
The shares are released after two years subject to the executive remaining in service with the Company, and carry the right to receive a dividend equivalent between award and release.
Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2013 54 Governance Governance Claw-back provisions Both the cash and share elements are subject to claw-back provisions, which means that they may be recouped in whole or in part, at the discretion of the Committee in the exceptional event that results were found to have been misstated or if an executive commits an act of gross misconduct.
Long-term incentive Performance Share Plan The structure of the current Performance Share Plan PSP was developed in 2010 to reflect the business strategy following detailed consultation with major shareholders.
The PSP closely aligns executive directors and senior executives interests with the strategy and the interests of shareholders over the long term, and is therefore an important component of the overall package.
Ahead of the AGM in 2012, we consulted with shareholders representing approximately 45% of our issued share capital on a specific resolution to approve a renewal of the PSP, as shareholder approval for the 2003 PSP would expire at the end of its ten-year life.
No changes to key terms of the PSP were proposed as part of this process, including the maximum award levels that had been permitted since 2010 and the choice of performance conditions that apply as described below.
Shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve the renewal of the PSP at the 2012 AGM, with 98% of shareholder votes cast in support of the resolution.
Maximum award level Since the 2010 AGM, awards to the executive directors and other senior executives have been granted at the discretion of the Committee, with flexibility for the Committee to make awards of up to 300% of base salary where necessary to ensure market competitiveness, while taking Company performance into account.
Performance conditions The release of awards depends on the Groups performance during the three-year performance period beginning on 1 April in the year of the award.
For awards made since 2010, the performance conditions comprised two elements, explained in the table below, consistent with the principles established following the review and consultation with shareholders at that time.
Performance measure Weighting Definition Rationale Adjusted diluted 50% Performance is measured by comparing the compound annual growth rate The Committee earnings per share CAGR of the Companys adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations selected this metric as EPS over the three-year performance period against pre-determined targets it is a key determinant of shareholder value creation Adjusted return on 50% Performance is measured by the adjusted ROCE on continuing operations The Committee capital employed achieved at the end of the three-year performance period against the selected this metric ROCE pre-determined targets as it is a good indicator Importantly the ROCE outcome would be adjusted downward in the of the effectiveness event of any asset impairment, by adding this back into capital employed: of strategic investment this is to encourage a prudent investment strategy decisions and of the For this reason, in the event of there being an impairment of assets quality of earnings during the performance period, the ROCE figure for PSP purposes generated can be significantly lower than the unadjusted ROCE number reported in the Companys accounts The Committee reviews the appropriateness of targets ahead of the grant of awards in any year to ensure these remain sufficiently stretching.
In practice, no changes to the performance targets have been made since they were established in 2010, and accordingly shares awarded under the PSP in 2010, 2011 and 2012 vest in accordance with the schedule set out in the table below.
CAGR of adjusted diluted EPS Adjusted ROCE at end during the performance period of performance period Percentage of award vesting 50% of award 50% of award 0% Below 6% Below 13.4% 15% 6% 13.4% On a straight line between 15% and 100% Between 6% and 15% Between 13.4% and 16.4% 100% 15% or more At 16.4% or above Before any shares are released, the Committee must also be satisfied that the level of vesting determined by performance against these targets is justified by the broader underlying financial performance of the Company.
Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2013 55 Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Awards vesting by reference to performance to 31 March 2013: 2010 PSP award PSP awards made in 2010 were dependent on EPS growth and ROCE targets as described above, with each condition applicable to half of the award.
Performance against these conditions and the vesting outcome is indicated in the table below.
Level of vesting Performance Proportion of Performance for this element condition total award outcome of the award Combined vesting outcome EPS growth 50% 16.0% growth 100% Based on the combination of EPS growth over the period and the level of ROCE achieved in the year ended 31 March 2013, 100% ROCE 50% 17.0% growth 100% of the PSP awards made in 2010 have vested The Committee also considered the broader underlying financial performance of Tate & Lyle over the performance period, to ensure that vesting results based on the performance outcomes were consistent with a broader view of the financial health and performance of the business.
Awards granted in the year to 31 March 2013 During the year ended 31 March 2013, the Company made awards under the 2003 PSP, and the Committee approved awards to executive directors of up to 300% of base salary, taking into account competitive need and Company performance to date.
Claw-back provisions Awards made under the PSP from 1 April 2013 are subject to claw-back provisions for a period following the vesting date and extending to the fifth anniversary following the date of grant.
During this period, the Committee may determine that an award will lapse wholly or in part or may require that a participant shall repay up to 100% of the value of any award that has vested by virtue of performance, in the event of circumstances including the following: material misstatement of financial results: misconduct which justifies, or could justify, summary dismissal of the participant: or if information has emerged which would have affected the value of the original award that was granted to a participant, or the level at which the performance conditions were judged to have been satisfied.
Additional share plan disclosures Potential impact of mergers and acquisitions or other corporate activity In the context of a merger or acquisition, or other relevant corporate activity, any potential impact on the schemes would be specifically considered by the Committee.
In such circumstances, the Committee retains the authority to vary the performance target or the vesting outcome to ensure that outcomes are equitable for both the participant and shareholders.
Change of control and voting All of the Companys share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control.
Outstanding awards would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time, and in proportion to the time served during the performance period.
Sharesave Plan The Company operates a Sharesave Plan which is open to all employees in the UK, and provides a mechanism for employees to purchase shares at a discounted price through savings that accumulate from monthly deductions in salary.
Executive directors are entitled to participate because the plan must be open to all employees in the UK.
The value of individual grants is capped monthly savings deductions from salary may not exceed 250, and no performance conditions are attached to awards because it is an all-employee scheme.
Dilution Shareholder approvals to operate our share incentive plans carry limits on the number of new shares that may be issued to satisfy awards over time.
These restrictions are referred to as limits on shareholder dilution, and the remaining capacity to use newly issued shares within the limits approved by shareholders is referred to as headroom.
In the ten-year period to 31 March 2013, awards made under the executive schemes represented 1.73% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital, leaving available dilution headroom of 3.27%.
Awards made under all share schemes represented 1.96% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital leaving available dilution headroom of 8.04%.
The Company will use shares that have been purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy awards made to the Chief Executive prior to 2012 and deferred share awards made under the Annual Bonus Plan as described on page 54.
Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2013 56 Governance Governance Personal share ownership requirements policy on executive share ownership The Committee and executive management believe that personal investment in Company shares is an important part of our overall remuneration framework.
Material personal investment in Company shares serves to strengthen the long-term alignment of interests between senior executives and the Companys shareholders.
Compared with similar companies in the FTSE 100, our executive shareholding requirements are more demanding and extend to a greater number of senior executives in the organisation.
The Chief Executive has a target share ownership requirement of four times base salary, and his shareholding currently exceeds this target.
The Chief Financial Officer has a target shareholding of three times base salary, which has been met.
Other Executive Committee members are subject to the share ownership policy, with target holdings at three times salary.
From 2011, this policy was extended to a broader group of executives who have senior leadership roles within the Company.
The shareholding target for this group is equal to their base salary.
The Committee monitors progress against the share ownership requirements annually.
Service contracts of executive directors The policy in determining service contracts is to take account of market practice, and to ensure that provisions in relation to notice periods or termination payments are not excessive.
The following table summarises the key provisions of the executive directors service contracts.
Provision Chief Executive Javed Ahmed Chief Financial Officer Tim Lodge Notice period By the director 6 months 6 months By the Company 12 months 12 months Termination payment The Company has the option to pay in lieu of notice The Company has the option to pay in lieu of notice the base salary and pension allowance that would the salary, pension and other contractual benefits have been payable during the notice period arising during the notice period The Company has the contractual right to phase the payments and to reduce them if the executive mitigates his loss Holiday 30 days 30 days Restrictive covenants nonFor the period of 12 months less any garden For the period of 12 months less any garden leave compete non-solicitation leave period following termination of employment period following termination of employment Contract commencement date 1 October 2009 4 December 2008 Executive directors external appointments The Board believes that the Company can benefit from executive directors holding external non-executive directorships.
Such appointments are subject to approval by the Board and are normally restricted to one position for each executive director.
Fees may be retained by the executive director concerned.
Neither of the executive directors currently holds an external non-executive directorship.
Chairman and non-executive director arrangements Terms of appointment The non-executive directors do not have service contracts or notice periods, but, under the terms of their appointment, they are usually expected to serve on the Board for between three and nine years, with a review of their terms of appointment every three years, subject to their re-election by shareholders.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Groups incentive or pension schemes, do not receive other benefits, and have no right to compensation on the early termination of their appointment.
Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2013 57 Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Chairmans fees The Committee excluding the Chairman reviews the Chairmans fees each year, taking into account the current market position, the individuals experience and contribution to the Group.
Following the most recent review of fees, the Committee approved an increase in the Chairmans fees of 3% to 315,950 effective from 1 April 2013, in line with the rate of increase applicable to the UK employee population.
Non-executive directors fees Non-executive directors fees, reviewed annually by the Chairman and executive directors of the Board, are set at a level to retain individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a substantial contribution to the Group.
Fees paid are commensurate with those paid by other UK-listed companies.
In addition to the basic fee for each non-executive director and the Senior Independent Director, supplements are paid to the Chairmen of the Audit, Corporate Responsibility and Remuneration Committees to reflect the extra responsibilities required by these positions.
A supplement is also paid to the Chairman of the Research Advisory Group.
Taking into account the competitiveness of current fees against the comparable market position, and the time commitment required of the non-executive directors, the executive directors and the Chairman agreed that an adjustment to increase non-executive directors fees by 3% would be made with effect from 1 April 2013, in line with the UK employee population.
The fees are shown in the following table.
Basic fees per annum At 1 April 2013 At 1 April 2012 Non-executive director 61 550 59 750 Senior Independent Director 68 600 66 600 Supplemental fees per annum At 1 April 2013 At 1 April 2012 Chairman of Audit Committee 16 300 15 850 Chairman of Remuneration Committee 10 850 10 550 Chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee 10 850 10 550 Chairman of Research Advisory Group 22 800 22 150 Executive directors total remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2013 The following tables show the remuneration packages of the executive directors for the year ended 31 March 2013, and illustrate the potential value in different performance scenarios.
Actual remuneration for the year shown in the right-hand column includes the value of incentive awards vesting by reference to performance in the year ended 31 March 2013.
Given the Groups EPS and ROCE performance in the period to 31 March 2013, awards will vest at maximum.
The value of share awards vested in the year as shown in the right-hand column of the table actual earned vested also reflects approximately 84% share price appreciation over the performance period.

For Javed Ahmed: the LTI award that vests based on performance to 31 March 2013 relates to a long-term incentive award of shares long-term incentive award B, in accordance with the incentive arrangements agreed at the time of his appointment as described in the Annual Report 2009 with a face value of 2,082,000 at the time of award referenced to three times salary at the time the 2010 PSP awards were made, and subject to the same performance conditions as applicable to those awards.
For Tim Lodge: the LTI award shown here is the 2010 PSP grant, which was made over shares with a face value of 983,000 at the date of grant.
These LTI awards are subject to the same performance conditions and will vest at maximum, based on the EPS and ROCE performance recorded in the period to 31 March 2013 as discussed on page 55.
The value of these awards at 31 March 2013 as shown in the table reflects significant share price appreciation over the performance period.
