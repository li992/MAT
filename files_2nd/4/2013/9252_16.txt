Key shareholders were consulted on the new plan, which should provide alignment of executives Jack Boyer interests with those of shareholders over the long-term, and on Chairman of the Remuneration Committee the performance conditions for share awards granted during 27 February 2014 the year.
The plan was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 3 May 2013.
In order to ensure alignment with Lairds strategic objectives, it is the intention of the Committee to conduct a review of our executive remuneration policy in 2014 and, if appropriate, propose amendments to ensure that we continue to provide a suitable remuneration framework for the business.
During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer and determined that they would be increased by 5.9% and 2.7% respectively.
The Committee also agreed that the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer should receive an annual performance bonus in respect of 2013 of 60% and 50% of base salary respectively see pages 80 to 81.

indd 67 11 03 2014 18:07 Directors remuneration report continued Directors remuneration policy This section of the Remuneration Report contains details of the Companys Directors Remuneration Policy that will govern the Companys future remuneration payments.
The policy will normally apply for three years although, as noted on page 67, it is the intention of the Committee to conduct a review of remuneration policy during 2014 which may necessitate a change to the policy in 2015.
The policy described in this part, subject to approval by shareholders at the Companys AGM on 2 May 2014, will apply from that date.
The policy part will be displayed on the Companys website, in the Investor Relations section, immediately after the 2014 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee has established the policy on the remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman.
The Board has established the policy on the remuneration of the other non-executive directors.
The policy for the executive directors is to structure the remuneration package so that no single aspect dominates.
Therefore there is a mixture of fixed remuneration and performance-related remuneration, with the latter split between annual bonuses, with a range of different measures, and longer term share incentives, which use more than one performance target.

Any awards made prior to the adoption of the directors remuneration policy set out in this report may be paid out, subject to the terms of those awards and achievement of the relevant performance conditions.
Notes to the future policy table Performance measures and targets The short and long-term incentives have a number of different financial performance measures which the Committee believes provide a direct link to the Companys performance.
The Annual Performance Incentive Scheme contains specific strategic and operational objectives which provide a direct link to the Companys strategy, whilst the long-term performance incentive targets of TSR and EPS are considered to be appropriate measures for aligning the interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders.
The Committee is of the opinion that, given the commercial sensitivity of Lairds operations, disclosing precise targets for the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme in advance would not be in shareholders interests.
Except in circumstances where elements remain commercially sensitive, actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the performance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts.
Discretion The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this report.
The Committee may also exercise operational and administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules.
In addition, the Committee has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees All employees of Laird are entitled to base salary, and a range of different benefits including pension and annual bonus depending on country, seniority and also sometimes legacy arrangements.
The maximum opportunity available is based on the seniority and responsibility of the role.
Long-term incentive awards are generally only available to the executive directors and the 55 senior employees who comprise the Leadership Team.
Long-term incentive awards may also be granted to other key employees at the discretion of the Committee.
Changes to remuneration policy from previous policy There have been no changes to the operation, maximum opportunity or performance measures in relation to salary, pension and other benefits during the year.
From 2014, the 25% for exceptional performance in the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme has been re-allocated to specific targets but the maximum payable under the Scheme remains capped at 100%.

indd 71 11 03 2014 18:07 Directors remuneration report continued During the year Laird introduced the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan to replace the existing plans that expired during the year.
Although the replacement plan is identical in almost all areas, changes include a 5% in 10 years dilution limit: a reduced threshold for vesting at 25% previously 30% and the introduction of clawback provisions for awards before they vest.
The new plan was approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGM.
Non-executive directors The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for non-executive directors: Objective and link Operation Maximum potential value Performance measures to the strategy and assessment Fees N A Core element of The Board as a whole is responsible Current fees are set out in the Annual remuneration, set for setting the remuneration of the Report on Remuneration on page 79. at a level sufficient non-executive directors, other than Increases in fees will be in line with to attract and retain the Chairman whose remuneration the median fee levels of comparable individuals with is determined by the Committee and companies within the FTSE 250 appropriate knowledge recommended to the Board.

Non-executive directors are paid a base fee and additional fees for chairmanship of Committees.
In exceptional circumstances, fees may also be paid for additional time spent on the Companys business outside of the normal duties.
Reviewed annually with any changes generally effective from 1 January.
Any increases in fees will be determined based on time commitment and take into consideration level of responsibility and fees paid in other companies of comparable size and complexity.
Non-executive directors do not receive any variable remuneration element or receive any other benefits, other than being covered for disability benefits under the Companys insurance whilst travelling on Company business.
Approach to recruitment and promotions The Committees approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role.
The remuneration package for any new recruit would be assessed following the same principles as for the executive directors, as set out in the remuneration policy table.
The Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure the preferred candidate and will have regard to guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or enhanced short or long-term incentive payments made on recruitment and the appropriateness of any performance measures associated with an award.
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the policy set out above would apply from the date of promotion but there would be no retrospective application of the policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements.
Accordingly, prevailing elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured and form part of the ongoing remuneration of the employee.
These would be disclosed to shareholders in the following years Annual Report on Remuneration.

indd 72 07 03 2014 19:27 The table below summarises our key policies with respect to recruitment remuneration: Element Policy Base salary and benefits The salary level will be set taking into account a number of factors including market practice, the individuals experience and responsibilities and other pay structures within Laird and will be consistent with the salary policy for existing executive directors.
The executive director shall be eligible to receive benefits in line with Lairds benefits policy as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Pension An executive director will be able to receive either a contribution to a personal pension scheme or cash allowance in lieu of pension benefits in line with Lairds policy as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Annual bonus An executive director will be eligible to participate in the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Awards may be granted up to the maximum opportunity allowable in the remuneration policy table at the Remuneration Committees discretion.
Long-term incentives An executive director will be eligible to participate in the Laird PLC 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Awards may be granted up to the maximum opportunity allowable under scheme rules at the Remuneration Committees discretion.
Maximum variable remuneration The maximum annual variable remuneration that an executive director can receive is normally limited to 300% of salary annual incentive scheme and nil cost awards and market value awards under the LTIP.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or promotion, an additional 100% of base salary may be awarded as market-value options under the 2013 LTIP see policy table.
Share buy-outs replacement awards The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards such that overall they are no more generous in terms of quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited.
Any previous outstanding share awards which the executive holds will be valued using a recognised valuation methodology by an independent party and share awards that are of broadly equivalent economic value may be awarded in Laird shares.
To ensure effective retention of the executive upon recruitment, the new award will be subject to performance measures and vesting will be a new three year period.
Relocation policies In instances where the new executive is relocated from one work location to another, the Company will provide compensation to reflect the cost of relocation for the executive in cases where they are expected to spend significant time away from their country of domicile in accordance with its normal relocation package for employees.
The level of the relocation package will be assessed on a case by case basis but will take into consideration any cost of living differences: housing allowance: and schooling in accordance with the Companys normal relocation package for employees.

All service contracts and letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Companys registered office and at the AGM.
When determining any loss of office payment for a departing director the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the Company whilst complying with the contractual terms and seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation : or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an executive directors office or employment.
The table below sets out, for each element of total remuneration, the Companys policy on payment for loss of office in respect of executive directors and any discretion available to the Committee.
Element Approach Committee discretion Base salary benefits There will be no compensation for normal resignation or in the None and pension event of termination by the Company due to misconduct.
In other circumstances, executive directors will be entitled to receive payment in lieu of notice.
Payment in lieu of notice to David Lockwood will be equivalent to the salary payments that he would have received if still employed by the Company for a maximum of a 12 month period.
This is payable in a lump sum or in instalments which would be subject to mitigation.
Payment in lieu of notice to Jonathan Silver will be equivalent to the salary payments and benefits and pension provisions that he would have received if still employed by the Company for a maximum of a 12 month period.
The terms and conditions of Jonathan Silvers service contract require an additional guaranteed payment of 25% of base salary in lieu of bonus for the period of notice where notice is served by the Company.
This is an historic contractual provision agreed prior to 27 June 2012 and is not part of the Committees ongoing policy see recruitment policy.

Illustrations of application of remuneration policy The graphs below seek to demonstrate how pay varies with performance for the executive directors based on our stated remuneration policy.

2 100% and 75% of base salary for the Chief Executive and Chief Finanacial Officer respectively for market value options and 100% of salary nil-cost awards for both executive directors.
3 A level of 62.5% vesting for on-target performance reflects the mid-point of the performance range.
4 Market Value Options are valued with the same model that is used to determine the share-based compensation cost included in the Companys consolidated statement of income.
5 In accordance with the Regulations, no allowance has been made for share price appreciation.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company in developing policy In setting the remuneration policy for directors, the pay and conditions of other employees of Laird are taken into account, including any base salary increases awarded.
The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure for management level tiers below the executive directors, and uses this information to ensure consistency of approach throughout the Company.
No comparison metrics were used.
However, with 80% of employees in Asia, 13% of employees in North America and 7% in Europe, only broad trends are considered.
In 2013 salary increases for management level employees ranged from zero to 20% depending on several factors, including the region where they work and individual performance.
Although the Remuneration Committee takes into account the pay and conditions of other employees, the Company did not consult with employees when drawing up the policy report.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee takes the views of the shareholders seriously and these views are taken into account in shaping remuneration policy and practice.
Shareholder views are considered when evaluating and setting remuneration strategy and the Committee commits to consulting with key shareholders prior to any significant changes to its remuneration policy.

Dilution limits The Company operates its share schemes within the Association of British Insurers ABI Guidelines on dilution.
No share award may be granted if, as a result, the aggregate number of shares issued or transferred from treasury during the previous ten years under all employee share schemes established by the Company would exceed ten per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company on that date or, in the case of all discretionary employee share schemes, five per cent.
The Company took the opportunity with the new long-term incentive plan introduced in 2013 to reduce the latter dilution figure to five per cent from ten per cent under the previous schemes which expired during the year.

indd 84 07 03 2014 19:27 Percentage change in the Chief Executives remuneration Laird is a global company with fewer than 50 UK employees and four of its most senior executives are not UK employees.
Due to the multinational nature of the Companys workforce and the fact that 80% of employees are based in Asia, the pay structure operated in respect of the vast majority of its employees is significantly different from that applicable to the Chief Executive, who is UKbased.
Therefore, the Committees view is that the most meaningful comparison of the percentage change in the Chief Executives remuneration is considered to be the eleven senior executives below Board level.
Seven of these are US employees, three are British and one is Swedish.
The table below compares the percentage increase in the Chief Executives pay including salary and fees, taxable benefits and annual bonus with that of the chosen comparator group.
2 The bonus for the comparator group for 2013 is an estimate.

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy for 2014 Executive directors The remuneration policy and its implementation for the forthcoming financial year is summarised below: Salary The salaries for the executive directors, which were last increased with effect from 1 July 2013, are 450,000 p. a. for the Chief Executive and 345,000 p. a. for the Chief Financial Officer.
The salaries of the executive directors will be reviewed as at 1 July 2014.
When reviewing those salaries, the Committee will take into account the employment conditions and salary increases awarded to employees throughout the Company, which will be determined in April 2014 and the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the salary levels of those comparable companies within the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts and the FTSE All Share Technology Hardware & Equipment Sector.
Annual Performance Incentive Scheme 2014 Details of the maximum and target bonus potentials along with the performance measures and their respective weightings for the year ended 31 December 2014 for both executive directors are set out below: Bonus opportunity Performance measure weighting % award Target % of salary Maximum % of salary Underlying profit before tax Working capital metrics Strategic objectives 65% 100% 70% 10% 20% An additional 10% of salary may be payable if the underlying PBT for 2014 is 110% of the target.
However, if this stretch target is achieved, and the working capital metrics and strategic objectives are achieved in full, the overall maximum that can be awarded cannot exceed 100% of base salary.
The main change to the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme in 2014 is the removal of the 25% weighting for exceptional performance.
The Committee considers disclosing precise targets of profit, working capital and strategic objectives, which are commercially sensitive, for the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme in advance would not be in shareholder interests.

Advisors to the Committee In September 2013, a competitive tender overseen by the Chairman of the Committee with input from the Chief Executive, Chairman of the Board and the Company Secretary was conducted.
 LLP PwC replaced Deloitte LLP as independent advisors to the Committee.
Both PwC and Deloitte are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operate under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
On this basis, the Committee is satisfied that the advice received is objective and independent.
PwC also provided the Company with tax advisory work and Deloitte provided internal audit services to Laird PLC during the year.
The Committee reviewed the nature of the services provided and was satisfied that no conflict of interest exists or existed in the provision of these services.
The Committee also sought the views of the Chief Executive, David Lockwood, during the year.
The Chief Executive is given notice of all meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Committee, attends part of the meetings.
The Chief Executive may request that he attends and speaks at Committee meetings.
In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive will be consulted on general policy matters and matters concerning the other executive director and employees.
The total fees paid to PwC in respect of services to the Committee during the year were 32,500.
Fees paid to Deloitte in 2013 were 69,300 which included work on the new long-term incentive plan approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGM.
Fees were determined based on the scope and nature of the projects undertaken for the Committee.
