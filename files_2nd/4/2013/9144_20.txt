His 2011 award remained unaffected but the maximum numbers of ordinary shares in the Company receivable under his 2012 and 2013 awards were reduced from 27,113 to 18,075 and from 28,029 to 9,343 to reflect his active service with the Group during the relevant performance periods.
As at the date of this document, the cumulative total maximum number of shares receivable by Ian Lawson under LTIP awards including the 2011 award is 56,714.
The performance criteria relating to the awards are set out on page 60.
The TSR and EPS elements of the 2011 award are weighted equally and, in the case of the 2012 and 2013 awards, are weighted two-thirds:one-third.
Compound cumulative growth in EPS over the performance period which ended on 30 June 2013 and the Groups TSR outperformance each as described on page 60 during the six-month averaging period which ended on the same date resulted in the EPS and TSR elements of the 2011 award vesting as to 30.17% and 32.12%, respectively, or an aggregate vesting of 31.15% of the award.
On 14 November 2013 being the vesting date for the 2011 award, those persons who served as a director during the year ended 30 June 2013 will be entitled to the following number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company as a result of the vesting of the 2011 award subject to deductions to satisfy income tax and national insurance contributions which will be due : Number of ordinary shares Steve Bowcott 7,543 Ian Lawson 9,125 Haydn Mursell 7,543 Paul Sheffield 10,464 Richard Simkin, a former member of the Board, will be entitled to received 2,673 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company as a result of the vesting of the 2011 award subject to deductions to satisfy income tax and national insurance contributions.
As described in last years Annual Report, his 2011 award was pro rated to a maximum of 8,583 shares to reflect the length of his active service during the performance period for the award.
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 61 Governance Directors remuneration report Continued Directors pensions Executive directors participate in the Kier Group Pension Scheme the Pension Scheme which has both a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section.
Executive directors accrue pension up to the value of the lifetime allowance.
Where the value of pension benefits exceeds the lifetime allowance, future pension accrual ceases and a cash supplement is paid.
Following changes to the taxation of UK pensions and, in particular, the reduction in the annual allowance, the trustees of the Pension Scheme and the Company have agreed that an executive directors annual pension provision may be replaced partly by a cash supplement.
The level of cash supplement is 20% of that salary which is no longer pensionable or, in the case of Ian Lawson, 30%, as the cost of his current membership of the pension scheme was higher than for the other directors.
The Committee has determined the level of cash supplement for each individual with a view to maintaining the Groups pension-related costs at their current level.
An assessment has been carried out by the Pension Schemes actuary of the cost to the Group of the current benefit provision and the individual supplements have been set at levels which are commensurate with the value of the pension benefit foregone.
The Committee believes that the levels of supplement are in line with market practice.
Only the basic salary of directors is pensionable.
Any cash supplement is excluded in determining annual bonus and long-term incentive entitlements.
Pension benefits earned by those persons who served as a director during the year ended 30 June 2013 and are members of the defined benefit section of the Pension Scheme are as follows: Transfer value Increase in Increase in of increase Accumulated total Transfer value of Transfer value of accrued pension accrued pension in accrued accrued pension accrued pension Increase in accrued pension 1 2 over the year over the year pension at 30 June 2013 at 30 June 2012 transfer value at 30 June 2013 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 3 Ian Lawson 3 97 1,675 89 1,764 4 Paul Sheffield 4 152 2,417 217 2,634 1 The figures in this column represent the difference between the total accrued benefit at the end of the year and the equivalent amount at the beginning of the year.
The figures shown have been adjusted to allow for the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation during the year.
2 The figures in this column are the transfer values of the increases in the directors benefits during the year.
3 Ian Lawsons pension accrual in the Pension Scheme was suspended on 1 September 2011.
Ian Lawson subsequently opted out of the Pension Scheme with effect from 5 April 2012 and became entitled to a deferred pension with effect from that date.
Ian Lawson received a cash allowance of 30% in lieu of continued pension accrual.
4 Paul Sheffield opted out of the Pension Scheme with effect from 30 June 2010 and became entitled to a deferred pension with effect from that date.
Paul Sheffield receives a cash allowance of 20% in lieu of continued pension accrual.
The figures set out in the above table have been prepared using the Retail Prices Index as the measure of inflation.
The above transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice from the Pension Schemes actuary in accordance with UK legislation.
Members also have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions.
Neither these contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
Contributions paid to the defined contribution section of the Pension Scheme on behalf of the directors during the year ended 30 June 2013 were as follows: Contributions over the year 000 Steve Bowcott 50 Haydn Mursell 50 The above contributions are inclusive of contributions paid by the employer on behalf of the employee via a salary sacrifice arrangement.

The vesting of this award is explained on page 67 of last years Annual Report.
5 In addition to the above amounts, the Group paid Haydn Mursell 287,485 gross of tax in respect of relocation expenses.
Haydn Mursells basic salary was increased from 310,000 to 330,000 per annum with effect from 1 November 2011.
6 Amanda Mellor became a member of the Board with effect from 1 December 2011.
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 63 Governance Directors remuneration report Continued Retirement from the Board principal terms Ian Lawson retired from the Board with effect from 21 June 2013, remaining employed by the Group until 21 September 2013 to assist with the integration of May Gurney.
The Committee agreed that Ian would be entitled to his salary and cash supplement relating to his pension for his 12-month contractual notice period, the first half of which will be paid in monthly instalments until March 2014 and, in April 2014, a lump sum will be paid with respect to the six-month period ending September 2014.
The total amount payable with respect to the notice period is 510,510, although all payments during the notice period are subject to a right of clawback in favour of the Company to the extent that additional remuneration is obtained during the period.
In addition, it was agreed that 8,100 would be paid by way of statutory redundancy entitlement.
No other benefits will be payable during his notice period.
In light of Ians long service with the Group in aggregate, approximately 20 years, the Committee exercised its discretion to allow his 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards to remain outstanding, subject to a reduction to reflect his active service with the Group during the relevant performance periods.
Since Ian had been in active service for the whole of the performance period relating to the 2011 award, the Committee allowed his original award to remain in place, without adjustment.
The Committee also agreed that, since Ian had been in active service for the year ended 30 June 2013, he would be entitled to a bonus with respect to the year, further details of which are set out on page 63.
Service contracts and letters of appointment The effective date of the service agreement or letter of appointment of each director of the Company at 30 June 2013 and the applicable notice periods are as follows: Effective date Notice period Richard Bailey 1 October 2010 1 month Steve Bowcott 1 July 2010 12 months Chris Geoghegan 1 July 2007 1 month Amanda Mellor 1 December 2011 1 month Haydn Mursell 12 November 2010 12 months Paul Sheffield 1 October 2005 12 months 1 Phil White 1 July 2006 1 month Nick Winser 1 March 2009 1 month 1 Phil White assumed the role of chairman with effect from 2 January 2008.
No term is included in any of the executive directors service agreements or the non-executive directors letters of appointment.
Notice may be served by either party to the service agreement or letter of appointment.
However, each director is subject to re-election, in accordance with the Articles, further details of which are set out on page 50.
The executive directors service agreements do not contain any provisions for compensation for loss of office.
These service agreements contain provisions relating to early termination and, in such cases, the Committee will consider the specific circumstances, the Companys commitments under the service agreement and any obligation to mitigate.
The Committee believes that its policy in relation to notice periods and early termination payments under the directors contracts is fair and reasonable in the interests of the Group and the individual concerned.
As indicated above, the Company has entered into letters of appointment with each of the non-executive directors.
The letters of appointment do not include any provisions for the payment of predetermined compensation in the case of wrongful termination by the Company.
Directors interests The directors of the Company at 30 June 2013 had the following beneficial interests including interests of connected persons in the ordinary shares of the Company: 30 June 2013 1 July 2012 Richard Bailey Steve Bowcott 12,310 4,537 Chris Geoghegan 5,000 5,000 Amanda Mellor Haydn Mursell 10,864 7,406 Paul Sheffield 64,602 44,375 Phil White 2,540 2,540 Nick Winser 3,500 3,500 64 Kier Group plc Overview Operational review Corporate responsibility Financial review Governance Financial statements The preceding table includes, where relevant, matching shares purchased, at no cost to the individual, on their behalf under the AESOP and shares to which the executive directors are beneficially entitled as a result of receiving one-third of their 2011 and 2012 bonuses in shares.
The table does not include shares to which the executive directors will become entitled upon the vesting of the awards under the LTIP granted on 15 November 2010 and or any shares to which the executive directors may, in the future, become entitled upon the vesting of other awards granted under the LTIP.

There have been no other changes in the interests of the directors or their connected persons in the ordinary shares in the capital of the Company since 30 June 2013.
Shareholding guidelines The Committee encourages executive directors to build up a shareholding in the Company.
With effect from 1 July 2014, the Committee has increased the recommended level of shareholding from at least one years salary to at least two years salary, over a period of up to five years.
Executive directors are therefore encouraged to retain any shares allocated to them as part of the annual bonus arrangements and 50% of the shares allocated to them upon the vesting of LTIP awards net of tax until this shareholding has been reached.
