ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013 REMUNERATION REPORT This report sets out the remuneration of NEXTs directors for the year to January 2013 and is in three parts: 1 overview of the year, 2 remuneration strategy, and 3 regulatory disclosures under Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Group Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008, the UK Listing Rules and the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Board confirms that the Company has complied with these regulations throughout the year.
We have also included some of the new disclosures proposed by the Department for Business Innovation & Skills BIS, notably a table showing a single total figure for remuneration and a summary of the Companys remuneration policy in tabular format.
PART 1: OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR Information not subject to audit Company performance NEXT has again achieved record pre-tax profits and earnings per share EPS.
Underlying pre-tax profits of 622m were 9% higher than last year and underlying EPS of 298p were 16.6% higher.
The key financial objective remains long term sustainable growth in EPS.
Therefore EPS is used to determine the executive directors annual bonus and the level of any entitlement under the Share Matching Plan SMP.
The Committee also assesses EPS performance and other factors in evaluating whether the general economic underpin test for the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP has been satisfied.
The Committee considers that this strong EPS performance fully justifies the bonuses and long term incentives earned by the executive directors and other senior executives during the year.
Annual bonus and base salaries At the start of the year, the Committee set targets for EPS growth, details of which are shown on page 39.
This years strong growth in EPS resulted in annual bonus for executive directors of 99% of the maximum potential award.
It should also be noted that, like last year, we excluded exceptional gains of 45m from this EPS calculation 2012: exceptional gains of 47m excluded.
Base salaries for executive directors were increased by 2.0% in February 2013 having increased by 1.2% in 2011 and 2.5% in 2012 in line with wider company cost of living awards.
We consider that increases in base salaries should continue to be restrained given the potentially significant multiplier effect of such increases on future costs.
LTIP Under the LTIP a variable percentage of a maximum number of shares granted at the start of each performance period can vest, depending on NEXTs relative TSR performance against a comparator group of some 20 other UK retailers.
The maximum number of shares that may be granted is a percentage of each directors base salary, divided by NEXTs average share price over the three months prior to the start of the performance period.
Details of grants and of the comparator group are set out on pages 44 and 45.
Since 2008 NEXT has made grants twice a year, rather than annually, and two awards matured in the year.
Over the performance periods of these grants, i. e. between August 2009 to January 2013, NEXTs share price rose from 1705p to 4059p and market capitalisation grew from 3.4 billion to 6.5 billion, a further 855m was returned through share buybacks and 449m paid in dividends.
The LTIP that matured in July 2012 vested 96% when NEXTs TSR ranked fifth against the comparator group and 98% of the January 2013 LTIP is expected to vest as its TSR also ranked fifth against the comparator group.
This vesting is subject to the Committees review of the economic underpin performance condition in April.
The value of these two LTIPSs is high: this is largely due to the rise in the Companys share price over the performance periods as there was no increase in the maximum number of shares originally granted.
Last year, we decided that the maximum value of LTIPs vesting for any participant in any one year should be capped at 2.5m and the Chief Executives LTIP payments last year were reduced by 704k.
This year the 2.5m cap will again be applied and, assuming the Committee confirms the grant maturing in January 2013 has vested, payments to Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides will be reduced by an estimated 327k and 11k respectively.
After applying this cap, the total value to the executive directors of the two LTIPs is estimated at 7.5m, of which approximately 51% or 3.8m is attributable to the growth in share price over the performance periods.
33 Additional information Parent Company accounts Consolidated accounts Governance Business reports ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013 REMUNERATION REPORT SMP Shareholders approved the SMP in 2010.
The purpose of the plan is to encourage ownership of NEXT shares amongst executive directors and other senior executives, and thereby further align their interests with shareholders.
For the 2010 grant, which is due to vest in June 2013, some 25 senior executives were able to reinvest part, or all, of their annual bonus in NEXT shares.
Subject to growth in fully diluted EPS over three years, participants are eligible to receive matching shares for every share bought.
Fully diluted EPS for 2012 13 was 280.8p excluding exceptional gains.
This compares with 176.0p for 2009 10, and represents growth of 60% over the three year period.
As a result of this strong performance, the 2010 SMP will vest in full in June 2013, subject to the continued employment of participants.
Lord Wolfson has waived his potential entitlement under this SMP on the understanding that all NEXT employees who have been employed since January 2010 will share an equivalent amount by way of a special bonus in July 2013, pro rata to their annual salary.
The estimated value of the amount waived by Lord Wolfson based on the methodology proposed by BIS is 2.4m.
The estimated total pre-tax value for other executive directors is 4.6m, of which 2.1m 46% derives from the growth in NEXTs share price since buying their SMP shares.
Total performance-related remuneration The aggregate performance-related remuneration of the executive directors has increased from 8.7m last year to approximately 9.9m see pages 49 and 50.
This remuneration is directly linked to strong profits and EPS growth, which have been reflected in NEXTs increased share price and therefore the value of shares in the LTIP.
The Remuneration Committee has carefully reviewed the level of performance-related remuneration earned by the executive directors.
The Committee considers that it is a strong reflection of NEXTs operating and financial performance over the past three years and that it is aligned with the financial interests of shareholders generally.
Additional remuneration disclosures The tables below give a single figure for total remuneration, split between fixed and performance-related elements, for the current and previous years and are based on methodologies proposed by BIS which differ from current regulations: Base pay Performance-related pay 2012 13 Salary Share Total 000 Salary SuppleSubAnnual Matching ShareSubremuner- 1 2 3 4 fee Benefits Pension ment total bonus LTIP Plan save total ation Chairman John Barton 250 250 250 Executive directors Lord Wolfson 714 45 280 27 1,066 1,064 2,500 3,564 4,630 Christos Angelides 519 33 220 19 791 514 2,398 1,725 4,637 5,428 David Keens 477 19 72 568 472 1,352 1,675 3,499 4,067 Andrew Varley 355 27 53 435 351 1,006 1,204 2,561 2,996 Non-executive directors Steve Barber 60 60 60 Christine Cross 50 50 50 Jonathan Dawson 70 70 70 Caroline Goodall 4 4 4 Francis Salway 50 50 50 2,549 124 500 171 3,344 2,401 7,256 4,604 14,261 17,605 34 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013 Base pay Performance-related pay 2011 12 Salary Share Total 000 Salary SuppleSubAnnual Matching ShareSubremuner- 1 2 3 4 fee Benefits Pension ment total bonus LTIP Plan save total ation Chairman John Barton 250 250 250 Executive directors Lord Wolfson 697 36 120 853 753 2,500 3,253 4,106 Christos Angelides 506 30 60 596 364 1,673 2 2,039 2,635 David Keens 466 19 46 531 385 1,602 1 1,988 2,519 Andrew Varley 346 30 49 425 249 1,193 2 1,444 1,869 Non-executive directors Steve Barber 60 60 60 Christine Cross 50 50 50 Jonathan Dawson 70 70 70 Francis Salway 50 50 50 2,495 115 180 95 2,885 1,751 6,968 5 8,724 11,609 Measurement bases for elements of total remuneration 1 Pension values are calculated using the HMRC method proposed by BIS, i. e. 20 times the post-inflation benefit for defined benefit pensions.
It does not necessarily represent the economic value of the pension accrual and is not immediately available to the relevant director.
The increase in pension values for Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides over the two financial years is entirely due to the effect of inflation and not to any change in the underlying accrued annual pre-inflation benefit.
Where the accrued value is negative, a value of zero is used.
2 Supplements of 15% of base salary are paid in lieu of pension provision after the directors became deferred members of the defined benefit section of the NEXT Pension Plan.
Andrew Varley and David Keens received this supplement from April and June 2011 respectively and Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides from November 2012.
3 LTIP values for 2012 13 comprise the actual value of awards that have vested and been paid for the performance period ending in July, together with the estimated value of awards that will vest for the performance period ending in January, based on the average NEXT share price over the last financial quarter.
For 2011 12 these are the actual value of the LTIP awards.
4 SMP values for 2012 13 assume a maximum vesting in June 2013 and are based on the average NEXT share price over the last financial quarter.
As detailed above, Lord Wolfson has waived his potential entitlement to the June 2010 SMP which will mature in June 2013.
We continue to focus on the alignment of executive remuneration and long term growth in shareholder value.
The graph below charts total annual remuneration of Lord Wolfson against TSR over the last 10 years and shows that TSR grew by 430% more than the Chief Executives remuneration, or by 290% excluding the SMP waiver.

Additional eligibility criteria for participation in future SMP investments whereby participants who sell their investment shares prior to or after a new SMP is made will have restrictions placed on the level of investment they can make or the number of matching shares that can vest.
Introduction of a minimum NEXT shareholding for all executive directors: the Chief Executive is required to hold shares with a value at least 1.5 times pre-tax salary, with other executive directors holding shares equal to their annual salary.
All executive directors currently exceed these requirements.
New executive directors would have up to 5 years to achieve the required holding.
In line with changes to the defined benefits section of the NEXT Group Pension Plan set out on page 47, the pension entitlements of Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides under the unfunded unapproved pension arrangement have been amended to freeze the accrual of future benefits under the unfunded arrangement based on their base salaries at 31 October 2012.
From that date, Lord Wolfson and Mr Angelides have received an annual salary supplement of 15% of their base salary, which does not attract bonus.
The Committee believes NEXTs remuneration strategy, and the structures implementing that strategy, have contributed positively to maintaining the stable and highly motivated management team at NEXT who have continued to deliver consistently strong performances for shareholders.
PART 2: REMUNERATION STRATEGY AND POLICY Information not subject to audit The Committees objective is to ensure that the remuneration paid to senior executives is appropriate in both amount and structure, is directly linked to the Companys annual and longer term performance and in alignment with the interests of shareholders.
We believe that stable and transparent remuneration structures are key elements in a fair system for rewarding personal and collective contribution across the business.
There are bonus structures throughout the Company, including Head Office, stores, call centres and warehouses.
The focus is on ensuring that a competitive and appropriate base salary is paid to directors and senior managers, together with incentive arrangements that are: aligned with shareholders interests and with long term business strategies: measured against challenging benchmarks, including both absolute financial targets which are set in advance and relative share price performance: a mix of annual and three year performance periods: paid in a combination of cash and shares: and transparent and without soft non-financial targets which could otherwise allow undue discretion to award bonuses that do not reflect actual financial performance.
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group are considered to ensure that any differences for directors are justified.
Remuneration policy does not conflict with the Companys approach to environmental, social and corporate governance matters and we believe the current arrangements do not encourage directors to take undue business risks.
36 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013 We aim to maintain a stable remuneration structure whereby directors and senior management know at the start of each year the potential rewards available to them, and the performance thresholds, without awarding significant increases in base salaries.
Over the past three years, general salary levels for all grades across NEXT, including directors, have risen by an annual average rate of 1.9%.
Individual merit awards are only given after a careful assessment of personal performance.
No executive director has received a merit or promotion award during the last three years.
For the current year, base salaries across NEXT and for directors will rise by 2.0%, which is again below the level of inflation.
We give careful consideration to ensuring that there is an appropriate balance in the remuneration structure between annual and long term rewards, as well as between cash and share-based payments.
We recognise that corporate performance and share price performance may not be correlated in any single accounting period.
Notwithstanding this, we believe that the present weighting towards rewarding sustainable long term performance is well aligned with shareholders interests.
This is evident from the high proportion of directors performance-related pay in the year that derived from growth in EPS and share price, as opposed to increases in salaries or annual bonus.
EPS and performance measurement The Committee reviews each year the basis of annual bonus and performance thresholds for the SMP.
We have again concluded that EPS remains the most appropriate measurement for the following reasons: We have used EPS as the determining measurement for many years: it is therefore consistent and transparent to participants and shareholders.
The Committee will exercise discretion if required to adjust EPS to reflect what it considers to be a fairer outcome for shareholders and executives.
Thus, last year the Committee decided to exclude from the calculation of EPS the exceptional profit achieved on the sale of Ventura and the proceeds of a refund of VAT.
This year we have excluded the exceptional profit on the sale of a development property and the accounting gain resulting from changes to the defined benefit pension scheme.
NEXT is predominantly a single business selling products through a number of channels under the NEXT brand.
No significant earnings are derived from uncorrelated businesses and therefore a group metric such as EPS is logical and consistent with strategy: EPS continues to be the core financial measure by which the Board assesses overall performance: and the use of EPS in determining annual bonuses and the SMP is complemented by the application of TSR for the LTIP.
We consider it right that the impact of share buybacks on EPS should be included in performance measurement as, for more than a decade, share buybacks have been one of NEXTs primary strategies in generating value for shareholders.
Share buybacks are regularly considered by the Board and are subject to prior approval as to timing, price and volume.
Shares are only bought after the Board is satisfied that the ability to invest in the business and to continue to grow the dividend would not be prejudiced.
Consistent with the clear focus on long term growth in EPS, the Board takes great care to manage the dilutive impact on shareholders of the various share-based schemes available to directors and other employees.
The Company regularly purchases shares in the market and holds them in NEXTs Employee Share Option Trust ESOT for reissue to satisfy option exercises and other share-based payments.

It is also responsible for determining the targets for performance-related pay schemes, approves any award of the Companys shares under share option or incentive schemes to employees and oversees any major changes in employee benefit structures.
The Committee members have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no director is permitted to be involved in any decisions as to his or her own remuneration.
The remuneration of non-executive directors is decided by the Chairman and executive directors of the Board.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Companys website www.

Additional information on Board remuneration LTIP The comparator group of companies for the three year performance periods to July 2012 and January 2013 was as follows: ASOS Findel J Sainsbury N Brown Burberry French Connection Kesa Signet Carpetright Halfords Kingfisher Tesco Carphone Warehouse HMV Marks & Spencer WH Smith Debenhams Home Retail Group Morrisons Dixons Retail JJB Sports Mothercare 44 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013 For subsequent performance periods the changes to the comparator group above are: 1. periods ending July 2013 and January 2014 - Ted Baker added and Findel, French Connection and JJB Sports removed: 2. period ending July 2014 - Supergroup added and Signet removed: and 3. periods ending January 2015 and July 2015 - Dunelm Group added and HMV removed.
The comparator group consists of UK listed retail companies which are most comparable with NEXT in size or nature of their business.
Comparison against such a group of companies is more likely to reflect the Companys relative performance against its peers, thereby resulting in grants being made on an appropriate basis.
Details of potential awards granted for outstanding performance periods are as follows: Maximum potential award granted % of base salary David Keens & Lord Christos Andrew Other Performance periods commencing Wolfson Angelides Varley employees August 2010 and February 2011 100% 125% 75% 60% August 2011, February 2012 and August 2012 100% 75% 75% 60% The Committee has discretion as to whether entitlements earned are payable in NEXT shares or cash and to date it has allowed participants the choice.
Entitlements earned are not pensionable and are based on salary and share price at the start of the performance period.
No individuals included in the plan have received grants under the management share option scheme in the same year.
Share Matching Plan Vesting of awards is dependent solely on achieving the fully diluted post-tax EPS targets detailed below.
Required fully diluted EPS pence Date of grant For 0.5:1 match For 1:1 match For 2:1 match June 2010 191.5 206.5 221.5 April 2011 231.3 240.2 258.1 For 0.25:1 match For 0.5:1 match For 1:1 match April 2012 267.2 281.5 310.2 These targets require a minimum three year growth in EPS of 8.8% 2010 award and 12% 2011 and 2012 awards before any shares vest and a maximum award is only achieved if EPS growth reaches 25.8%, 25% and 30% respectively over three years.
The effective matching ratio will be calculated on a straight line basis for EPS falling between each of the threshold points.
Details of the calculation of fully diluted EPS are provided in Note 9.
The Committee has reviewed the performance conditions of awards to be made in 2013 and for the period to January 2016, the fully diluted EPS hurdle will be 314.5 pence 12% growth for a minimum match of 0.25 of a share to vest and 365.0 pence 30% growth for the maximum match of one share.
45 Additional information Parent Company accounts Consolidated accounts Governance Business reports ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013 REMUNERATION REPORT Management share options The management share option plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees.
This plan is primarily aimed at middle management and senior store staff.
No options were granted to any directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.
No employee is entitled to be granted options under the scheme and be included in the LTIP or the SMP in the same year.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to shareholder approved limits and there are no cash settlement alternatives.
Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant, which are generally made annually.
The maximum total market value of shares i. e. the acquisition price of shares over which options may be granted to any person during any financial year of the Company is three times salary.
This limit may be increased to five times salary in circumstances considered by the Committee to be exceptional, for example on the grant of options following recruitment.
The maximum grant during the year was 120% of salary.
Sharesave options Executive directors can participate in the Companys Save As You Earn Sharesave scheme which is open to all employees.
Grants are generally made annually and the scheme is subject to HMRC rules which limit the maximum monthly savings to 250.
Options are granted at a discount of 20% to the prevailing market rate and are exercisable three, five or seven years from the date of grant.
Sharesave options granted to, or exercised by, directors in the year are detailed on page 52.
Dilution of share capital by employee share plans The Company monitors and has complied with dilution limits in its various share scheme rules and has not issued a significant number of new or treasury shares in satisfaction of share schemes in the last 10 years.
Share-based incentives are usually satisfied from shares held by the ESOT see Note 26.
Group pension plan Executive directors are members of the NEXT Group Pension Plan the Plan which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs and consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The trustee of the Plan is a limited company, NEXT Pension Trustees Limited the Trustee.
The Board of the Trustee includes members of the Plan, a pensioner member and an independent director who is also the Chairman of the Trustee.
Two of the directors are member nominated directors and cannot be removed by NEXT: the other directors, including the independent director, are appointed by and can be removed by NEXT.
All directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of NEXT.
No director of the Company is a director of the Trustee.
The Plans investments are kept separate from the business of the NEXT Group and the Trustee holds them in trust.
Responsibility for investment of the Plans funds has been delegated by the Trustee to professional investment managers.
The Group operates a salary sacrifice scheme whereby members from either section can elect to receive a reduced gross salary in exchange for enhanced employer pension contributions.
The participation of members in the salary sacrifice scheme does not result in any overall increase in costs to the Group.
Defined contribution section Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the Plan.
Members elect to pay either 3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.
For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of three times the members base salary at the previous April is payable along with the current value of the members fund.
46 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013 Defined benefit section The defined benefit section was closed to new members in 2000 and during the current year the Group reviewed its operation for remaining employee members.
Following a consultation process with those employees, from November 2012 the future accrual of pension benefits will be based on pensionable salary frozen at that time, rather than final earnings.
In addition, those employees can elect to receive either a salary supplement or additional contributions to a defined contribution scheme.
From November 2012, the defined benefit section provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth depending on the members chosen contribution rate of pensionable earnings at 31 October 2012 for each year of pensionable service.
This section provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependants pensions on death in service or following retirement.
Pensions are only payable to deceased members children after death in service.
In the case of ill-health retirement, only the accrued pension is payable.
All benefits are subject to Plan limits.
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post-1997 is subject to limited price indexation.
From 2006, sales and profit related bonuses were excluded from pensionable earnings and the normal retirement age under the Plan was increased from 60 to 65.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company currently makes contributions at the rate of 17.5%.
The last full triennial valuation of the Plan was carried out as at March 2010, the next will take place as at March 2013.
As calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, the surplus in the Plan at January 2013 was 65.6m: further details are given in Note 21 to the financial statements.
Certain members whose accrued or projected pension fund value exceeds their personal lifetime allowance are provided with benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement.
The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by a deduction of 5% on all pensionable earnings.
Since April 2011, where existing members have reached either the annual or lifetime pension contributions limits, the Company has offered those members the choice of leaving the defined benefit section and either joining the defined contribution section with an enhanced Company contribution or taking a salary supplement, in both cases equal to 10% or 15% of their salary depending on their existing contributions and benefits.
Auto-Enrolment Following the introduction of Auto-Enrolment A-E in 2012, most employees now have the option of joining the NEXT plan, the statutory A-E plan or opting out of pension provision through the Company.
Contributions to A-E commenced in February 2013.
Specific information in respect of executive directors pension entitlements is detailed on page 53.
Service contracts Executive directors Apart from service contracts detailed in the Remuneration Policy Table on page 42, no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries.
Non-executive directors Letters of appointment for the Chairman and non-executive directors do not contain fixed term periods: however they are appointed in the expectation that they will serve for a minimum of six years, subject to satisfactory performance and successful re-election at Annual General Meetings.

49 Additional information Parent Company accounts Consolidated accounts Governance Business reports ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013 REMUNERATION REPORT Long term incentive plans For the three year performance period to July 2012, TSR ranked fifth in the comparator group of 22 and 96% of the grant made in July 2009 vested.
Before allowing the award to vest the Remuneration Committee assessed the performance of the Company during the performance period in light of underlying economic and other conditions the economic underpin.
The Committee noted that EPS compound growth of 19.7% and pre-tax profit compound growth of 10.4% over the three year period, was well ahead of RPI compound growth of 4.3%.
In addition, dividends had grown in line with EPS and 727m had been returned to shareholders through buybacks.
The Committee also assessed earnings growth against selected comparable major UK retailers and concluded that NEXT had performed favourably.
Taking these factors into account, the Committee determined that the economic underpin performance condition for the July award had been satisfied.
Details of the amounts that vested for each executive director are detailed in the table below.
The awards were cash settled for all executives except David Keens who received shares.
For the performance period to January 2013, TSR ranked fifth against the comparator group of 22 which corresponds to an expected vesting of 98% of the maximum award made in January 2010.
The Remuneration Committee will formally assess the performance of the Company for this period in April on the same basis as the grant made in July 2009 before determining whether the economic underpin performance condition has been satisfied.
If the condition is satisfied, the January 2013 award will be settled in April, and based on the share price of 41.10 on 19 March 2013, awards for each executive director for the year are detailed below: July 2012 January 2013 Total Total for 2012 Estimated Estimated Adjustment Final Actual no.
2 Full details of deferred bonus are set out on pages 38 and 49.
3 See page 50 for details of the performance conditions and vesting levels applicable to the LTIP schemes vesting in the year, including the restriction on the maximum value that could vest.
4 The maximum value of LTIP awards that vest for a participant in a year is capped at 2.5m.
This cap was applied to Lord Wolfsons awards that vested in the year to January 2012.
The impact of the cap was to reduce shares vested and increase shares lapsed by 23,344 shares.
5 See page 50 for details of these awards which are expected to vest in April 2013.
