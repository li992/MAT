These plans will expire in 2014 and 2014.
This remuneration committee report, which will be put the committee has commissioned a full review of incentives to shareholders for approval at the annual general meeting, with the intention of submitting new proposals to the 2014 complies with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized annual general meeting.
The remuneration committee is aware Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations of recent updates to institutional shareholder guidelines asking 2008 and also the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
In companies to consider simpler incentive structures and will be addition, the committee has decided to adopt a number of the consulting with our major shareholders as part of this review.
BIS proposals early and, as such, this report is divided into three sections.
The first is a forward-looking policy report, which details PayPoints remuneration policies and links to strategy Andrew Robb as well as projected pay outcomes under various performance Chairman, remuneration committee scenarios.
The second section is the implementation report, which focuses on the remuneration arrangements and outcomes for the period under review, including the total actual remuneration paid to each director and details of performance against targets.
The final section is the audited information required under the existing regulations.
The remuneration committee, whose membership and responsibilities are set out on page 28 of this report, has continued to strive to ensure that executive directors remuneration provides an appropriate incentive to directors to create shareholder value and that the companys remuneration policy is aligned with the interests of shareholders.
The remuneration committee believes that shareholders interests are best served by focussing a greater proportion of total potential remuneration on compensation which varies with performance.
Short and long-term incentives are structured to align directors interests with shareholders by rewarding them for enhancing shareholder value.
The value received by executive directors under the share incentive arrangements depends on the degree to which the associated performance conditions are satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share price of the company at this time.
This ensures that substantial rewards are only received when substantial value has been created for shareholders.
Highlights of the results for the period under review are shown on page 1.
The groups performance was strong, with growth in profits and cash, enabling an increase in the dividend for shareholders.
No major changes have been made to remuneration during the period.
For 2013, the committee has agreed salary increases for the executive directors of between 3.2% and 5.6%, taking into account individual and company performance as well as salary increases across the rest of the group.
Bonuses for the period under review were 86.2% of maximum, reflecting growth in economic profit of 18%.
The bonus structure will remain unchanged for 2013 14.
Based on our earnings per share growth for the three years ended 31 March 2013 of 39%, the 2010 deferred share bonus awards will vest in full.
2010 long term incentive plan awards will be performance-tested in June 2013, and based on our total shareholder return performance to date of above upper quartile relative to the FTSE250 Index excluding investment trusts, we expect these awards to vest in full, subject to the committees satisfaction that this is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance of the company.
