Annual incentive outcome 2013 audited information To incentivise management to achieve profitable growth and sustainable cash flow, the annual cash incentive financial targets in 2013 depended upon the realisation of targets for Group underlying profit before tax and free cash flow as well as personal performance.
At target, the annual incentive achievement was 90% of base salary and the maximum incentive opportunity was 180% of base salary for achieving demanding financial targets and exceeding personal performance objectives.
Personal performance was measured against personal objectives and Rexam specific leadership practices.
The executive directors receive 25% of any annual incentive as a deferred award over Rexam shares, with no additional performance conditions save that such shares must be held for a period of not less than three years and are subject to clawback.
The policy relating to clawback is described in the policy section of this report.
The financial targets for 2013 were partially achieved and resulted in the executive directors being entitled to an annual incentive of 47.3% of base salary in respect of financial targets.
In addition, the committee assessed the achievement by each executive director of their personal objectives set at the beginning of 2013 and agreed attainment levels as indicated in the table below.

Long term incentive outcome 2013 audited information Long term incentive awards granted in 2011 through the LTIP completed their measurement period on 31December 2013.
Vesting of the awards was dependent on three equally weighted measures over a three year performance period: EPS growth, relative TSR versus the largest 150 companies excluding investment trusts by market capitalisation within the FTSE All Share Index, and ROCE.
There is no retest provision.
The awards were granted with the right to the payment in cash of a dividend equivalent on the number of shares that vest based on the notional value of the dividends paid between the date of grant and the date of transfer of the shares.
Further details, including vesting schedules and performance against each of the measures is provided in the table below.

For each of the three performance measures, the vesting below threshold is nil.
Between threshold and maximum, the vesting is calculated on a straight line basis between 25% and 100%, and the vesting is capped at 100% for achievements at or above maximum.
Each executive directors award will vest on 10March 2014, the first business day after the third anniversary of the date of grant.

Shares can be purchased in the market or acquired on the vesting of share incentives.
Shares awarded through the deferred bonus plan are included for the purpose of assessing the minimum shareholding requirement.
The current minimum shareholding requirement is 320,000 shares for the chief executive and 130,000 shares for the finance director.
Other executive directors have a requirement of 130,000 shares.
The share ownership guidelines for the chief executive and the other executive directors are reviewed annually.
The committee has reviewed the guidelines during 2013 and considers that the current minimum shareholding requirement remains relevant.
Graham Chipchase and David Robbie exceeded their minimum shareholding requirement during 2013.
The majority of the ELT members see page 49 have met their minimum 50,000 shareholding requirement.
Those that have not met their minimum shareholding requirement were not eligible to participate in the 2010 LTIP award or their award was insufficient to fully cover their requirement.
