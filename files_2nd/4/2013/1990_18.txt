Berendsen plc Report and 82 Accounts 2013 Report on directors remuneration Part A: Policy Report Remuneration policy With effect from its approval at the 2014 AGM, this Policy Report sets out the framework that will inform how the companys remuneration strategy will be executed during 2014 and it is anticipated over the next three years, thereby ensuring that thestructure and levels of executive remuneration continue to remain appropriate for the company.
This is to be achieved byhaving a remuneration policy that: k Provides an appropriate mix of rewards, incentives and benefits that are balanced between: Fixed and variable pay, with at least half variable at target performance: and Short and long-term performance.
k Ensures that remuneration levels for the companys senior executives take into account their skills and experience, the nature and complexity of their responsibilities, relevant comparative market data typically executive pay is benchmarked against companies of a similar size to Berendsen selected primarily on the basis of market capitalisation but with consideration also given to revenue, sector and number of employees and any unforeseen factors that may arise from time to time: and k Recognises and rewards stretching performance and appropriate risk-reward behaviours.
The committee is satisfied that these policy objectives remain appropriate and that there continues to be a sensible balance between fixed and variable elements of remuneration as set out in the Future policy table below.
No changes to the remuneration policy will be made in 2014.
The committee is aware that the Performance Share Plan PSP willexpire in April 2016 and accordingly will review that plan in advance of this date.
As a component of this review, thecommittee will consider the introduction of a formal clawback and or malus policy.
Remuneration for executive directors will consist of the following elements: Future policy table Purpose and link to strategy Operation and performance conditions if applicable Maximum potential value Fixed remuneration Salary Reviewed annually, with any change having effect from 1 January and The base salaries of executive directors To recognise the responsibilities of taking into account: effective from 1 January 2014 prior to the role and the experience, skills this policy taking effect are as follows: k Group and individual performance: and performance of the individual Peter Ventress 551,000 and to attract and retain the k Pay levels and salary increases throughout the company and the highest calibre of Chief Executive group: and Kevin Quinn 340,000 Officer and executive directors.

Payments can be increased or decreased through the application of a multiplier depending on personal performance against measures linked to the individuals areas of responsibility and the overall strategy of the group.
Personal measures are specific to the performance of each executive.
Depending upon the extent to which the personal measures have been achieved, a performance multiplier then operates at the discretion of the committee whereby the above amounts can beincreased or decreased byup to 30%.
The committee retains the discretion to adjust annually the financial measures such that no financial measure accounts for more than 50% ofthe bonus outcome.
This is to ensure that they remain appropriate and aligned with the companys strategy, subject to the overall maximum.
If changes to the performance measures targets are contemplated, thecommittee will consider whether it is appropriate to consult with the companys main shareholders and their representative bodies depending on the extent of the change.

Travel and subsistence for non-executive directors based outside of the UK for company-related business will be reimbursed by the company.
Subject to board approval and ensuring that there are no conflicts of interest, executive directors can hold one non-executive directorship forwhich they retain their fees.
Performance measures and target setting As noted in the Future policy table above, performance measures are determined annually to ensure continued alignment with Berendsens corporate strategy, in order to both reward and incentivise its delivery.
The 2014 annual bonus financial measures adjusted EPS, free cash flow generation and revenue, were chosen in light of the stated strategic objectives to deliver organic revenue growth of GDP 1-2%, high single-digit EPS growth and cash conversion of at least 100%.
Individual performance measures are chosen based on the areas that the committee wants to see improvement and or progress on during the financial year in light of the overall strategic priorities for the company.
This process of identifying and selecting performance measures does not change on an annual basis.
The 2014 long-term incentive measures of absolute EPS and ROIC were chosen as the committee considers them to be the most accurate measures of long-term company performance, balancing growth and investor returns whilst providing good line ofsight for executives.
In setting performance targets the committee takes account of internal and external forecasts and prevailing economic conditions.

The UK Sharesave Plan is excluded from the scenarios as the values are diminutive Employee remuneration and engagement When reviewing and setting executive remuneration, the committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of all employees of the company and group.
Specifically, the level of any company-wide pay review is a key determinant when setting the level of any salary increase for the executive directors and will be disclosed in the Annual Report each year.
The companys approach to reward and remuneration is broadly consistent across the group however: executive remuneration ismore heavily weighted towards variable elements of remuneration which are conditional upon the executive directors achieving performance targets linked to the successful delivery of strategy.
This aims to create a clear link between the value created for shareholders and remuneration received by the executive directors.
Managers across the group who participate in an annual bonus scheme have similar metrics to those used for executive directors.
These are typically dependent upon the achievement of local business unit performance targets which can be a mixture of financial or personal objectives and are linked to the implementation of our strategic objectives.
Other employees may also participate in a performance-led annual bonus plan.
Senior managers are eligible to participate in the BLTIP Berendsen Long-Term Incentive Plan which rewards approximately 100 managers for the achievement of strategic goals and encourages share ownership.
Two or three-year stretching performance targets, which are business unit specific, are set and managers received regular performance updates to ensure they are informed about their progress toward the achievement of targets.
All permanent UK employees are invited to participate in the UK Sharesave Plan, which is explained within the Future policy table.
Although the company has not carried out a formal employee consultation regarding board remuneration, it does comply with local regulations and practices regarding employee consultation more broadly.
The Group Director, Human Resources ensures that the committee is made aware of any relevant employee feedback regarding the companys remuneration policy.
Further information about our engagement with employees across the group is provided in the Our people section on page 47.

Appointment of new directors The policy for the appointment of new executive directors both internal and external is as follows.
The new directors base salary will be set taking into account a range of factors including market levels, experience, internal relativities and cost.
If base salary has been set at a level below the desired market level contingent on individual performance, the committee retains adiscretion torealign the base salary over a phased period of one to three years following the appointment, which may result inanexceptional rate of annualised increase in excess of that set out in the Future policy table on page 83.
Other elements of annual remuneration will be consistent with the Future policy table save that conduct conditions allowing thecompany to recover unvested awards may apply.
The following exceptions to this approach will apply: k If an internal appointment is made, the committee retains the discretion to continue with any existing contractual remuneration provisions: and k The committee retains the discretion to make awards on recruitment under the PSP and CIP and or an individual award agreement on similar terms, to provide an immediate interest with company performance.
The committee will determine the level of the award, the performance conditions and time-horizon that would apply to such awards at the time of grant, taking into account the strategy and business circumstances at Berendsen.
The maximum value of variable remuneration that may be granted is consistent with the Future policy table, namely: 130% of salary bonus opportunity, a 35% of salary investment under the CIP and a 200% of salary award under the PSP reducing to 100% on an ongoing basis.
k The same principles shall apply if it is necessary for the Chairman or any non-executive director to assume executive function on a temporary basis.
Service contracts will be entered into on terms similar to those for the existing executive directors, summarised in our service contract policy opposite.
The committee can also consider buying-out incentive awards that the individual has had to forfeit by accepting the appointment.
This would be done either through the companys existing reward structures as set out in the Futurepolicy table or in accordance with and reliance upon any relevant provisions and procedures contained within the ListingRules.
Any awards or payments made in respect of forfeited remuneration would, as far as is possible or practicable, take into account the expected value, timing, form of delivery and the terms of, the forfeited remuneration.
Wherever possible, any new arrangements would be linked to the achievement of Group targets.
The committee may also require the individual topurchase company shares up to a pre-agreed level prior to vesting.
With respect to the appointment of a new Chairman or non-executive director, contractual terms will be consistent with those currently adopted.
Variable pay will not be considered and as such no maximum applies nil.
In order to secure the appointment of a new Chairman not based in the UK, payments relating to relocation or repatriation including house costs can be considered.
An appropriate announcement of the directors appointment and the incumbents remuneration will be made through aregulatory information service and posted on the companys website.
Unforeseen circumstances and change of law The committee retains the discretion to make emergency payments outside of the policy described in exceptional and genuinely unforeseen circumstances.
This discretion would extend to cover where the committee believes that this is in the best interest ofthe company and when it would be disproportionate to seek approval from a general meeting.
Any payments or commitments to make such payments in such circumstances will be disclosed on a timely basis.
In addition to the various operational discretions that the committee can exercise in the performance of its duties including those discretions set out in the companys share plans, the committee reserves the right to make either minor or administrative amendments to the policy, if required, to benefit its operation or to make more material amendments in order to comply with substantially new laws and regulations.
