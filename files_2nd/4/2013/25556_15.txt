Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration Statement On behalf of your Board, I am pleased to present our Directors Remuneration Report DRR for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Shareholders will be invited to approve both our Remuneration Policy and the Annual Remuneration Report at the Groups AGM to be held on 13 May 2014.
Evolution of our remuneration framework As outlined earlier in this Annual Report, for the During the year, the Committee considered how the Groups remuneration second consecutive year, the Groups performance and incentive structures should evolve has been strong, with progress across many of to enable the Group to continue to the Groups portfolio businesses contributing to a attract and retain management and staff significant increase in net assets and a reported profit of the highest quality, whilst retaining an appropriate level of entrepreneurial before tax of more than 70m, the highest since culture, and also remaining in accordance the Groups formation in 2001.
The Groups share with best practice for a FTSE 250 listed price increased by around 40% during the year, from business.
This resulted in a number of changes for 2013, as set out below.
119.9p to 169.8p, representing an increase in market capitalisation of more than 180m.
IP Group is a business experiencing substantial growth and its market Francis Carpenter Chairman of the Remuneration Committee capitalisation has increased from approximately 80m in January 2011 to approximately 900m at the date of this report.
As a result the Committee believes it is important to keep remuneration arrangements under regular review to ensure they continue to evolve to support the strategy and circumstances of the business.
We consulted our major shareholders on the changes in 2013 and would intend to do so for any future changes.
Incentive mix for 2013 The Committee determined that it would reduce the proportion of total reward potential arising from the Groups LTIP and introduce a new annual incentive scheme while broadly maintaining the overall incentive opportunity.
The Committee considers that this is most appropriately aligned with the Groups current strategy of sourcing and developing technologybased businesses and seeking to generate long term value through the growth in value of the Groups holdings in such businesses, while being mindful of the Groups financial performance in each twelve month period.

The Committee remuneration for the executive directors has therefore determined that the 2013 for the year appropriately reflects the LTIP awards will be granted at the same Groups performance over the year time as the 2014 LTIP awards.

IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 62 23002-04 Proof 8a 01-04-14 Our Governance Committee Reports Annual incentive scheme 2013 As described earlier in this report, following consultation with its major shareholders, in 2013 the Group introduced the AIS under which all executive directors were eligible for an award.
The targets for the 2013 AIS were solely financial in nature and were based on annual return on hard net assets i. e. excluding intangibles and the Oxford equity rights asset which were 236.6m at 1 January 2013, as follows: Performance condition Vesting criteria Actual performance Return on Hard NAV 8% return 18.9m : 25% of maximum opportunity 33.3% return 78.9m threshold 22.5% return 53.2m : 100% of maximum opportunity As shown in the table, the financial performance of the Group in 2013 was very strong, with the actual return on hard NAV being 33.3% and therefore the maximum awards pool was available for allocation by the Committee.
Taking into account various factors, including the companys year-end cash position and the level of realisations achieved during the year, the remuneration committee determined that it would make no amendments to the general policy.
Therefore, subject to a minimum bonus of 20,000, 50% of any individuals bonus would be payable in cash and 50% would be deferred into equity and that, in line with the scheme rules, these would be subject to deferral as to 50% over one year and 50% over two years with forfeiture should the executive director leave the Group within such times.
Awards to executive directors are subject to claw-back as set out in the Policy.
The Committee considered that the executives should be treated equally in terms of bonus outcome for 2013 given the strong allround performance.
As a result, the following annual incentive scheme awards apply for the 2013 year: CEO: 100% of maximum opportunity for the year 100% of salary : CFO: 100% of maximum opportunity for the year 75% of salary : CIO: 100% of maximum opportunity for the year 75% of salary : and MD of TTV: 100% of maximum opportunity for the year 75% of salary.
2012 The Group did not operate any annual bonus scheme in 2012.
Long-term incentive scheme 2011 LTIP awards due to vest in March 2014 The 2011 LTIP awards were based on the performance of Groups Hard NAV the Groups net assets excluding intangibles and the Oxford Equity Rights asset for the three financial years ending on 31 December 2013 and TSR from date of award to the ordinary vesting date, being 31 March 2014.
Both performance measures were combined into a matrix format, as per the vesting table below.
The total award is subject to an underpin based on the relative performance of the Groups TSR to that of the FTSE Small Cap index, which can reduce the awards by up to 50%.
TSR performance based on quarter to 31 December 2013.
Actual performance period to 31 March 2014 Growth in NAV p. a.
As set out in the above table, the actual performance of the Group in terms of Hard NAV growth was in excess of the upper target and, based on the positions as at 31 December 2013 and the date of this report, it appears that the TSR target and the performance of the underpin index will also be significantly exceeded at the end of the performance period.
As a result of this, it is anticipated that 100% of the 2011 LTIP awards will vest on 31 March 2014.
Our Governance Committee Reports Directors Remuneration Report Annual Remuneration Report continued 2010 LTIP awards that vested in April 2013 The following table sets out the outcomes of the performance measures relating to the 2010 LTIP awards against the vesting criteria.

Hard NAV target increased by the net proceeds of the Groups 2011 placing plus 8%-15% growth from the date of completion of the placing.
As the performance measures were achieved in part, the relevant proportion of the 2010 LTIP awards vested on 16 April 2013.
2013 awards During the first half of 2013, the Committee undertook a consultation with major shareholders on the rebalancing of the incentive mix.
The Committees intention had been to implement the new incentive framework, including granting the agreed 2013 LTIP awards, following this consultation.
However, as a result of the corporate activity during the second half of the year culminating in the Groups recommended offer for Fusion IP plc and a capital raising in early 2014, there was no appropriate opportunity to grant the agreed 2013 LTIP awards during the year.
The Committee has therefore determined that the 2013 LTIP awards will be granted at the same time as the 2014 LTIP awards discussed on page 66.
As communicated during consultation, the 2013 LTIP award will have a face value of 100% of salary based on the share price at date of grant and will vest three years later subject to performance.
Any shares that vest net of tax shall be subject to a further one-year holding period in line with the Policy.
The performance conditions that will apply shall be the same as those used for the 2011 and 2012 awards, i. e. the matrix of TSR and Hard NAV growth as shown on page 66.
Hard NAV growth will be measured over the three year period to 31 December 2015 starting point: 236.6m and TSR shall be measured from March 2013 to March 2016 with a one-month average starting point: 143p.
The underpin will be with reference to TSR performance against the FTSE 250 over this same period.
Under the new disclosure regulations, there is a requirement to disclose certain details of share awards made during the reporting year.
Although the 2013 LTIP awards were not technically awarded during 2013, the Committee believes it is appropriate and transparent to include the required table on the basis that the 2013 LTIP awards relate to this reporting year.

No payments have been made that have not already been included in the single figure of remuneration set out earlier in this report.
Remuneration for the Chief Operating Officer who stepped down from the Board in 2013 audited information As described earlier in this report, Alison Fielding stepped down from the Board due to ill-health with effect from 30 June 2013 however she remains employed by the Group in a part-time capacity.
Alison received her base salary, benefits and pension contributions to the date of stepping down and then continued to do so at a level commensurate with her new part-time role following this date.
In addition, in view of her continued employment with the Group, Alisons outstanding awards under the Groups LTIP remain in force and will vest, or not, in 2014 or 2015 depending on the performance against vesting targets of the awards at the relevant time.
She will also continue to participate in the LTIP as a member of the senior management team.
Alison received no additional remuneration as a result of her stepping down from the board.

The increases for Charles Winward and Greg Smith reflect increases that, as described earlier in this report, are being phased over a number of years to bring the individual closer to a market competitive salary commensurate with their increased experience having both initially joined on the Board on lower base salaries.
Pension and benefits will be in line with the benefits stated in the policy table.
Incentives There will be no change to the maximum opportunity under our AIS, being set by the Committee at 100% of base salary for the CEO and 75% of base salary for the other executive directors.
The performance measures shall be unchanged for 2014 and shall be based on a minimum return of 8% on the Groups hard NAV with the maximum awards pool being available for a return of 22.5% or greater.
It is anticipated that the opening hard NAV will be adjusted upwards to reflect the Groups capital raising and, assuming completion following the accounts date, the acquisition of Fusion IP plc.
This will result in opening hard NAV of approximately 460m requiring a net return of approximately 37m for any bonus pool to be available and in excess of 100m for the maximum pool to be available.
The 2014 LTIP awards will be made at the same levels that apply for the 2013 awards, being 100% of base salary for all executive directors.
Performance will continue to be assessed against growth in hard NAV and TSR performance with the underpin based on relative TSR against the FTSE250 as per the vesting table below.
Hard NAV growth will be measured over the three year period to 15% 60% 75% 90% 100% 31 December 2016 with the starting point being the 315.5m at 31 December 2013 adjusted upwards for the net proceeds of the 10% 30% 45% 60% 90% Groups 2014 new equity issue and, assuming it completes, the Groups acquisition of Fusion IP and TSR shall be measured from 8% 15% 30% 45% 75% March 2014 to March 2017 with a one-month average.
The Committee continues to consider that hard profitability 8% 0% 15% 30% 60% which in turn drives the Groups net asset value growth over the longer term is the most appropriate annual performance 8% 8% 10% 15% measure for the Groups business, and considers that increase in hard NAV and TSR continue to be the most appropriate over the Growth in NAV p. a. longer term.
As discussed on page 64, the Committee also intends to grant the 2013 LTIP awards during 2014 as it was not possible to grant these during 2013.
Chairman and non-executive directors With effect from 1 April 2014, the fees of the Chairman will be 65,000 reflecting a 2.5% increase compared to 2013 14 and the fees of the non-executive directors will be 38,000 reflecting a 2.5% increase compared to 2013 14.
Additional fees for chairmanship of a board committee or for being senior independent director shall be 7,500 previously 5,000.

Directors shareholdings and share interests audited information As set out in the Policy on pages 55 to 61, the Group has minimum shareholding requirements for each of its executive directors.
In its consultation with shareholders in the first half of 2013, the levels were proposed as 1.5 salary for the CEO and 1.25 salary for all other executive directors.
Mindful of evolving best practice however the Committee has determined to set the limits at 2.0 salary for the CEO, and 1.5 salary for all other executive directors.
This level of shareholding is required to be met within four years of 1 July 2013 or date of appointment, if later.
If the guideline is not met within this timeframe then the Committee will discuss with the relevant executive director a plan to ensure that the guideline can be met within a reasonable timeframe.
The Committee will ordinarily require executive directors to retain all shares received under the AIS or LTIP, other than as required to meet tax and NIC liabilities, until the guideline is met.
At the end of the year, all executive directors met this requirement.

Under the co-investment arrangements, executive directors make minority capital and loan commitments to IP Venture Fund IPVF alongside the Group.
Executives are entitled to participate in a carried interest scheme in respect of IPVF and The North East Technology Fund LP alongside the Group.
Carried interest provides a preferential return to participants once the partnership in question has returned all funds contributed by limited partners together with a pre-agreed rate of return.
The carried interest and co-investment arrangements will generally contain forfeiture provisions in respect of leavers over the investment period of the relevant partnership typically 5-6 years.

Under the IPVF fund LPA, payments to participants are made when all limited partners have been repaid their contributions together with a hurdle rate of 8% compound interest.
Under the North East Technology Fund NETF scheme, payments to participants are made when all limited partners have been repaid their contributions together with a hurdle rate of 3.5% compound interest.
Scheme interest represents the percentage of the relevant pool of investments in respect of which the participant is entitled to participate in the realised profits.
The schemes contain forfeiture provisions over the investment period of the fund which may reduce the scheme interest accruing to any participant.
The table reflects the maximum scheme interest receivable should no forfeiture occur.
Accrued value of scheme interests is calculated based upon the current fair value of the relevant limited partnerships assets in excess of the capital contributed and the hurdle rate of return.
Any payments will only be made following full repayment of limited partners loan commitments and the hurdle return and accordingly actual payments under the scheme, if any, may be materially different to those set out above.
