Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 63 Remuneration report Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, Ed Haslam Dear shareholders 1.
Introduction and annual statement Background to remuneration decisions While this year has continued to be challenging, the Company has been successful in a number of important ways: year gold production 356,943 oz 36% increase on 2012 : cash operating costs of under US$663 per ounce below budget of US$700 per ounce : safety record of 0.36 LTIFR in 2013 48% reduction on the prior year : Stage 4 expansion project largely on time and on budget total capital expenditure estimate of US$331.2 million : strong financial position US$106 million cash and liquid assets at year end: Edward Haslam systematic exploration continued both at Sukari and Ethiopia, although Chairman of the only low grade mineralisation discovered resulting in the write down and Remuneration Committee relinquishing of the licence areas: and M&A activity culminated in a recommended takeover offer of Ampella Mining Ltd to extend exploration into prospective and stable Burkina Faso.
Therefore, while there are still challenges in respect of the litigation, details of which are set out in Note 20 to the financial statements, from an operational and financial perspective this has been a successful year and it is within that context that the key remuneration decisions for 2013 described below have been taken.
Last year some shareholders expressed concerns about certain aspects of the remuneration policy and practice.
We have been working on those concerns and I would like to thank the shareholders, whom I had an opportunity to meet this year, for their constructive feedback on the Remuneration Report.
I will continue to engage with shareholders throughout 2014.
Simple approach to remuneration We continue to be wedded to a simpler remuneration structure for the executive directors with only three elements of remuneration for Josef ElRaghy, base pay, contribution to a pension and annual bonus and two elements for Trevor Schultz, base pay and annual bonus.
As described below we are not proposing any changes in this policy for the coming year.
We believe this simple approach allows a cleaner line of sight for the delivery of performance in the short term while meaningful actual shareholdings means the executives wealth is directly linked to the fortunes of other shareholders.
There is no better union of interest between shareholder and executives than for executives to be substantial shareholders in their own right.
As reported last year Josef ElRaghy no longer participates in any long term incentive plans, the committee being of the view the his significant shareholding is a sufficient link to shareholders interests.
Trevor Schultz award of 1,000,000 shares under the terms of the Directors Loan Funded Share Plan failed to achieve the necessary performance criteria, after the year end and therefore it was agreed that these awards lapse.
He will receive no further awards for long term incentives.
For employees the complex loan funded arrangements that previously existed have been replaced with one simple Deferred Bonus Share Plan.

Long term incentive arrangements Introduction The Company has had a number of share schemes intended to facilitate employee and executive participation in the capital value of the Company.
A number of these share schemes were developed to take account of Australian tax law.
With the review last year and Committee concluding that the schemes were too complex and failed to provide any meaningful motivation or link to shareholder interests those scheme are no longer being used.
The existing executive directors no longer participate in any long term incentive arrangement and neither executive director has any outstanding award under any company share scheme.
There is a deferred share plan for senior management detailed below.
Deferred Bonus Scheme not for directors This plan, introduced in 2013, allows the annual bonus to be matched with shares which are then ordinarily released in three annual tranches, conditional upon the continued employment with the Group.
The plan was introduced as a review of annual bonus arrangements for management with the objectives of: 1 increasing the variable pay element of remuneration: 2 introducing a new retention element in the remuneration package: and 3 linking part of that reward to the mediumterm share performance of the Company.
For the initial year and to introduce the plan, on 4 June 2013, the Company offered to participants of existing plans the opportunity to replace awards with an initial one off award under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan.
The plan is not open to directors of the Company.
CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 74 Remuneration report continued 6.
Long term incentive arrangements continued Historic long term incentive plan summary Employee Loan Funded Share Plan 2011 There are no outstanding awards under this Plan and there is no current intention to make further awards under this plan.
This was the rollover plan for the Centamin Egypt Ltd 2011 Employee Loan Funded Share Plan.
Under the plan, employees receive a loan to buy shares in the Company.
The shares are then held in trust for the employee and at the end of three years the employees can repay the loan and receive the shares.
Director Loan Funded Share Plan 2011 After the year end, there were no outstanding awards under this Plan as the performance criteria were not met and awards lapsed.
There is no current intention to use this Plan.
The plan operated in the same way as the Employee Plan, except that there are mandatory performance conditions attached to the Director Plan, and that the shares vested in one tranche, three years from the date of grant.
At 31 December 2013, having carried out initial calculations, the participants had no prospect of the performance conditions being met, however the plan operated in the following way.
The awards were due to vest three years from the date of grant, dependent on the achievement of comparative total shareholder return, with 50% based upon the FTSE 250 and 50% based upon comparator companies.
25% of the award would vest for median performance and 100% for upper quartile performance under each element.
Comparator companies were selected by the Remuneration Committee from peers in the mining sector and were as follows: New Gold Inc: Centerra Gold Inc: Randgold Resources: Hochschild Mining: Alamos Gold Inc: European Goldfields Ltd: Eldorado Gold Corp: African Barrick Gold and Petropavlovsk Plc.
Employee Share Option Plan There are no outstanding awards under this plan and there is no current intention to use the plan.
Awards under the plan were subject to performance criteria for senior management based upon share price, financial, production or key tasks.
