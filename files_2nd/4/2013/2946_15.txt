Carillions remuneration philosophy is that reward should be used to incentivise Executive Directors in a manner that is consistent with the Groups objectives.
The package has been designed based on the following key principles: Key focus Remuneration policy To attract, develop and retain excellent people To reward all employees fairly according to their role, experience and performance and with due regard to actual and expected market conditions and the financial performance of the Group.
Alignment with interests of shareholders A substantial proportion of the package for the Executive Directors is delivered in the Companys shares to ensure that the interests of Executives are aligned with shareholders.
This is further supported by shareholding guidelines ensuring that a meaningful portion of each Executive Directors personal wealth is linked to the share price performance.
Pay for performance A substantial proportion of Executive Director remuneration is variable and linked to the Groups performance, in particular, to the delivery of sustained profitable growth and to the performance of the individual.
Be a recognised leader in Health & Safety and sustainability To ensure that remuneration arrangements support our sustainability agenda, the quality of performance in terms of business results and leadership is considered, including achieving high standards in respect of Carillions Health & Safety, environmental and social performance targets.
This is further supported by the introduction of strategic objectives into the LEAP from 2014 which include specific and quantifiable sustainability metrics.
