66 HAYS PLC|ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2013 R EMUNERATION REPORT MARKET CONDITIONS Given that the specialist recruitment industry is prone to rapid and material changes in market conditions, setting the shortand long-term incentive targets requires the Committee to exercise professional judgement to anticipate where financial performance could reasonably be expected to be in 12 months time.
Inevitably this requires the interpretation and extrapolation of both internal and external factors which can change very quickly within a relatively short time frame.
Reviewing operational performance over the last two years clearly illustrates these challenges in relation to both the longand short-term incentive schemes: Short term incentive schemes Financial year to June 2012 In setting the targets for the year to June 2012, the Committee took into account both the strong rebound in Group profitability achieved in the second half of the 2011 financial year and the improvement in the global economic backdrop apparent at that time.
Having delivered 114.1 million operating profit EPS: 5.19 pence in the 2011 financial year, we set a challenging, but at the time appropriate target for the 2012 financial year of 150 million operating profit target EPS: 6.93 pence with an entry level at 6.24 pence and a maximum level of 7.62 pence.
