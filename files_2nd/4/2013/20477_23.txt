Selection of Performance Measures EPS v LIBOR has been selected as the performance measure for awards under the DFSS as the Committee feels itisastrong indicator of long term shareholder return.
It is also transparent, visible and motivational to Executives.
Performance targets are set to be stretching and achievable, taking into account the Companys strategic priorities and the economic environment in which the Company operates.
Targets are set, taking into account a range of reference points including the Groups strategic plan and broker forecasts for both Admiral and its insurance peers.
The Committee believes that the performance targets set arevery stretching and that the maximum outcomesare only available for truly outstanding performance.
Remuneration Policy for Other Employees The Companys approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, withconsideration given to the role size, experience required, individual performance and pay levels in comparable companies.
In general, the Remuneration Policy which applies to other Senior Executives is consistent with that for Executive Directors.
Remuneration istypically linked to Company and individual performance in a way that reinforces shareholder value-creation.
Approximately 1,800 employees from across the Group, as well as the CFO, participate inthe DFSS.
The Committee recommends for approval by the Board awards to all participants under the DFSS.
For the CFO, all share awards are subject to the performance condition detailed in the policy table.
For below-Board employees, awards are split: 50% of the award is subject to the same performance condition, and the other 50% has no performance conditions attached other than the requirement that the recipient remains an employee of the Group at the date of vesting.
Award sizes vary by organisational level.
All holders ofDFSS awards receive the DFSS bonus.
All employees are eligible to participate inthe SIP on the same terms.
Remuneration Arrangements for Founding Directors Two of the three Executive Directors Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens are founding Directors.
They and the Committee continue to hold the view that the significant shareholdings held by them provide a sufficient alignment of their interest in the performance of the Group with the interests of other shareholders.
In light of this, their remuneration packages consist only of a below market rate salary and benefits such as private medical cover, permanent health insurance and death in service cover.
The Group does not contribute to any pension arrangements on behalf of these Executive Directors, and they have not participated, nor is it intended that they participate, inany Group share schemes.
Service Contracts and Leaver Change ofControl Provisions The Companys policy is to limit termination payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements.
In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
Under normal circumstances, Executive Directors are entitled to receive termination payments inlieu of notice based on base salary and compensation for loss of benefits.
The Company has the ability to pay such sums ininstalments, requiring the Executive Director to mitigate loss over the relevant period.
The notice period for all Executive Directors is one year.
Date of Executive Director appointment Henry Engelhardt 22 10 99 David Stevens 22 10 99 Kevin Chidwick 04 09 06 There is no provision in the Executive Directors contracts for compensation to be payable on early termination of their contract over andabove the notice period element.
Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.
When considering termination payments, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and participants.

Pay-for-performance: Scenario Analysis The following charts provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the potential split between the different elements of pay under three different performance scenarios: Minimum, On-target, and Maximum.
As described above, Admirals DFSS bonus is directly aligned with dividends received by our shareholders.
As such, there is no threshold or target performance defined for this element of pay.
The figures shown in the chart below for the CFOs DFSS bonus include the value of the actual DFSS bonus paid in 2013.
Under all scenarios, potential reward opportunities are based on Admirals Remuneration Policy applied to salaries as at 31 December 2013.
The On target threshold column includes a 10% vesting for DFSS awards which would occur in the event that EPSgrowth over the performance period equates to LIBOR over the same period.

Pension New appointees will be eligible to participate in the Personal Pension Plan with Group contributions in line with the existing policy.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may include but are not limited to death in service scheme, private medical cover, and permanent health insurance.
SIP New appointees will be eligible to participate in the SIP.
DFSS New appointees will be granted awards under the DFSS on the same 1,000,000 or 600% of base salary terms as other Executives, as described in the policy table.
iflower DFSS bonus New appointees will be granted awards under the DFSS bonus scheme Linked to Admiral dividend on the same terms as other Executives, as described in the policy table.
The Committee may also make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met to ensure that the value of the buy-outs are no greater than the fair value of the awards they replace.
The Committee may also avail itself of Listing Rule 9.4.
2 R if appropriate in respect of buy-out incentive arrangements.
Internal Appointments Remuneration for new Executive Directors appointed by way of internal promotion will similarly be determined in line with the policy for external appointees, as detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the Board, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements.
Incentive opportunities for below Board employees are typically no higher than for Executive Directors, but measures may vary if necessary.
NED Recruitment In recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on pages 55 to 56.
A base fee would bepayable for Board membership, with additional fees payable for acting as Senior Independent Director or as Chairman or member ofaBoard Committee asappropriate.
Other Directorships Executive Directors are permitted to, although none currently do, accept appointments as non-executive directors of companies with prior approval of the Group Chairman.
Approval will only be given where the appointment does not present a conflict of interest with the Groups activities and the wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the development of the individual.
Considerations of Conditions Elsewhere in the Group The Committee considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when determining remuneration for Executive Directors.
Whilst the Committee does not currently consult specifically with employees on the Executive Remuneration Policy, it consults with and receives updates on employee pay arrangements from the Groups Head of People Services and takes this into consideration when reviewing Executive remuneration.
Considerations of Shareholder Views When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into account best practice guidelines issued by institutional shareholder bodies.
The Committee is open to feedback from shareholders on Remuneration Policy and will continue to monitor trends and developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the structure of the Executive remuneration remains appropriate.
Further detail on the votes received on the 2013 Directors Remuneration Report is provided in the Annual Report onRemuneration.
