The single figure amount for Christopher Ward in 2012 was for nine months as he joined part way through the year 2.
At the A GM on 8 February 2013, Jonathan Lane retired as executive Deputy Chairman and was appointed non-executive Chairman.
His remuneration in respect of his role asDeputy Chairman is shown above and as Chairman is shown in the single figure for non-executive directors below 3.
Benefit s comprise car benefit, permanent health insurance, life insurance and health insurance.
Pension contribution is 25% of salary and may be taken in cash in part or entirely.
The cash equivalent is reduced by any resultant tax liability borne by the Group 5.
P ayment for performance during the year ie annual bonus.
For 2013, the executive directors received bonuses of 50% of salary.
Each director has elected to take their 2013 bonus entirely in shares.
No further performance criteria apply.
See page 62 and 63 for further details 6.
Multipl e year variable is the LTIP.
50% of LTIP awards granted in December 2010 will vest on 9 December 2013.
The value of these awards has been calculated by multiplying the number of shares that will vest by the 3-month average share price to 30 September 2013 of 6.13.
See below for further details.
As disclosed last year, the award for Jonathan Lane was made pro-rata according to the time he was an executive director 7.
This includes Shar esave which has been valued based on the monthly savings amount 250 and the discount provided 20% ie 250 x 12 x 20%.
It also includes any dividend equivalents to be paid in respect of LTIP shares due to vest on 9 December 2013 Nil cost options under the LTIP granted on 8 December 2010 are due to vest on 9 December 2013 for Brian Bickell, Simon Quayle, Tom Welton and Jonathan Lane.
Of the options granted in December 2010, 50% of the options will vest in December 2013.
The TSR performance condition over the three years ended 30 September 2013 was not met, whilst NAV performance resulted in 100% vesting for this element.
Retrospective disclosure of the extent to which the targets have been met for the annual bonus in respect of the year ending 30 September 2013, payable in December 2013, and included within the single figure remuneration for that year is as follows: TARGET PERFoRMANCE Achieve growth in ERVs compared to levels assessed by our valuers Achieved rents 4.5% above ERV at 30.9.
2012 in the year end valuation KPI Let vacant space on a timely basis in light of market conditions KPI Exceeded target letting times on average by 33% Corporate responsibility performance DJSI score improved from 63 to 65.
GRESB score ranked the Group 3 out of 10 in a peer group Outperform UK IPD benchmark index Outperformed IPD benchmark for total property return by 6.9% Manage property expenses as a percentage of rental income Ratio of property expenses compared to rents receivable unchanged from previous financial year Deliver projects transactions successfully Projects identified were either completed satisfactorily or, if delayed by external factors, satisfactory progress was made during the year During the year ended 30 September 2013, the Group has performed well with EPRA profit before tax of 30.4 million, EPRA earnings per share of 12.0p and EPRA NAV of 5.67.
Operational and financial performance of the business in the year has met or exceeded the Boards expectation.
In determining the level of 2013 annual bonuses for executive directors, the Committee carefully analysed the Groups performance against the objectives set at the beginning of the financial year.
Each of the objectives was considered to be substantially met or exceeded.
However it was noted this good performance was achieved against the background of a buoyant wider West End economy.
Taking into account the environment in which the Group was operating and EPRA profit and NAV growth for the year, together with the Groups policy of rewarding delivery of sustained growth in shareholder value through LTIP arrangements, it was decided that an annual bonus award of 50% of base salary was appropriate.
This compares with the Groups policy of a maximum award of 125% and an on-target award of 62.5%.
In all cases the bonus level is reduced by 20% where an employee elects to take their annual bonus in cash rather than shares.
