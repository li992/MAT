Policy on Directors Remuneration No director has a service contract with the company.
The companys policy is for the directors to be remunerated in the form of fees, payable half-yearly in arrears.
There are no long term incentive schemes, bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other benefits and fees are not related to the individual directors performance, nor to the performance of the board as a whole.
The companys Articles of Association limit the aggregate fees payable to the board of directors to a total of 150,000 per annum.
The directors are proposing an ordinary resolution at the forthcoming AGM resolution 10 to increase the current limit on the aggregate amount of fees payable in any year to 200,000.
A further explanation of resolution 10 appears in the Directors Report of page 33.
Subject to this overall limit, it is the boards policy to determine the level of directors fees having regard to the level of fees payable to non-executive directors in the investment trust industry generally, the role that individual directors fulfil, and the time committed to the companys affairs.
The board believes that levels of remuneration should be sufficient to attract and retain non-executive directors to oversee the company.
