DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 1 Chairmans annual statement Dear Shareholder I present below the Companys remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2013.
During the year, the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the Regulations came into force.
The Regulations mean that we are required to set out a formal remuneration policy see section 2 below.
This policy must be approved by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM and if approved will remain in place for three years.
The Board must only operate in accordance with the policy, unless it seeks prior shareholder approval to amend the policy.
We are also required to put an ordinary resolution for the approval of the report on remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2013, set out at section 3 below.
The law requires the Companys auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated as such.
The auditors opinion is included in their report on pages 37 and 38.
Scope and responsibility As the Company has no employees and no executive directors, the policy relates only to the non-executive directors.
2 Policy on Directors fees The Boards policy is that the remuneration of Directors should be set at a reasonable level that is commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the role and consistent with the requirement to attract and retain Directors of the appropriate quality and experience.
It should also reflect the experience of the Board as a whole and be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts that are similar in size.
It is intended that this policy, if approved by the shareholders, will be implemented immediately after the AGM on 22 April 2014 and will remain in force until the AGM in 2017.
The Board has taken account of any views expressed by shareholders in formulating this policy.
Component Commentary Basic fee arrangement The directors currently receive fees for their services as follows: Chairman fee 28,500 Audit Committee chair 21,000 NED fee 19,000 These fees were agreed in 2012 and fees are determined within an aggregate limit set out in the Companys Articles of Association which currently stands at 125,000 per annum.
There is no separate Remuneration Committee and the Board as a whole considers changes to Directors fees from time to time.
The Company Secretary provides advice and comparative information when the Board considers the level of Directors fees.
If the Board concludes that it is appropriate to increase fees during the three year period that the policy is in force, such increase or increases will be limited to a maximum total increase of 20% of the amounts currently payable.
Any new directors will be paid at the rates set out above subject to any increase that may have been introduced in line with this policy.
Under the terms of the Directors appointment letters, there is no notice period and no provision for compensation upon early termination of appointment.
