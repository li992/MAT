Directors Remuneration Report Introduction from Remuneration Committee Chairman On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The objective of our remuneration policy is to retain and incentivise talented individuals to deliver sustained superior returns for our shareholders.
The Committee is responsible for the operation of an Annual Incentive Scheme AIS and a Share Appreciation Rights SAR Plan.
These are designed to measure our achievements and reward Directors accordingly.
We rigorously measure performance and are always mindful of shareholder expectation.
Above all, our remuneration policy must align executive reward with shareholder value creation.
With that objective in mind, the Committee initiated a review of the effectiveness of the AIS at the start of the year.
We asked our remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street, to work with the Committee to evaluate the components of the scheme.
In advance of a binding shareholder vote on remuneration policy, the Committee wanted to ensure the scheme was fully aligned with the Companys Corporate Objective, shareholders expectations and the Companys portfolio management approach.
In consultation with shareholders and as described in more detail below, we are recommending a small number of revisions to the AIS.
These comprise: An element of capital growth alongside the measure of relative performance: An appropriate equity index that accurately reflects our international portfolio for the measure of relative performance: and A reduction of the cap on the aggregate bonus pool.
These revisions, together with the closure of our private equity carry scheme to new investments, provide a remuneration structure which more clearly reflects our corporate objectives.
The Company continues to view long-term incentives as a critical way of aligning individual rewards with RITs longer term performance.
Hence, the SAR Plan remains an important part of our overall remuneration policy.
This remuneration report, in accordance with the new regulations governing disclosure and approval of remuneration, is in two parts: 1 a policy on Directors remuneration, subject to a binding shareholder resolution at the forthcoming AGM: 2 an annual report on remuneration which provides information on how the policy has been applied during the year: subject to an advisory vote at the AGM.
We believe that this remuneration report provides a clear explanation of the Committees policies and their alignment with shareholders interests.
As a result, we do hope that you will feel able to support the resolution submitted for the approval of the Directors Remuneration Policy at the AGM.
Douro 5 March 2014 Chairman, Remuneration Committee 32 Report and Accounts December 2013 RIT Capital Partners plc | Company Highlights | Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Other Information | Directors Remuneration Report Directors Remuneration Policy This part of the report sets out the remuneration policy for the Directors of the Company.
It has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 and the views of our major shareholders.
It has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
The policy will be put to a binding vote at the April 2014 AGM, and, if approved, will take effect from the date of the AGM for a maximum of three years.
The Committee determines, on behalf of the Board, the Groups policy on the remuneration of the Chairman and other senior executives.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Groups website.
In setting the remuneration policy the Committee takes into account: the need to attract, retain and motivate talented individuals: the alignment of remuneration policy with our Corporate Objective and the interests of our shareholders: best practice within the marketplace.
The remuneration of Executive Directors comprises the following: Element and purpose Operations, Performance Assessment and Clawback Maximum Payment Fixed Pay: Basic salary Reflects market value Basic salary is reviewed annually with any changes There is no prescribed of the individual, their effective on 1 January.

The Committee proposes to limit the cap to 0.5% of NAV and to retain discretion to increase it to the maximum of 0.75% of NAV if required to meet exceptional business needs.

participants in the SAR Plan are entitled to exercise their SARs and receive a payment in shares equal to the growth in value of the notional shares over the vesting period.
However, the exercise of a SAR is ordinarily subject to the participants continued service over the vesting period and whether the performance condition applying to the SAR is satisfied.
The Committee determines the metric for the SAR performance condition.
The current metric applied to the awards requires that the increase in the Companys total shareholder return TSR exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index plus three percentage points per annum over the three-year performance period.
In the event that the performance condition is met the award vests in full.
The performance condition was chosen as a good measure of above-inflation returns to shareholders and is subject to ongoing review by the Committee.
The SAR Plan uses ordinary shares of the Company to settle the share appreciation amount for existing and future awards granted under the SAR Plan.
The Group seeks to hedge its exposure under the SAR Plan by using an Employee Benefit Trust to acquire shares to meet the estimated future liability.
As noted on page 34, LTIP awards are subject to clawback.
While the binding vote on remuneration policy only applies to remuneration awarded to Directors, we normally apply the same principles to the remuneration of employees.
Eligibility for annual incentive payments based on investment performance, along with access to long term incentive components, is focused on the Executive Committee and those senior employees of JRCM who are able to influence the long-term performance and strategy of the Group.
The Remuneration Committee receives regular feedback on the Groups remuneration policy from staff.
Key Performance Indicators KPIs As we set out in our Strategic Report, we have established three KPIs which accurately reflect our Corporate Objective: 1.
Absolute Outperformance: NAV total return in excess of RPI plus 3% per annum: 2.
Relative Outperformance: NAV total return in excess of the ACWI: and 3.
These KPIs are incorporated into our incentive structure in the following way: Our first KPI is designed to measure the effectiveness of our aim to produce strong absolute returns with a meaningful premium above inflation, while preserving capital.
This will assess performance based on the growth in NAV above a hurdle and a high watermark.
RIT Capital Partners plc Report and Accounts December 2013 35 Directors Remuneration Report Payments under this component of the AIS will be made only on the portion of NAV growth measured on a total return basis, above a hurdle of RPI plus a 3 percentage point premium per annum and subject to a rolling threeyear high watermark.
The latter means that the NAV at the relevant year-end needs to have increased above the NAV three years earlier before any payment is possible.
As shareholders are aware, RIT does not invest with reference to a formal benchmark index.
Nonetheless, in common with many investment companies, we will apply the ACWI as our second performance measure within the AIS.
The ACWI has a broad geographical remit which accurately reflects our unconstrained investment policy.
In addition, we will use a blended index consisting of 50% of the ACWI measured in Sterling and 50% of the ACWI measured in local currencies: this is intended to ensure that currency movements do not unduly distort the performance outcome.
The third KPI, our TSR, is explicitly reflected in the performance condition for the SARs.
It is further reinforced through the use of deferred shares which will vest over three years as part of the AIS payments.
Consulting with shareholders The Committee engages pro-actively with major shareholders and shareholder representatives.
The Committee Chairman consulted with major shareholders and appropriate industry bodies on the proposed amendments to the AIS.
It has anticipated that any future changes to remuneration policy would involve a similar level of shareholder consultation.
Executive Shareholdings Executive Directors are expected to build and retain a substantial personal shareholding in the Companys shares.
As at 31 December 2013, these beneficial holdings represented a very significant multiple of base salary for Lord Rothschild.
External Non-Executive Directorships Where a directorship is accepted in furtherance of the Groups business, any fees received are remitted to the Group.
If the appointment is not connected to the Groups business, the Director is permitted to retain any fees received.
No other fees are paid to the Chairman in respect of external non-executive directorships.
Fees are received by the Chairman for advisory and other roles.
Executive Directors Service Contracts and loss of office Lord Rothschild has a service agreement with JRCM, dated 29 April 1996.
This can be terminated on not less than twelve months written notice.
It provides for benefits-in-kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
The agreement does not specify compensation payable in the event of early termination.
Contracts are available for inspection at the Companys registered office shown on page 110.
In appointing a new Executive Director, the Company would seek to impose a contract which required the Director to provide 12 months written notice.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, such as illness.
Approach to remuneration in the event of new Executive Director appointments In the event that the Company wished to appoint a new Executive Director, the remuneration package would be set in accordance with the terms of the Groups approved remuneration policy.
The variable remuneration for a new Executive Director would be determined following the same principles used to determine variable remuneration for existing Executive Directors.
The Committee may also offer additional cash and or share-based elements if it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and shareholders, to replace variable remuneration awards or arrangements that an individual has foregone in order to join the Company.
The Company may also consider meeting certain relocation expenses as appropriate.

Salaries and fees The Companys non-executive Directors fees totalled 296,139 for the year compared to 220,986 in the nine month financial period ended 31 December 2012.
Following the Committees review for the year ended 31 December 2013, the base salary of the Chairman has been set at 350,000 per annum period ended 31 December 2012: 448,640 per annum as discussed on page 42.
Bonus payments As described in more detail elsewhere in the annual report, RIT has performed well in 2013.
The Companys net assets are at an all-time high and total shareholder return has been pleasing.
This performance is reflected in the remuneration received by the Chairman in respect of 2013.
Annual bonus awards for the Chairman were determined by the Committee based on rigorous evaluation of Group and individual performance.
Following two consecutive periods in which no performance bonus was paid to the Chairman and recognising the planned changes to the AIS, the Committee carefully evaluated performance indicators and made discretionary awards proportionate to achievement in 2013.
The performance indicators for the year included: investment total return, leadership of the business and management of our relationship with shareholders.
The performance indicators are kept under constant review and appraisals are conducted annually to evaluate performance against appropriate metrics.
Over 2013, the following metrics were taken into account when determining payment: total return of 18.6%: approximately 300 million added to net assets: establishment and leadership of a settled senior management team and an enhancement of our relationship with shareholders.
The Chairman chose to waive any bonuses in cash and in the interests of alignment with RITs share price, the Chairmans bonus payment is deferred into shares of the Company vesting in equal tranches over a two year period.

Indirect beneficial interests may include shares held by trusts or settlements where more than one Director, or person s connected to such Directors, may be members of a class of beneficiaries.
In such instances, all shares held by the trust or settlement concerned are included in the total beneficial interests of the relevant Directors and will therefore be disclosed more than once.
Non-beneficial interests similarly may include shares held by entities where more than one Director has significant influence, for example as a Trustee.
In such instances all of the shares held by the entity concerned will be included in the non-beneficial interests of each of the relevant Directors and therefore will also be disclosed more than once.
The above disclosures include 6,910,666 shares held beneficially and 12,293,839 shares held non-beneficially in which both Lord Rothschild and Hannah Rothschild are interested either as trustees or beneficiaries of trusts or settlements.
Between the end of the year and the date of this Report, there were no changes in the Directors interests.
Requests from the Chairman for permission to deal in the ordinary shares of the Company are considered by the Board of Directors.
Requests from other Directors and employees of the Group are referred to the Chairman or Senior Independent Director, except in the case of small volume transactions requested by those other than Directors and JRCM executive management, which are considered by the Compliance Officer.
Except as stated in note 30 to the financial statements no Director has, or has had during the year under review, any beneficial interest in any contract or arrangement with the Company or any of its subsidiaries within the terms set out in the Listing Rules of the FCA.

This is calculated by reference to the Companys share price, including dividend reinvestment.
The Committee considers the ACWI to be the most suitable index for this purpose.
Further information can be found in the Companys Strategic Review.

As required by the legislation the total remuneration figure now includes the value of SAR awards which vested in each period even if these were not exercised.
This figure does not therefore represent cash payments made to the Chairman in the periods and will differ from previous disclosures.
As the Company applies a cap to the overall cost of incentives to the Group, rather than on an individual basis, disclosure showing each payment as a percentage of the maximum payment has not been shown.

RIT Capital Partners plc Report and Accounts December 2013 41 Directors Remuneration Report Reward scenarios The Groups policy means a significant portion of the remuneration received by Executive Directors is dependent on Group performance.
The chart below illustrates the minimum fixed remuneration, and provides an indication of the total remuneration for a year of good performance using the base salary effective 1 January 2014 as well as the annual bonus figure for the year ending 31 December 2013.
It also shows the weighting of the main remuneration components.
As the Groups policy is not to cap individual variable pay, a maximum total remuneration figure is not shown in the chart.
The overall cap for payments under the annual incentive scheme is 0.75% of net assets, reducing to 0.25% in circumstances where the Groups net assets have reduced.

This is to reflect his continued leadership of the Investment Committee and involvement in key investment decisions whilst, at the same time being less involved in the day-to-day administration of the Company.
