The Committee also takes account of the pay and conditions throughout the Company: to align, as far as possible, the interests of the senior executives with those of shareholders by providing a significant proportion of the Directors total remuneration potential through a balanced mix of short and long-term performance related elements that are consistent with the Groups business strategy: to enable executives to accumulate shareholdings in the Company over time that are personally meaningful to them: to ensure that incentive schemes are subject to appropriately stretching performance conditions and designed so as to be consistent with best practice: and to ensure that the Groups remuneration structure does not encourage management to adopt an unacceptable risk profile for the business.
The policy table below sets out the broad principles which will be applied when setting the individual remuneration packages of Directors.

Recruitment and promotion policy When facilitating an external recruitment or an internal promotion the Committee will apply the following principles: Remuneration element Policy Base salary Base salary levels will be set taking into account the individuals experience and skills, prevailing market rates in companies of comparable size and complexity and internal relativities.
Where appropriate the Committee may set the initial salary below this level e. g. if the individual has limited PLC board experience or is new to the role, with the intention to make phased pay increases over a number of years, which may be above those of the wider workforce, to achieve the desired market positioning.
These increases will be subject to continued development in the role.

The Committee may pay relevant relocation and legal expenses in order to facilitate a recruitment.
Pension A defined contribution or cash supplement at the level provided to current executive Directors.
Annual bonus The Committee would intend to operate the same annual bonus plan for all Directors, including the same maximum opportunity at 150% of salary, albeit pro-rated for the period of employment.
However, depending on the nature and timing of an appointment, the Committee reserves the right to set different performance measures, targets and weightings for the first bonus plan year if considered necessary.
Any bonus criteria in such circumstances would be disclosed in the following years annual report on remuneration.
Long-term incentives LTIP awards would be granted in line with the policy set out in the Policy table, with the possibility of an award being made after an appointment.
The maximum ongoing annual award would be limited to that of the current Chief Executive Officer.
For an internal hire, existing awards would continue over their original vesting period and remain subject to their terms as at the date of grant.
Buy-out awards Should it be the case that the Remuneration Committee considered it necessary to buy out incentive pay which an individual would forfeit on leaving their current employer, such compensation, where possible, would be structured so that the terms of the buy-out mirrored the form and structure of the remuneration being replaced e. g. vested share awards may be replaced with shares in Derwent London while recently granted long-term incentive awards may be replaced with a performance related LTIP award.
Where possible this will be accommodated under the Companys existing incentive plans, but it may be necessary to utilise the exemption under rule 9.4.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.

Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2013 103 REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED Performance share plan Half the awards granted in 2011 were subject to a relative TSR performance measure and half subject to a growth in net asset value.
The performance condition was complete or substantially complete at the year end and the Committee made the following assessment of vesting: % vesting Weighting Threshold Maximum Actual estimated Performance measure % of bonus Basis of calculation % % % vesting Growth in NAV 50 Relative to IPD Central 42.8 62.7 53.6 33.3 London Offices Total Return Index Total shareholder return TSR 50 TSR of major real 63.9 141.0 73.0 21.9 estate companies As required by the scheme rules, before allowing any vesting, the Committee considered whether the Groups TSR performance reflected its underlying financial performance.
Having considered a range of key financial indicators, including profits and NAV performance, the Committee concluded that, for the parts of the 2011 awards with measurement periods ending in 2013, this was the case.
Therefore, the vesting for each executive Director is estimated to be: Number of Value of award 1 awards on vesting vesting J. D. Burns 32,325 906,070 S. P. Silver 27,743 777,636 D. M. A.

Awards made during the year On 8 April 2013 the Committee made a PSP award to executive Directors on the following basis: % of face Basis of award Share price at Number of Face value value which granted date of grant shares of award vests at Type of award % of salary awarded threshold J.

Silverman Nil-cost option 150 21.20 25,250 535,300 25 If threshold performance is not achieved, none of the award will vest.
The weighted average exercise price of awards that either vested or lapsed in 2013 was nil 2012: nil.
The weighted average market price at the date of vesting in 2013 was 22.44 2012: 17.57.
For all awards granted under the PSP: half of the shares vest based on TSR performance relative to a comparator group of companies: and half of the shares vest based on NAV performance compared to properties in the IPD Central London Offices Total Return Index.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2013 105 REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED The Committee has discretion to reduce the extent of vesting in the event that it feels that performance against either measure of performance is inconsistent with underlying financial performance.
The TSR comparator group consists of a defined group of real estate companies.
The comparator group for 2013 comprises the following: Big Yellow Group plc, The British Land Company plc, Capital & Regional plc, Capital & Counties plc, Great Portland Estates plc, Hammerson plc, Intu Properties plc, Land Securities Group plc, Quintain Estates and Development plc, St Modwen Properties plc, Segro plc, Shaftesbury plc and Workspace Group plc.
25% of awards subject to the TSR target vest for median performance over the three-year performance period increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
If the Groups NAV performance matches that of the median performing property in the Index over the three-year performance period, 25% of awards subject to the NAV target vest.
Vesting increases on a sliding scale to full vesting for outperforming the median performing property by 5% per annum.
