MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 46 Directors remuneration report General remuneration principles The Committee is responsible for formulating remuneration policies and principles that promote the success of the group in creating value for shareholders over the longer term, are aligned to the corporate objectives and business strategy and take into full account the associated risks.
The Committee understands that it is accountable to shareholders for the decisions made on Executive remuneration and seeks to maintain an open and constructive dialogue where changes to remuneration policy are being proposed.
The remuneration policy for the Companys Executive Directors and other group senior executives is shaped by the requirement to align the interests and individual performance of the senior executive team with those of MITIEs shareholders.
The policy has particular regard to the Companys and the groups long-standing culture of encouraging equity ownership in order to achieve this alignment.
The Committee, and the Board, continue to believe that the principle of equity incentivisation has been a key driving force in the past success of the group.
Consequently, in order to maintain and further develop MITIEs performance culture, the Committee believes that the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors should continue to contain significant performance-related equity-based elements.
The Committee continues to believe that exceptional performance should be matched with appropriate remuneration to attract, retain and motivate Directors and management and ensures that packages are linked to and support the long-term performance of the Company.
Remuneration policy The remuneration policy of the Company promotes and embeds the Companys remuneration principles.
The Companys policy is: Group performance determines a significant element of the Executive remuneration Performance linked packages.
Only top-end performance can achieve the stretching targets that are reflected in the performance-linked pay elements of the packages.
The discretionary share schemes are based on EPS growth to align the interests of the Shareholder aligned Senior Executive team with those of shareholders.
Bonuses are structured to reward the attainment of the strategic target of long-term sustainable, profitable growth.
Comprehensive and simple The overall remuneration policy is comprehensive without becoming overcomplicated and encourages Executives to concentrate on growth.
The Committee believes, and is satisfied that, the remuneration policy is appropriate and takes account of the groups performance and strategic objectives.
It will therefore continue to use this policy as a framework for setting future packages, whilst having due regard for the remuneration packages offered across the group and the external market.
Share ownership policy The Company operates a share ownership policy to encourage the build-up of equity in the Company by both its Executive Directors and senior executives.
Under this policy, all Executive Directors are required, over time, to build and maintain a target shareholding in the Company worth 150% of salary.
The Committee recognises that the principal mechanism for building up this holding will be on the exercise of vested LTIP awards and accordingly, until such time as the shareholding requirement is met, Executive Directors will be expected to retain no fewer than 50% of shares net of taxes that vest under the LTIP.
On the 1 May each year, the Committee reviews the expected target holding for the Executive Directors, calculated as a percentage of salary.

MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Marketplace Strategy and and sustainable Overview performance operations Finance Governance Accounts 47 The key elements of Executive Director remuneration The overall package for Executive Directors consists of a fixed element salary and benefits and variable performancerelated elements annual performance-related bonus and long-term equity-based incentives and has been structured to align the Executive Directors packages with the interests of shareholders.
The Committee tests the remuneration structure regularly to ensure that it remains aligned with business needs and is appropriately positioned relative to the market.
The Committee considers the key elements in total to ensure there is the right balance between reward for short-term success and long-term growth.
For Executive Directors, this can be summarised below: Remuneration Element Policy and link to strategy Operation in 2013 Base Salary Base salary is set in a total remuneration Reviewed annually with any increase normally context against comparable roles within FTSE awarded from 1 April.
Other factors considered include: market conditions, the responsibilities and skills of the individual Executive Directors and the level of salary increases across the organisation as a whole.

The annual bonus rewards mainly shortExecutive Directors 135% of salary term group performance but also has a link to The bonus is split between achievement of budgeted longer-term performance through to the profit growth and non-financial strategic objectives.
A inclusion of strategic targets and partial delivery sliding scale is applied to the financial target: paying in MITIE Group PLC shares.
In setting the nonout between 90% and 110% of salary at threshold and financial strategic targets, the Committee has exceptional financial performance respectively.
The due consideration of the longer-term success remaining percentage of salary awarded is assessed of the group and the alignment of interests with on a series of non-financial strategic targets.

Where EPS growth is less than a lower performance threshold no awards will vest.
Awards vest in full when EPS growth is equal to, or more than, an upper performance threshold.
Vesting is on a straight-line basis for performance between these levels.
MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 48 Directors remuneration report How it was implemented Base salary and other benefits The Executive Directors received salary increases in April 2012 which averaged 3% and took account of the range of factors described above, the continued growth and performance of the group and the performance of the individual Executive Directors, with due consideration of the outcomes of the benchmarking exercise.
For the current year, the Remuneration Committee did not award pay increases for the Executive Directors.
For the Chief Executive, the Remuneration Committee considered an increase given her current pay positioning versus the market: however, the Chief Executive requested that the increase be waived.
Annual bonus For the 2012 2013 performance year, the Chief Executive had an opportunity to earn a maximum bonus of 160% of salary: Executive Directors had the opportunity to earn up to 135% of salary.
Any bonus earned above 100% of salary is deferred into MITIE Group PLC shares for two years and forfeited should the Director leave the business during this period.
For the year under review, performance was assessed against a financial target weighted at 90% to 110% of salary and a set of strategic objectives weighted at 50% of salary for the Chief Executive and 25% of salary for the remaining Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee assessed performance against the two elements as follows: Performance delivered against the financial target resulted in a pay-out of 95.4% of salary.
The Remuneration Committee assessed performance delivered against strategic objectives and concluded that these had been substantially achieved.
This resulted in pay-outs of 40% of salary for the Chief Executive and 20% of salary for the Executive Directors.
No changes to plan design are planned for the 2013 14 financial year.
Long-term incentives Vesting of share awards under the LTIP is based on performance measured over three years which is considered appropriate to align rewards to Executive Directors with the strategic objectives of the Company.
Certain Executive Directors still retain options granted under the ESOS details of the holdings are set out in Table 7 of Section B.
It is the intention of the Committee not to issue further ESOS options to Executive Directors, although ESOS continues to be used to reward and incentivise certain other members of the senior executive and management teams.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance conditions on an annual basis to ensure that the performance targets continue to be relevant to long-term business success.
In considering the 2012 award grant, the Committee reviewed the underlying EPS performance condition and following a consultation with shareholders, approved a revised range taking into consideration factors such as the economic environment, market forecasts and changes to group strategy.
Accordingly, for LTIP awards granted in 2012, the lower performance threshold at which 25% of an award vests is 5% per annum and the upper performance threshold for 100% vesting is 10% per annum.
Awards to all Executive Directors during the year were 200% of salary.
During the year the Committee assessed the outcome of the 2009 LTIP awards against the vesting schedule.
In its assessment, the Committee took into account the companys underlying earnings growth and the significant increase in UK RPI relative to the expectations at the start of the performance period.
The Committee is currently reviewing the performance criteria for 2013 LTIP awards.
Any significant changes will be discussed with major shareholders in advance and disclosed in next years report.
Details of Executive Directors participation in the groups share schemes are set out on pages 53 to 55.

MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 50 Directors remuneration report Employee share schemes MITIE remains committed to fostering a culture of employee involvement in the business through equity participation whereby employees are enabled to build a stake in the Company through the groups various equity-based incentive schemes.
The Board believes that the groups culture of employee equity involvement is a significant driver in the groups growth performance and that this assists in attracting and retaining skilled and committed employees.
Equity-based incentive schemes The group currently operates six equity-based incentive schemes as set out below and the interests of the Executive Directors in each of these schemes are set out in Tables 5 to 9 of Section B.
2001 SAYE Scheme 2001 SAYE and 2011 SAYE Scheme 2011 SAYE The 2001 and the 2011 SAYE Schemes are the Companys non-discretionary option schemes open to all eligible employees and approved for HMRC purposes.
Salary deductions are made and savings are used to purchase the options at the end of the three-year period.
No options have been issued to any Directors under the 2001 SAYE Scheme.
The 2001 SAYE expired in September 2011 and future awards may only be granted under the 2011 SAYE rules following the adoption of new plan rules at the Companys 2011 AGM.
Executive Directors participated for the first time this year in the 2011 SAYE, contributing the maximum permitted under the plan rules.
Details are set out in Table 5 of Section B.
2011 Share Incentive Plan 2011 SIP At the 2011 AGM shareholders approved the adoption of the 2011 SIP which allows employees to use their salary to purchase shares in the Company.
Eligible employees are offered the opportunity to buy Company shares from pre-tax earnings as part of a regular share purchase plan.
Shares are currently purchased monthly using employees deductions and are placed in trust.
All the Executive Directors participate in this scheme with each Director contributing the maximum permitted under the plan rules for which details are set out in Table 6 of Section B.
2001 Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 ESOS and 2011 Executive Share Option Scheme 2011 ESOS New 2011 ESOS Plan rules were adopted by shareholders at the 2011 AGM.
The 2001 and 2011 ESOS are discretionary schemes and therefore not open to all employees of the group.
The award of options under the 2011 ESOS is focused on employees who are below main Board level and who do not participate in the LTIP.
Currently, the 2011 ESOS is used to retain, reward and motivate employees with continuous service of six months who form part of the groups management team includes senior managers, managers and team leaders.
The scheme has been approved by HMRC and options over shares to an individual limit of 30,000 can be awarded in the approved element of the scheme.
Above 30,000, options are awarded under the unapproved for HMRC purposes section of the scheme.
Overall, awards in any single year are limited to 100% of an individuals salary.
Awards made prior to 2011 were granted with a single performance threshold for vesting of average growth in earnings per share over the threeyear vesting period in excess of inflation measured as RPI plus 4% per annum.
In order to ensure a consistent and aligned approach to performance criteria across other MITIE schemes, for awards granted in 2011, the Committee approved a performance threshold based on a nominal EPS measure.
Accordingly, 2011 awards were granted with a performance measure of 6% per annum compound growth over a three-year performance period.
The scheme permits the grant of share appreciation rights and the settlement of outstanding unapproved options with share appreciation rights.
The Board continues to believe that the ESOS offers incentive and motivation to those employees nominated for awards and proposes to continue with awards on the basis explained above.
The share options detailed in Table 7 of Section B were granted to Executive Directors prior to 2007 under the 2001 ESOS and the performance conditions that applied at the date of grant required a percentage growth in the groups earnings per share equal to or in excess of 10% per annum compound over the period from the date of grant of the option to the date on which the option first became exercisable.
The performance conditions relating to the awards to Directors detailed on page 53 are the same as for any other member of the schemes who received awards at the same time.
Since these grants to Ruby McGregor-Smith and Suzanne Baxter there have been no grants to Directors under the 2001 or 2011 ESOS both under the unapproved part and the HMRC-approved part and it is the Committees current policy that equity-based incentives for Directors will be based solely upon LTIP awards.
MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Marketplace Strategy and and sustainable Overview performance operations Finance Governance Accounts 51 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a discretionary scheme focused on incentivising Executive Directors and senior management.
Awards under the LTIP may be made, either through a joint-ownership structure or through direct grants in the form of nil-cost options, conditional shares or forfeitable shares.
The Committee may also decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy share-based awards in cash, although it does not currently intend to do so.
No payment other than in respect of any individual recipient electing to pay income tax and national insurance, where appropriate is required for the grant of an award.
Awards are not transferable, except on death, and are not pensionable.
The scheme rules, in line with standard industry practice, contain provision for pro-rata vesting in the event of retirement, redundancy, disability and or death.
In the event of a change of control of the group, awards will be pro-rated both for time and performance, subject to the discretion of the Committee.
See section under Shares on page 47 for details of the performance condition for the LTIP.
Table 8 of Section B provides details of the LTIP awards granted to, and exercised by, the Executive Directors, as well as the performance targets governing the vesting of LTIP awards granted in prior years.
Share dilution The Company manages dilution rates within the ABI guidelines of 10% of issued Ordinary share capital in respect of all employee schemes ESOS and SAYE and 5% in respect of discretionary schemes ESOS.
In calculating compliance with these guidelines the Company allocates available headroom on a ten-year flat-line basis, making adjustments for projected lapse rates and projected increases in issued share capital.
LTIP awards are satisfied through the market purchase of shares held by the MITIE Group PLC Employee Benefit Trust 2007 and the MITIE Group PLC Employee Benefit Trust 2008.
The potential dilution of the Companys issued share capital is set out below in respect of all outstanding awards granted under the Companys equity-based incentive schemes which are to be satisfied through the allotment of new shares.
Table 4: Share dilution at 31 March 2013 Dilution % All share plan maximum 10% 7.4% Discretionary share plans maximum 5% 4.4% Total shareholder return The graph below shows the total shareholder return performance of MITIE shares compared with the FTSE 250 and FTSE 350 Support Services indices over a five-year period to 31 March 2013.
The Committee is of the opinion that these comparators provide a clear picture of the performance of MITIE relative to a range of companies of comparable size as well as a specific group of companies within the same sector.
Total shareholder return is calculated according to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and assumes that all dividends are reinvested.
The market price of the Companys shares as at 28 March 2013 was 280.8p.
