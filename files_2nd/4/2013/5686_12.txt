It is the groups policy to construct executive remuneration packages such that a significant part of a directors compensation is based on the growth in the groups profits contributed by that director.
Salaries and benefits are generally not intended to be the most significant part of a directors remuneration.
In formulating its directors remuneration policy, the group has considered employee pay and benefits available across the group and did not consider it necessary to consult with its employees.

It encourages each director to grow their businesses, to invest in new products, to search for acquisitions, and to manage costs and risks tightly: Profit shares are designed to maximise profits with no guaranteed floor and no ceiling for profit share: Profit shares are expected to make up much of the directors total pay and encourage long-term retention.
Operation Profit shares are paid in full in the financial year following the year in which they are earned.
In exceptional circumstances profit shares may be paid in part during the year in which they are earned but only to the extent that profits have already been generated: There is no deferral of profit share: There is no guaranteed floor or ceiling on profit shares earned: Profit shares are calculated after charging the cost of funding acquisitions at the groups actual cost of funds: Each directors profit share is subject to remuneration committee approval, and can be revised at any time if the directors responsibilities are changed: The profit share of PR Ensor executive chairman is based on the adjusted pre-tax post non-controlling interests profit of the group, thereby matching his profit share with the pre-tax return the group generates for its shareholders.
The profit share is calculated by applying a multiplier to the adjusted pre-tax profits.
The multiplier is adjusted for the dilution arising from increases in the companys share capital.
PR Ensor is also entitled to a percentage of adjusted pre-tax profit in excess of a threshold.
This threshold increases by 5% each year.
This multiplier is also adjusted for any dilution arising from the issue of new equity: The profit share of CHC Fordham managing director is linked to the growth in the groups adjusted pre-tax earnings per share EPS, from a base pre-tax EPS that increases at 5% per year: NF Osborn receives a profit-share linked to the operating profits of the businesses he manages at fixed rates on profits above various thresholds: DC Cohen receives a profit-share linked to the operating profits of the businesses he manages at fixed rates on profits above various thresholds: CR Jones finance director receives a profit share linked to the adjusted pre-tax EPS of the group.
A fixed sum is payable for every percentage point the adjusted pre-tax EPS is above a threshold and an additional fixed sum is payable for every percentage point that the adjusted pre-tax EPS is above a second higher threshold: fide Alfano receives a profit-share linked to the operating profits of the businesses she manages at fixed rates on profits above various thresholds.
She also receives a profit share on acquisitions she manages at a fixed rate: JL Wilkinson receives a profit-share linked to the operating profits of the businesses she manages at the rate of 5% of adjusted profits above a threshold that is adjusted for titles sold, closed or acquired in line with the groups US investment in digital strategy.
As group marketing director, she receives an incentive based on the growth in the groups subscription and delegate revenues above certain thresholds.
These thresholds are based on a rolling three year average of the respective revenue streams: B AL-Rehany receives a profit-share linked to the operating profits of the businesses he manages at a fixed rate on profits above a threshold.
This threshold increases each year.

com Directors Remuneration Report continued Remuneration policy report continued Non-executive directors The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the board based on the time commitment required by the non-executive, their role, and market conditions.
Each non-executive director receives a base fee for services to the board with an additional fee payable to the chairs of the remuneration and audit committees.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the companys incentive schemes.
Policy on external appointments The company encourages its executive directors to take a limited number of outside directorships provided they are not expected to impinge on their principal employment.
Subject to the approval of the chairman, directors may retain the remuneration received from the first such appointment.
Recruitment policy Compensation packages for new board directors are set on the same basis as those in place for existing board directors.
The main components are detailed below.
Executive directors will receive a salary commensurate with their responsibilities, likely to be below market average and not the most significant part of the directors overall remuneration package.
Directors salaries are reviewed every year by the committee.
The directors will also be invited to receive non-cash benefits in the form of private healthcare.
Other benefits may include a relocation or housing allowance and, in exceptional circumstances, compensation for loss of earnings from their previous employment which have been forfeited in order to join the company.
Where these exceptional circumstances apply the remuneration committee would try to match closely the compensation type foregone with that offered by the company.
New executive directors are expected to be paid a profit share directly linked to the growth in profits of the business units they manage.
There will be no floor or ceiling to the profit share.
Profit share thresholds and the specific arrangements will be agreed with the remuneration committee.
The standard profit share arrangement pays 5% of the operating profits in excess of a threshold, which is normally set at the level of profits achieved in the 12 months prior to joining the company.
In some exceptional cases there may be an additional incentive paid to a director in the event of the director turning around a non-performing business.
The quantum of this incentive will be dependent on the time frame taken to turn the business around and the initial level of losses.
Non-executive directors appointed to the board will receive a base fee in line with that payable to other non-executive directors see above.
Policy on payment for loss of office Executive directors are generally employed on 12 month rolling contracts with a 12 month notice period.
Non-executive directors contracts can be terminated by the company giving summary notice, with the exception of Sir Patrick Sergeant who has a 12 month notice period.
In the event of a termination of contract, executive directors are entitled to 12 months salary, pension and a pro-rated profit share up to the date of termination.
Executive directors are not entitled to any payment from the groups CAP and other option schemes unless the schemes vest within the directors notice period, in which case the director is only entitled to the options vesting at that time.
No other termination payments are provided unless otherwise required by law.
22706.04 13 December 2013 6:27 PM Proof 6 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 57 57 Directors service contracts The companys policy is to employ executive directors on 12 month rolling service contracts.
The remuneration committee seeks to minimise termination payments and believes these should be restricted to the value of remuneration for the notice period.
Directors service contracts are reviewed from time to time and updated where necessary.

The salaries and fees figure for JL Wilkinson includes 88,332 of housing allowance.

The long-term incentive figure represents the value of the CAP 2004 share options, CAP 2010 share options, CAP CSOP share options and the CAP cash award where the performance conditions were met during the period.
The value of these share options is derived by multiplying the number of share options with the market value of options and deducting the cost of the options.
The value of the CAP cash award is equivalent to the cash received.
Pension amounts are those contributed by the company to pension schemes or cash amounts paid in lieu of pension contributions.

It is also compared with the change in remuneration of all other employees across the group.
The directors feel that this group of people is the most appropriate as a comparator because employees pay is determined annually by the remuneration committee at the same time as that of the managing director and under the same economic circumstances.
The directors believe this demonstrates the best link between the increase in average remuneration compared to the managing director.

The remuneration of the managing director fell by 78.7% this year.
This reflects CHC Fordhams appointment as managing director and PR Ensors appointment as chairman under the management succession plan implemented in October 2012.
The majority of Mr Ensors remuneration was profit share which was calculated from a low base threshold set in 1978 when the company was in its infancy.
This profit share was in lieu of equity at the time.
As the groups profit has grown significantly from this date, so Mr Ensors remuneration has grown with it.
Mr Fordhams remuneration was structured to include a higher proportion from his salary and his profit share threshold was based on the profits achieved in 2012.

Benefits will also be reviewed during the year although it is not anticipated that any significant changes will be made other than possibly the provision of a UK or group wide life assurance scheme.
The profit share arrangement for each director will be as described on page 54.
Profit share thresholds are subject to review during the year.
Changes to thresholds are made only where considered appropriate by the remuneration committee, taking into account the businesses that the respective director is responsible for and any acquisitions and disposals, as well, where applicable, the other factors stated in the groups policy.
