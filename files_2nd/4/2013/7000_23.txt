Our goal is to build a strong long-term business by delivering ongoing sales growth and sustainable shareholder returns through the delivery of authoritative ranges of products, colleague and service excellence, digital participation and helpful store environments.
Consequently, the overall remuneration policy of the Committee, and of the Board, is to provide remuneration packages for Executive Directors and other senior managers in the Group which: Attract and retain Enable the Group to attract and retain management of the right calibre with the necessary financial, retail, customer service, and digital skill sets required to deliver a sustainable business model and drive shareholder returns.
Remuneration arrangements are set at levels which are appropriate to achieve this goal without paying more than is necessary.
Benchmarking exercises are undertaken at appropriate intervals to inform the position of executives pay relative to the market, and without seeking to match the median to identify and mitigate the risk of losing strong performers.
Variable pay linked to the delivery of the strategy Provide management with the opportunity to earn competitive remuneration through annual and long-term variable-based pay arrangements that are designed to support delivery against key strategic objectives.
Performance measures are aligned with strategic goals so that remuneration arrangements are transparent to Executives, shareholders and other stakeholders.
Different elements of executive pay are delivered over the short and longer terms and are designed to ensure that a substantial proportion of the Executives remuneration is variable and performance-related.
Executives as shareholders Align managements interests with those of shareholders by incentivising management to deliver the Groups long-term strategy of a sustainable, growing business and thus enhance shareholder value.
A significant portion of reward is delivered in shares to create alignment of interests.

com Annual Report & Accounts 2013 86 Directors Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Policy for New Hires When hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee will seek to align the remuneration package with the above policy.
However, to ensure that the right calibre of individual is appointed to the Board the Committee retains discretion to make remuneration proposals that are outside this standard policy where it considers it is necessary to do so.
In determining the appropriate arrangements the Committee may look to benchmark the role and remuneration against its peer group and may also take into account other relevant factors such as the remuneration levels of other Executive Directors and the type of remuneration being offered.
The Committee may also make arrangements to compensate the new Executive for loss of existing remuneration benefits when leaving a previous employer.
In doing so the Committee may take account of the form in which they were granted, the relevant performance conditions and the length of the time that the performance periods have to run.
Remuneration Arrangements in Different Performance Scenarios As outlined above, the remuneration policy is designed to ensure that a substantial proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration is variable and performance-related.
By linking the remuneration of the individual Executive Director to the performance of the Company, the Board seeks, as far as possible, to motivate that individual towards superior business performance and shareholder value creation, and to only pay rewards when these goals have been realised.
Performance measures are aligned with strategic goals so that remuneration arrangements are transparent to Directors, shareholders and other stakeholders.
The charts below illustrate remuneration arrangements in different performance scenarios.

com Annual Report & Accounts 2013 87 Share Arrangements in Place The Company had adopted three share plans: The Halfords Sharesave Scheme: the Halfords Company Share Option Scheme CSOS, a market value share option plan: and the Halfords Performance Share Plan PSP.
In 2012 the Company also made the new CEO a one-off Co-Investment Share Award.
This was made under Listing Rule 9.4.
2, where the long-term incentive scheme arrangements are for an individual whose appointment as a director is being contemplated and the arrangement is established specifically to facilitate, in unusual circumstances the recruitment and retention of the relevant individual.
It is currently not intended that further Co-Investment Share Awards will be made.
While committed to the use of equity-based performance-related remuneration as a means of aligning Directors interests with those of shareholders, the Committee is aware of shareholders concerns on dilution through the issue of new shares to satisfy such awards.
Therefore, when reviewing remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into account the effects such arrangements may have on dilution.
Halfords intends to comply with the ABI guidelines relating to the issue of new shares for equity incentive plans.
The current 10 year shareholder dilution is 3.34%.

com Annual Report & Accounts 2013 88 Directors Remuneration Report continued Executive Directors Service Agreements Term The Companys policy in relation to contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, is that they should be fair to the individual, the Company and shareholders.
Failure should not be rewarded and the departing Executives duty to mitigate loss should be fully recognised.
The Committee periodically reviews the Groups policy on the duration of Directors service agreements, and the notice periods and termination provisions contained in those agreements.
The Company is aware that companies are encouraged to consider notice periods of less than 12 months, and in contracting with the new CEO it was agreed that a notice period of six months was appropriate.
The notice periods of the other Executive Directors remain limited to 12 months.
The Committee will continue to review this policy, to ensure that it is more in line with the Companys overall remuneration policy.
Date of Service Agreement Notice Period Matthew Davies 4 October 2012 6 months 1 Andrew Findlay 16 November 2010 12 months 2 Paul McClenaghan 9 May 2005 12 months 1 Andrew Findlay was appointed to the Board on 1 February 2011 and his service agreement was effective from that date.
2 Paul McClenaghan resigned on 12 April 2013.
Early Termination of contract No compensation would be payable if a service contract were to be terminated by notice from an Executive Director or for lawful early termination by the Company.
The Company may terminate any of the above service agreements in accordance with the appropriate notice periods.
In the event of early termination other than for a reason justifying summary termination in accordance with the terms of the service agreement the Company may but is not obliged to pay to the Executive Director, in lieu of notice, a sum equal to the annual value six months for the CEO of the Executive Directors then salary, benefits and pension contributions, which he would have received during the contractual notice period, the sum of which shall be payable in 12 monthly instalments six for the CEO.
In respect of any bonus entitlement earned during a financial period prior to termination of employment this will be calculated by the Remuneration Committee, if the Director is deemed by the Committee to be a Good Leaver, on a pro rata basis by reference to their period of service in the financial period in which their employment is terminated.
If the Directors employment is terminated in circumstances that the Committee reasonably believes that they cannot be designated a Good Leaver the Director shall forfeit any entitlement to a bonus payment.
Mitigation in Termination In such instances the Executive Director shall use their best endeavours to secure an alternative source of remuneration, thus mitigating any loss to the Company, and shall provide the Board with evidence of such endeavours upon their reasonable request.
If the Director fails to provide such evidence the Board may cease all further payments of compensation.
To the extent that the Executive Director receives any sums as a result of alternative employment or provision of services while he is receiving such payments from the Company, the payments shall be reduced by the amount of such sums.
In Good Leaver circumstances the Executive Director might be offered a lump sum termination payment paid at the time they cease employment which in all cases will be less than he would receive if he were to be paid his annual salary over 12 months six months for the CEO.
Change of Control The service agreements of Executive Directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the Company.
com Annual Report & Accounts 2013 89 Loss of Office Payments The Companys policy towards exit payments is that under no circumstances will they exceed the contractual obligations afforded to the Executive Director and contained within their contract of employment.
There are a number of ways in which an Executive Director can leave the business and each circumstance is dealt with differently in respect of how exit payments are calculated.
Share plans leaver treatment The treatment of outstanding share awards in the event that an Executive Director leaves is governed by the relevant share plan rules.

There are no provisions for compensation being payable upon early termination of the appointment of a Non-Executive Director.
com Annual Report & Accounts 2013 91 Outside Appointments Halfords recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive Directors of other companies.
Such non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge which can benefit Halfords.
Subject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are allowed to accept non-executive appointments and retain the fees received, provided that these appointments are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest.
David Wild is a Non-Executive of Premier Foods plc and between 31 March 2012 and 19 July 2012 received fees of 17,161 and Matt Davies is a NonExecutive Director of Dunelm Group plc and between 4 October 2012 and 29 March 2012 received fees of 15,000.
Remuneration Arrangements elsewhere in the Group The remuneration policy for executive managers in the Group is similar to the policy for Executive Directors as set out in this report a substantial proportion of remuneration is performance related in order to encourage and reward superior business performance and shareholder returns and remuneration is linked to both individual and Company performance.
Basic salary is targeted at normal commercial rates for comparable roles and is benchmarked at appropriate intervals.
Bonuses of up to 100% of salary can be earned on the same basis as the Executive Directors.
Senior Executives immediately below the Board also benefit from participation in the PSP.
Increases to Executive managers base salaries are considered at the same time as all other colleagues across the Group and other than benchmarking increases to ensure that the Group is attracting and retaining the right calibre of executive, increases are in line with all colleagues.
Increases have been as follows October 2012: 1.8% Executive Directors: Nil, April 2012: 2% Executive Directors: 2%.
All of the Groups c. 12,000 colleagues are eligible to join the Halfords Sharesave Plan SAYE after they have served one complete months service.
At the same time they are all eligible for some form of quarterly or full year bonus, although the type, limits and performance conditions vary according to job level.
Senior managers and other key management individuals are invited to join the Company Share Option Scheme.
In 2012 13 all newly appointed colleagues and other existing colleagues who had experienced a joining-trigger event were eligible to join the Halfords Pension Plan 2009.
All members of the Pension Plan are required to make a minimum contribution of 3% and the Company also contributes a minimum of 3%, dependent on length of service and seniority.
The Company has also made plans to auto enrol all other colleagues as appropriate.
Dialogue with Shareholders The views of our shareholders are very important to the Committee and it is our policy to consult with our largest shareholders in advance of making any material changes to the executive remuneration arrangements.
The Committee is currently consulting with major shareholders regarding the proposed changes to the PSP performance conditions.
com Annual Report & Accounts 2013 92 Directors Remuneration Report continued How the remuneration policy will be implemented for 2013 14 Base salary Base salaries were last reviewed with effect from 1 October 2012 when no increases were awarded to Executive Directors.
Current salaries are as follows: CEO 500,000 Finance Director 280,500 In reviewing Executive Directors responsibilities the Committee determined that the Groups Finance Director, Andrew Findlay, had assumed Board responsibility for a number of areas of the business, most importantly that of IT.
This was considered by the Board to be a vital role in the delivery of the Companys Getting Into Gear 2016 programme and as such the Committee considered it appropriate that Andrew receive an increased salary from 1 October 2013 of 325,000.
Annual bonus The annual bonus opportunity for 2013 14 will remain unchanged as follows: CEO Maximum opportunity of 150% of base salary two-thirds paid in cash one-third paid in Halfords shares deferred for three years Finance Director Maximum opportunity of 100% of base salary Paid in cash The annual bonus for 2013 14 will continue to be based 75% on Profit Before Tax PBT performance and 25% based on performance against strategic objectives.
PBT targets range from 92% of budget, where payment is zero, to 106% of budget for maximum payment.
The Committee reviews the goals included in the strategic objectives portion of the bonus to ensure that remains appropriate.
For 2013 14 the Committee determined that the strategic objectives should be linked to the delivery of the Companys long-term strategic goal is to deliver growth in top line revenues.
The Executive Team have considered the Getting Into Gear 2016 programme discussed on pages 29 to 32 and 34 to 35 and have identified measures that will determine the successful delivery of each initiative and these also represent the strategic non-financial KPIs that will form part of the Executive Teams 2013 14 annual bonus plan.

In determining whether any bonuses are payable the Committee retains the discretionary authority to increase or decrease the bonus to ensure that the level of bonus paid is appropriate in the context of performance.

Our strategic focus is on putting in place the foundations to deliver a sustainable business in the future, focusing on an authoritative range of products, colleague and service excellence, digital participation and helpful store environments with the ultimate goal of delivering profitable top line revenue growth and therefore creating shareholder value.
As a consequence during the year the Committee reviewed the performance measures used for the PSP and determined that Total Shareholder Return and Earnings Per Share were no longer the most suitable mechanisms for measuring and incentivising the successful delivery of this strategy.
Core awards made under the PSP will continue to be 150% of base salary with the opportunity to earn up to 1.5x this level if exceptional performance is achieved.
The Committee is currently consulting with shareholders regarding these proposed changes and details will be provided in a Stock Exchange announcement when finalised and in next years report.

com Annual Report & Accounts 2013 94 Directors Remuneration Report continued Salary and Benefits The last Group-wide salary review was undertaken in October 2011 which took into account remuneration trends, candidate quality and job location in markets in which the Group had recently recruited.
With respect to the Executives, the salary review also considered executive remuneration market trends and benchmarking.
Salary increases not exceeding 2% were made to all Group colleagues, including some Executive Directors in April 2012 following no increases in the previous 12 months.
In October 2012 the Group reverted to the normal review timing and further increases of 1.8% were made to Group colleagues: however, Executive Directors were excluded from this round of increases.
Annual Bonus for 2012 13 Annual Bonus for 2012 13 for the Finance Director and Commercial Directors was based 75% on Group PBT and 25% on key strategic projects.
These key projects included delivering an increase in the Companys Fitting proposition: increasing the range of parts, accessories and clothing on offer in the Companys Cycling category: the development of new store formats: driving the Autocentres business: and improving both Colleague and Customer engagement with the Halfords brand.
Annual Bonuses reported in the above table and payable in May 2013 for the financial period ended 29 March 2013 were calculated as follows.

On appointment, the Committee agreed that the CEO should participate in an annual bonus for his period from appointment on 4 October 2012 to the end of the financial year, 29 March 2013.
His maximum bonus opportunity for this period was set at 50% of this normal maximum i. e. 75% of his full year base salary, with two-thirds paid in cash and one-third deferred into shares for a period of three years.
Fifty per cent of the bonus was based on PBT performance and 50% was based on the delivery of key personal performance objectives which were considered by the Committee to be key objectives for the initial period of his tenure.
These included reviewing and formulating a new strategy, undertaking a review of the executive committee organisational capability and improving employee engagement.
The Committee reviewed the achievement of the new CEOs bonus targets and concluded that he had met all of the personal performance objectives set on his appointment in October 2012.
The key objectives included: a review of the business and the formulation of a new strategy: a review of the organisational capability of the business: the creation of a new executive management team: and, a positive movement in the Colleague Engagement score which increased from 64% to 77%.
Although the Group achieved profits in line with the guidance that was indicated to the market after the new CEOs appointment, it was considered by the Committee that, given the profit performance of the Group relative to original budget and initial market guidance, no award for the profit element of his bonus be made.
Thus 50% of the available pro rata bonus was payable, of which one-third would be deferred into shares.
The Committee reviewed the annual bonus payout in the context of the performance of the underlying business during the year and the delivery against strategy and determined that the level of bonus paid was appropriate in this context.

Pension Pension payments represent contributions made either to defined contribution pension schemes or personal funds, the purpose of which is to provide additional benefits, made by the Group during the period to 29 March 2013 in respect of qualifying services of the Executive Directors.

However, to ensure that the PSP continued to support sustainable performance, the multiplier for one measure is only applied if performance is at least at the threshold level for the other measure.
The companies included in the TSR comparator group for awards granted in 2010 are as follows: Brown Group: Carpetright: Carphone Warehouse: Debenhams: Dignity: Dixons Retail plc formerly DSG International : Dunelm Group: Game Group fide-listed on 3 April 2012 : Greggs: Home Retail Group: JD Sports Fashion plc: Darty formerly Kesa Electricals : Kingfisher International: Marks & Spencer Group: Morrison WM : Mothercare: Next: Sainsbury J : Sports Direct: Tesco: WH Smith.
Based on TSR performance between 27 March 2010 and 29 March 2013, Halfords was ranked 16th against the comparator group and therefore no portion of the TSR element of the award will vest.
EPS growth between FY10 and FY13 was below that of RPI over the same period and therefore no portion of the EPS element of the award will vest.
The 2010 PSP award will therefore lapse in full in August 2013.
Outstanding PSP awards PSP awards granted in 2011 and 2012 are subject to the same performance conditions as those outlined above for the 2010 PSP award.
The companies included in the TSR comparator group are based on the FTSE 350 general retail and food retail companies on the date of grant.
CEO Co-Investment Award On appointment the Company made the CEO a Co-Investment Award, the details of which are set out in the Stock Exchange announcement issued on his appointment.
This Award is designed to recruit and retain an executive of calibre required to run the business and to incentivise the CEO to deliver exceptional shareholder value creation through the achievement of share price performance targets.
This plan was adopted for the sole purpose of making a one-off award to the Groups new CEO and was adopted under Listing Rule 9.4.
2 where the long-term incentive scheme arrangements are for an individual whose appointment as a director is being contemplated and the arrangement is established specifically to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment and retention of the relevant individual.
It is currently intended that no further awards either to the Groups CEO or other executives will be made under this plan.
Under the Plan the CEO invested 500,000 into Halfords shares, acquiring 164,056 shares at 302.22p per share.
The CEO was then awarded a maximum matching award of 3.5 the number of invested shares 574,196 shares.
Subject to continued employment these shares may vest up to a third in November 2015, up to two-thirds in November 2016 and in full in November 2017, depending on the following Threshold 30% vesting and Maximum 100% vesting share price performance targets of Halfords: November Threshold Maximum 2015 350p 400p 2016 385p 440p 2017 425p 485p Share Price performance will be assessed using the average mid-market closing share price for the 30 days following the announcement of the Interim results for the relevant year normally November.
At each relevant vesting date the CEO may decide to either exercise any portion of the award that has vested based on performance at that time in which case any unvested shares in that tranche in respect of which the share price target has not been met will lapse or roll forward that tranche in full to be subject to performance testing at the next vesting date.
In the latter case roll-forward the Participant will forfeit the right to exercise any awards that had become capable of vesting at the earlier vesting date.
Matching shares were granted in the form of nil cost options.
Vested options can be exercised until the 10th anniversary of the date of grant.
Matching shares may accrue additional shares related to dividends.
com Annual Report & Accounts 2013 97 Prior to vesting the Committee will satisfy themselves that the achievement of the Share Price Target is a genuine reflection of the Companys underlying financial performance and may adjust the level of vesting accordingly.
The Committee may determine that Matching Shares can be scaled back before exercise for circumstances such as material misstatement, the individual being responsible for serious reputational damage to the Company, or in circumstances where the Company suffers serious losses.
The Committee believes that the design of the plan is appropriate and necessary to recruit an individual of the CEOs calibre and that the structure will incentivise him to drive exceptional business performance.
Shareholding guidelines The Committee believes that it is important that Executive Directors are also long-term shareholders in the business because as such Executives are incentivised to deliver the corporate strategy, thus creating value for all shareholders.
