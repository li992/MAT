Directors and governance Remuneration Committee report Dear Shareholder At the time of last years report I informed shareholders that the Committee intended to undertake a detailed review of its remuneration policy for executive directors to ensure that it remains appropriate as the Company develops.
This review has now concluded and as a result the Committee intends to make a number of changes to its remuneration policy.
I summarise these below and they are described in more detail later in this report.
In the last four years the Company has been transformed from a technology company, primarily dependent on licensing fees, milestone payments and licensing royalties, to a specialist healthcare company with a portfolio of pharmaceutical and medical device products directly marketed by the Company and additional products in late stage development.
This has come about through the acquisition of both Protherics in 2008 and Biocompatibles in 2011, the launch of Voraxaze together with the completion of the US development of PEM.
With the submission of the PEM NDA filing to the FDA in February this year and its acceptance in April, the Company is gearing up for the planned launch of the product in the US during 2014.
The next three to five years will continue to represent a period of significant change and challenge for the Company as it continues to seek to grow and develop, both in scale of operations, product base and international reach.
It is crucial that the executive directors maintain the correct balance between short-term smart execution with respect to marketed products, successful introduction of PEM and the development of longer term value enhancing product development programmes and acquisition opportunities.
It is, therefore, essential that the remuneration policy achieves the right balance between rewarding short-term execution whilst encouraging the long-term creation of value through significant rewards for delivery of significant value to shareholders.
As a result the Committee intends to make the following changes to the remuneration arrangements for executive directors: I The Chief Executives salary has been increased by 16.5% from 472,032 to 550,000 with effect from 1 April 2013.
This represents a one-off re-alignment of Louise Makins salary, to ensure that it remains positioned at a broadly mid-market level, and reflects BTGs growth in size and complexity and Louise Makins strong performance in the role over a number of years.
I The Chief Financial Officers salary which was re-positioned as part of the 2011 12 review will be increased by 3%, inline with average increases awarded to the wider workforce, from 350,000 to 360,500.
I Going forwards, executive directors will be required to build and maintain very significant levels of shareholding in the Company 250% of salary for the CEO and 150% of salary for the CFO.
As the executive directors increase their shareholdings, the requirement to defer a proportion of their annual bonus will be progressively relaxed, with no deferral once the requirements are met.
I Options will not be granted to executive directors going forwards, instead their annual awards of performance shares will be increased from 100% to 150% of salary.
This change is not anticipated to result in any increase in overall levels of remuneration.
I In order to make the long-term incentive performance condition more transparent for participants and shareholders, relative TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 250 index as a whole, rather than the current approach of comparing performance against a peer group selected from companies in the FTSE 250.
I The cumulative trading profit performance measure used in the long-term incentive will be replaced by a measure based on adjusted earnings per share EPS performance measured in the final year of the three-year performance period.
I In addition, in order to increase the focus on longer-term sustained value creation going forwards, executive directors will be given the opportunity to put at risk up to 100% of PSP awards vesting at year three by converting them into a multiplier award based on BTGs total shareholder return TSR under outperformance of the FTSE 250 index measured at the end of five years from the grant of the original award.
For awards granted from 2013 onwards, if BTG outperforms the index by 100% at the end of five years, the number of shares vesting could be doubled.
The shares vesting at year five will be at risk and would be reduced potentially to zero to the extent that BTG underperforms the index at the end of that period.
It is intended that the multiplier mechanism would be introduced for future PSP awards and also for the PSP awards made in 2011 and 2012.
The multiplier for the 2011 and 2012 awards could vary the number of shares vesting by between zero and two-and-a-half times.
There will be no opportunity to apply the multiplier to existing share options.
The changes to PSP award levels and performance conditions and the introduction of multiplier awards require shareholder approval at BTGs AGM in July.
Full details are provided in the Notice of AGM.
Ian Much Remuneration Committee Chairman Directors and governance 63 Remuneration Committee report BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Remuneration Committee report continued Introduction and compliance This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the Board in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 8 to the Largeand Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 Regulations, and explains how the Company has applied the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code in respect of directors remuneration.
In preparing this years report, the Committee has paid regard to the new reporting requirements announced by The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills BIS that will come into force with effect from next years Annual Report, and has sought to adopt a number of the new requirements where it is practical to do so whilst still remaining compliant with the existing regulations, in particular the Company has chosen to include a detailed letter from the Committee Chairman, separate policy and implementation sections, a detailed pay policy table, references to how employees pay influences directors pay, results of the 2012 AGM, level of share ownership and details of directors contracts.
The report has been divided into two sections: Part A, which describes the Companys policy for the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors for the coming year subject to approval of the components to be put to the AGM and which is not subject to audit: and Part B, parts of which are subject to audit, which describes how the existing policy has been applied during the year under review and provides details of the directors emoluments, shareholdings, long-term incentive awards and pensions for that year.
In accordance with the Regulations, a resolution inviting shareholders to approve the report will be put to the Annual General Meeting AGM on 16 July 2013.
Part A: Remuneration policy The policy for remuneration for executive directors is to enable the Company to offer a package of rewards that: I Is sufficiently competitive to enable the Company to attract and retain the management talent it needs to ensure the Group is successful.
I Supports the achievement of the Companys strategy by providing the potential to receive significant rewards linked to the long-term performance of the Company.
I Aligns executives with shareholders and helps to retain them by delivering a significant element of remuneration in shares.
I Is flexible enough to cope with the Companys changing needs as it grows and the strategy evolves.
The Committee believes that the bonus opportunity aligned with the deferral into shares and forfeiture provisions, together with other elements of the long-term incentive plans, provides a balanced market-competitive package for the executive team.
However the Committee keeps such targets under regular review in order to ensure they remain appropriate.
Inline with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the incentive structure for executive directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, the Committee will ensure that the overall remuneration policy does not encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking.

2 The increase for Rolf Soderstrom is broadly inline with the level of increases awarded in the rest of the Group, which will be approximately 3% on average.
Louise Makins salary was rebased to 550,000 effective from 1 April 2013 following a review of her remuneration which indicated that her salary was significantly below the Committees assessment of the mid-market level for her role.
How employees pay is taken into account in setting the remuneration of the executive directors The Committee also considers the base salaries for ten other senior executives.
In addition, the Committee receives information on general pay levels across the Group.
The Committee, therefore, has due regard to salary levels across the Group in applying its remuneration policy.
BTGs workforce includes a high proportion of highly-qualified scientists, technicians and professionals whose skills are highly sought after by competitors.
Ensuring that levels of remuneration for the general workforce are competitive is important to BTGs ongoing success and this is reflected in the level of salary increases awarded to employees.
As a result BTG is required to benchmark and rebase salaries from time to time.
The average salary increases awarded to BTGs general workforce for 2013 14 will be higher than for the general UK employment market but competitive among the companies with which BTG competes for talent.
General workforce increases effective from June 2013 will range between 2% and 15%.
How executive directors remuneration policy relates to the wider Group The remuneration policy described above provides an overview of the structure that operates for the most senior executives in the Company.
Lower incentive opportunity is available below executive level, with levels driven by market comparatives and the impact of the role.
As explained above, salaries for the Companys wider workforce are benchmarked externally against comparable companies within the sector and wider industry.
The Company aims to ensure that all employees salaries are positioned at a mid-market level for the role taking account of performance and individual responsibility.
Employees are provided with a competitive package of benefits that includes participation in the Groups pension arrangements.
All employees are eligible to participate in the bonus arrangements with targets aligned to the financial performance of the Group and their individual performance within their specific area of responsibility.
The Company believes that broad-based employee participation in share schemes is an important tool in delivering value for shareholders.
Other senior staff are also able to receive awards of long-term incentives at a lower maximum percentage of salary.
Long-term incentives are provided to the most senior executives and those anticipated as having the greatest potential to influence performance levels within the Company.
However, in order to encourage wider employee share ownership, the Company operates a Sharesave Plan in the UK, with an international section for employees in Australia and Germany, and a Stock Purchase Plan in the US.
These are described in more detail on page 71.
Directors and governance 68 Remuneration Committee report BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors and governance How shareholders views are taken into account The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the Annual General Meeting each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally.
Shareholders views are key inputs when shaping remuneration policy.
Over the last few years we have received a variety of comments from shareholders following the publication of the remuneration report in the Annual Report.
These comments informed the Committees thinking during its recent review of its remuneration policy for BTGs executive directors and have included: I A dislike of two long-term incentive plans with the same performance metrics.
I A suggestion that more significant executive director shareholding requirements would be appropriate.
I A comment that greater emphasis on long-term incentives and value creation would be relevant.
I A request for the introduction of clawback on performance awards which we have already implemented.
During the year, the Committee engaged with its largest shareholders regarding changes to the executive directors incentive arrangements and the rebasing of Louise Makins salary for 2013 14.
Proposed changes to the long-term incentive arrangements Executive directors and senior managers, together with all other employees, are eligible to participate in the Companys share schemes as operated from time-to-time.
Following its review of its remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee intends to make the following changes to the long-term incentive arrangements.
Subject to approval at BTGs AGM in July 2013 future long-term incentive awards to BTGs executive directors would consist of two elements: I A core Performance Share Plan PSP award over shares that vest subject to performance over three years.
I A potential multiplier applied to up to 100% of awards vesting under the core PSP at year three, giving the executive directors the opportunity to receive enhanced awards over a five-year period.
This mechanism enables executive directors to put 0%, 50% or 100% of the vesting amounts of the three-year award at risk for a further two years for a potential increase or decrease in the number of shares based on performance measured at the end of five years.
The PSP rules would be amended, as follows: I The individual annual limit on core awards will be increased from 100% of salary p. a. to a maximum of 150% of salary p. a. in normal circumstances and up to 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances, such as on recruitment.
The increase in the normal limit would result in no increase in overall value of core awards for executives as share options will be discontinued.
I The individual annual limit for awards to executive directors, taking account of core and multiplier awards, will be increased to 300% of salary p. a.
The performance condition applying to multiplier awards will be based on a single condition measuring the Companys relative performance against the FTSE 250 Index over a five-year period commencing on the date of grant of the initial core award.
The Multiplier Performance Condition would only apply to that part of the award that would have vested to an executive director at year three and then only to the extent that the executive director has elected for a multiplier award.
For PSP awards granted in 2013 onwards each 1% outperformance underperformance of the FTSE 250 index would increase or decrease the total number of shares that would have vested under the Core Award performance condition by 1%.
Rolled over core awards subject to the multiplier would be at risk and could be increased or decreased by 100% i. e. it could be doubled or be reduced to zero based on TSR performance to the end of year five.
For PSP awards granted in 2011 and 2012 each 1% outperformance underperformance of the FTSE 250 index would increase or decrease the total number of shares that would have vested under the Core Award performance condition by 1.5%.
Rolled over core awards subject to the multiplier would be at risk and could be increased by 150% or decreased by -100% based on TSR performance to the end of year five.
The higher leverage reflects the fact that BTGs policy in 2011 and 2012 was to grant a mix of options and PSPs and that the multiplier would only apply to PSP awards.
Directors and governance 69 Remuneration Committee report BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Remuneration Committee report continued PSP performance targets for 2013 14 Vesting of the PSP awards granted in 2013 14 will be subject to achievement of performance conditions based on a combination of an Earnings per share target as described below 50% and total shareholder return TSR 50% measured over three financial years.
Performance for the TSR element will be measured from the date of grant and compared with that of a peer group comprising the constituents of the FTSE 250 index with opening and closing TSR values averaged over three months prior to the start and end of the performance period.
The FTSE 250 index as the comparator group has been chosen as it is represents a broad range of similar sized companies and is transparent for shareholders and participants.
The performance scale for this award is shown in the table below.
TSR performance against the comparators Percentage of TSR element that vests Below median 0% Median 25% Between median and upper quartile 25% 100% on a straight line basis Above upper quartile 100% For the 2013 14 awards an EPS measure will be used for the remaining 50% of PSP awards.
This replaces the cumulative trading profit measure going forwards.
In introducing EPS, the Committee has recognised that any share awards made in 2013 will be measured on results for the financial year ending March 2016.
While BTG is not yet an earnings based company, the Committee believes that the Company will be substantially along the road to that position by 2016 and it is appropriate to recognise this in the choice of metric.
For the awards made in 2013 14 EPS will be defined as EPS adjusted for acquisition adjustments and reorganisation costs e. g. amortisation of acquired intangible assets: impairment of acquired intangible assets: transaction costs: and costs of a major business reorganisation undertaken as a result of an acquisition.
EPS targets for the awards made during 2013 14 will be measured in the final year of the three-year period the 2015 16 financial year.
The percentage vesting at threshold will be increased from 20% to 25% of this part of the award to bring it into line with the TSR performance condition, however the Committee considers that the EPS targets have been made commensurately more demanding to take account of this change.
In setting the EPS targets, the Committee has compared them to the Groups approved Three-Year Plan and considers them to be demanding.
The targets represent 40% growth at Threshold and 90% growth at Stretch respectively against adjusted EPS of 12.7p for the 2012 13 financial year.
In arriving at the opening baseline value of 12.7p the Committee has sought to exclude the one off effects of the CytoFab development termination.
Accordingly underlying EPS of 14.5p which already excludes the effect of 22.5m asset writedowns has been adjusted by 1.8p to exclude also the associated deferred income release and contract termination compensation of 8.6m.
Note 29 on page 131 explains the accounting treatment on the termination more fully.
EPS in the year ending 31 March 2016 Percentage of EPS element that vests Below Threshold Less than 17.7p 0% Threshold 17.7p 25% Between Threshold and Stretch 17.7p to 24.1p 25% 100% on a straight line basis Stretch 24.1p or higher 100% Payouts for performance between Threshold and Stretch calculated on a straight line basis Directors and governance 70 Remuneration Committee report BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors and governance Other share plans The Company operates other shares plans as follows: I An HMRC-approved Save As You Earn scheme, open to all eligible employees including executive directors, with a 36-month savings period enabling UK employees to acquire shares at a price not less than 80% of the market value of the shares at the date of grant.
The Scheme provides an international section to allow for the participation of Australian and German employees.
I A US Internal Revenue Service 423 Plan with a 24-month savings period under which its US employees are able to acquire shares at not less than 85% of the market value of the shares at the date of grant.
I The non-shareholder approved Senior Management Performance Share Plan enables awards over market purchased shares to be granted to certain senior employees below Board level where it is not appropriate to make awards under the PSP.
Awards under this plan can be made over market purchase shares only and are normally subject to different performance criteria to awards made under the PSP.
External appointments The Board believes that it may be beneficial to the Company for executives to hold non-executive directorships outside the Group.
Any such appointments are subject to approval by the Board and the director may retain any fees payable.
Louise Makin received fees from her position at Premier Foods plc until she retired from the Board on 30 September 2012 of 31,875 2011:67,500.
She joined the Board of Intertek Group plc on 1 July 2012 and received fees of 37,500 during the year to 31March2013 2012: n a. Rolf Soderstrom does not currently hold any outside directorships.
Service contracts Executive directors have rolling service contracts, details of which are summarised in the table below: Provision Detailed terms Contract dates Louise Makin 19 October 2004 Rolf Soderstrom 4 December 2008 Notice period 12 months from both the Company and from the executive Termination payment The Company may terminate the contracts of the executive directors with immediate effect by making a payment in lieu of notice.
Any payments made would be determined by reference to normal contractual principles with mitigation being applied as wherever relevant or appropriate.
The directors contracts do not provide for automatic entitlement to bonus or share-based payments.
Remuneration entitlements Louise Makins contract contains the following remuneration related entitlements: Salary: membership of Company pension scheme or contribution to a personal pension: medical benefits: and permanent health insurance.
Rolf Soderstroms contract contains the following remuneration related entitlements: Salary: contribution to a personal pension: medical benefits: and permanent health insurance.
The Companys policy on directors service contracts is that, inline with the best practice provisions of the Code, they should be terminable by the Company on a maximum of one-years notice and contracts do not provide for pre-determined compensation in the event of termination or provision for enhanced payments in the event of a takeover of the Company.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts, but have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years, which may be renewed by mutual agreement, normally for a further three-year term.
The terms of appointment provide for a notice period in the event of early termination of six months for the Chairman and three months for other non-executive directors, other than if they are not re-elected at an AGM.

Bonus targets were set at the start of the financial year for both Louise Makin and Rolf Soderstrom, based on the achievement of certain objectives.
These were the achievement of targets for revenue growth, a trading profit measure, cash generation and individual KPIs intended to drive future growth in the business.
The Committee set threshold and stretch as well as intermediate target levels for the various targets.
The bonus is calculated on base salary with a percentage pay out of between 20% and 100% for various performance levels.
The trading profit measure, used for both bonuses and long-term incentives, is a normalised measure relating to earnings before amortisation of intangibles, restructuring and acquisition costs, group foreign exchange movements and movements in derivatives.
The cashflow measure adjusts for restructuring and acquisition costs only.
