Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Directors Remuneration Policy This Directors Remuneration Policy the Policy will operate from 1 January 2014 and become formally e ective on 13 May 2014, subject to approval from shareholders through a binding vote at the 2014 Annual General Meeting AGM.
Policy overview The Group seeks to attract and retain the best talent for the bene t of the Business and to align the interests of Executive Directors, senior management and employees with the long-term interests of shareholders and other stakeholders.
Tothat end, the Groups remuneration policies aim to provide appropriate reward for good performance without creating incentives that will encourage excessive risk taking.
In setting the Policy, the Remuneration Committee has regard to the provisions within the FCAs Remuneration Code even though the Group is not required to comply with that code and to the anticipated requirements of Solvency II.
In particular, the Committee considers carefully the link between remuneration and risk and there is cross-membership of the Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee.
As well as financial risk, this also ensures that there is an appropriate focus on Environment, Safety and Governance ESG issues.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee has discussed with major shareholders the Policy to be put to shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
In the event that future changes to the Policy are proposed, the Committee would consult with its major shareholders in advance of changes being made.
The Committee will also consider any shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM at the next scheduled meeting a er the AGM and any other feedback received at any other time as part of the review of Executive Directors remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company The Committee regularly reviews remuneration trends across the Group, including the di erential between the total remuneration at the highest and lowest levels of employees within the Group: and these were taken into account when setting the Policy.
However, there has been no formal consultation with employees in determining the Policy.
The table overleaf summarises the key elements of the Policy.

Both David Calder and Charles Schrager von Altishofen retired from the Board on Admission, and the arrangement whereby the Group paid a monitoring fee to Penta Capital LLP terminated.

Annual bonus for the year ending 31 December 2013 audited The annual bonus payments shown in the total remuneration table were based on Group trading pro t as measured over the 2013 financial year.
The annual bonus was calculated in two parts re ecting the di erent plans in place pre and post-Listing.
The annual bonus payable in respect of the period from 1 April 2013 to 31 December 2013, under the post-Listing remuneration Policy, is set out below: Annual bonus payable Maximum Actual Trading Actual % salary Actual 1 2 Executive Opportunity Pro t payable value $FWXDO 7UDGLQJ 3URW 130.6m Stuart Vann 75% 24.5% 116,375 Between Darren threshold Maximum Threshold Target Ogden 50% and target 16.3% 50,530 25% payout 50% payout 100% 1 Pro-rated to represent the period from 1 April 2013 to 31 December 2013.
2 For the period from 1 April 2013 to 31 December 2013.
For the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 March 2013, trading pro t targets were set relating to performance in the first quarter of the year.
These were achieved in full resulting in a bonus payable for that three month period of 35,625 for the CEO and 23,250 for the CFO being 30% of salary pro-rated for three months.
The aggregate bonuses for 2013 were therefore 152,000 for the CEO and 73,780 for the CFO 32.0% and 23.8% of post-Listing salary respectively.
The scale of the trading pro t targets has not been disclosed as it is deemed by the Committee to be commercially sensitive information.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to scale back annual bonus payments in the event of, inter alia, risk or regulatory compliance issues and also in the event that the level of bonus represents, in the Committees view, an excessive proportion of the Groups overall pro tability.
There were no events in 2013 which led the Committee to determine that a scale back of the annual bonus payment was appropriate.
In addition, the Committee did not consider that the level of bonus represented an excessive proportion of the Groups overall pro tability such that it should be scaled back.
