com reportingcentre2013 Remuneration Report: Implementation Report continued Context to outcomes for the Executive Committee The increase in total remuneration for most executives is primarily driven by the significant change in the value of LTIP awards vesting in 2013 compared to 2012 and relatively higher STIP awards for 2013.
Hugo Bague, Alan Davies, Andrew Harding, Harry Kenyon-Slaney and Debra Valentine did not participate in the 2009 PSP awards which vested with respect to the performance period that ended 31 December 2012 as their awards for 2009 comprised awards under the MSP and SOP.
The 2009 awards under the 2009 MSP and 2009 SOP had performance periods that ended 31 December 2011.
Awards under the 2010 SOP which vested with respect to the performance period ending 31 December 2012 had minimal value in terms of 2012 remuneration due to the share price at the time of vesting being close to or below the option exercise price.
Alan Davies and Debra Valentine also had awards of MSP shares which vested with respect to the performance period ending 31 December 2012.
The increase in remuneration for Alan Davies reflects that his 2012 remuneration represents part year remuneration for the period 1 September 2012 to 31 December 2012.
The increases for Preston Chiaro and Jacynthe Ct reflect higher STIP awards in 2013 compared to 2012 due to significantly higher discretionary downward adjustments being made to their 2012 STIP awards.
The decreases in remuneration for Bret Clayton and Doug Ritchie reflects that their 2013 remuneration represents part year remuneration for the periods 1 January 2013 to 1 March 2013 and 1 January 2013 to 17 January 2013 respectively.
