The most senior managers in the business approximately 80 people globally participate in bonus arrangements with similar targets, measures and relative weightings to the Executive Directors.

1.4 Approach to recruitment and promotion remuneration When appointing external hires or when promoting executives, or an Executive Director, internally, the Committee will continue to act in the best interests of shareholders when determining remuneration, in line with the stated policy.
The main elements of the remuneration policy forExecutive Director appointments are: Base salary will be set on appointment taking into account the factors set out in the policy table, but also the individuals experience.
Depending on an individuals prior experience, the Committee may set salary below market norms, with the intention that it is realigned over time, typically two to three years, subject to performance in the role.
In this situation, the Committee is permitted to exceed the normal rate of annual salary increase set out in the policy table.
On-going annual incentive pay opportunity will not exceed 275% of salary, in line with the maximums stated in the policy table up to 125% of salary for annual bonus and an award of up to 150% of salary under the PSP.
In the year of appointment an off-cycle award under the PSP may be made by the Committee to ensure an immediate alignment of individual interests.
In addition to the standard elements of remuneration, on the appointment of an external candidate, the Committee reserves the right to buy-out incentive awards that the individual has foregone by accepting the appointment, if appropriate.
The terms of such awards would beinformed by the amounts being forfeited and the associated terms for example the extent to which the outstanding awards were subject to performance, the vehicles and the associated time horizons.
It is the intention of the Committee that on an expected basis, the value of the awards being made would not exceed those being forfeited.
Awards would be made either through the existing share plans or in accordance with the relevant provisions contained within the Listing Rules.
When an internal appointment to the Board is made, any pre-existing obligations may be honoured by the Committee and payment will bepermitted under this remuneration policy.
For Executive Director internal promotions, salary will be capped at that of the incumbent Group Chief Executive.
The Committee shall have discretion to grant one-off cash or share-based awards to Executive Directors pursuant to the Listing Rules.
The Committee will exercise this discretion only in exceptional circumstances, where it determines that such an award is necessary to secure the recruitment or retention of an Executive Director and where the Committee determines that it is in the best interests of the Company to doso.
Any one-off award will be subject to a maximum of 100% of salary and will be performance related.
In such circumstances, the Company will disclose a full explanation of the detail and rationale for the one-off award.
The Committee does not expect to have to make any one-off awards as a matter of course, and this power has been included in the policy to cater for any exceptional and genuinely unforeseen circumstances, such as a grant to a key individual where it is vital to retain them in the business.
Details of the remuneration for any new Chairman or Executive Director appointed to the Board will be disclosed on a timely basis on the Groups website, www.
Our governance Chairmans introduction Board of Directors Corporate governance report Audit Committee Nomination Committee Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 79 1.5 Service agreements and termination policy The Companys policy on service agreements and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below.
Service agreements aredesigned to reflect the interests of the Company, as well as the individual concerned.
Executive Directors service agreements are kept atthe Companys headquarters in Cheltenham.
In accordance with the Code and guidelines issued by institutional investors, Executive Directors have service agreements that are terminable by either the Company or the Executive Director on 12 months notice.
In the event of termination or resignation, and subject to business reasons, the Company would not necessarily hold the Executive Director to his or her full notice period.
All Directors are subject to election ifnewly appointed in the year or re-election at the AGM.
Service agreements set out restrictions on the ability of the Executive Director to participate in businesses competing with those of the Group or to entice or solicit away from the Group any senior employees or to solicit deal with clients of the Group or interfere with supply, in the 12 months following the cessation of employment.
Salary, pension and benefits are included in the agreements and are treated as described in the policy table on pages 75 to 77.
There is nocontractual entitlement to payment of an annual bonus or granting of an award under the PSP, until individual participation, level of award, measures and targets have been set for a particular year.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but serve the Company under letters of appointment, for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election at the AGM.
Appointments may be terminated by the Company or individual with onemonths notice.
Group Chief Executive and new appointments from 1st January 2013 The details of the service agreements of the Group Chief Executive and for new appointments to the Board are outlined below.
The Group Chief Executive's service agreement has been updated to reflect latest best practice.
In the event of a material change in role, function or responsibilities, Executive Directors agreements will be reviewed and will be expected to be updated to meet the requirements outlined below.
Notice Period 12 months by the Executive Director and 12 months by the Company Termination No payment if Executive Director commits a repudiatory breach of the service agreement or for gross misconduct or in certain circumstances No additional termination payment if notice worked If notice only part worked part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice Otherwise 12 months base salary only Company discretion to pay in lieu of notice in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control, when a lump sum will be paid If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits, excluding long-term incentives, earned in new paid employment in that period No automatic entitlement to payments under the annual bonus or PSP.
See page 80 Garden leave clause Robust post-termination restrictions on confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and non-interference with customers or suppliers Service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of certain events, such as gross misconduct or financial misstatement Clawback Bonus payments and PSP awards are subject to clawback for up to three years following award Circumstances include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct Executive Directors legacy agreements Within the legacy agreements of Executive Directors, termination of agreements is subject to a 12 month notice period.
Where payment is made in lieu of notice on termination, the payment of a sum in respect of lost future bonus opportunity based on an average of the preceding three years bonus payments is subject to the Committees discretion, with the power to reduce the amount to reflect performance on the part of the Executive Director which is considered by the Committee to be unsatisfactory.
On termination of such an Executive Directors service agreement, the Committee will take into account the departing Executive Directors need to mitigate his or her loss when determining the amount of bonus.
Payment will only be made at the discretion of the Committee after taking into account individual performance in order to ensure that there will be no payments for failure.
In any event, payments will be subject to clawback provisions.
Executive Directors service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of certain events, such as termination for gross misconduct or financial misstatement.
Strategic report 80 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Governance continued Remuneration policy report 2014 continued While the Executive Directors service agreements include a provision to deal with termination on a change of control, in the event of an offer being made, shareholders have discretion to accept the offer or not.
The decision to recommend acceptance, or not, is a matter for the Board and the Committee is of the clear view that the change of control provision within the Executive Directors service agreements would have no influence on the voting pattern of those Executive Directors.
Executive Directors legacy agreements are summarised in the table below.
Notice Period 12 months by the Executive Director and 12 months by the Company Termination No payment if Executive Director commits a repudiatory breach of the service agreement or for gross misconduct or in certain circumstances No additional termination payment if notice worked If notice only part worked part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice Otherwise 12 months base salary, the value of other benefits, plus the cost of pension credits or contributions for the period plus the average of the prior three years annual bonus payments, with Committee discretion to reduce the amount of the bonus that would otherwise be calculated, to reflect performance on the part of the Executive Director that is considered by the Committee to be below the required standards, provided that termination by the Company does not occur within 12 months of a change of control Committee discretion to pay in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control when a lump sum will be paid If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits excluding long-term incentives, earned in new paid employment in that period No automatic entitlement to payments under the current annual bonus or PSP.
See below Garden leave clause Robust post-termination restrictions on confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and non-interference with customers or suppliers Clawback Bonus payments and PSP awards are subject to clawback for up to three years following award Circumstances include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct Treatment of leavers under the incentive plans Whilst it is not an entitlement, it is expected that where an Executive Director is a good leaver i. e. where the cessation of employment is due to death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company business in which he she works being disposed of where the ending of employment is instigated by the Company and is not for cause, payments will be made under the annual bonus plan if performance targets are met subject to, and in accordance with, the plan rules.
If the Executive Director is not a good leaver it is expected that no bonus will be paid.
The treatment of leavers under the PSP is determined in accordance with the shareholder approved PSP rules.
Any awards granted within six months prior to termination or the giving or receiving of notice will lapse.
Any awards granted six months or longer prior to termination of employment but prior to the end of the performance period will lapse unless the Executive Director is considered to be a good leaver.
In the case of a good leaver the award will vest on the termination date, or the normal vesting date, at the Committees discretion.
This is subject to the satisfaction of the performance targets at that date and a pro-rata reduction in the number of shares to take account of the shortening of the performance period.
For awards granted on or after 1st March 2012, if the Executive Director is a good leaver where the ending of employment is not for cause, the number of shares vested may be reduced including to zero by the Committee in its absolute discretion.
If an Executive Director ceases employment or notice is given on or after the end of the performance period but prior to the date on which the Committee has determined the extent to which the award has vested, if the Executive Director is a good leaver, his her award will be preserved and will be treated in the same way as if his her employment had continued, whereas if the Executive Director is not a good leaver, his her award will lapse on the earlier of his her cessation of employment and the giving of notice.
Change of control Bonus: if termination occurs within 12 months of a change of control, the Executive Director is entitled to i a lump sum payment in lieu of notice and ii receive a full bonus payment calculated by reference to the average of the preceding three years bonus payments without any reduction for performance.
PSP: the rules provide that in the event of a change of control, outstanding share-based awards will vest to the extent that performance targets are met at the date of the event.
Any such vesting would generally be on a time pro-rated basis.
The Committee may, at its discretion, increase the level of vesting if it believes that exceptional circumstances warrant such treatment.

Below we illustrate how the total pay opportunity for the Executive Directors varies under three performance scenarios: maximum, on target, and below threshold.
The scenarios, informed by the current application of our pay policy, are defined as follows: Element Fixed pay, benefits and ESOP Fixed pay and ESOP does not vary with performance and comprises: Base salary effective 1st January 2014 Benefits value based on 2013 disclosure Pension value DB 2013 as reported: cash allowance: rate applied to 2014 salary ESOP participation of up to 1,500 1:1 matching shares for eligible Executive Directors Percentage of Base Salary Below threshold On target Maximum Annual bonus % of salary 0% 60% 100% 1 PSP % of salary at award 0% 25% 100% 1 A level of 25% vesting for on target performance is equivalent to threshold performance under the PSP, which the Committee believes to be a fair assumption foron target performance given the approach taken to setting performance targets.

Strategic report 82 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Governance continued Remuneration policy report 2014 continued 1.7 Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group When determining the remuneration of Executive Directors, the Committee considers the pay of employees across the Group.
When conducting the annual salary review, the average base salary increase awarded to the UK workforce and senior managers across the Group provides a key reference point when determining levels of increase for Executive Director remuneration.
The remuneration policy was drawn up by the Committee without the need for any consultation with employees.
The Committee also determines the principles and policy of remuneration which shall apply to the Groups senior managers.
The responsibility for determining precise compensation packages that meet local practice and performance targets lies with the Group Chief Executive and the responsible Executive Director.
To ensure consistency in remuneration policy across the Group and to encourage a performance culture, senior managers participate in the PSP.
The Board believes that share ownership is an effective way of aligning the interests of managers and shareholders and to strengthen the development of the business.
1.8 Statement of consideration of shareholder views In developing and reviewing the Companys remuneration policy for Executive Directors and other senior executives, the Committee seeks and takes into account the range of views of shareholders.
The Committee Chairman actively engages with institutional shareholders when appropriate and takes into account their views when reviewing and implementing the Companys remuneration policy.
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during the year at meetings with shareholders, is considered as part of the Companys annual review of remuneration policy.
At the AGM in 2013, the advisory vote on the 2012 Directors remuneration report received 96.3% in favour.
The views of shareholders have been helpful and constructive and assisted in the development of a pro-forma Executive Director service agreement which has been applied to Mr Anderson on his appointment as Group Chief Executive and which will apply to all new appointments.
Specifically in relation to the termination arrangements, the revised service agreement restricts any termination payment to 12 months base pay.
This applies to the new Group Chief Executive service agreement and, in the event of a material change in the role, function or responsibilities, existing Executive Directors service agreements will be reviewed and changed to meet the new standard.

Strategic report 86 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Governance continued Annual report on remuneration 2013 continued Spirax-Sarco Performance Share Plan PSP The Committee makes an annual conditional award of shares to each Executive Director under the PSP.
Prior to award, the Committee reviews the performance targets for each measure to ensure they remain sufficiently stretching.
For financial measures this includes a review of analysts forecasts.
In normal circumstances, the maximum award under the PSP is 100% of base salary but, in exceptional circumstances, this may be increased to 150% of base salary.
Vesting is based on two performance measures, which have been chosen as they are aligned with our strategy: TSR performance relative to a comparator group Aggregate EPS relative to target aggregate EPS.
Performance is measured over a three-year period.
Clawback provisions apply for PSP awards made from 2012 onwards.
PSP Awards vesting over 2011 2013 In 2011 the Executive Directors, excluding Mr Whalen, received share awards under the PSP, with vesting subject to EPS growth and relative TSR performance.
The diagrams below set out details of the performance measures and targets that applied, along with the actual performance during the period 1st January 2011 to 31st December 2013.
Relative TSR performance 60% of PSP award Aggregate EPS performance 40% of PSP award Over the three-year period to 31st December 2013, the Company Over the three-year period to 31st December 2013, the Company delivered a TSR of 70.9%.
This fell below the median of the delivered aggregate adjusted EPS of 382.0p.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Executive Directors excluding Mr Vernon and Mr Whalen who are USA citizens are eligible to participate in an HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan known as the ESOP.
The maximum annual investment in shares is 1,500 per Executive Director which can be matched by the Company on a one-for-one basis for each share that is purchased by an Executive Director and dividend shares can be reinvested.
No shares acquired under the ESOP are subject to performance measures as the aim of the ESOP is to encourage increased shareholding in the Company by all eligible UK employees.
2.2 Pension audited Directors pensions Mr Vernon and Mr Whalen are members of the Spirax Sarco Inc. defined benefit plan.

Spirax-Sarco Performance Share Plan PSP The weighting of the TSR and EPS performance measures will be changed to 40% : 60% for 2014, to place greater emphasis on delivering strong EPS performance in the context of the current economic environment.
The Committee also agreed to change the comparator group for the 2014 PSP award in respect of the TSR element to the full FTSE 350 Industrial Goods and Services Supersector to reduce volatility over the long-term.
This provides the Group with a more credible tool with which to motivate and incentivise senior management, while still clearly aligning Executive Directors' remuneration to shareholder interests.
Based on standard statistical modelling, this change has a non-cash cost impact of 143,000 over three years in respect of the Executive Directors 2014 award.
