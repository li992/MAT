Directors remuneration report As you will have seen from the rest of this Annual Report and Accounts, performance at Ashtead has continued the trend of the last couple of years and has been particularly strong this year.
We have continued to grow market share and expand margins in our core market of the US.
As a result we have been one of the best performing stocks in the FTSE 250.
This, combined with our record dividend again this year, means that total shareholder returns have been extremely good.
Nonetheless, the business environment remains challenging and, as a cyclical business, Ashtead remains susceptible to changes in market conditions throughout the economic cycle.
Our aim is to continue to take advantage of the structural change in the US market and continue to build market share.
Building sustainable performance across economic cycles remains a key focus of our corporate strategy.
The Implementation Report includes a table for the new single remuneration figure for all directors for the year, as well as a summary table setting out our chief executives remuneration over the past six years.
Total remuneration has increased five-fold since 2008 as a result of the strong financial performance of Ashtead, while total shareholder returns have increased ten-fold over the same period.
In the last two years, we have seen a significant increase in total MiChael BurroW remuneration, a substantial element of which is a result of the full vesting of the 2009 and 2010 Performance Share Plan PSP awards which were granted when the share price were 55.5p and 98.5p, respectively.
We are pleased to note the strong correlation of Dear Shareholder remuneration policy with total shareholder returns.
The alignment of I am pleased to present the Directors remuneration report for the remuneration policy with the interests of shareholders has been, and year ended 30 April 2013. will continue to be, a key objective of the Remuneration Committee.

MiChael BurroW I believe the changes we have made have resulted in a better Chairman of the Remuneration Committee correlation between remuneration and performance and have contributed to our record performance.
Following consultation with our major shareholders the recent changes introduced were: an overhaul of the bonus scheme to reward exceptional performance and also the introduction of a deferral, forfeiture and clawback mechanism that aligns remuneration with shareholder interests: and a balanced and holistic approach to the Performance Share Plan, incorporating four performance measures, with the objective of: aligning remuneration with the key performance indicators of the business over the long term: and incentivising executive management appropriately throughout the economic cycle.

44 ashtead group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 The Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan, which was adopted in 2004, is a long-term incentive share award plan under which executive directors and other members of the senior management team may annually be awarded a conditional right to acquire shares, the vesting of which depends on the satisfaction of demanding performance conditions.
In recent years, the policy has been to grant awards of shares with a market value at the date of grant equal to between 20% and 100% of the participants base salary with the executive directors typically receiving the upper end of this range and the Group chief executive receiving an award equivalent to 150% of his base salary as at the date of grant.
Share-baSed incenTiveS and diluTion limiTS The Company observes an overall dilution limit of 10% in 10 years for all company share schemes, together with a limit of 5% in 10 years for discretionary schemes.
No new shares have been issued by the Company in connection with executive share plans in recent years.
remuneraTion Policy on new hireS In the event of hiring a new executive director, the Committee will seek to align the remuneration package with the remuneration policy summarised above.
However, the Committee retains the discretion to make remuneration proposals outside the standard policy to facilitate the recruitment of an individual of the calibre required to deliver the Groups strategy.
In particular, it will consider compensating an incoming executive with the like-kind incentive arrangements for foregone incentives with their previous employer, taking into account the length of the period they were held and an assessment of the likely vesting value.
The Committee will ensure that such arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company and the shareholders without paying more than is necessary.
conSulTing wiTh ShareholderS The Committee believes that it is important to maintain an open dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters.
The Committee consulted with major shareholders extensively during 2011 12 with regards to the introduction of the Deferred Bonus Plan and the balanced scorecard approach for the Performance Share Plan.
The views of shareholders were integral to the changes introduced.
Looking forward, the Committee will continue to liaise with shareholders regarding material changes to remuneration arrangements.
ToTal remuneraTion oPPorTuniTy Our remuneration arrangements are designed so that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of shortand long-term objectives designed to create shareholder value.

They are required to retain no fewer than 50% of shares that vest under the Performance Share Plan net of taxes until such time as a shareholding equivalent to 100% of salary is achieved and thereafter maintained.
All executive directors currently meet this guideline.

SerViCe ConTraCTS anD exiT PayMenTS The Companys policy is that executive directors have rolling contracts which are terminable by either party giving the other 12 months notice.
The service contracts for each of the executive directors all contain non-compete provisions appropriate to their roles.

Upon the termination of an executive directors employment for cause the Company is entitled to terminate the directors employment immediately without payment.
Bonus Executive directors may receive a prorated bonus based on achievement of performance objectives and the number of months service during the year to the date of leaving.
Performance Share Plan Under the rules of the Performance Share Plan, if an executive director is classed as a good leaver where his employment terminates by reason of, amongst other things, death, redundancy, retirement at normal retirement age or by agreement with the Company any outstanding awards will be normally prorated for time and vest, subject to the attainment of the performance conditions attaching thereto, on or around the third anniversary of the grant date.
reMuneraTion PoliCy for non-exeCuTiVe DireCTorS The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
None of the non-executive directors has a service contract with the Company and their appointment is therefore terminable by the Board at any time.

Other taxable allowances include car, travel and accommodation allowances.
ii Sat Dhaiwal is a member of the Ashtead Group Retirement Benefits Plan.
The amount shown above represents the increase in his accrued pension benefit calculated on the proposed BIS basis.
This methodology differs from that prescribed by the occupational transfer value regulations and so the figure differs from that shown in the pension section on page 51.
The amount for Geoff Drabble and Ian Robson represents a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions at 40% of salary.
The amounts included for Brendan Horgan and Suzanne Wood represent the co-match under the Companys 401K defined contribution pension plan and 409A deferred compensation plan.
iii Deferred Bonus Plan includes the cash received by each director from the DBP for 2012 13 performance as explained on page 44.
This includes 50% of this years total bonus earned by, and 50% of the brought forward deferred share equivalents for, Geoff Drabble and 67% of each for Brendan Horgan and Suzanne Wood.
The balance for each director was compulsorily deferred into share equivalents as part of the DBP.
iv Annual Performance Bonus represents the cash award under the Annual Performance Bonus plan for 2012 13 performance.
v The vesting PSP value is calculated as the number of shares vesting, based on the vesting criteria, valued at the market value of those shares, plus the payment in lieu of dividends paid during the vesting period.
Market value is the market value on the day the awards vest if they vest before the date the financial statements are approved or the average market value for the last three months of the financial year if the awards vest after the date the financial statements are approved.
The 2010 award is expected to vest fully on 29 June 2013 and has been valued at an average market value of 557p for the three months ended 30 April 2013, plus 10p per share in lieu of dividends paid during the vesting period.
vi Suzanne Wood was appointed a director on 16 July 2012 and her salary, benefits and pension are included from that date to 30 April 2013.
The amount related to the DBP is the total amount due under the plan for 2012 13.
The PSP figure represents the award for which the performance period completes on 28 June 2013.
The significant value attributable to the vesting of PSP awards within the single remuneration figure reflects the significant appreciation of the share price since the awards were granted.

Geoff Drabble and Brendan Horgan received a salary increase of 10% of base salary and Suzanne Wood received a salary increase of 7%.
These increases were designed to bring salaries into a more appropriate range for a company of our size and complexity.
While base salaries remain generally lower than those of our peers, they are now more in line.
In an inherently cyclical business we continue to believe that a larger, variable element of pay is appropriate.

This was agreed prior to his joining the Company in 2006 and reflected the fact that he was leaving a generous defined benefit arrangement at his previous employer.
Sat Dhaiwals pension benefits are provided entirely through the Retirement Benefits Plan.
Further details are provided on page 51.
Brendan Horgan and Suzanne Wood are members of the Sunbelt 401K defined contribution pension plan and the 409A deferred compensation plan.
48 ashtead group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 The DeferreD BonuS Plan The performance targets for the Deferred Bonus Plan for the year were as follows: Group pre-tax profit Sunbelt operating profit Bonus potential Forfeiture 100m $248m Loss of 50% of previously deferred bonus Threshold 130m $300m 10% Target 160m $345m 50% Maximum 182m $382m 100% Underlying profit.
The performance targets for Geoff Drabble and Suzanne Wood for the year to 30 April 2013 related directly to the underlying pre-tax profits of Ashtead Group and for Brendan Horgan, underlying operating profit of Sunbelt Rentals.
The targets set by the Committee for full entitlement under the DBP were significantly ahead of both prior year 131m and consensus market expectation of 144m when the target was set.
The target for Sunbelt Rentals was significantly ahead of the prior year $290m.
For the year to 30 April 2013, the underlying pre-tax profit for Ashtead Group was 247m and underlying operating profit for Sunbelt Rentals was $453m.
As a result, the maximum bonus entitlements were earned and were equivalent to 200% of base salary for Geoff Drabble and 150% of base salary for Suzanne Wood and Brendan Horgan.
In 2013 14 Geoff Drabble, Suzanne Wood and Brendan Horgan will participate in the DBP.
The targets for Geoff Drabble and Suzanne Wood will be linked to the Groups underlying pre-tax profits and those for Brendan Horgan will relate to Sunbelts underlying operating profit.
These performance targets should be viewed in conjunction with the wider performance targets set for the 2013 14 PSP awards as detailed on page 44.
The annual PerforManCe BonuS The performance targets for the annual performance bonus were as follows: A-Plant operating profit Bonus potential Threshold 8m 20% Target 10m 50% Maximum 12m 100% Underlying profit.
The maximum bonus entitlement for Sat Dhaiwal was 100% of base salary and related directly to the profitability of A-Plant.
The target for maximum payout was significantly ahead of the prior year profit of 7.3m.
A-Plants underlying operating profit was 12.2m and, as a result, the maximum bonus entitlement was earned equivalent to 100% of base salary.
The PerforManCe Share Plan The performance criteria have varied by year in prior years.
Following consultation with shareholders, a balanced and holistic approach was adopted involving four performance measures selected because delivery of them through the cycle is a significant challenge and the achievement of them will deliver optimum sustainable performance over the long term.
The performance criteria for the award years affected by this years performance are as follows: Performance criteria measured over three years Award date Financial year TSR % of award EPS % of award Status 13 7 09 2009 10 From date of grant versus FTSE 250 2011 12 EPS RPI 0% 25% vested Vested in full in July 2012 Index 37.5% at median: 75% at upper quartile 29 6 10 2010 11 From date of grant versus FTSE 250 2012 13 EPS between 1p 12.5% vested Expected to vest fully in June 2013 Index 12.5% at median: 50% at upper and 2.5p 50% vested quartile 27 7 11 2011 12 From date of grant versus FTSE 250 2013 14 EPS between 8p 12.5% vested TSR in upper quartile and EPS Index 12.5% at median: 50% at upper and 12p 50% vested upper threshold exceeded in quartile 2012 13 Award date Financial year TSR 40% EPS 25% RoI 25% Leverage 10% Status 19 9 12 2012 13 From date of 25% of this element 25% of this 100% of this TSR performance is in the upper grant versus of the award will element of the element of the quartile and EPS growth of 83% FTSE 250 Index vest if EPS award will vest award will vest achieved in the first year 25% of this compound growth at an RoI of 10% if the ratio of net element of the for the year ending with 100% debt to EBITDA is award will vest at 30 April 2015 is 6% vesting with an equal to, or is less median: 100% at above EPS for the RoI of 15% than, 2.5 times upper quartile year ending 30 April 2012, rising to 100% vesting if EPS compound growth is equal to, or exceeds, 12% per annum ashtead group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 49 Directors remuneration report continued For performance between the lower and upper target ranges, vesting of the award is scaled on a straight-line basis.
The 2009 PSP award vested in full on 13 July 2008 with EPS for 2011 12 of 17.3p exceeding the upper target of 13.6p and the Companys TSR performance ranked it first within the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
The 2010 PSP award, for which the performance period completes on 28 June 2013, is expected to vest in full.
EPS for 2012 13 of 31.6p exceeds the upper target of 2.5p and at 12 June 2013, the Companys TSR performance ranked it first within the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
EPS is based on the profit before exceptional items, fair value remeasurements and amortisation of acquired intangibles less the tax charge included in the accounts.
The Committee considers it most appropriate to measure TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts rather than a specific comparator group of companies because there are few direct comparators to the Company listed in London and because the Company is a FTSE 250 company.
The Companys TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts is shown on page 48. reTireMenT of exeCuTiVe DireCTor Ian Robson retired as an executive director of the Company on 13 July 2012, having given the Company 12 months notice of his intention to retire.
