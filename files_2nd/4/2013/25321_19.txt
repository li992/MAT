Non-executive directors receive no other bene ts and take no part in any discussion or decision concerning their own fees.

Notes to the policy table Performance measures and targets The Committee selects annual bonus performance conditions that are central to the achievement of the Companys key strategic initiatives for the year and re ect both financial and nonfinancial objectives.
To balance this, the performance conditions for the LTIP are linked to long-term value creation: TSR aligns with the Companys focus on shareholder value creation: EPS provides strong line-of-sight for executives and supports the Companys long-term strategy.
Revenue less impairment supports the Companys focus on sustainable growth.
The performance targets are determined annually by the Committee and are set typically at a level that is stretching and achievable.
The Board is of the opinion that the performance measures and targets for the annual bonus are commercially sensitive in respect of the Company and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them during the financial year.
This is particularly so because the majority of the Companys competitors are unlisted.
Shareholding requirement Since the last AGM, one shareholder has adopted a public policy which seeks a minimum holding period of five years between the date of grant of any shares and the sale of those shares.
Given the Companys substantial shareholding requirements, the Committee is not currently persuaded that such a rule is necessary for the Company.
It will, however, continue to follow discussions on this point and keep the matter under review.
67 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Corporate Governance DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Total remuneration opportunity The tables below set out an illustration of the remuneration policy for 2014 in line with the remuneration policy above and include base salary, pension, bene ts and incentives.
The tables provide an illustration of the proportion of total remuneration made up of each component of the remuneration policy and the value of each component.
Bene ts are calculated as per the single gure of remuneration.
Three scenarios have been illustrated for each executive director: Fixed, On target and Maximum.
Assumptions made for each scenario are as follows: Fixed: xed remuneration only i. e. latest known salary, bene ts and pension.
On target: xed remuneration plus on target annual bonus 80% plus midpoint vesting 62.5% of awards under the PSP based on threshold of 25% and maximum 100% and Share Matching Scheme.
Maximum: xed remuneration plus 100% annual bonus plus 100% vesting of PSP and Share Matching Scheme.
Approach to recruitment remuneration The Committees approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract appropriate candidates to the role.
Starting salary will be set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy, based on a combination of market information, internal relativities and individual experience.
Thereafter, salary progression will depend on the initial agreed base salary and the normal review process.
The maximum level and structure of ongoing variable remuneration will be in accordance with the approved remuneration policy detailed above, i. e. at an aggregate maximum of up to 317% of salary 100% annual bonus, 150% LTIP shares and 67% matching shares under the DSP.
This limit does not include the value of any buyout arrangements.
For external appointments, it may be necessary to buy out an individuals awards from a previous employer.
The Company may offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interest of the Company.
Such payments would take account of the remuneration relinquished and would re ect the delivery mechanism i. e. cash, shares and or options, time horizons and expected value i. e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria.
Replacement share awards, if used, will be granted using existing share plans.
Wherever possible, any new arrangements will be tied into the achievement of Group targets in either both the annual performance bonus and long-term incentives.
As shares under the normal long-term incentive scheme will not be released for up to three years, some cash-based interim long-term arrangement may be provided, but the level will not be more than would otherwise have been paid.
This may be used as part of the buy out of existing arrangements.
For internal appointments, any variable pay elements awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to the terms of the scheme, adjusted as relevant to take account of the new appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
68 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Corporate Governance Directors service agreements The Company has historically appointed executive directors on 12 month rolling contracts.
Accordingly, Gerard Ryan and David Broadbent have service contracts terminable on this basis.
The Company has recently changed its policy in relation to service agreements for newly appointed executive directors so that they are terminable upon six months notice.
Adrian Gardner was the first to be appointed on this basis.
All non-executive directors are appointed for three years, subject to re-election by shareholders.
The initial three-year period may be extended.
The Company can terminate the appointment on three months notice.
The Companys Articles of Association require that all directors retire from of ce if they have not retired at either of the preceding two AGMs.
In any event, at this years AGM, all directors will be standing for re-election in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Contracts are available for inspection at the Companys registered of ce.
Contracts and service agreements are not reissued when base salaries or fees are changed.
Pension arrangements for all of the executive directors have also been amended, as described in the policy table, without reissuing their contracts.
Loss of of ce payments The Companys policy is to limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements.
In the event that the employment of an executive director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined having regard to the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
Under normal circumstances, good leavers who do not serve notice are eligible to receive termination payments in lieu of notice based on base salary and contractual bene ts.
The Company normally expects executive directors to mitigate their loss upon departure.
In any speci c case that may arise, the Committee will consider carefully any compensatory payments having regard to performance, age, service, health or other circumstances that may be relevant.
In the event an executive director leaves for reasons of death, injury, disability, change of control of the Company, or any other reason which the Committee in its absolute discretion permits, any outstanding DSP matching shares and PSP awards will normally vest at the end of the performance period and be pro-rated for time.
However, the Committee has the discretion to allow the award to vest on cessation of employment on a pro-rata basis if, in the Committees view, the performance conditions are met at that point on a pro-rata basis.
The Committee may vest the award on any other basis if it believes there are exceptional circumstances which warrant that.
For example, it can be in the interest of the Company for the Board to proactively organise succession and manage an executive directors departure.
When determining the treatment of outstanding awards in those cases, the Committee will take into account the executives level of performance and contribution to the transition.
For all other leavers, outstanding PSP awards and DSP matching shares will lapse.
The Committee retains discretion to alter these provisions as permitted by the relevant Plan Rules on a case-by-case basis following a review of circumstances and to ensure fairness for both shareholders and participants.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees All employees of the Group are entitled to base salary and bene ts appropriate to the market in which they are employed.
The maximum opportunity available is based on the seniority and responsibility of the role.
LTIP awards are only available to senior management and directors.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company In making remuneration decisions, the Committee also considers the general increases in base salaries taking place within the Group.
While the Company does not consult directly with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay, the Committee does receive and take account of employee engagement results as part of their overall assessment of executive director performance.
Consideration of shareholder views When determining remuneration, the Committee also takes into account the guidelines of investor bodies and shareholder views.
The Committee considers these to be of great importance.
In November 2013, the Company consulted a number of its major shareholders and shareholder representative bodies in order to discuss the proposed introduction of a Groupwide share scheme.
We received valuable feedback from a number of key shareholders and took this into account in nalising the proposals.
As outlined in the annual remuneration report, the Company received strong support from its shareholders with a 97.78% vote in favour of last years Directors Remuneration Report.
The Committee continues to be mindful of shareholder views when determining ongoing remuneration strategy and commits to undergoing shareholder consultation in advance of any signi cant changes to remuneration policy.

In accordance with his Letter of Appointment, he received payment of his fee through to 31 May 2013.
Additional disclosures for single gure for total remuneration table Base salary Base salaries were increased by 3% from 1 April 2013: this re ected strong financial and individual performance and also the level of salary budget increases across the Group.
Bene ts The bene ts provided to the executive directors included: private healthcare, life assurance, annual medical, long-term disability cover and a cash allowance in lieu of a company car.
Determination of 2013 annual bonus The maximum award for both the CEO and Finance Director in 2013 was 100% of salary 80% of salary for on target performance and 20% of salary for threshold performance.
During 2013, a balanced scorecard approach was used for the annual bonus whereby 50% of the bonus was calculated on pre-tax pro t and, subject always to a minimum pro t threshold, the remaining 50% calculated against stretching personal performance objectives.
The pre-tax pro t targets were: threshold 105.0 million: on target 113.0 million: and maximum 118.0 million.
The personal performance objectives included the following: launching businesses in new markets: listing on the Warsaw Stock Exchange: launch of a UK retail bond: new product initiatives: development of a sales culture: and building employee engagement.
The award for achievement of personal performance objectives is conditional upon achievement of the pre-tax pro t element i. e. the maximum achievable on the personal performance objectives is equal to the amount achieved under the pre-tax pro t element.
Over the period, pro t before tax and exceptional items was 118.1 million, which gave rise to maximum payment under the pro t before tax target.
The Committee also reviewed the performance of the CEO and Finance Director against their agreed personal objectives for 2013, and determined that they had been achieved in full.

The bonus was payable one-third in cash, and two-thirds in deferred shares which will vest at the end of a three-year period, subject to the director not being dismissed for misconduct.
There are also provisions for clawback during the vesting period in the event of a restatement of the Companys Financial Statements or material misjudgement of performance.
Pension The Company has two pension schemes, the International Personal Finance plc Pension Scheme the Pension Scheme and the International Personal Finance Stakeholder Pension Scheme the Stakeholder Scheme.
New employees are eligible to join the Stakeholder Scheme.
The rate of Company pension contribution for any executive director is 20% of base salary.
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, this may be paid as a cash allowance.
The Companys contributions in respect of Gerard Ryan during 2013 amounted to 92,025, all of which was paid into pension arrangements.
David Broadbent was a member of the final salary section of the Pension Scheme until 1 April 2006 when he began to accrue bene ts as a member of the cash balance section.
He ceased to be a member of the cash balance section on 31 July 2008 and became a deferred member of the Pension Scheme.
The Companys contributions in respect of David Broadbent during 2013 amounted to 61,770, of which 50,000 was paid into pension arrangements and 11,770 was paid as a cash allowance.
Details of David Broadbents entitlements under both sections of the Pension Scheme are as follows: Final salary Accrued pension at 31 December 2013 14,418 Accrued pension at 31 December 2012 14,108 Increase in accrued pension during the year net of in ation Directors contributions in 2013 Cash balance Accrued pension at 31 December 2013 102,786 Accrued pension at 31 December 2012 100,573 Increase in accrued pension during the year net of in ation Directors contributions in 2013 David Broadbent was age 45 at the end of the year.

Normal retirement age is 65 for David Broadbent.
Early retirement can be taken from age 55 and the accrued final salary pension will then be reduced to take account of its early payment.
71 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Corporate Governance DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED LTIP Awards vesting during 2013 PSP CSOP The LTIP amount included in the 2013 single total gure of remuneration is the PSP and CSOP nil-cost option award granted in 2010.
Vesting was dependent on absolute TSR performance over three years from the date of grant ending on 22 July 2013.
The performance achieved against the performance targets is shown below.
Performance condition Threshold Maximum Achieved Absolute TSR growth 30% TSR over 3 years 60% TSR over 3 years 150% TSR 33% vests 100% vests 100% vested Based upon absolute TSR of 150%, 100% of the award vested when tested on 22 July 2013.
The Committee was satis ed that the TSR growth was a fair re ection of performance.
50% of the vested award was released after the end of the performance period, with 50% deferred for an additional 12 months.
Awards granted during 2013 PSP As disclosed in last years Directors Remuneration Report, the performance measures for PSP awards granted from 2013 were amended following a review of our remuneration policy and consultation with shareholders.
The measures were changed such that absolute TSR is complemented with the key drivers of TSR EPS and growth in revenue net of impairment to provide a more rounded incentive for executive directors, whilst maintaining shareholder alignment.
Awards granted from 2013 will vest depending on performance against three equally weighted measures, measured over three years: one-third absolute TSR: one-third EPS growth: and one-third growth in net revenue net of impairment.
The performance targets applying to the award granted during the financial year are: Growth in Cumulative revenue less Absolute TSR EPS growth impairment Weighting 1 3 1 3 1 3 Vested at threshold 25% 25% 25% 1 Threshold 30% over 3 years 6% p. a.
Stretch 100% vesting 60% over 3 years 15% p. a.
1 The targets were set by the Committee following shareholder consultation and based on data relating to broker forecasts, internal budgets and historical precedent achieved by the Company.
As outlined in the policy table, awards are made in shares and the number of shares is determined based on a percentage of base salary.
The following table sets out details of awards of nil-cost options made during the year under the PSP: Amount vesting Threshold Maximum End of performance performance performance Date of award Face value % of face value % of face value period Gerard Ryan 1 August 2013 150% of salary 25% 100% 31 July 2016 David Broadbent 1 August 2013 125% of salary 25% 100% 31 July 2016 The face value was calculated using the share price the day before the day of grant of 636p.
The Remuneration Committee exercised discretion, in line with the remuneration policy and the rules of the plan, to approve a grant to Gerard Ryan of 150% of salary rather than the normal sized grant of 125% during 2013.
In the view of the Committee, Gerard Ryan had performed exceptionally well since joining the Company and his last PSP award in March 2012.
Rather than increase his salary, which in turn increases other elements of remuneration, the Committee determined to increase his performance-related remuneration.
Accordingly, a PSP award equal to 150% of salary was made.
This is intended as a one-off increase and will revert to 125% as the normal award for future years.
