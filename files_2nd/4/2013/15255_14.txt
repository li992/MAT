Shareholding guidelines There are no formal shareholding guidelines for executive Directors.
However, the Executive Directors are encouraged to invest and hold shares in the Company.
R M Steeves has an interest in excess of 3% of the issued share capital and G Hill has an interest in shares with a value equivalent to more than 100% of base salary as at 31 March 2013.

Remuneration policy for new hires When hiring a new executive Director, the Committee will typically seek to use the policy detailed in the table above to determine the executive Directors ongoing remuneration package.
To facilitate the hiring of candidates of the appropriate calibre required to implement the Groups strategy, the Committee retains the discretion to make remuneration decisions which are outside the policy.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, the nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction the candidate was recruited from to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both the Group and its shareholders.
The Committee may make an award in respect of hiring to buy-out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards and the time over which they would have vested.
The Committee may make use of Listing Rule 9.4.
Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2013 43 Governance Directors Remuneration report continued Pay policy for other employees The remuneration policy applied to the most senior executives in the Group is similar to the policy for the executive Directors in that a significant element of remuneration is dependent on Group and individual performance.
The key principles of the remuneration philosophy are applied consistently across the Group below this level, taking account of seniority and local market practice.
Executive Director pay mix The charts below show the balance of remuneration between fixed pay base salary and pension and variable pay short and long term incentive arrangements assuming maximum performance.
The maximum annual bonus potential is 100% of base salary.
The maximum LTIP Option potential is 150% of base salary for R M Steeves and 100% for G Hill.
The maximum LTIP Co-invest is 200% of base salary based on the full annual bonus of 100% of base salary being invested in shares and a two-for-one match being achieved on vesting.
The Committee believes that these proportions represent an appropriate balance between fixed income and performance-related remuneration linked to Synergys operational and strategic objectives.

Following the acquisition of SRI and reflecting the importance of the Americas region to the Group, R M Steeves has spent a substantial amount of time during the year working in the US.
The Board is in the processing of recruiting a new Chief Executive Officer for the Americas region, and hopes to have employed a suitable candidate by the end of the 2014 financial year.
In the meantime, the Company has formalised R M Steeves role as Chief Executive Officer of the Americas region and his ongoing role as Group Chief Executive Officer under two separate contracts effective 3 November 2012.
The intention is that the base salary of $566,190 will be paid under his US contract in respect of his US role and 115,000 in respect of his Group Chief Executive Officer role.
His total base salary remains unchanged at 466,000 under both contracts the US base salary has been converted at an exchange rate of $1.6131 to the 1.
As part of his US role, RM Steeves continues to be provided with a reasonable living expenses allowance and flight allowance for the purpose of family visits as set out above.
Following the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer for the Americas region, the intention is that the split of RM Steeves time and benefits will continue as provided under the two separate contracts, to reflect the importance of the Americas market to the Group.
The contract in the UK for the Group Chief Executive Officer role replaces the original agreement in the UK dated 1 November 1999.
No changes have been made to the notice periods in his UK contract set out above, or to the policy set out below relating to termination of an Executive Directors service contract.
44 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2013 Overview Business review Governance Financial Statements The policy below is applied in the event of termination of an executive Directors service contract: Policy The service contracts of all the executive Directors, contain a provision, exercisable at the option of the Group, Termination payments to pay an amount on early termination of employment.
The Committees policy is that payments to executive Directors on termination should reflect the circumstances that prevail at that time, also taking account of, if applicable and appropriate the Directors duty to mitigate.
No predetermined compensation is payable.
Such payments are usually equivalent to one years base salary and pension contributions.
Consideration will be given to the inclusion of additional elements relating to annual bonus and major benefits in kind unless termination is as a result of underperformance.
Typically for good leavers, bonus amounts as estimated by the Committee will be pro-rated for time in service to termination and will be, subject to performance, paid at the usual time.
The Group will use the pay in lieu of notice provisions when the speed, certainty and protection of restrictive covenants afforded by such clauses are thought to be in the best interests of the Group and the circumstances surrounding the departure of the relevant Director justify their use.
Vesting is governed by provisions relating to leavers in the relevant share scheme rules.
Vesting of long term incentives Non-executive Directors terms of appointment All non-executive Directors are engaged on letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities and confirm their remuneration.
The appointment details for the current non-executive Directors are as follows: Notice period by Date of current letter Expiry of current Notice period non-executive of appointment term by Group Director C F Baroudel 01.09.2010 25.07.2013 3 months 3 months E A Hewitt 01.09.2011 25.07.2013 3 months 3 months D K Nichol 01.11.2002 25.07.2013 3 months 3 months The Group may terminate each of these appointments at any time without the payment of compensation other than the notice payment.
