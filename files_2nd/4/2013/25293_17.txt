Although these arrangements are not a long term incentive scheme as the costs of these arrangements are borne by the investors in such funds the Company sought, and obtained, approval from its shareholders for such arrangements at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 21 January 1998.
Reconfirmation of the approval of the carried interest arrangements was obtained from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 May 2003.
It is not possible to put a monetary value on these interests, as they are dependent upon the performance of the relevant funds in the future.
