DIRECTORS REPORT ON REMUNERATION DEAR SHAREHOLDER I am pleased to introduce the Directors Report on Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2013, which has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board.
The Group delivered a strong performance in 2013.
Sales increased by 7.2%, profit before tax and exceptional items was up 11.2% to a record for the business of 274.6m.
Adjusted earnings per share rose by 11.3%.
In August 2013, the UK Government Department of Business, Innovation & Skills BIS published regulations setting out what companies must disclose in the Directors Report on Remuneration with the overall aim of improving transparency, empowering shareholders and promoting best practice.
This Report is divided into two sections.
The first is the Directors Remuneration Policy, which details the Groups remuneration policies and links to strategy as well as projected pay outcomes under various performance scenarios.
The second section is the Annual Report on Remuneration, which focuses on the implementation of the remuneration policy in 2013 including the total actual remuneration paid to each Director and details of performance against targets, and how we intend to implement our remuneration policy in 2014.
The Report complies with Regulation 11 and Schedule 8 of the Large and MediumSized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 and other relevant requirements of the FCA Listing Rules.
The Committee believes that the Company has complied with the provisions regarding remuneration matters contained within the UK Corporate Governance Code.
In particular, the Committee is satisfied that the approach to setting the structure of remuneration packages for senior executives underpins the effective and proper management of risk by rewarding executives fairly for sustainable profit growth REMUNERATION COMMITTEE FOCUS DURING THE YEAR: and long term returns to shareholders and delivering a significant There were no major changes to the Groups remuneration portion of senior executive remuneration in shares.

Our remuneration policy is based on the following objectives: Align with and support the Groups business strategy: Enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate executive management: Encourage the right behaviours, drive performance and reward results by delivering upper quartile pay for upper quartile performance: and Align executive management and shareholders interests.

Awards in 2011 were based on a percentage of salary, but were fixed as a number of shares for 2012 and 2013.
The Committee feels that fixing the award sizes as a number of shares provides strong alignment with shareholders as the face value of awards will fall if the share price falls and the face value will rise if the share price rises.
