Performance related remuneration for 2013 Profit share Reflecting the Groups very strong performance in 2013, profit share awards of 86% of maximum potential were earned by the Executive Directors compared to approximately 65% in respect of 2012, of which 27% will be delivered in the form of Savills shares, deferred for a further three years.
The following near term performance measures applied to the 2013 performance related profit share arrangements.
70% of the award was based on profit performance, defined as underlying PBT performance.
The target range, and Savills performance were as follows: First hurdle Maximum target Bonus award 20% of element 100% of element Savills performance % of element 54m 80m 75.2m 86.3% There are pre-defined hurdles between the first hurdle and maximum rather than straightline vesting.
The remaining 30% of performance profit share awards was based on individual performance against key strategic and operational objectives.
Jeremy Helsbys personal objectives included ensuring the successful integration of the Groups two UK businesses effective 1 January 2013, delivering the targeted improvement in the Groups overall margin, progressing the expansion of the Groups geographic footprint and broadening and strengthening the Groups service line offerings in all markets.

Savills plc 65 Report and Accounts 2013 Directors Remuneration report continued Long term incentives The PSP award granted in 2011 will vest in May 2014, subject to performance in the three years to 31 December 2013.
Following an assessment of Savills performance against targets set at grant, the Committee determined that 100% of the award should vest.
The targets and Savills performance were as follows: Threshold target Maximum target Weighting 25% vesting 100% vesting Savills performance Vesting % of maximum Relative TSR 50% Equal to index Outperform index by Exceeded target 100% versus FTSE Mid 250 8% p. a. compound index excluding investment trusts EPS growth 50% RPI plus 3% p. a. RPI plus 8% p. a. compound compound Exceeded target 100% Total 100% Non-Executive Directors fees audited The Non-Executive Director fees for 2013 were as follows: Peter Smith Tim Clare Charles Chairman Martin Angle Freshwater Hollingsworth McVeigh Basic Fee 150,000 45,000 45,000 45,000 45,000 Additional fees Senior Independent Director 5,000 Remuneration Committee Chairman 7,500 Audit Committee Chairman 10,000 2013 Total 150,000 60,000 45,000 52,500 45,000 2012 Total 150,000 58,225 45,000 39,375 46,875 The fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Non-Executive Chairman and the Executive Directors after considering external market research and individual roles and responsibilities.

Fees for acting as a Chairman of a Committee or as the Senior Independent Director, remain unchanged.

The information in this table has been audited by the independent Auditor,  LLP.
Operation of policy in 2014 The base salaries of the Executive Directors will not be increased in 2014.
For the profit share, the target weighting will be 70% in relation to the Groups annual profit performance and 30% in relation to delivery against a mix of strategic and operational objectives.
The Committee will keep the weighting of reward for delivery of corporate and strategic operational objectives under review for future years.
The Committee considers prospective disclosure of performance pay targets to be commercially sensitive and disclosure will therefore be on a retrospective basis.
The established policy in relation to PSP awards will continue to be applied, with the Group Chief Executive eligible to receive an award of up to 450k and the Group Chief Financial Officer of up to 250k.
During 2013, in light of some shareholder feedback, the Committee reviewed targets for the EPS element of the PSP awards and taking into account market conditions determined that the maximum EPS performance target for 2014 awards should be increased.
The EPS targets for 2014 awards are as follows: 25% ie threshold of the element to vest if the Companys EPS growth is RPI plus 3% p. a. compound 100% ie the maximum of the element to vest if the Companys EPS growth is RPI plus 10% p. a. compound or more historically 8% p. a. compound.
Straight-line vesting between the two points.
The other 50% of the award will be subject to relative TSR performance versus the FTSE Mid 250 index excluding investment trusts.
25% of the element will vest for equalling the index, with 100% vesting for outperforming the index by 8% p. a. compound or more.
Straight-line vesting will apply between these points.

For Non-Executive Directorships which are considered to arise by virtue of an Executive Directors or GEB members position within Savills, the fees are paid directly to Savills.
During 2013, Simon Shaw received a fee of 30,000 in relation to his continuing appointment as Non-Executive Chairman of Synairgen plc which he was permitted to keep.
