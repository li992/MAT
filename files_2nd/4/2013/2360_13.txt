It covers the remuneration of the executive and non-executive directors and is divided into two sections, as required by the new remuneration reporting regulations.
The policy report contains the three year remuneration policy to be submitted to shareholders in a binding vote at the 2014 AGM and the annual remuneration report Colin Holmes explains the application of the policy in 2013 and 2014.
As a result, the Committee is proposing that the Overview maximum award under the LTIP be increased from 100% to In 2013 Bovis Homes again delivered significant revenue and 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and to 125% of salary profit growth.

This demonstrates the strong EPS outstrategy.
The Committee considers the remuneration policy fair performance of the Group over the past three financial years, and fully aligned with the interests of shareholders and looks against stretching targets, with absolute cumulative EPS reaching forward to your support for the associated AGM votes.

motivated to ensure all the potential opportunities are fully realised for the benefit of its shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee, as part of an overall review of executive remuneration policy, therefore focused on long term performance related pay to ensure it is appropriately set for Colin Holmes Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Bovis Homes Group PLC | 43 Policy report Role of the Remuneration Committee The Committees principal responsibilities are to set, review and approve the remuneration policy and to determine the remuneration packages including incentive plans and their performance criteria and any changes to service contracts of the Chairman, executive directors and other designated senior executives including the Group Company Secretary.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Companys website www.
The remuneration policy The Committees remuneration policy is designed to provide a market competitive, performance-related package which supports and facilitates the delivery of the Companys strategy and the creation of long-term shareholder value.
This remuneration policy will be proposed for adoption at the 2014 AGM.
If approved it will apply on a legislative basis immediately following shareholder approval on 16 May 2014.
The Committee keeps the remuneration policy under review to ensure it promotes the attraction, retention and motivation of the high performing executive talent required to deliver the business strategy.
It is required that the policy be put to shareholders for approval every three years.
Should any changes be required before the end of a three year period, the amended policy will be put to shareholders, following shareholder consultation as appropriate.
Components of the remuneration framework for executive directors The policy table below summarises the main components of the remuneration framework, as detailed further in the report, a large proportion of which is performance related.

Notes to the policy table The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
There are no provisions for the recovery of sums paid.
The Company does not operate malus or clawback because the majority of measures approved by the Committee are outcome measures.
Flexibility is retained to amend bonus outcomes if they do not reflect business performance.
The executive directors may request and the Company may grant salary and bonus sacrifice arrangements.
The LTIP rules permit the substitution or variance of performance conditions to produce a fairer measure of performance as a result of an unforeseen event or transaction and include discretions for upwards adjustment to the number of shares to be realised in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or voluntary winding up.
Non-significant changes to the performance metrics may be made by use of discretion under the LTIP rules.
Awards are normally satisfied in shares, although there is flexibility to settle in cash.
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments that are not in line with the policy table set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed: i before the policy came into effect: or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an award over shares is agreed at the time the award is granted.
Performance measures for the annual bonus scheme and the LTIP are selected to focus the executive directors on strategic priorities, both short term and those related to long term sustainable performance, providing alignment with shareholder interests.
Targets for each performance measure are then set by the Committee in light of strategic objectives over the short term for the annual bonus scheme and over at least a three year performance period for the LTIP.
In setting targets the Committee takes into account a number of reference points including internal and analysts forecasts.
Bovis Homes Group PLC | 45 Policy report Illustration of the application of the remuneration policy Our aim is to ensure that superior reward is only paid for exceptional performance, with a substantial proportion of executive directors reward opportunity being performance related.
The charts below set out remuneration scenarios for each executive director at three levels of performance, as a percentage of the total reward opportunity and as a total value.

The level of fees must be within the limit approved by shareholders, contained in the Articles of Association.
Non-executive directors and the Chairman do not participate in the annual bonus scheme or the LTIP and are not eligible to join the Groups pension schemes.

46 | Annual report and accounts | Our governance 6% 4% 10% 7% 18% 13% Remuneration report Our governance m Policy report Approach to recruitment In agreeing a remuneration package for a new executive director, it would be expected that the structure and quantum of variable pay elements would reflect those set out in the policy table above.
However, the Committee would retain the discretion to flex the balance between annual and long-term incentives and the measures used to assess performance for these elements, with the intention that a significant proportion would be delivered in shares.
Salary would reflect the skills and experience of the individual, and may be set at a level to allow future progression to reflect performance in the role.
On recruitment, relocation benefits may be paid as appropriate.
This overall approach would also apply to internal appointments, with the proviso that any commitments entered into before promotion which are inconsistent with this policy can continue to be honoured under the policy.
Similarly, if an executive director is appointed following the Companys acquisition of or merger with another company, legacy terms and conditions would be honoured.
An executive director may initially be hired on a contract requiring 24 months notice which then reduces pro-rata over the first year of the contract to requiring 12 months notice.
The Committee may award compensation for the forfeiture of awards from a previous employer in such form as the Committee considers appropriate taking account of all relevant factors including the expected value of the award, performance achieved or likely to be achieved, the proportion of the performance period remaining and the form of the award.
There is no specific limit on the value of such awards, but the Committees intention is that the value awarded would be equivalent to the value forfeited.
Maximum variable pay will be in line with the maximum set out in the policy table above excluding buy-outs.
The Committee retains discretion to make appropriate remuneration decisions outside the standard Policy to meet the individual circumstances when: An interim appointment is made to a fill an executive director role on a short-term basis.
Exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a non-executive director takes on an executive function on a short-term basis.
For non-executive directors, the Board would consider the appropriate fees for a new appointment taking into account the existing level of fees paid to the non-executive directors, the experience and ability of the new non-executive director and the time commitment and responsibility of the role.
Service contracts and exit payments policy The current executive directors service contracts contain the key elements shown below.
Provision Detailed terms Notice period 12 months by either employer or director Termination payment Up to 12 months salary excluding bonus or other enhancement The executive directors service contracts do not contain specific provision for compensation in the event of early termination, with the exception of 12 months base salary in the event of removal at an AGM.
When determining exit payments, the Committee would take account of a variety of factors, including individual and business performance, the obligation for the director to mitigate loss for example, by gaining new employment, the directors length of service and any other relevant circumstances, such as ill health.
A departing director may also be entitled to a payment in respect of statutory rights.
Should a departing director be required to retire and be eligible for an early retirement pension under the terms of the defined benefit pension arrangement, an actuarial reduction will only be applied, in accordance with the rules, if the departing director has not reached age 55.
The Committee would distinguish between types of leaver in respect of incentive plans.
Good leavers death, ill-health, agreed retirement, redundancy or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee may be considered for a bonus payment having completed the full year and part year bonus payments may be paid and LTIP awards may vest taking into account performance conditions and pro rating for time in employment during the performance period, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
The LTIP rules include discretion for upwards adjustment to the number of shares to be realised for good leavers and, in exceptional circumstances, adjustment to the realisation date.
In all other leaver circumstances, the Committee would decide the approach taken, which would ordinarily mean that leavers would not be entitled to consideration for a bonus and LTIP awards would lapse.
The appointment of the Chairman and each of the non-executive directors is for an initial period of three years, which is renewable for further terms, and is terminable by the Chairman non-executive director as applicable or the Company on twelve months notice.
No contractual payments would be due on termination.
There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination for the non-executive directors, with the exception of entitlement to compensation equivalent to 12 months fees or, if less, the balance of appointment, in the event of removal at an AGM.
Bovis Homes Group PLC | 47 Policy report Change of control The LTIP rules include discretion for upwards adjustment to the number of shares to be realised, subject to the performance conditions and awards being pro-rated for service, in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or voluntary winding up.
Additionally, all the Companys share plans contain provisions relating to change of control.
In general, outstanding awards would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been satisfied at that time, reflecting the time period to the date of the event.
External directorships Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of suitable companies and organisations outside the Group.
Pay and conditions throughout the Group The pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group are considered by the Committee in setting remuneration policy for the executive directors and senior management.
The Committee is kept regularly informed on the pay and benefits provided to employees and base salary increase data from the annual salary review for general staff is considered when reviewing executive directors salaries and those of senior management.
The Committee does not directly consult with employees when setting remuneration policy for the executive directors.
Difference in the Companys policy on remuneration of directors compared to employees The remuneration policy for the executive directors is designed with pay and conditions throughout the Group in mind.
The Committee believes that some differences are necessary to reflect responsibility and provide appropriate focus and motivation for delivery of the Groups strategy.
Executive directors, therefore, have a higher bonus opportunity than employees generally to motivate them to achieve stretching annual targets and they participate in the LTIP to provide focus on long term sustainable performance.
This approach is designed to provide an appropriate emphasis on performance related pay.
Consideration of shareholder views The Company is committed to ongoing dialogue with shareholders and welcomes feedback on directors remuneration.
Feedback received from meetings during the year and in relation to the AGM is considered, together with guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally, and taken into account in the annual review of remuneration policy.
The Committee believes that it has a responsible approach to directors pay and that its policy is appropriate and fit for purpose.
Support from shareholders is evidenced by the 99.3% approval of the 2012 Directors Remuneration Report at the 2013 AGM see the annual remuneration report for further details.
A letter was sent to major shareholders on 8 January 2014 setting out the proposed increase to maximum award levels for the LTIP and their feedback indicated that they were supportive of this change.

Executive share options granted in 2003 vested on 24 February 2012 and a value of 51k, representing the taxable gain, has been included in 2012 for D J Ritchie, calculated using the share price on the vesting date 505.5 pence.
9 This is an estimated value based on the average share price over the last quarter of 2013 of 770.44 pence for the EPS element of the 2011 LTIP which vests on 15 March 2014.
Neither of the executive directors currently has any external directorships.

Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan Long term incentive awards are made in the form of performance shares or nil-cost options under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting.
Each award is made subject to the achievement of performance criteria as set out below and will ordinarily vest after three years.
Discretions available to the Committee contained in the LTIP rules are set out in the policy table and also in the exit payments policy.
Awards vesting in respect of 2013 The LTIP awards made in 2011 were measured over the three year period to 31 December 2013 and will vest to the extent of 50% on 15 March 2014.
Half of the award was measured against EPS performance, whilst the other half of the award was measured against TSR performance against an index.
The threshold EPS target was 55p, and maximum target was 80p measured on a cumulative three year basis.
Absolute cumulative EPS over the three year performance period was 93.1p.
Therefore, all of the part of the award based on EPS will vest.
The threshold TSR target was performance equal to the index and the maximum target was performance equal to 10% annual outperformance of the index.
Actual TSR was below the median of the index of 188% and therefore none of the award based on TSR will vest.
Awards granted on 26 February 2013 audited Awards of 110,854 shares were made to executive directors at 100% of basic salary at a grant price of 6.495, exercisable in 2016 and subject to a three year performance period ending on 31 December 2015, as follows: Number of shares Face value at date % of face value that Executive director Type of award awarded of grant 000 would vest at threshold David Ritchie Performance share award 69,284 450 30 Jonathan Hill Performance share award 41,570 270 30 The performance measures are unchanged from the prior year, namely TSR 33.3%, EPS 33.3% and ROCE 33.3%.
The performance targets are: TSR threshold performance equal to the median of the comparator group and maximum performance at median plus 10% per annum unchanged from the prior year.
EPS threshold performance at cumulative EPS of 130 pence and maximum performance at cumulative EPS of 165 pence.
ROCE threshold performance at 11.5% and maximum performance at 14.5%.

This is reflected in the strong profit improvement delivered by the Company in 2013 and the excellent positioning of the Group for 2014, following a difficult period for the house building industry.
The Committee decided that given his performance, increased experience and strong contribution to the Group, an increase of 3.70% would be made to the salary of Jonathan Hill, the GFD.
An allowance of just over 3% of salary roll was provided for general staff increases.

Bovis Homes Group PLC | 57 6% 4% 10% 7% 18% 13% m Annual remuneration report Approach to annual bonus Following the annual review, it was concluded that the annual bonus scheme continues to measure key elements of performance that are in line with the Companys stated strategy over the shorter term and so no changes are to be made for 2014 in terms of either performance measures or quantum.
The Committee has decided not to disclose the detail of performance targets in advance as they are considered commercially sensitive, being indicative performance indicators closely linked to the Groups growth strategy.
It is not intended to provide this information in future years.
However, the 2014 performance measures are described below.

50% Challenges management to deliver and out-perform profit target.

Non-financial measures 10% Customer service Quality of service is key to reputation and future success, both in 10% terms of customer demand and achieved selling prices.
Total opportunity 100% Approach for Long Term Incentive Plan awards The key features of the long term incentive arrangements remain the same as those for 2013 with the exception of: Award sizes increased to 150% of salary for the CEO and 125% of salary for the GFD subject to 2014 AGM approval.
Performance conditions Total Shareholder Return one-third of total award The target for maximum vesting of outperformance of the index by 10% per annum is historically equal to at least upper quartile performance, and is thus deemed appropriately stretching.
TSR will be calculated using a three month averaging period at the start and end of the period to smooth the impact of share price volatility on vesting.
Performance measurement Target performance Maximum performance TSR Equal to the median of the Index Median plus 10% per annum The constituents of the TSR index to be used for the 2014 awards have been increased by the addition of Crest Nicholson Holdings plc.

When setting minimum and maximum absolute EPS targets for the 2014 awards, the Committee considered data providing visibility over the three year performance period, including internal forecasts and analysts forecasts, and set absolute minimum and maximum EPS targets of 230p and 280p per share to be measured on a cumulative basis over the three year performance period.
Where EPS falls below the minimum, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS can be realised.
