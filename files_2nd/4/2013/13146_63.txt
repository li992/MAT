New UK basis columns d, g and j : These figures are calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in the new UK Regulations.
They include, for performance related share-based awards, the value attributable to share price appreciation since the date the award was granted.
In the case of the CEOs figures, the amount included that relates to share price appreciation is 3m for 2012 and 1.2m for 2013.
Dutch Civil Code basis columns e, h and k : These figures comply with the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code.
The figures for share-based awards comprise the multi-year incentives charges in accordance with IFRS2 Share-Based Payment.
These IFRS2 charges do not reflect the actual value received on vesting.
The figures for pensions reflect the cost of pension provision which comprises i for defined benefit schemes, the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension during the year net of inflation, Directors contributions and participation fee and ii for defined contribution schemes, payments made to the scheme or to the Executive Director in lieu of pension.
Consistent with prior disclosure columns f, i and l : We believe including these figures is helpful for our non-UK shareholders as the calculation methodology for share-based awards and defined benefit pensions is consistent with what has been used in previous reports although we have reflected amounts in the same year as required by the New UK basis to facilitate comparison.
Accordingly, values are calculated as follows: i for share-based awards, the value of the vested award at grant excluding any subsequent share price movement as shown in the share-based award tables in prior reports and including dividend equivalents if applicable: ii for options, 20% of face value at grant based on our previously disclosed 5:1 exchange ratio for options to shares applicable to ESOS participants below the Board, as described in the 2013 Notices of Annual General Meetings : iii for defined benefit pension, the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension during the year net of inflation, Directors contributions and participation fee and iv for defined contribution pension schemes, payments made to the scheme or to the Executive Director in lieu of pension.
Share-based awards for Erik Engstrom columns d and f : The 2012 figures reflect the vesting of tranche 1 of the REGP and the 2010 BIP, both measured over the 2010-12 period.
The vesting percentages under these plans were determined on 25 April 2013 and are in line with estimates in the 2012 Remuneration Report pages 81 and 82.
The figures include the related dividend equivalent payments paid out in cash in 2013 in respect of both plans.
The 2012 REGP figures reflect the entire amount that was performance tested over the 2010-12 period, including the 50% of shares deferred until 2015 in accordance with the plan rules.
The 2013 figures represent the 2011-13 cycle of the BIP and ESOS.
As the BIP vests after the approval date of the Report, and the ESOS vests in May 2014, the average share prices for the last quarter of 2013 have been used to arrive at an estimated figure under the New UK basis in respect of both awards.
The proportion of the value of the CEOs share-based awards under the New UK basis that relates to share price appreciation between the dates of grant and vesting is 36% or 3m for 2012 and 47% or 1.2m for 2013 using, as required, the average share prices for the last quarter of 2013.
Benefits: Each Executive Director receives a car allowance, private medical dental insurance and the company meets the cost of tax return preparation.
In 2013, Duncan Palmer received a one-off cash relocation allowance of 500,000 which was paid to him in May 2013 in recognition of him and his family being required to relocate to the UK from the US see page 84 of last years report.
As a result of his resignation, Duncan Palmer became required to repay this to the company through payroll deductions, bydeduction from his 2013 annual incentive payment, so it has not been included in column b.
He also received reimbursement of direct relocation expenses, under Reed Elseviers relocation policy, amounting to 200,907, which is included.
Duncan Palmers 2012 figures: Columns a to c, g and i reflect the amount Duncan Palmer received from his date of joining Reed Elsevier 24 August 2012 until the end of the year.
The 2012 share-based award figures in columns d and f relate to the restricted shares granted to compensate him for the forfeiture of awards from his former employer as disclosed in last years report, reduced to reflect time served up to the point of giving notice of resignation.
The figure in column f includes estimated dividend equivalents of 46,977.
Exchange rates used for share-based awards: The exchange rates used to convert share-based awards to pounds sterling are i for the New UK basis, those that applied at the vesting dates or, if vesting has not occurred, the average exchange rates for the last quarter of 2013, ii for consistent with prior disclosure, those that applied at the grant dates, iii for dividend equivalents, the exchange rates at the time of payment and iv for estimated dividend equivalents yet to be paid, the 31 December 2013 rates disclosed under Statement of Financial Position in note 30 to the combined financial statements.
Total remuneration for Directors: This is set out in note 29 to the combined financial statements on pages 136 and 137.
