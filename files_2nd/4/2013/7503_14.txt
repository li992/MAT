Remuneration report The Remuneration Committee the Committee works hard to ensure that the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors supports the business strategy and that the level of remuneration received is reflective of the overall business performance and the returns received by shareholders.
A significant proportion of the remuneration package comes from variable pay 60% at target performance, with careful consideration given to the choice of performance metrics to ensure that the executives are not encouraged to take inappropriate risks.
The transition to a more customer focused culture across all our businesses is reflected in the use of customer service metrics in the annual bonus scheme.
In the UK, our focus on improving customer service has been particularly successful with the number of complaints received reduced by 40%.
Bonus payments for the year ended 31st March 2013 range from 75% to 89% of salary no bonuses were paid for the prior year, reflecting the significant progress made in improving the customer experience, the commercial performance of the business and the achievement of individual objectives.
The share-based long-term incentive awards performance and matching awards are based on relative total shareholder return and, for the 2010 and 2011 awards, an earnings per share growth target.
HomeServes share price underperformed the FTSE 250 during the period to June 2012 and the 2009 awards lapsed accordingly.
The 2010 awards due to vest in June 2013 are currently below the minimum vesting threshold.
The salary review date for all employees has been moved from 1 April to 1 July.
Martin Bennett was the only Executive Director to receive a salary increase last year reflecting his promotion.
In setting the salary levels for the Executive Directors, the Committee is mindful of the pay and employment conditions for all our employees across the Group.
An increase of 2.5% has been agreed for 2013 which reflects the average pay increase expected to be given to HomeServes employees in the UK.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the current policy supports the needs of the business, drives the right behaviours and appropriately rewards executives.
Accordingly no changes to the remuneration policy are proposed for 2013 14.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 the Act and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and has been approved by the Board and the Remuneration Committee.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules and describes how the Board has applied the principles within the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code the Code relating to Directors remuneration.
An advisory resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The Act requires the external auditors to report on certain parts of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with it.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 58 Governance The Remuneration Committee is aware of the proposed changes to the reporting and approval of directors remuneration that have been put forward by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.
The proposed change will take effect for the Company from 1 April 2014.
As the new disclosure requirements are still to be finalised at the time of drafting this report, the Committee has chosen not to early adopt any of the proposals.
Notwithstanding this, the Committee believes that the Remuneration report, in its current format, provides a clear and transparent account of the policy for Directors remuneration and its application during the year under review.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee Members Ian Chippendale Chair Stella David JM Barry Gibson Mark Morris All of the members are independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Board determined that the Company Chairman, Barry Gibson, should remain a member of the Committee taking account of the fact that he was considered to be independent on appointment and also that, as a former Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, his knowledge of the development of the remuneration policy and practices at HomeServe is invaluable.
He takes no part in discussions relating to his own remuneration.
Responsibilities The primary responsibilities of the Committee are to: determine the Groups overall remuneration strategy determine the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee approve the grant and exercise of executive long-term incentive arrangements and oversee the operation of other share-based plans across the Group.
In determining remuneration policy, the Committee is free to obtain such professional advice as it sees fit, and it periodically monitors both the policies of comparator companies and current market practice, in order to ensure that the packages provided are sufficient to attract and retain Executive Directors of the necessary quality.
The Committee aims to develop and recommend remuneration strategies that drive performance and reward it appropriately.
In determining its policy, the Committee has paid regard to the principles and provisions of good governance contained in the Code.
The Committee operates under the delegated authority of the Board and its terms of reference are available on the website.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Board.
No Director is involved in determining his or her own remuneration.
The Committee has also agreed and implemented a procedure for reviewing and assessing its own effectiveness.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 59 Remuneration report Advisers During the year New Bridge Street NBS, a firm of independent remuneration consultants, served as advisers to the Committee.
The Company also instructed NBS to advise it on a limited number of remuneration matters concerning individuals below the Executive Committee during the year.
Other than in relation to advice on remuneration, NBS has no other connections with the Company.
NBS is a trading name of Aon Hewitt Ltd, the ultimate parent company of which is Aon plc.
Aon Benfield another Aon company provides underwriting advice and services to HomeServe.
The Remuneration Committee is comfortable that this does not present a conflict of interest as Aon Benfield and NBS operate entirely independently of one another.
The terms of engagement for NBS are available on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee has also received assistance from Richard Harpin, Group Chief Executive, Mike Winstone, Group HR Director and Anna Maughan, Company Secretary, all of whom attended meetings of the Committee as required.
No executive took part in discussions in respect of matters relating directly to their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy The Committees remuneration policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors and other senior executives is based on the following principles: to provide a remuneration package that is sufficient, but no more than necessary, to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives: to align rewards with the Groups performance: to reward good performance with remuneration that is in line with that payable by broadly comparable businesses i. e. companies of a similar size and those with similar operating characteristics: to reward exceptional performance in such a way as to align the executives interests with those of the Companys shareholders, with the potential to deliver above market levels of reward for outstanding performance.
To that end, the Committee structures executive remuneration in two distinct parts: fixed remuneration of basic salary, pension and benefits and variable performance-related remuneration in the form of a cash bonus and long-term incentive arrangements.
Remuneration for Executive Directors is structured so that the variable pay element forms a significant portion of each Directors package.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 60 Governance The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable pay at on-target and maximum performance levels under the normal remuneration policy for the Executive Directors.
In the case of the long-term incentive arrangements, the charts assume certain levels of share price growth.
Maximum performance assumes the achievement of maximum bonus and full vesting of shares under the Companys long-term incentive arrangements.
They demonstrate the significant weighting of the package towards variable performancerelated pay.
In particular, the majority of Executive Directors total remuneration at the maximum performance level will derive from the Companys long-term incentive arrangements, which are strongly aligned to shareholder value creation.
On-target remuneration Maximum remuneration 21% 42% 38% 62% 17% 20% Fixed pay Short-term variable pay Long-term variable pay The Committee is satisfied that neither the structure of the remuneration packages, with the high weighting on variable pay, nor the performance measures targeted under the annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements, encourage inappropriate risk taking.
The remuneration arrangements are designed so as to provide a strong alignment of interest between the executives and shareholders and to support the growth and performance aspirations of the Company and the Committee is satisfied that the current arrangements meet these objectives.
Furthermore, a claw-back provision to annual bonuses and long-term incentive awards was introduced in 2011 which helps to further guard against excessive risk-taking.
The Committee has the discretion to take into account performance on environmental, social and governance matters when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
As detailed later in this report, a customer satisfaction related element was added to the bonus arrangements for 2012 13.
However, the Committee has chosen not to take any other matters into specific account in setting performance targets in the belief that the structures in place neither encourage nor reward inappropriate behaviour and that relevant operational controls relating to such matters are in place.

Annual Report & Accounts 2013 62 Governance Remuneration for Executive Directors The main components of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are: Basic salary Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual.
Salary levels are determined taking into account pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere in the Company and market data on salary levels for similar positions at comparable companies in the FTSE 250.
Historically, salaries were reviewed annually in April unless responsibilities changed but the decision has been taken to move the review date to July to allow performance development reviews to be completed and the results to be taken into account when determining any salary increases.
As a transitional measure, in 2013 any increase will be retrospectively applied to salary earned from 1 April 2013.
No salary increases were awarded to the Executive Directors in April 2012.
Martin Bennett was appointed to the new role of Group Chief Operating Officer from the role of CFO in January 2012.
Given the difficulties facing the business and the newness of the role, the Remuneration Committee felt that it was not appropriate to review his salary at that time.
In November 2012, by which time Martin Bennett was established in the COO role and performing well, the Committee agreed to review his salary.
It was agreed that in light of the change in scope of his position, his personal performance and criticality to the business an increase should be awarded.
A 13.4% increase was applied from October 2012, bringing his salary to 375,000.
For 2013, an increase of 2.5% has been agreed in respect of Messrs Harpin, Ford and King.
This reflects the general increase being given to HomeServe employees in the UK.
The current salaries for the Executive Directors are therefore as follows: Name of Director R Harpin 535,819 M Bennett 375,000 J Ford 281,875 J King 377,456 Annual Report & Accounts 2013 63 Remuneration report Annual bonus The annual bonus is designed to drive and reward excellent short-term operating performance of the Company and encourage the delivery of consistently good customer outcomes and real yearon-year growth in profitability.
No annual bonus is paid unless a very high level of performance is achieved.
Executive Directors bonuses are paid entirely in cash, though under the Long Term Incentive Plan adopted in 2008, Directors have the opportunity to invest part of their net bonus in shares.
If they choose to do this, they may be awarded a matching award which vests after three years subject to a comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition.
2012 13 The bonus potential was 100% of salary.
As reported last year, the Remuneration Committee undertook a detailed review of the bonus objectives and some significant changes were introduced with a view to ensuring that customer outcomes were of equal importance to commercial outcomes.
Bonus objectives were as follows: Customer objectives Commercial objectives Personal objectives 1 40% of bonus 40% of bonus 20% of bonus A reduction in customer Profit before tax An improvement in employee complaints Core renewable customers engagement An increase in customer Up to four other stretching satisfaction personal objectives 1 Johnathan Ford joined part way through the year.
His bonus entitlement was pro rated accordingly and a higher weighting on personal objectives was applied 40% of the total.
Executive Directors with a specific responsibility for a particular territory were able to earn a higher proportion of bonus potential based on their respective territory.
This applied to Jonathan King and Martin Bennett, both of whom had specific responsibility for the UK.
Stringent bonus gates were applied with the customer objectives being considered first.
If an agreed percentage of the customer objectives was not achieved, no bonus would be payable.
If customer objectives were achieved, the level of profit and therefore affordability would be considered.
Strong performance was achieved in respect of the customer objectives with customer complaints reducing in all territories exceeding the stretch target set at the start of the year and improvements in customer satisfaction levels, particularly in the UK and USA.
On the commercial objectives, the Group exceeded its target in respect of profit before tax whilst narrowly missing the target in respect of core renewable customers except in the USA where the target was achieved.
The Committee reviewed the achievement against the personal objectives which had been set for each of the Directors at the start of the year based on their area of responsibility and payments for this element ranged from 80% to 90% of the maximum.
Total bonuses payable in respect of 2012 13 were between 75% and 89% of salary pro-rated for Johnathan Ford who joined part way through the year.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 64 Governance 2013 14 Bonus potential will remain at 100% of salary and the bonus objectives will follow the model introduced in 2012 13.
Provided their personal objectives are met in full, the normal on-target bonus payable to Executive Directors in any year is expected to be in the region of 60% of their basic salary.
Long-term incentives The Committees policy for the provision of long-term incentives to Executive Directors is to grant awards of performance shares performance awards and to provide them with the opportunity to invest their annual bonus voluntarily into a matching share arrangement matching awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan adopted in 2008 the LTIP.
The maximum individual award limit under the LTIP is 200% of basic salary for performance awards and for matching awards of up to two shares for each share invested, based on a maximum investment of the net of tax equivalent of 75% of the maximum bonus potential.
Awards under the LTIP may be satisfied through a mixture of either market purchase or new issue shares.
To the extent new issue shares are used, the 2008 LTIP will adhere to a 5% in 10 year dilution limit.
2012 awards Details of the LTIP awards granted in June 2012 are set out later in this report.
As set out in last years Remuneration report, the awards are subject to a relative TSR performance condition.
It should be noted that in relation to the matching awards, bonuses for 2011 12 were zero, so no bonus deferral was possible.
However, as permitted under the Rules, Richard Harpin chose to invest the equivalent of 25% of his salary, from his own money, in shares thereby receiving a corresponding matching award.
2013 awards It is the Committees intention to grant performance awards in 2013 in line with the normal grant policy of 150% of salary.
The awards will be subject to the same relative TSR performance condition as applied to the 2012 awards.
Matching awards will also continue to be granted where executives choose to invest in accordance with the Rules.
The performance condition for the matching awards will be same as for the performance awards.
Save As You Earn Scheme Executive Directors may participate in the Groups Save As you Earn Scheme where share options are exercisable after three or five years at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares at the time of grant.
No performance criteria are attached to this scheme.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 65 Remuneration report Benefits Non-pension benefits comprise company car, fuel allowance and medical insurance.
The range of benefits and their value are considered to be broadly in line with those provided to executive directors in similar companies in the FTSE-250.
Shareholding guidelines It is the Boards policy that Executive Directors and certain members of the Companys senior management build up and retain a minimum shareholding in the Company.
Each Executive Director is encouraged to hold shares of at least equal value to his annual basic salary.
If the holding guideline has not been fulfilled at the point of exercise of any option or the vesting of any other long-term incentive award, the Director must retain 50% of the net proceeds in the Companys shares until the holding requirement is achieved.
Details of the current shareholdings of the Executive Directors are provided later in this report.
Service contracts The Committees policy is to offer service contracts with notice periods of one year or less other than in exceptional circumstances, where longer initial notice periods may be offered on appointment, and then reduced to one year over time.
All Executive Directors contracts of service are terminable on 12 months notice by either party.
Dates of current contracts are summarised in the table below: Name Date of contract R Harpin 18 January 2002 M Bennett 26 June 2012 J Ford 1 October 2012 J King 21 September 2011 The Company may terminate the executives employment by making a payment equivalent to one years remuneration excluding bonus in the case of Messrs Bennett, Ford and King.
Notice periods and payments are not extendable in takeover situations.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 66 Governance Pensions Executive Directors currently participate in one of two pension schemes with benefits limited to their notional capped salary.
An unapproved pension contribution is paid in respect of basic salary above the cap.
The Water Companies Pension Scheme A funded, Inland Revenue approved occupational defined benefit scheme Members Richard Harpin Jonathan King Main features Pension at normal retirement age of one-half of final pensionable salary and a tax free lump sum of one and a half times final pensionable salary on completion of 40 years service at an accrual rate of 80ths plus 3 80ths cash: Life assurance of five times basic salary: Pension payable in the event of ill health: Spouses pension on death: Normal retirement at age 60.

An unapproved pension contribution, equal to 20% of the amount by which basic salary exceeds the notional cap is paid annually.
Executives may choose to have this amount paid directly into their pension or may receive it as cash.
The notional cap is indexed in line with earnings inflation.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 67 Remuneration report Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors serve under letters of appointment for periods of three years.
The NonExecutive Directors have a notice period of three months but no liquidated damages are payable.
Their fees are determined by the Executive Directors within the limits set by the Articles of Association and are based on information on fees paid in similar companies and the skills and expected time commitment of the individual concerned.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to bonus payments or pension arrangements, nor do they participate in the Companys long-term incentive plans.
Details of their current three year appointments are as follows: Name Date of contract J M B Gibson 1 April 2013 I Chippendale 1 January 2013 S David 23 November 2010 B Mingay 1 January 2012 M Morris 27 February 2012 The fees for the Non-Executive Directors were last reviewed in January 2010 with the changes being effective from 1 April 2010.
During the year, the base Board fee was 44,000 with a premium for Chairmanship of the Audit & Risk and Remuneration Committees of 8,500.
Ian Chippendale received an additional fee of 5,000 for his role as Senior Independent Director.
Barry Gibson received 200,000 for his role as Chairman.

05 The DBP was introduced in 2005.
Under its terms, Executive Directors were able to invest some or all of their annual bonus into shares and to defer receipt for three years.
Matching shares could be earned if the TSR of the Company over a three year period exceeded the median of the FTSE- 350 index of companies excluding investment trusts.
Mr Harpin elected to convert his vested award into a nil cost option at the end of the performance period.
The option can be exercised at any time up until the tenth anniversary of grant.

The price of an ordinary share on 5 July 2012 when the options were exercised was 1.64.
The market price of the Companys shares on 27 June 2012, the date the 2012 LTIP awards were granted was 1.509.
The performance conditions in respect of the LTIP awards granted in 2009 and 2012 are based exclusively on a TSR performance condition, an EPS target was added in 2010 and 2011.
The performance period for the TSR condition runs for three years from the date of grant and requires HomeServes TSR to match that of the FTSE 250 Index for 25% of the shares to vest, rising on a straight-line basis so that full vesting required out-performance of the Index by 15% per annum.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 74 Governance The performance period for the EPS condition applicable to 50% of the 2010 and 2011 awards is three financial years, starting with the year in which the award is granted.
25% of the EPS awards will vest for average annual EPS growth of RPI 4%, increasing in a straight line basis to 100% vesting where average EPS growth is RPI 10%.
For the 2009 awards which are subject to a single TSR condition, HomeServes TSR was below that of the FTSE 250 Index at the end of the performance period and the awards lapsed accordingly.
As at 31 March 2013, for the 2010 and 2011 HomeServes TSR performance was below the FTSE 250 Index.
