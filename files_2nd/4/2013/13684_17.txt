Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc Annual report and accounts 2013 49 remUnerATiOn repOrT lETTER TO ShAREhOlDERS Dear Shareholder This report sets out the remuneration policy for the directors of RPC Group Plc and discloses amounts paid to them over the course of the financial year.
The Government has tabled proposals to reform the way Directors remuneration is voted upon and reported.
The new legislative requirements will not come into effect until October 2013 but, although not mandatory for this report, the Committee has sought to comply with a number of the new requirements early in the interests of best practice.
Therefore, this report has been split into two sections: Remuneration Policy report which sets out the policy on the remuneration of the executive and non-executive directors: and Implementation report which discloses how the current remuneration policy has been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2013.
We will be seeking your support for both parts of the report by way of a single advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM.
PeRFoRManCe anD ReWaRD The Remuneration Committee considers that the remuneration paid to the executive directors during the year ended 31 March 2013 fairly reflects their individual performance during the year while recognising the challenges that the Company has faced in difficult macro-economic conditions inthe Eurozone and UK.
Reflecting both the difficult trading conditions and challenging targets, the threshold PBIT profit before interest and tax annual bonus target was not metand, as a result, no bonus is payable to the executive directors for the year ended 31 March 2013.
The 2010 Performance Share Plan PSP awards, which had a three-year performance period ending 31 March 2013, is expected to vest in full.
sUMMaRY oF KeY DeCIsIons In THe YeaR Following the announcement in early October 2012 that the Chief executive intended to retire and would be succeeded by the Finance Director, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the executive director remuneration policy and has made a number of changes.
A summary of the remuneration policy which will operate for 2013 14, together with the main components of the packages for the newly appointed executive directors is as follows: The Committee has agreed that a competitive, market salary should be paid to the newly appointed Chief executive as a consequence of his five years experience and knowledge of the business which has enabled him to make a seamless transition to the role.
Consequently, his basic salary from his 1 May 2013 appointment date will be 470,000 p. a.
In order to attract the best candidate for the role, the Committee has set a market level basic salary for the Finance Director of 310,000 p. a.
The annual bonus potential will continue to be capped at 100% of salary and based on challenging sliding scale PBIT targets.
However, reflecting the Remuneration Committees desire to align management performance targets with Return on Capital Employed ROCE, oneofthe key Company objectives, a ROCe moderator will be introduced.
This means that bonuses for the year ending 31 March 2014 will bereduced by 12.5% if the targeted level of free cash flow generation is not achieved and by 12.5% if the targeted ROCe is not achieved.
As part of the recruitment negotiations involving the newly appointed executive directors and connected to the Committees intention to move the executive remuneration policy closer to market norms, annual PSP awards for executive directors will be increased from 75% of basic salary to 125% of basic salary.
Reflecting the increase in award levels and the Committees desire to introduce an additional performance measure, performance conditions will be amended compared with prior years by reducing the threshold level of vesting from 25% to 20% of an award, increasing the EPS target at the top end and introducing a relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition for one third of PSP awards.
Further, shareholding guidelines have been increased from 50% to 100% of basic salary and the Committee has introduced a clawback provision into the PSP rules.
The Committee has made the performance target ranges more stretching and designed the bonus and PSP scales so that only 50% of an award will be paid at 60% of the target range.
sHaReHolDeR enGaGeMenT The Committee continues to take an active interest in shareholder views on our executive remuneration policy and is mindful of the concerns of shareholders and other stakeholders.
In this regard, while formal shareholder approval was not required, the changes to the remuneration policy for 2013 14 were discussed with the Companys major investors before this report was finalised.
Those consulted were generally supportive of the new remuneration policy.
Our voting result at the 2012 AGM was 99.8% in favour of the Directors Remuneration report resolution.
We hope to receive your continued support at the forthcoming AGM.

RPC Group Plc 52 Annual report and accounts 2013 remUnerATiOn repOrT continued DeTaIleD ReMUneRaTIon PolICY The key components of the remuneration of executive directors are set out below.
BasIC salaRY Salaries for executive directors and senior managers are reviewed annually by the Committee, although not necessarily increased.
Salary increases are determined after taking into account an individuals responsibilities, abilities, experience and performance as well as both the Groups own salary structures, pay and conditions in the relevant countries as described above and, although used with caution, market data on salary rates for similar positions in comparative companies.
Salary levels for the newly appointed Chief Executive and Finance Director both appointed to their respective roles on 1 May 2013 which, due to their experience, have been set at broadly market levels from appointment, are as follows: annual salary Chief executive P R M Vervaat 470,000 Finance Director S J Kesterton 310,000 P R M Vervaats basic salary, which is paid in euros, equated to 272,000 p. a. plus an ex-pat allowance which will cease of 28,000 p. a. up to 30 April 2013 in respect of his previous role asFinance Director.
The next salary review date will be 1 April 2014 although as the basic salaries presented above are considered by the Committee to be marketcompetitive, absent a material change to the size and nature of the role and or Group, future increases are expected to be limited toinflationary increases.
BeneFITs In KInD The policy in respect of benefits in kind for executive directors, which has been simplified in connection with the newly appointed executive directors, will principally relate to a fully expensed car, mobile telephone, private health insurance, disability and death benefits.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable and are not taken into account when determining basic salary for performance related remuneration.
annUal BonUs The RPC Group Annual Bonus Plan provides the framework for an annual incentive for executive directors and eligible senior managers with the aim of promoting the achievement of the corporate strategy and success of the Group.
Any bonuses paid are non-pensionable and are not taken into account when determining basic salary for performance related remuneration.
The incentive for the financial year ended 31 March 2013 was based on a requirement for a significant increase in the Groups adjusted PBIT profit before interest and tax.
The maximum bonus payable was 100% of salary, with a sliding bonus scale commencing at 0% of salary for a challenging threshold target level of performance.
In addition, the bonus payable would be reduced by 25% if the targeted level of free cash flow generation was not achieved.
As a result of the threshold PBIT not being met, no bonuses will be payable to executive directors for the year ended 31 March 2013.
The performance conditions for the annual bonus for the financial year ending 31 March 2014 will continue to be based on the Groups adjusted PBIT with a sliding bonus scale commencing at 0% of salary for a challenging threshold target level of performance.
Only 50% of the bonus will be payable at 60% of the target range.
As a result of the Committees desire to align management performance targets with a Return on Capital Employed ROCE, one of the key Company objectives, a ROCE moderator will be introduced.
Consequently, bonuses for the year ending 31 March 2014 will be reduced by 12.5% if the targeted levelof free cash flow generation is not achieved and by 12.5% if the targeted ROCe is not achieved.
Any bonus payable under the Group Annual Bonus Plan will continue to be divided equally between cash and an award of deferred shares in the Company.
The deferred shares will normally vest three years after they are awarded subject to continued service and a clawback provision whereby entitlement to unvested shares will be forfeit in the event of a material misstatement of the Groups consolidated results or serious misconduct.
An exceptional negative event clause is also operated.
lonG-TeRM InCenTIves RPC Group 2008 Performance share Plan The Companys long-term incentive plan LTIP for executive directors and senior management is the RPC Group 2008 Performance Share Plan thePSP.
The main features of the PSP are as follows: Awards may be made in the form of an allocation of conditional shares or an option to acquire shares.
No payment is required on grant, vesting or exercise of an award.
Until an allocation vests or an option is exercised, a participant has no voting, dividend or other rights in respect of the shares.
Participants are eligible to be considered for awards annually.
The aggregate market value of awards made under the PSP in any one financial year may not exceed 200% of basic salary although the most recent awards were limited to 75% of salary.
Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc Annual report and accounts 2013 53 Awards are subject to performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee which must be satisfied before an award vests.
Performance is measured over a three-year performance period commencing on 1 April of the year in which an award is granted.
Performance conditions for past PSP awards were based on sliding scale ePS targets, whereby 25% of awards vest for annual adjusted ePS growth of CPI 5% p. a. increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting for annual adjusted ePS growth of CPI 10% p. a.
Following a review of long-term incentive provision in connection with the appointment of the new Chief executive and Finance Director and consultation with the Companys major investors, the following changes are being made to the long-term incentive policy: Reflecting the Committees desire to move incentive provision towards FTSe 250 market practice over time, PSP award levels, starting with the 2013 awards, will be set at 125% of salary for the Chief executive and Finance Director.
Reflecting the increase in award levels and the Committees desire to introduce a long-term relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance measure, performance conditions will be amended compared to prior years by reducing the threshold level of vesting from 25% to 20% of an award, increasing the ePS target at the top end and introducing a relative TSR performance condition for a minority of PSP awards.
Forawards to be granted in 2013, the following three year performance targets will apply: Two-thirds of an award: 20% of this part of an award will vest for annual adjusted ePS growth of CPI 5% p. a. increasing pro-rata to 50% ofthis part of an award vesting for annual adjusted EPS growth of CPI 9% p. a. approx.
60% of the EPS growth range increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting of this part of an award for annual adjusted ePS growth of CPI 12% p. a.
One-third of an award: 20% of this part of an award will vest if RPCs TSR is ranked at the median of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting of this part of an award if RPCs TSR is ranked at or above the upper quintile.
In addition, no part of this award may vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the vesting percentage produced by the TSR condition is reflective of the Groups underlying financial performance.
Reflecting the increase in PSP award levels, shareholding guidelines for executive directors have been increased from 50% to 100% of salary.
The rules of the PSP have been strengthened to include a clawback provision whereby entitlement to unvested shares or unexercised options will be forfeited in the event of a material misstatement of the Groups consolidated results or serious misconduct.
An exceptional negative event clause has also been introduced.
The Committee has given careful consideration to 2013 PSP performance measures and considers that sustained growth in ePS with a minority ofthe awards on relative TSR appropriately captures the impact of managements decisions and actions in areas such as production efficiency, margin improvement and efficient use of resources.
RPC Group 2003 approved and unapproved Executive share option schemes While the PSP is the current long-term incentive arrangement used for the executive directors, there remain some outstanding options under executive share option schemes.
Under the Rules of the RPC Group 2003 Approved executive Share Option Scheme and the RPC Group 2003 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme the 2003 Schemes, market value options may be granted which are normally exercisable between three and ten years after the date of grant.
The aggregate value of options granted to an employee under the 2003 Schemes in any financial year will not normally exceed their basic annual salary although this limit may be exceeded where the Remuneration Committee determines that special circumstances exist.
It is not intended that further grants will be made to executive directors under the 2003 Schemes or their successor Schemes.
The 2003 Schemes are due to expire as they will soon be reaching the end of their 10 year life.
At the forthcoming AGM, shareholders will be asked to approve the RPC Group 2013 Approved executive Share Option Scheme and the RPC Group 2013 Unapproved executive Share Option Scheme the 2013 Schemes to replace the 2003 Schemes.
The Rules of the 2013 Schemes are similar to the 2003 Schemes but have been brought up-to-date with current legislation and best practice.
A summary is given in appendix 2 of the explanatory notes to the Notice of AGM.
RPC Group 2003 sharesave scheme executive directors are able to participate in invitations under the RPC Group 2003 Sharesave Scheme and the RPC Group 2003 International Sharesave Scheme on the same terms as all other eligible employees.
The UK Scheme is HM Revenue and Customs HMRC approved and the unapproved International Scheme allows overseas employees to participate on terms that are no more beneficial than those for UK participants.
Options are granted at an exercise price equal to 80% of the market price of the Companys shares at the close of business on the last dealing day, or the average of the last three dealing days, before the invitation date.
At the AGM on 10 July 2013, shareholders will be asked to approve the RPC Group 2013 Sharesave Scheme and the RPC Group 2013 International Sharesave Scheme to replace the existing 2003 Sharesave Schemes which were approved and adopted by shareholders in 2003 and are due to expire.
The Rules of the new Schemes are similar to the 2003 Sharesave Schemes but have been updated for current legislation and best practice.
Summaries are given in appendix 3 of the explanatory notes to the Notice of AGM.
shareholding Policy To reinforce the linkage between senior executives and shareholders, the Remuneration Committee operates a shareholding policy that applies todirectors and other executives eligible to receive awards conditional on performance under its long-term incentive arrangements.
Such executives are required to build up and retain a personal shareholding worth an equivalent of a minimum of 100% of their prevailing basic salary previously 50% of salary.
It is expected that the required shareholding will be built up over a number of years by retaining half of the shares that vest or options that are exercised net of those sold to meet acquisition costs, tax and social security liabilities until the required level is met.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to waive the requirement in exceptional circumstances.
Once attained, a subsequent fall below the required level may be taken into account by the Committee when determining the grant of future awards.
RPC Group Plc 54 Annual report and accounts 2013 remUnerATiOn repOrT continued PensIon PRovIsIon Consistent with normal practice in the Netherlands, P R M Vervaat has an individual defined benefit pension policy with a Dutch insurance company, .

If the employing company terminates the employment ofa UK executive director in breach of contract, compensation is limited to basic salary due for any unexpired notice period.
Payments in lieu of notice are not pensionable.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive director under the Companys short-term or long-term incentive plans will be determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee in accordance with the relevant schemes rules.
That said, a participants awards will lapse and right to any part of the relevant bonus ceases if he resigns or is dismissed.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the notice period and compensation for breach of contract for executive directors is unchanged from the provisions described above.

The Scheme provides a pension of one 60th of final pensionable earnings average of the final three years since 1June 2003 for each year of pensionable service plus widows and dependants pensions.
In addition, R J E Marsh has been granted a pension supplement uplifting pension benefits from all sources, including the RPC Scheme, up to two-thirds of pensionable earnings.
The supplement, payable at his normal pension age under the Scheme of 65 years, accrued uniformly over the period from 1 May 1989 until the age of 60. early retirement benefits may be taken from age 55 years reduced for early payment with the agreement of the Schemes Trustee.
In the event of death inservice, a lump sum benefit of four times annualised earnings was provided.
employee contributions were 11% of pensionable earnings or the above director could participate in a pension salary sacrifice arrangement whereby scheme members sacrifice an amount of their gross salary in exchange for the employer paying the employee pension contributions.
Theemployer contribution was 14.5% of pensionable earnings but it will make such additional payments to the Scheme as are appropriate to fund the pension supplement having regard to the advice of the Scheme Actuary.
R J E Marsh is responsible for meeting any tax charges arising if any from pension benefits.
With effect from 31 July 2010 the RPC Containers Limited Pension Scheme closed to future service accrual.

The Remuneration Committee agreed to pay R J e Marsh a supplement of 20% of basic salary in lieu of employer pension contributions.
The supplement is not included in basic salary for the purposes of performance related remuneration.
The year end accrued pension is that which would be paid on retirement based on service up to 31 July 2010 and final pensionable earnings at31March 2011, the date the director ceased to be a Continuing Member of the Scheme, increased in line with the Rules of the Scheme.
Theseincreases are broadly inflationary increases on pension earned after 1 April 1995 and a late retirement uplift from age 60 on pension accruedbefore 1 April 1995.
Member contributions have been nil since the Scheme closed to future service accrual on 31 July 2010.
The accrued pension and transfer value for R J e Marsh includes an allowance for his retained benefits which have been offset against his accruedpension at 1 April 2011.
The transfer values have been calculated using the Schemes standard approach at the relevant dates without any reduction for underfunding.
