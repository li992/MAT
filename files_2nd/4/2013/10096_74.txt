Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and accounts 2013 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee does not formally consult with employees as part of its process when determining Executive Director pay.
However the Committee is kept informed of general decisions made in relation to employee pay and related issues by the Group HR Director and is conscious of the importance of ensuring that its pay decisions for Executive Directors are regarded as fair and reasonable within the business.
As outlined in the Policy Table, pay and conditions in the Group are one of the specific considerations taken into account when the Committee is determining salary levels for the Executive Directors.
Consideration of shareholders views The Companys three major shareholders each had a representative on the Committee in the pre-Listing period and, accordingly, the structure of our post-Listing remuneration policy has been subject to significant consultation with them.
In addition we have sought the views of our largest institutional shareholders and leading advisory bodies post Listing.

70 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and accounts 2013 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Additional disclosures in respect of the single figure table Annual bonus Executive Directors are participants in the central bonus plan.
The central bonus plan for 2013 comprised a bonus pool linked to Group underlying EBITDA performance out of which individual awards were made based on role, seniority, contribution and performance against pre-set targets for operational and financial measures relevant to the individual.
The specific structure of the bonus pool for the 2013 central bonus plan is regarded by the Board as commercially sensitive as it was designed and agreed in the context of Merlin being an unlisted company.
The table below sets out the annual cash bonus awards made to Executive Directors in respect of the full 2013 financial year.
2013 annual bonus Nick Varney 462,275 Andrew Carr 298,788 These payments were determined by the Remuneration Committee having taken account of: The Groups strong financial performance.

As outlined elsewhere in the Remuneration Report, the central bonus plan has been restructured for 2014 in line with listed company best practice.
Scheme interests awarded during the financial year Performance Share Plan awards Performance Share Plan PSP awards are granted over Merlin shares with the number of shares under award determined by reference to a percentage of base salary.
Vesting of the awards is conditional upon satisfaction of performance conditions and is usually also conditional upon continued employment until the awards vest.
An initial award was granted under the PSP to selected senior executives, including the Executive Directors, on 12 November 2013.
This award is subject to the performance conditions described below and will vest on 1 April 2017 after the release of financial results for the financial year ending 31 December 2016.
There will be no grant under the PSP during 2014 to Executive Directors and the next PSP award to them will be granted during 2015.
As disclosed in the Listing Prospectus, the initial PSP awards to the CEO and CFO were granted over shares worth 310 per cent.
These award levels were set by the Committee in recognition of the absence of a PSP grant in 2014 and are consistent with the Committees current policy that the annualised value of PSP awards to the CEO and CFO should be over shares worth 250 per cent.
The following table provides details of the awards made under the PSP on 12 November 2013.

Statement of Directors shareholding and share interests Upon Listing, the Committee introduced a shareholding requirement of 200 per cent.
of base salary for the Executive Directors.
Both of the current Executive Directors had a shareholding that surpassed that requirement at 28 December 2013.
Executive Directors are expected to achieve the shareholding requirement primarily by retaining at least 50 per cent.
of any share awards that vest under the PSP and the Deferred Bonus Plan after selling sufficient shares to satisfy tax liabilities.
Individuals are expected to be compliant with their shareholding requirement within five years of Listing or, if later, within five years of that individual becoming subject to the requirement.
The Committee reviews ongoing individual performance against the shareholding requirement at the end of each financial year.
Current shareholding requirements and the number of shares held by Directors are set out in the table below.
