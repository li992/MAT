Evaluation of the Remuneration Committee The Committees performance is evaluated annually.
The findings of the review were discussed by the Committee and with the Chairman of the Board.
Remuneration principles The Committee has developed the remuneration policy with a number of principles in mind.
The overall policy should be: Competitive Employees receive a competitive compensation and benefits package, which is reviewed annually and benchmarked by reference to the external market.
Aligned with shareholders A significant proportion of variable remuneration is delivered in the form of deferred awards over Schroders shares, thereby aligning the interests of employees and shareholders.
In addition, executive Directors and other members of the GMC are required, over time, to acquire and retain a holding of Schroders shares or rights to shares equivalent to 300 per cent.
Aligned with clients A proportion of key employees variable remuneration is delivered as fund awards, which are notional investments in funds managed by the Group, thereby aligning the interests of employees and clients.
Aligned with financial performance Total variable compensation is managed as a percentage of pre-bonus profit before tax, determined by the Committee and recommended to the Board.
The total spend on compensation is managed as a percentage of operating revenue.
This approach aligns compensation with financial performance.
Designed to encourage retention Deferred variable compensation does not give rise to any immediate entitlement.
Awards normally require the participant to be employed continuously by the Group until at least the third anniversary of grant in order to vest in full.

Recruitment of new Directors The Committee aims to pay executive Directors remuneration that is appropriate in level and structure to attract, motivate, retain and reward Directors of the quality required to run the Group successfully, while avoiding paying more than necessary.
On recruitment, the level of fixed remuneration is likely to be set at the same level as applies to other Directors, provided this is justifiable by reference to the candidates skills and experience, and taking into account remuneration in their most recent role, internal relativities and external market rates for roles with similar responsibilities.
Benefits and pension entitlements will be provided on a similar basis as those available to other employees.
New executive Directors would be eligible to be considered for annual bonus and LTIP awards in the same way as existing Directors.
The Group does not normally award guaranteed annual bonuses.
If, by exception, the Committee believes this is necessary, it would be limited to the first 12 months of service and would not exceed the level of bonus the Committee considers commensurate with a full years satisfactory performance in the role.
Where a candidate will forfeit remuneration as a result of leaving their current employer or joining Schroders, the Group may mitigate that loss by making one-off awards as part of the recruitment arrangements.
The Committee will take reasonable steps to ensure that any such awards are no more generous in either amount or terms than the remuneration being forfeited.
Any deferred remuneration awards will be subject to appropriate performance adjustment requirements.
If the Group hires a new executive Director internationally then relocation support may be offered, on a similar basis to other employees.
This may include support such as temporary accommodation, assistance finding new accommodation, transportation of household goods, school search for children moving internationally with the Director, tax advice and assistance preparing tax returns and a one-off cash allowance of up to 5,000 net.
New non-executive Directors would receive fees and benefits in line with the policy for other non-executive Directors in place at that time.

Directors service contracts, letters of appointment and termination arrangements The Committees general policy is that each executive Director will have a rolling contract of employment with mutual notice periods of six months, with the exception of Michael Dobson who is entitled to 12 months notice from the Company.
The Committee will consider the appropriate notice period on appointing any new executive Director.
If necessary to secure a new hire, a notice period of up to 24 months may be offered, in which case this would reduce to 12 months or less after an initial period.
When recruiting new executive Directors, the Committees policy is that contracts will not contain any provision for compensation upon early termination, unless this is necessary in exceptional circumstances.
When an executive Director leaves the Group, the Committee will review the circumstances and apply the treatment that it believes is appropriate.
Any payments will be determined in accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Group and the employee, as well as the rules of any deferred remuneration plans.
Salary and benefits will continue to be paid through the notice period.
In certain circumstances, the Committee also has the discretion to make a payment in lieu of notice, normally based on salary only.
Departing executive Directors do not have a contractual entitlement to be awarded variable compensation, except in the case of contractual commitments that pre-date this policy.
If a departing Director works during the notice period to achieve the Groups goals and supports an effective transition of responsibilities, the Committee may recommend to the Board that a discretionary payment be made to reflect his contribution during the proportion of the financial year worked.
The treatment of awards under the ECP, LTIP and other share plans will be in line with the relevant plan rules.
In certain circumstances, those rules permit participants to retain some or all of their awards following the termination of their employment, for example, under the ECP, after the first, second and third anniversary of an award, or if the employee is leaving due to ill health or injury, or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account the individuals performance and the reason for leaving.

Similarly, payments to former Directors that do not exceed 10,000 will not be disclosed in the Annual report on remuneration.
The Committee may agree additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith to discharge an existing legal obligation, or as damages for breach of such an obligation, or in settlement or compromise of any claim arising on the termination of a Directors office or employment.

Basis for determining annual bonus awards audited In determining the annual bonus award for the Chief Executive and other executive Directors, the Committee made an assessment of the overall performance of the business and of each individual.
A number of financial and non-financial factors were taken into account, without attaching a separate weighting to each factor, including: The trend in profit for the year: Cost control: Investment performance: The Companys reputation: Net new business: Business performance within each individuals responsibilities: The management of risks facing the Group: Individual performance against annual objectives: and Talent retention and succession planning: Schroders share price performance.
Execution and integration of strategic acquisitions: Targets and actual performance for investment performance and cost metric KPIs are outlined on pages 20 and 21.
Targets for other metrics are not disclosed due to commercial sensitivity and the risk of providing information to competitors, many of which are not subject to the same disclosure requirements.
Based on this assessment of performance, the Committee used its discretion to determine annual bonus awards, taking into account the recommendation of the Chief Executive in respect of the other executive Directors.
