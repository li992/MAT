888 888 Holdings plc Holdings plc Annual R Annual Report & A eport & Ac cc counts 20 ounts 2013 13 Directors Remuneration Report Dear Shareholders, The new regime applying to directors remuneration reporting has introduced a number of requirements both in terms of formulating a written remuneration policy, disclosing it to shareholders and putting it to vote at the Annual General Meeting: and in terms of remuneration reporting, including as to the manner in which the remuneration policy was implemented in the relevant period as well as other relevant matters regarding directors remuneration during the year.
The Company early adopted some of the reporting requirements in 2012, on a voluntary basis, which has put it in an advantageous position to report in 2013 on its remuneration policy and other relevant matters.
It has done so even though it is incorporated in Gibraltar and, therefore, is not legally required to comply with the new UK regulations on directors remuneration.
As such, the Board intends to put the remuneration policy set out in this Report, and the remainder of the Report as a whole, to shareholders for approval in two separate votes at the 2014 Annual General Meeting.
Since the Company is not a UK incorporated company, and is not subject to the UK Companies Act 2006 nor the UK regulations on directors remuneration, the two votes will be advisory votes.
This means that payments made or promised to directors would not have to be repaid if either of the votes were not passed, and while the Board intends to set Directors remuneration in accordance with the remuneration policy, subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, neither the Board nor individual directors are legally bound by the policy.
The Board has determined that its remuneration policy shall come into force immediately after the Annual General Meeting, subject to its approval by shareholders.
As from the effective date, the Board intends that all payments made by the Company to its directors will be made in accordance with the remuneration policy.
Existing obligations will continue to be met.
It is the Companys intention that the remuneration policy will remain in force until a new remuneration policy that has been approved by shareholders takes effect.
Furthermore, the Company intends to again seek shareholder approval for its remuneration policy in three years time.
The proposed remuneration policy seeks to align the Companys remuneration policy with Company strategy and its approach to risk, and on rewarding success fairly, whilst avoiding paying more than is necessary to properly attract, retain and motivate Directors of appropriate calibre to the Companys business.
In adopting the policy, the Company confirms that there is a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual directors, with no director being involved in deciding his own remuneration.
Annual Statement 2013 was a record year for the group, with revenue increasing by 7% compared to 2012, Adjusted EBITDA increasing by 13% and like for like Adjusted EBITDA increasing by more than 20% compared to 2012.
During the year, the Board discussed with investor representative groups the remuneration of the Executive Directors, amongst other matters.
During 2014, the Remuneration Committee will exercise its duties in accordance with the Remuneration Policy set out herein, subject to its adoption by the Annual General Meeting.
We hope that you will find the Directors Remuneration Report informative and would be happy to discuss any feedback you may have.
Sincerely, Amos Pickel Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 25 March 2014 34 23124.04 25 March 2014 6:24 AM Proof 10 Governance www.

The minimum amount payable is 250,000 and the maximum payable is 5,500,000.
