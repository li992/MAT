Awards granted in 2011 under the existing Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP vest based on an underlying EPS performance condition: the performance condition was not met during the year and, as a result, these awards will lapse in April 2014.
CHRIS GEOGHEGAN Chairman, Remuneration Committee REMUNERATION POLICY 12 March 2014 The Committee also reviewed the existing LTIP during the year which expires in April 2014, and has proposed a number of revisions which will be incorporated in the new LTIP for which Shareholder approval is being sought at the 2014 AGM.
For awards to be made in 2014 and subsequent years, the opportunity will be increased from 100% to 150% of salary 200% under exceptional circumstances.
Awards will continue to vest based on EPS and ROCE performance conditions, and the EPS performance range will be strengthened to take into account the Companys long-term strategy and the current economic environment.
We have also introduced clawback provisions for unvested shares, and a two-year post-vesting holding period to further improve Shareholder alignment.
In addition, the shareholding guideline will be increased from 100% to 200% of salary.
The Committee consulted the Companys major Shareholders prior to making these revisions, and received support for the proposed changes.
SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 63 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY This section of the report sets out the policy for Executive Directors in accordance with Section 439A of the Companies Act 2006 the Act, which Shareholders are asked to approve at the 2014 Annual General Meeting AGM.
The Committee intends that this policy will formally come into effect from the date of the 2014 AGM.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT This report, prepared by the Remuneration Committee the Committee on behalf of the Board, takes full account of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code and the latest ABI NAPF guidelines and has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
The Act requires the Auditor to report to the Companys Shareholders on the audited information within this report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been prepared in accordance with the Act.
The Auditors opinion is set out on pages 123 to 125 and those aspects of the report that have been subject to audit are clearly marked.
It is considered that throughout the year under review the Company has complied with the governance rules and best practice provisions applying to UK listed companies, and Shareholders will note that the Directors Remuneration Policy supports compliance with the new BIS regulations.
REMUNERATION POLICY The Companys policy is to provide remuneration packages that fairly reward the Executive Directors for the contribution they make to the business and that are appropriately competitive to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and Senior Managers of the right calibre.
The policy is designed to align the Executive Directors interests with those of Shareholders, and to incentivise the Executive Directors to meet the Companys financial and strategic objectives such that a significant proportion of remuneration is performance related.
The Groups financial and strategic objectives are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 6 to 49.
The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors is summarised in the table below: Fixed remuneration Element Purpose and link Operation and process Opportunity Performance metrics to strategy Base salary To attract and retain talent in Reviewed on an annual basis with Base salary increases will Not applicable the labour market in which effect from January or following a be applied in line with the the Executive Director is significant change in responsibilities, outcome of the review.

The Committee is satisfied that the above Remuneration Policy is in the best interests of Shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-taking.
The Committee will consider the Companys performance on environmental, social and governance issues when determining the overall reward for the Executive Directors, and has discretion to make adjustments as appropriate.
The Committee also retains discretion to make non-significant changes to the policy without reverting to Shareholders.
NOTES TO THE REMUNERATION POLICY TABLE PAYMENTS FROM EXISTING AWARDS Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment under any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the Remuneration Policy including under the existing LTIP.
LTIP AWARDS Awards under the new LTIP may be structured in a manner which delivers tax advantages to the Executive Directors but the value delivered will be no greater than as set out in the table above.
SELECTION OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES The performance measures used under the annual performance bonus are selected annually to reflect the Groups main strategic objectives for the year and reflect both financial and non-financial priorities.
The Committee continues to believe that ROCE reinforces the focus on capital efficiency and delivery of strong returns for our Shareholders, thereby further strengthening the alignment of managements incentives with SIGs strategy.
The Committee also continues to believe that underlying EPS is a key driver of long-term Shareholder value for SIG.
Performance targets are set to be stretching and achievable, taking into account the Groups strategic priorities and the economic environment in which the Company operates.
Targets are set taking into account a range of reference points including the Groups strategic plan and broker forecasts for both SIG and its peers.
The Committee believes that the performance targets set are very challenging and that the maximum outcomes are only available for truly outstanding performance.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR OTHER EMPLOYEES Our approach to salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the level of responsibility, experience, individual performance, salary levels in comparable companies and the Companys ability to pay.
Remuneration surveys are referenced, where appropriate, to establish market rates.
Senior Managers participate in an annual bonus plan which has similar performance targets to those of the Executive Directors.
A limited number of Senior Managers also receive LTIP awards.
Performance conditions are consistent for all participants, while award sizes vary by organisational level.
All UK employees are eligible to participate in the SIP on the same terms.
Pension and benefits arrangements are tailored to local market conditions, and so various arrangements are in place for different populations in SIG.
Executive Directors participate in the same pension scheme as other Senior Managers.
SIG plc 66 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Overview Strategic report Directors report Accounts APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION The Committees policy is to set pay for new Executive Directors within the existing Remuneration Policy in order to provide internal consistency.
The Committee aims to ensure that the Company pays no more than is necessary to appoint individuals of an appropriate calibre.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS In the case of appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing components of remuneration, as follows: Component Approach Maximum annual grant value Base salary The base salary will be determined by reference to the scope and responsibility of the position as well as n a internal relativities and their current remuneration.
Where a new appointee has an initial base salary set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period of years, subject to the Executive Directors development in the role, which may result in above-average salary increases during this period Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may include but are not limited to a company car, medical and permanent health insurance Pension New appointees will be eligible to participate in the Companys defined contribution pension scheme or receive a cash equivalent payment SIP New appointees will be eligible to participate in the SIP Annual The plan as described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant maximum being pro-rated to 100% of salary performance reflect the proportion of the year employed.
Targets for the personal element will be tailored to the role of the appointee bonus LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other Executives, as described in 200% of salary the policy table The Committee may also make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer and may exercise the discretion available under the relevant Listing Rule to facilitate this, i. e. in the event that a different structure would be required.
In doing so, the Committee will ensure that buyout awards would have a fair value no higher than that of the awards forfeited and would consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, and the remaining vesting period of these awards.
Where, in the Committees opinion, awards forfeited are still subject at date of appointment to substantive performance conditions, any awards made in compensation will have SIG-specific performance conditions attached.
INTERNAL APPOINTMENTS Remuneration for new Executive Directors appointed by way of internal promotion will similarly be determined in line with the policy for external appointees, as detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the Board, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements.
Incentive opportunities for below Board employees are typically no higher than for Executive Directors, but incentive measures may vary to provide better line of sight.
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES To ensure alignment between Executive Director interests and those of Shareholders, the Company has established the principle of requiring Executive Directors to build up and maintain a beneficial holding of shares in the Company equivalent to a minimum of 200% of base salary.
Under normal circumstances it is expected that this should be achieved within five years of appointment.
It is anticipated that the satisfaction of this target will be mainly achieved by the vesting of shares through the Companys share plans.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SERVICE CONTRACTS AND LEAVER CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISIONS AND POLICY FOR LOSS OF OFFICE The Committee sets notice periods for the Executive Directors including future Executive Directors at twelve months.
Subject to the considerations set out overleaf, the Companys policy is to limit termination payments to pre-established contractual arrangements.
In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
If employment is terminated by the Company, the departing Executive Director may have a legal entitlement under statute or otherwise to additional amounts, which would need to be met.
In addition, the Committee retains discretion to settle any claims by or on behalf of the Executive Director in return for making an appropriate payment and contributing to the legal fees incurred by the Executive Director in connection with the termination of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement as provided for overleaf and the individual must seek independent legal advice.
There is no provision in the Executive Directors contracts for compensation to be payable on termination of their contract over and above sums due in respect of notice and accrued but untaken holiday, and as outlined overleaf regarding bonus and LTIP.
Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.
In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing Executive Directors including but not limited to settlement, confidentiality, outplacement services, restrictive covenants and or consultancy arrangements.
These will be used sparingly and only entered into where the Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders to do so.

The Maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus full payout of all incentives.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The Non-Executive Directors NEDs, including the Chairman, do not have service contracts.
The Companys policy is that NEDs are appointed for specific terms of three years unless otherwise terminated earlier in accordance with the Articles of Association or by and at the discretion of either party upon three months written notice.
NEDs appointments are reviewed at the end of each three-year term.
NEDs will normally be expected to serve two three-year terms, although the Board may invite them to serve for an additional period.
Summary details of terms and notice periods for NEDs are included below: NED Original date of appointment Date of letter of engagement Unexpired term L.

CONSIDERATIONS OF CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP The Committee considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when determining remuneration for Executive Directors, and the Company seeks to promote good relationships with employee representative bodies as part of its employee engagement strategy.
However, the Committee does not currently consult specifically with employees on the Executive Remuneration Policy.
CONSIDERATIONS OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into account the guidelines of investor bodies and Shareholder views.
The Committee is always open to feedback from Shareholders on the Remuneration Policy and arrangements, and commits to undergoing Shareholder consultation in advance of any significant changes to the Remuneration Policy.
Further detail on the votes received on the 2012 Directors Remuneration Report and the Committees response are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
EXTERNAL DIRECTORSHIPS The Committee acknowledges that Executive Directors may be invited to become independent Non-Executive Directors of other quoted companies which have no business relationship with the Company and that these duties can broaden their experience and knowledge to the benefit of the Company.
Executive Directors are permitted to accept such appointments with the prior approval of the Chairman.
Approval will only be given where the appointment does not present a conflict of interest with the Groups activities and the wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the development of the individual.
Where fees are payable in respect of such appointments, these would be retained by the Executive Director.

J. Davies annual bonus was pro-rated for time worked before going on garden leave.
Based on the Groups financial performance and Mr. C. J. Davies personal contributions to the Company during the year, his bonus was calculated to be 67,876, equivalent to 50% of his pro-rated salary to 31 March 2013.
As stated in the Policy table, for all current Executive Directors one-third of the total annual bonus outcome for 2013 is deferred into SIG shares for three years, subject to clawback.
Bonus deferral did not apply to Mr. C. J. Davies in 2013 on account of his retirement.
No discretion was applied by the Committee to the annual bonus outcome calculation.
In the Committees view, the level of bonus paid to Executive Directors appropriately reflects the individuals and Groups performance in an exceptionally difficult environment.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN: 2011 AWARDS On 27 April 2011, Mr. C. J. Davies received an award of 379,000 nil-cost options under the LTIP.
Vesting of the award was dependent on three year cumulative underlying EPS performance.
There was no re-testing of performance.
The performance targets are illustrated below: EPS performance 100% 0% 30p 40p Cumulative underlying EPS 20112013 Performance measure Actual performance Vesting outcome % of maximum Three year cumulative underlying EPS 30.0p 0% The three year period over which performance was measured ended on 31 December 2013.
Actual cumulative underlying EPS was 30.0p, which resulted in nil vesting.
The award will therefore lapse on 27 April 2014.
No awards are due to vest for the incumbent Executive Directors based on performance to 31 December 2013.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN: 2013 AWARDS On 18 April 2013, Mr. S. R. Mitchell and Mr. D. G. Robertson were granted awards under the LTIP of 363,036 and 214,191 shares respectively: details are provided in the table below.

Awards vest in full for ROCE of 13% or higher and vesting is on a straight line basis between these two points.
For the EPS element, if cumulative underlying EPS over the three financial years ending 31 December 2015 is less than or equal to 30p, no shares will vest.
Awards vest in full for cumulative EPS of 40p or higher and vesting is on a straight line basis between these two points.
As in previous years, the ROCE and EPS targets have been calibrated with reference to analysis based on internal and external data and the Committees view of what it believes will provide an appropriate level of stretch.
In order to ensure targets remain commensurately stretching with what was intended at the outset, and also to ensure a fair outcome for both participants and Shareholders, the Committee has discretion to adjust the targets as appropriate, e. g. to reflect changes in capital, M&A activity, and any other reason the Committee determines in its absolute discretion.
Further, if such discretion is exercised, the Committee undertakes to disclose the rationale for its decision in the Annual Report on Directors Remuneration the following year.

As in 2013, 2014 bonuses will be based 80% on underlying profit before tax and working capital improvement and 20% against personal and key operating objectives.
The Committee has determined that performance targets will not be disclosed on a prospective basis for reasons of commercial sensitivity, but will be disclosed on a retrospective basis in due course when they are no longer considered commercially sensitive.
LTIP In advance of each LTIP cycle, the Committee reviews the appropriateness of the performance measures and corresponding targets.
Following a review of performance measures and the calibration of targets, the Committee strengthened the EPS targets for 2014 awards and determined that 25% of the element should vest for threshold EPS performance.
No changes are proposed to the way that ROCE is measured.
Subject to Shareholder approval, a number of other changes will be introduced for LTIP awards from 2014.
To encourage long-term decision-making and further improve Shareholder alignment, the Committee will introduce a two year post-vesting holding period on vested LTIP awards for awards made in 2014 and in subsequent years.
Unvested awards will be subject to clawback, i. e. forfeiture or reduction in exceptional circumstances e. g. material misstatement or gross misconduct.
Dividend equivalents will be payable over the five year vesting and holding period in respect of the awards which vest.
SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 75 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2014 CONTINUED LTIP CONTINUED When the Committee initially consulted with Shareholders on these changes, it advised that the performance range would be 9.0% to 13.0% for ROCE and the cumulative equivalent of 8% to 22% p. a. growth for underlying EPS.
In February 2014, the Group completed the sale of its German Roofing Business.
To ensure no reduction in the toughness of the ROCE performance targets under the 2014 LTIP as a result of this sale, the Committee has determined that the threshold for ROCE should be increased from 9.0% to 9.2%, with the maximum ROCE unchanged at 13.0%.
The 20142016 cumulative underlying EPS performance targets will remain unchanged in relation to the sale.
