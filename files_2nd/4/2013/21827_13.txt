Directors Report & Governance Directors Remuneration Report Annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee This has been a year of change for the industry and for Brewin Dolphin and so, a comparable significant amount of activity for the Remuneration Committee.
There have been a number of changes to the management team and the Committee has taken this opportunity to develop a new approach to incentivise remuneration for executive directors.
This includes a proposed Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and changes to the annual bonus for executive directors: the introduction of an LTIP is accompanied by a reduction in the maximum level of annual bonus.
The details of both schemes are set out in this report and we have sought by their design to ensure that targets are clear and stretching, and tied into the Brewin Dolphin strategy of driving organic growth and achieving operational excellence to improve quality and lower costs.
The Committee consulted with major shareholders on these proposed changes to executive remuneration and subsequently adjusted the 2014 LTIP performance criteria and introduced an additional post vesting holding period in response to shareholders views.
As the Groups financial year ended on 29 September 2013, it is not technically required to put the directors remuneration policy to a binding shareholder vote until the AGM in February 2015.
However the Committee has decided that it would not be right to delay shareholder approval, and instead has elected to put the remuneration policy to the vote at the AGM in February 2014.
This means that the directors remuneration policy will be binding on the Company from the 2014 AGM.
Meanwhile, the second part of the remuneration report, which is the annual report on remuneration, will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2014 AGM, in accordance with the regulations.
In considering the new remuneration policy, the Committee was concerned that it needed to be able to attract and retain a high calibre management that will serve the Company well.
We have benchmarked against relevant competitors and the significant amount of remuneration that is related to performance will help drive the strategy forward over the short and longer term, avoiding creating incentives for excessive risk taking whilst maintaining a flexible cost base.
Lastly, the Remuneration Committee has introduced a directors shareholding policy to align the interests of the Executive Directors with shareholders.
Directors Remuneration Policy subject to binding vote by shareholders at the 2014 AGM This section of the Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with Part 4 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
It sets out the Directors Remuneration Policy for the Group.
The Policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, executive remuneration guidelines produced by shareholder organisations, and the remuneration principles of the Financial Conduct Authoritys FCA Remuneration Code so far as they apply to the Group.
Overview The Committee determines the Groups policy on the remuneration of the Board Chairman, Executive Directors and other members of executive management including employees designated as Code Staff under the FCA Remuneration Code.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Groups website.
In determining the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee takes into account the following objectives: to attract, retain and motivate talented Directors and senior management of the calibre required to manage the business successfully, whilst seeking to avoid paying more than is necessary to meet this objective: to motivate and reward good performance: and to meet relevant regulatory requirements, including the requirements of the FCA Remuneration Code so far as these apply to the Group.
The main principles of the policy are to: ensure that total remuneration is set at a level that is market competitive by benchmarking against relevant external comparators, taking account of size, complexity, and sector, and to ensure that the overall package takes account of market practice: maintain appropriate proportions of fixed and performance-related pay, to help to drive performance over the short and longer term, maintain a flexible cost base, and avoid creating incentives for excessive risk-taking: align incentive plans with the business strategy, prudent risk management, and shareholder interests: and achieve consistency with the general remuneration philosophy applied to Brewin Dolphin employees as awhole.
Details of the remuneration components are provided in Figure 1 the Remuneration Policy table for Executive Directors.
49 Directors Remuneration Report continued How the views of shareholders are taken into account The Committee will regularly compare the Groups Directors Remuneration Policy with shareholder guidelines and takes account of the results of shareholder votes on remuneration.
If any material changes to the Remuneration Policy are contemplated, the Committee Chairman will consult with major shareholders about these in advance.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years remuneration report are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration section of the Directors Remuneration Report.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Group applies a consistent remuneration philosophy for employees at all levels.
Fixed pay components for all employees are benchmarked against relevant market comparators and the Committee takes account of the aggregate rate of base salary increase for all employees when determining increases in fixed pay for Directors.
All employees are eligible for performance-related annual bonus and the principle of bonus deferral applies to annual bonuses for employees whose bonuses exceed certain thresholds established by the Committee.
The Group does not operate formal employee consultation on remuneration.
However, employees are able to provide direct feedback on the Groups remuneration policies to their line managers or the Human Resources department.
The Committee monitors the effectiveness of the Groups remuneration policy in recruiting, retaining, engaging and motivating employees, and receives regular reports on how the Groups remuneration policies are viewed by employees and whether they are meeting business needs.
The Committee does not seek to apply fixed ratios between the total remuneration levels of different roles in the Group, as this would prevent it from recruiting and retaining the necessary talent in a highly competitive employment market.
Benchmarking The Committee takes account of market benchmark data when setting total remuneration packages for Executive Directors.
Comparisons are made with other FTSE-listed companies of similar size and business profile to Brewin Dolphin.
Practices in the private client investment management sector, and other related sectors, are also considered.
Benchmark data is used by the Committee as a reference point, alongside other factors such as the individuals role and experience, and company and personal performance, rather than as a direct determinant of pay levels.
Future policy table Figure 1 summarises the key aspects of the Groups Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors.

The Committee may seek to clawback LTIP in exceptional situations, such as misstatement of performance, failure of risk management or serious misconduct.
51 Directors Remuneration Report continued Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees The approach to remuneration for the Executive Directors is generally consistent with that for employees across the Company as a whole.
However, there are some differences which the Committee believes are necessary to reflect the different responsibilities of employees across the Company, and the need to recruit, retain and motivate employees in a variety of roles.
For example, below Executive Director level, the portion of annual variable pay that is deferred is structured differently and is capped at one third rather than the two-thirds deferral that applies to Executive Directors.
Awards of market purchased shares are made to selected individuals from time to time, excluding Executive Directors, which vest subject to continued service, to recognise individuals value to the Company and to create further alignment with shareholders.
External non-executive director positions Executive directors are permitted to serve as non-executive directors of other companies, on the grounds that this can help to broaden the skills and experience of the Director, provided there is no competition with the Companys business activities and where these duties do not interfere with the individuals ability to perform his duties for the Company.
Where an outside appointment is accepted in furtherance of the Companys business, any fees received are remitted to the Company.
If the appointment is not connected to the Companys business, the Executive Director is entitled to retain any fees received.
Approach to remuneration for new Executive Director appointments The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms and maximum levels of the Groups approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.
The Committee may also offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders, for the purpose of replacing awards or potential foreseeable earnings which are forgone by the individual on becoming an Executive Director.
This includes the use of awards made under 9.4.
In considering any such payments the Committee would take account of the amount of remuneration foregone and the nature, vesting dates and any performance requirements attached to the remuneration foregone.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments and the rationale for these.
For an internal appointment, any deferred pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may be permitted to continue where this is considered to be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders.
For external and internal appointments, the Company may meet certain relocation expenses as appropriate.
Service contracts and loss of office payments Service contracts normally continue until the directors agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree.
The service contracts contain provision for early termination.
Notice periods are limited to 6 months by either party.
If the employing company terminates the employment of an Executive Director without giving the period of notice required under the contract, the Executive Director would be entitled to claim recompense for up to six months Total Fixed Pay.
In cases of good leavers the Committee may consider a discretionary award of annual variable pay, subject to performance, in respect of the portion of any financial year that the individual has been working with the Company, although not for the period of any payment in lieu of notice or garden leave.
In the event of a change of control of the Company there is no enhancement to these terms.
In summary, the contractual provisions are as follows: Figure 2: Provision Detailed terms Notice period 6 months Termination payment in the event of Total Fixed Pay in respect of the unexpired period of contractual notice.
termination by the Company without In certain cases, the Committee may also consider a discretionary award of due notice annual variable pay, subject to performance, in respect of the portion of any financial year that the individual has been working with the Company, although not for the period of any payment in lieu of notice or garden leave Change of control Same terms as above on termination.
Any outstanding share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Companys LTIP or other share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, disability, redundancy, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee taking into account the individuals performance and the reasons for their departure good leaver status can be applied.
In such cases, the normal practice, unless there are exceptional circumstances, is for any LTIP awards held to be pro-rated for the period of the performance period that has expired, and the performance conditions would continue to apply.
Share awards under the Deferred Profit Share Plan will vest in full on the original vesting schedule.
52 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors Report & Governance An Executive Directors service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, the Directors Remuneration Policy includes authority for the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous Remuneration Reports.
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the implementation section of this report as they arise.

54 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors Report & Governance Annual bonus for the year ending 29 September 2013 In prior years, Executive Directors annual bonuses were paid from a profit sharing pool.
However, for the year ending 29September 2013, annual bonuses for the Chief Executive, Finance Director and Head of Investment Management were determined by the Committee based on an assessment of performance relative to Key Performance Indicators.
This new approach was intended to achieve a more direct relationship between progress towards the Companys strategic goals and the bonuses that were awarded.
The bonus award for Michael Williams, as an Investment Manager, is assessed in relation to the profitability of his Investment Management team which was significantly higher in 2013 than in the prior year.
Figure 6 below shows the Key Performance Indicators that were considered by the Committee, their weightings and the Committees assessment of performance for the year.

Andrew Westenberger and Stephen Ford received salary, benefits and bonus in relation to their non-qualifying services as employees, prior to their appointment as directors on 1 January 2013 and 21 March 2013 respectively.
55 Directors Remuneration Report continued With the exception of Michael Williams, the maximum annual bonus for each individual Executive Director is currently 200% of total fixed pay.
Annual bonus awards are delivered part in cash and part in deferred shares that vest after 3 years.
The table below shows how the split is calculated: Portion of variable pay Fraction deferred Up to 50,000 None Between 50,000 and 1 x fixed remuneration One third Above 1 x fixed remuneration Two thirds In Michael Williams case, as he is an Investment Manager with significantly lower base pay, the first 50,000 is in cash, and the balance above 50,000 is two-thirds cash one-third shares.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to adjust the final outcome upwards or downwards in the event that an exceptional event outside of the directors control occurs which, in the Committees opinion, materially affected the bonus out-turn.
There were no such events during 2013.
Both the cash and share element of the bonus is subject to clawback.
Please see the Directors Remuneration Policy table for further details.
David McCorkell, Jamie Matheson, Sarah Soar, Ben Speke and Henry Algeo left employment during the year.
Under the terms of their contract, they were not entitled to a bonus in relation to the year under review.
Outstanding share awards The table below sets out details of Executive Directors outstanding share awards which will vest in future years subject to performance and or continued service.
SEMP options lapsed upon cessation of employment on 21 September 2013.
DPSP awards will vest on normal vesting schedule in accordance with good leaver provisions.
57 Directors Remuneration Report continued Deferred Bonus The Executive Directors receive part of their annual variable pay as a deferred award in BDH shares DPSP, normally in the form of options with a zero exercise price.
These options are subject to service conditions and vest in one tranche three years from the date of grant.
Share Incentive Plan SIP All employees of the Group are eligible to participate in the SIP following six months of service.
Employees may use funds from their gross salary up to a maximum of 10% of their gross salary in regular monthly payments being not less than 10 and not greater than 125 to acquire ordinary shares in the Company Partnership Shares.
Partnership Shares are acquired monthly.
For every Partnership Share purchased, the employee receives one matching share up to the value of 20.
All shares to date awarded under this scheme have been purchased in the market by the Trustees and it is the intention of the Board to continue this policy in the year to September 2014.
Share schemes under which no awards were made in 2013 2004 Approved Share Option Plan ASOP Awards under the ASOP have been historically granted to directors and other employees.
These awards have been subject to a condition that the year-on-year growth in annual fee income charged on portfolios shall not be less than 10% per annum compound or a 33% increase in annual fees over a three-year period.
The performance criteria are set by the Remuneration Committee and selected to recognise that income growth is a key driver of shareholder value.
The options are exercisable from five to ten years from grant.
These options are only granted once an employee has been with the Group for two years.
Awards have not been made under the ASOP since 2011.
The Board does not intend to issue any options or shares under this scheme in 2014.
Senior Employee Matching Purchase Share Scheme SEMP Awards have not been made under this scheme since 2009.
The SEMP was additional to the above scheme and allowed a further 5% issue of options over a ten year period, provided that a similar number of shares were subscribed for by senior executives at the price the options are issued.
The Board does not intend to issue any options or shares under this scheme in the future.
Dilution By agreement with shareholders, the aggregate number of shares which may be issued at any date of grant, when aggregated with shares issued or issuable pursuant to options or awards granted in the preceding 10 years under any employee share plan operated by the Company other than the SEMP, shall not exceed 10% of the issued share capital.
The current cumulative dilution level over the ten year period to 29 September 2013 is 5.14%.
This includes 1.49% issued under the SEMP and 0.64% under the all-employee plans discontinued SAYE scheme.
58 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors Report & Governance Directors shareholding and share interests To align the interests of the Executive Directors with shareholders, Executive Directors are required to build up shareholdings through the retention of shares vesting under the Companys share plans.
The Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding equivalent to 100% of total fixed pay over a period of five years, excluding awards that have not yet vested or have vested but not yet been exercised.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to hold shares in the Company but are not subject to a formal shareholding guideline.

Total pension entitlements Executive Directors may opt to receive pension paid for from their aggregate fixed pay amount.
They may also receive part of their annual bonus in the form of pension contribution.
Defined Contribution Scheme Executive Directors may join the Company Defined Contribution Scheme.
Andrew Westenberger and David Nicol have not made contributions to the Scheme and do not receive any benefit from the Company under the Scheme.
Michael Williams has elected to sacrifice salary into this scheme.
Stephen Ford has not sacrificed salary into the scheme in relation to his qualifying services as a Director during the year.
Defined Benefit Scheme Entry to the Company Defined Benefit Scheme was withdrawn in 2004 for new staff members.
Robin Bayford, Jamie Matheson and Sarah Soar all transferred their pension benefits out of the Defined Benefit Scheme in December 2007.

In accordance with his contract, he did not receive a bonus in relation to the year to 29 September 2013.
David Nicol is the Chief Executive who was appointed on 21 March 2013.
Bonus and salary above relate to the period of his qualifying service as Chief Executve.
Figure 10 shows the movement in the salary and annual bonus for the Chief Executive between the current and previous financial year compared to that for the average UK employee.
The Committee has chosen this comparator and it feels that is provides a more appropriate reflection of the earnings of the average worker than the movement in the Groups total wage bill, which is distorted by movements in the number of employees.
As the Chief Executive was appointed during the year, the 2013 figure includes the remuneration of the previous Executive Chairman, as the most appropriate prior comparator.
Rather than having separate base salary, pension and benefit components, executive directors and other senior staff receive a total fixed pay sum which they can receive part as a defined pension contribution and or benefits such as car benefit, private medical insurance or long-term illness disability insurance.
More junior staff receive a base salary and pension contributions additionally.
As such, an analysis of the movement in benefits for the Chief Executive and the average employee was not considered to be practical or meaningful and has not been included in Figure 10.

63 Directors Remuneration Report continued How the policy will be applied in 2014 onwards i Base salary review The Executive Directors salaries were last reviewed in September 2013.
There will be no salary increases for 2014.
The current salaries are shown in Figure 15: Figure 15: Current salaries for the Executive Directors Salary as at Salary as at 29 September 30 September 2013 2012 Change David Nicol 350,000 350,000 Stephen Ford 300,000 300,000 Andrew Westenberger 300,000 300,000 Michael Williams 154,500 154,500 or date of appointment if later ii Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors As detailed in the remuneration policy, the Companys approach to setting non-executive directors remuneration is with reference to market levels in comparably sized FTSE companies, levels of responsibility and time commitments.
These fees are reviewed periodically by the Board.
A summary of current fees is as follows: Figure 16: Current fees of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors As at 29 September 2013 Chairman 125,000 Base fee 40,000 Senior Independent Director 4,000 Committee Chairman 4,000 6,000 with the exception of J Worsley where the base fee is 50,000 iii Performance targets for the 2013-14 annual bonus, and LTIP awards to be granted in 2014 For FY 2014, the annual bonus will be based on performance against a balanced scorecard comprising three Key Performance Areas: profit before tax 35% weighting : operating profit margin 35% weighting and personal performance non-financial targets 30%.
Profit and margin will be adjusted to exclude the impact of exceptional items.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the annual bonus performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive.
Full retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be seen in next years Annual Remuneration Report.
The Committee is seeking approval to implement an LTIP with effect from 2014: details of this are included with the Notice of AGM.
If the new Plan is approved, the LTIP awards granted in 2014 will be subject to two separate performance conditions, each accounting for one-half of the award.
The performance conditions are as follows: Figure 17: Performance targets for the LTIP awards to be granted in 2014 Weighting Stretch each measured Threshold 100% Performance metric independently 25% vesting vesting Measurement period Adjusted EPS 50% 8% 18% CAGR measured over the three financial years Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16, using 2012-13 as the base year.
2016 full year adjusted 50% 23% 25% Measured in 2015-16 financial year.
operating profit margin There is also a general underpin: the Committee will assess the overall health of the business and whether prudent risk management has been applied and may scale-back the vesting level if it considers this to be appropriate having taken account of this general underpin.
64 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors Report & Governance Statement of shareholder voting At last years AGM, the Directors Remuneration Report received the following votes from shareholders: Figure 18: Shareholder Voting 2013 AGM % Votes cast in favour 129,412,408 89% Votes cast against 15,444,463 11% Total votes cast 144,856,871 Abstentions 20,429,927 Whilst our Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders last year, we received 11% votes against the resolution.
Thiswas largely due to some shareholders having concerns about the size of increases in fixed pay.
These increases were intended to re-position the base salaries at a more competitive level and balance the introduction of a cap on variable pay.
However, the total remuneration, after application of the increases in 2012, remained substantially below market median levels for a company of Brewin Dolphins size.
There have been no increases in base salary at the start of the 2013-14 financial year.
Approval This Directors Remuneration Report, including both the Policy and Annual Remuneration Report has been approved by the Board of Directors.
