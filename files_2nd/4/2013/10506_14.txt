Bruce Carnegie-Brown Clarity and openness in disclosure Chairman of the Remuneration Committee The Committee aims to operate and demonstrate best practice in 3 March 2014 the area of executive remuneration and disclosure.
We aim to comply with the new disclosure requirements under the Governments reforms on directors pay.
Our report has three sections as follows: this Annual Statement, which summarises and explains the major decisions and changes in respect of Directors remuneration: a Directors Remuneration Policy setting out the forward-looking remuneration policy for the Companys Directors, which will operate from 23 April 2014, subject to shareholder approval: and an Annual Report on Remuneration, providing details of how the policy will be operated for 2014 and the remuneration earned by the Companys Directors in relation to the year ended 31 December 2013.
At the forthcoming AGM on 23 April 2014, the Directors Remuneration Policy will be subject to a binding shareholder vote and the Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote.
In future years, the Directors Remuneration Policy will be subject to a binding vote every three years sooner if changes are made to the policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an annual advisory vote.
com Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 36 GOVERNANCE Directors Remuneration Policy In formulating the remuneration policy, full consideration has been given to the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Codes and the Committee regularly reviews the policy to ensure it takes due account of best practice and the particular circumstances of the Company.
Consistent with the new legislation, the Directors remuneration policy which will operate from 23 April 2014, will be put to a binding shareholder vote and become formally effective at the 2014 AGM.
Policy overview The Company aims to provide a remuneration structure that is aligned with shareholder interests and, as such, is competitive in the marketplace to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of superior calibre in order to deliver continued growth of the business.
Company policy is that performance related components should form a significant portion of the overall remuneration package, with maximum total potential rewards being earned through the achievement of challenging performance targets based on measures that reflect the best interests of shareholders.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee will consider shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year at its next meeting following the AGM.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time, will then be considered as part of the Companys annual review of remuneration policy.
In addition, the Committee will seek to engage directly with major shareholders and their representative bodies should any material changes be made to the remuneration policy.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years remuneration report and any matters discussed with shareholders during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee does not formally consult employees in relation to remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
However, the Company regularly carries out engagement surveys which enable employees to share their views with management.
To the extent that employees are shareholders, they can vote on this policy at the AGM.

2 The following differences exist between the Companys policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors as set out above and its approach to the payment of employees generally: A lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity as a percentage of base salary may apply to employees other than the Executive Directors and certain senior executives.
Benefits offered to other employees generally comprise a car allowance where required for the role or to meet market norms.
Participation in the LTIP is limited to the Executive Directors and certain selected senior managers.
Other employees are eligible to participate in the Companys share plans, details of which are provided on page 38.
A lower level of pension rate applies to employees other than the Executive Directors and certain senior executives.
In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the various categories of roles.
They also reflect the fact that, in the case of the Executive Directors and senior executives, a greater emphasis tends to be placed on performance related pay.
3 The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflects the Committees belief that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging and tied to the delivery of revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth and specific individual objectives.
4 The adjusted EBITDA growth and comparative total shareholder return performance conditions applicable to the LTIP further details of which are provided on page 44 were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term returns to shareholders and the Groups financial growth and are consistent with the Companys objective of delivering superior levels of long-term value to shareholders.
5 The Committee operates share plans in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC where relevant.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plans.
6 All employee share plans do not operate performance conditions.
7 As highlighted above, the Company has a share ownership policy which requires the Executive Directors to build up and maintain a target holding at least equal to 100% of base salary.
Details of the extent to which the Executive Directors had complied with this policy as at 31 December 2013 are set out on page 46.
8 For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors such as the payment of a pension or the vesting exercise of past share awards.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.

5 The maximum value of the LTIP is taken to be 150% of the face value of the award at grant.
6 No share price appreciation or depreciation has been assumed in calculating the value of the LTIP.
Service contracts for Executive Directors The service agreements of the Executive Directors are not fixed term and are terminable by either the Company or the Director on twelve months notice and make provision, at the Boards discretion, for early termination by way of payment of salary in lieu of twelve months notice.
Incidental expenses may also be payable where appropriate.
In calculating the amount payable to a Director on termination of employment, the Board would consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant contractual terms, the circumstances of the termination, any applicable duty to mitigate and the commercial interests of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the contractual terms for new Executive Directors to ensure these reflect best practice.
Provision Detailed terms Notice period 12 months Termination payment Up to 12 months salary Remuneration entitlements A bonus may be payable pro-rated where relevant and outstanding share awards may vest pro-rated where relevant subject to performance conditions Change of control No Executive Directors contract contains additional provisions in respect of change of control Approach to leavers Annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the financial year served although it will be pro-rated for time and paid at the normal date.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Companys share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment under the LTIP plan is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill health, disability, retirement, redundancy or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, good leaver status may be applied.
For good leavers, awards will normally vest on their normal vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions and reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.
However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to disapply time pro-rating.
Approach to recruitment and promotions The remuneration package for a new Executive Director i. e. base salary, benefits, pension, annual bonus and long-term incentive awards would be set in accordance with the terms of the Companys prevailing approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment and would reflect the experience of the individual.
Annual bonus potential will be limited to 200% of salary and long-term incentives will be limited to 200% of salary.
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and therefore shareholders to take account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would where appropriate reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
com Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 40 Remuneration 000 GOVERNANCE For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are disclosed to shareholders in the next following Directors Remuneration Report.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and or incidental expenses as appropriate.
Other appointments The Executive Directors may accept outside appointments, with prior Board approval, provided these opportunities do not negatively impact on the individuals ability to perform his duties at the Company.
Whether any related fees are retained by the individual or are remitted to the Company will be considered on a case by case basis.
Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors are appointed under arrangements that may generally be terminated by either the Company or the Director on up to three months notice and their appointment is reviewed annually.
Annual Report on Remuneration Implementation of the remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December 2014 A summary of how the Directors remuneration policy will be applied during the year ending 31 December 2014 is set out below.
Base salary The Remuneration Committee has determined that base salaries for the Executive Directors will increase as follows with effect from 1 January 2014: 2014 2013 % increase Peter Plumb 450,000 425,000 6% Paul Doughty 290,700 285,000 2% Graham Donoghue 280,000 258,995 8% In light of the Companys experiences in recruiting senior executives, including the Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Committee reviewed the remuneration of existing executives and increased the base salaries of Peter Plumb and Graham Donoghue to ensure they remain competitive in the market.
The Groups employees are, in general, receiving salary increases ranging from 0% to 6% depending on promotional increases and individual performance.
Upon Matthew Price joining the Group as Chief Financial Officer in April 2014, his base salary in 2014 will be 300,000 per annum.
Pension arrangements The Company will continue to provide pension contributions of 20% of base salary for the benefit of the Executive Directors.
Where the pension contributions exceed the limits set by HMRC, the Group will continue to provide benefits through the provision of salary supplements.
Annual bonus The target bonus for the year ending 31 December 2014 will remain at 135% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 110% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer and 100% of base salary for any other Executive Director.
The maximum bonus potential for the year ending 31 December 2014 will remain at 185% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 165% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer and 150% of base salary for any other Executive Director.
Awards are determined based on a combination of both the Groups financial performance, being growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, and the Executive Directors performance against specific personal objectives.
For the achievement of growth in adjusted EBITDA at or above the target level, a multiplier will be applied up to the maximum bonus potential.
Maximum bonus will only be payable when the adjusted EBITDA has significantly exceeded expectations.
Long-term incentives Consistent with past awards, the extent to which LTIP awards which will be granted in 2014 will vest will be dependent on two independent performance conditions with 30% determined by reference to the Companys comparative total shareholder return Comparative TSR and 70% determined by reference to growth in the Groups adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA, as follows: 30% of the Comparative TSR element of an award will vest if the Comparative TSR ranks at median performance as measured over the three year performance period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index.
This rises on a straight line basis to a maximum vesting of 150% of the Comparative TSR element of an award if the Comparative TSR ranks in the upper quartile.
There is no vesting of the Comparative TSR element of an award for performance below median: and 30% of the Adjusted EBITDA element of an award will vest at threshold performance of compound annual growth of adjusted EBITDA of 6%.
This rises to a maximum vesting of 150% of the Adjusted EBITDA element of an award at stretch performance if the compound annual growth in adjusted EBITDA is 17% or above.
Vesting is determined by a set formula between threshold and stretch performance.
There is no vesting of the Adjusted EBITDA element of an award for performance below compound annual growth of adjusted EBITDA of 6%.
