Assessment of performance in 2013 Financial measures As outlined in the financial highlights section on page 2, performance in 2013 was resilient Deliver superior financial performance inachallenging environment.
Double-digit earnings per share growth The normalised return on equity reduced to 11.2 per cent, as profits declined.
Mid-teens return on shareholders equity Deliver diversied income growth Our income stream remains highly diversied with 25 markets delivering over $100 million ofincome.
The Committee noted that these results needed to be viewed in the context of the challenging market conditions also experienced by our global peers.
The Committee concluded that overall the Group did not meet expectations against the financial measures.
Non-financial measures The key performance indicators on pages 14 to 15 show that significant progress was made Build long-term, deep relationships ina number of areas.
For example: withour clients and customers We have consistently grown the number of leading clients that generate income of $1 million, Continue to run our balance sheet $5 million and $10 million per year conservatively, maintaining a strong capitalbase The Net Promoter Score, an indication of customer satisfaction of our products and services Risk and control in Consumer Banking, showed year-on-year improvement Prove we are Here for good The Groups capital position continues to be strong with good levels of organic equity Innovate and digitise generation.

It is intended to apply for three years to the conclusion of the AGM in 2017.
In summary, we are proposing longer deferrals, higher shareholding requirements, all variable compensation to be delivered in shares and a xed pay allowance to be delivered in the form of shares retained for up to five years.

After this, the numberof shares will be aligned to the shareholding requirement for Code Staff 1 Maximum award potentials for xed pay allowances and variable compensation awards are based on obtaining shareholder approval to increase the maximum variable compensation as a percentage of xed pay under CRD IV from 100 per cent to 200 per cent at the AGM on 8 May 2014.
If shareholder approval is not obtained the maximum xed pay allowance payable for each executive director under the policy will be the difference between i 50 per cent of maximum total remuneration of the executive director under this policy as shown in the illustrative scenarios charts on page 188, and ii the aggregate of the base salary, benets and pension cost for that executive director.
The maximum variable compensation award levels will then be revised from 200 per cent to 100 per cent of xed pay in line with the EBA valuation rules.
The increase in the cap to 200 per cent would enable us to minimise the increase in xed remuneration costs and maintain greater exibility on total pay while retaining a larger quantum of variable pay that can be subject to claw back and forward-looking performance conditions
