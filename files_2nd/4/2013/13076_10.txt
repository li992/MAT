The Committee intends that the policy will come into effect on this date, if approved by Shareholders, and be effective for three years.
A summary of the Directors Remuneration Policy is summarised in the table below: EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION POLICY TABLE Component purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance measures Variable Remuneration incentives Annual bonus Financial targets are set by the Committee at the Target opportunity: Performance will be assessed To drive strong start of the year, with reference to prevailing CEO: 120% of salary against the growth in one or financial performance growth rates in RBs peer group, and across the CFO: 90% of salary more key financial metrics of with significant reward health care and FMCG industries more broadly.

36 RB Annual Report 2013 Governance & Remuneration Directors Remuneration Report NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE Payments from Existing Awards Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the Remuneration Policy detailed in this Report, i. e. before 7 May 2014.
Details of these awards are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance Measure Selection and Approach to Target Setting The measures used under the annual bonus are selected to reflect the Groups main financial priorities for any given financial year.
With regard to the LTIP, the Committee regularly reviews the performance measure to ensure that it aligns well with the Companys strategy and with our Shareholders interests.
EPS is considered the most appropriate LTIP performance measure for a number of reasons: It focuses Executives on real profit growth which is strongly aligned with value creation at RB: It provides a well-recognised and accepted measure of the Companys underlying financial performance: and It is a measure that the plan participants can directly impact and is easily measurable.
EPS is measured on an adjusted diluted basis, as shown in the Groups financial statements, as this provides an independently verifiable measure of performance.
However the Remuneration Committee maintains the discretion to make adjustments to the measure if this is considered to be appropriate.
Any adjustments will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Targets applying to the bonus and LTIP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points.
Bonus targets take into account prevailing growth rates in RBs peer group, and across the health care and FMCG industries more broadly.
LTIP targets reflect industry context, expectations of what will constitute performance at the top of the peer group, and factors specific to the Company.
Remuneration Policy for other Employees RBs approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the level of experience, responsibility, individual performance and salary levels for comparable roles in comparable companies.
Senior employees are eligible to participate in an annual bonus scheme with similar metrics to those used for the Executive Directors.
Opportunities and specific performance conditions vary by organisational level, with business area-specific metrics incorporated where appropriate.
Senior managers, who comprise of the Top400 employees, are eligible to participate in the LTIP on broadly similar terms as the Executive Directors, although award sizes vary by organisational level.
In addition, Senior Executives, who comprise of the Top40 employees, are also required to build up significant shareholdings in RB of between 30-50,000 shares, representing c. 8x base salary.
All UK employees are eligible to participate in the Companys Sharesave plan on identical terms.
Shareholder Alignment The Committee recognises the importance of aligning Executive Directors and Shareholder interests through executives building up significant shareholdings in the Company.
Executive Directors are expected to acquire a significant number of shares over a period of eight years and retain these until retirement from the Board of Directors.
The shareholding requirement for the CEO is 600,000 shares and for the CFO is 200,000 shares.
Details of the Executive Directors current personal shareholdings are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 46.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements, but are engaged on the basis of a letter of appointment.
In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code September 2012 guidelines, all Directors are subject to re-election annually at the AGM.
It is the policy of the Board of Directors that Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys bonus, share option, long-term incentive or pension schemes.
An element of the basic fee is, however, paid in RB shares.
Details of the policy on fees paid to our Non-Executive Directors are set out in the table below: Component and objective Approach of the Company Fees cash The fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board of Directors, with recommendations provided by and shares the Chairman and CEO.
The fees of the Chairman are determined by the Remuneration Committee.

Chairman and Non-Executive fees are delivered partly in cash and partly in RB shares which must be held until retirement from the Company.
The fees paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors in respect of the year under review and for the following year, including the split between cash and shares, are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Aggregate fees are limited to 1.5m by the Companys Articles of Association.

Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to Executive Director level, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements even in instances where they would not otherwise be consistent with the prevailing Executive Director Remuneration Policy at the time of appointment.
Non-Executive Directors In recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on page 37.
A base fee in line with the prevailing fee schedule would be payable for membership of the Board of Directors, with additional fees payable for acting as Deputy Chairman, Senior Independent Director, as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, and for being a member of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
Fees will be delivered partly in cash and partly in RB shares to be held until retirement from the Company.
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND EXIT PAYMENT POLICY Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee.
In accordance with general market practice, each of the Executive Directors has a rolling service contract which is terminable on twelve months notice and this practice will also apply for any new Executive Directors.
In such an event, the compensation commitments in respect of their contracts could amount to one years remuneration based on base salary, benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period.
Termination payments may take the form of payments in lieu of notice.
Copies of Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.
The Companys policy on any termination payments is to consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant contractual terms in the executives service contract and the circumstances of the termination.
The table below summarises how awards under the annual bonus and LTIP are typically treated in specific circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the Committees discretion as provided under the rules of the plan: Reason for cessation Timing of vesting payment Calculation of vesting payment Annual Bonus Voluntary resignation or Not applicable No bonus to be paid for the financial year.

RB Annual Report 2013 39 Governance & Remuneration Directors Remuneration Report EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS With the approval of the Board of Directors in each case, and subject to the overriding requirements of the Company, Executive Directors may accept one external appointment as a Non-Executive Director of another company and retain any fees received.
Details of external appointments and the associated fees received are included in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
CONSIDERATION OF CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE COMPANY The Committee does not consult with employees specifically on Executive Remuneration Policy.
However, the Company seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodies including trade unions and works councils as part of its employee engagement strategy, and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
Although the Company does not consult employees on executive remuneration, the Committee is mindful of the salary increases applying across the rest of the business in relevant markets when considering salaries for Executive Directors.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS The Committee considers Shareholder views received during the year and at the Annual General Meeting each year, as well as guidance from Shareholder representative bodies more broadly, in shaping Remuneration Policy.
The Committee Chairman speaks with a number of the Companys largest Shareholders on the subject of executive remuneration at least on an annual basis.
The majority of Shareholders are supportive of the Companys philosophy and policy on remuneration, and the Committee will continue to keep its Remuneration Policy under regular review, to ensure it continues to reinforce the Companys long-term strategy and aligns closely with Shareholders interests.
The Committee will continue to consult our major Shareholders before making any significant changes to our Remuneration Policy.
Annual Report on Remuneration The following section provides details of how our Remuneration Policy was implemented during the year ended 31 December 2013.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP IN 2013 As of 31 December 2013, the Remuneration Committee comprised three Non-Executive Directors.
Judith Sprieser Chairman Richard Cousins Adrian Bellamy Graham Mackay was also a member of the Remuneration Committee until 12 June 2013 when he retired from the Board.
As at 31 December 2013, Judith Sprieser has served ten years on the Board of Directors.

1.1, the Board of Directors has determined that, in its opinion, Judith Sprieser remains independent.
Richard Cousins is considered independent under the Code.
Adrian Bellamy, Chairman of the Company, was independent on appointment but has served on the Board of Directors for more than nine years.
The Committees purpose is to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility by ensuring that Remuneration Policy and practices reward fairly and responsibly: are linked to corporate and individual performance: and take account of the generally accepted principles of good governance.
On behalf of, and subject to approval by, the Board of Directors, the Committee primarily: Sets and regularly reviews the Companys overall remuneration strategy: Determines the general Remuneration Policy for Senior Executives: and In respect of the Chairman, the Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee sets, reviews and approves: Remuneration policies, including annual bonuses and long-term incentives: Individual remuneration and compensation arrangements: Individual benefits including pension and superannuation arrangements: Terms and conditions of employment including the Executive Directors service agreement: Participation in any of the Companys bonus and long-term incentive plans: and The targets for any of the Companys performance-related bonus and long-term incentive plans.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the CEO are responsible for evaluating and making recommendations to the Board of Directors on the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors.
Members of the Remuneration Committee and any person attending its meetings do not participate in any discussion or decision on their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee held four scheduled meetings and one additional meeting during the year and details of members attendance at meetings are provided in the Corporate Governance section on page 26.
ADVISERS Kepler Associates Kepler was originally appointed by the Committee as independent advisor in mid-2012 following a competitive tender process, and was retained during 2013.
The Committee undertakes due diligence periodically to ensure that Kepler remains independent of the Company and that the advice provided is impartial and objective.
Kepler is a founding member and signatory of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants, details of which can be found at www.
During 2013, Kepler provided support to the Committee in relation to short and long-term incentive design, benchmarking executive remuneration structure and levels, and the consultation of Shareholders on remuneration matters.
Kepler Associates does not advise the Company on any other matters.
Their total fees for the provision of remuneration services to the Committee in 2013 were 215,935 on the basis of time and materials.
40 RB Annual Report 2013 Governance & Remuneration Directors Remuneration Report SUMMARY OF SHAREHOLDER VOTING AT THE 2013 AGM The following table shows the results of the advisory vote on the 2012 Remuneration Report at the 2013 AGM: Total number of votes % of votes cast For including discretionary 421,057,300 81.77% Against 93,881,447 18.23% Total votes cast excluding withheld votes 514,938,747 100.0% Votes withheld 11,173,126 Total votes cast including withheld votes 526,111,873 Whilst the level of support for the Remuneration Report was broadly similar to that received at the 2012 AGM 84%, the Committee recognises that there remain a number of areas of concern for Shareholders, including incentive award opportunities and the use of a single long-term performance measure EPS growth.
The Committee believes the existing incentive arrangements are simple, reinforce our remuneration principles and align Executives closely with the interests of our Shareholders.
In addition, the requirement for Senior Executives to build up significant shareholdings in the Company further supports our policy of executive alignment with Shareholders interests.
The Committee regularly reviews the incentive arrangements for Executive Directors and, taking into account the feedback received from our Shareholders, decided to make a number of changes to LTIP awards that were granted in December 2013, including a reduction in the threshold vesting level and an extension to the EPS performance range as explained in the Remuneration Committee Chairmans letter.
Single Total Figure of Remuneration for Executive Directors audited The table below sets out a single figure for the total remuneration received by each Executive Director for the year ended 31 December 2013 and the prior year.

RB Annual Report 2013 41 Governance & Remuneration Directors Remuneration Report INCENTIVE OUTCOMES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013 AUDITED Annual Bonus in Respect of 2013 Performance The performance measures attached to the 2013 annual cash bonus plan were net revenue and net income growth.
As in 2012, target performance was calibrated to deliver a bonus of 120% and 90% of salary for the CEO and CFO respectively, with bonus payments worth up to 3.57x these target amounts equivalent to 428% of salary for the CEO and 321% of salary for the CFO available for truly exceptional performance.
Performance under each of the measures is combined multiplicatively such that Threshold performance would deliver zero bonus whilst Stretch performance would deliver 3.57x target bonus.
The net revenue and net income targets set at the start of the year not disclosed as we consider them to be commercially sensitive took into account the fact that generics for Suboxone tablets entered the US market in late February 2013, and were anticipated to have a material impact on the revenue and profitability of the RB Pharmaceuticals business.
Despite the challenges faced within RB Pharmaceuticals, the Group has delivered exceptional performance, by continuing to grow the core business and maintaining market share within RB Pharmaceuticals.
Excluding RB Pharmaceuticals, net revenues have increased 7% based on a constant exchange rate and 5% on a like-for-like basis.
These are well above the general market growth rates.
This growth has been led by our new strategy to drive health and hygiene Powerbrands together with our focus on 16 Powermarkets.
Excluding RB Pharmaceuticals, adjusted operating profit has also increased by 7% based on a constant exchange rate, with margins increasing to 23.6%, exceeding targets.
Our volume film market share for total buprenorphine prescriptions in the US has been maintained at 68% since the launch of generic tablets which demonstrates an outstanding performance despite huge challenges being faced in this area.
Excellent progress has been made with our acquired businesses.
The effective ongoing integration of Schiff and effective collaboration agreements with BMS and Guilong has proven again RBs strength to acquire high quality businesses and delivering superior shareholder value.
We have also delivered a significant gross margin expansion of 150 bps and net working capital improvements of 163m to minus 863m.
This strong performance has resulted in a dividend payment which is 2% above that delivered last year.
Based on performance measures against the targets, but also supported by the overall financial results outlined above, the Committee has decided to make an annual bonus award of 428% of base salary to the CEO and 321% of base salary to the CFO, equivalent to 3.57x target bonus.
CEOs 2011 LTIP LTIP awards for 2011 were dependent on compound average annual growth CAAG in adjusted EPS over the three-year period ending on 31 December 2013.
The threshold target for awards was growth of 6% p. a. with awards vesting in full for growth of 9% p. a.
The threshold performance target was achieved and the CEOs LTIP award granted to him when he was EVP, Category Development may vest to the following extent in May 2014 for performance over the completed three-year period: Interests Exercise Vesting Interests Date Assumed Estimated Awards held price % vesting vesting market price value Shares 60,000 n a 24,000 7 May 2014 1,125,120 40% 46.88 Options 180,000 34.64 72,000 7 May 2014 881,280 The value disclosed above and in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 41 captures the full number of interests vesting.
As the market price on the date of vesting is unknown at the time of reporting, the value is estimated using the average market value over the last quarter of 2013 of 46.88.
The actual value at vesting will be trued-up in the 2014 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Former CFOs LTIP awards In line with the LTIP rules, Liz Dohertys outstanding LTIP share awards and option grants did not lapse on cessation of employment, but were prorated for the time elapsed from the start of each respective performance period to cessation of employment.

PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN CEO REMUNERATION The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in remuneration for all UK employees who form part of the senior management team Top400.
This group has been chosen as it represents the most appropriate comparator group for reward purposes for our UK-based Group Chief Executive.
The analysis excludes part-time employees and is based on a consistent set of employees, i. e. the same individuals appear in the 2012 and 2013 populations.
CEO Other employees % change 2012-2013 % change 2012-2013 Base salary 4% 3% Taxable benefits 24% 0% Annual bonus 96% 51% The difference in the percentage change of the annual bonus for the CEO and other employees is primarily a result of the fact that different targets are set for different areas of the business which are subject to different challenges.
The percentage change in taxable benefits for other employees excludes international transfer benefits as this is volatile from year to year based on each individuals circumstance.
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SPEND ON PAY The table below shows Shareholder distributions i. e. dividends and share buy backs and total employee pay expenditure for FY 2012 and FY 2013, along with the percentage change in both.
2013 2012 % change m m 2012-2013 Shareholder distributions dividends and share buy backs 1,271 1,451 -12.4% Total employee expenditure 1,329 1,220 8.9% EXIT PAYMENTS MADE IN THE YEAR AUDITED As outlined in last years Remuneration Report, Liz Doherty received a lump-sum termination payment which reflected historical contractual terms and company policy in April 2013 totalling 705,392.
As disclosed last year, the Committee has updated the termination provisions for the CEO and the new CFO so that they are aligned with best practice and limited to 12 months base salary.
The payment to Liz Doherty consisted of a severance payment of 203,490 and a contractual payment in respect of one-half of annual base salary 214,200 and a payment in respect of one-half of the average APP payout for the previous two years 287,702.
Unvested share and option awards held by Liz Doherty at the time of her ceasing to be employed by RB will vest in May 2014 based on performance to 31 December 2013, in accordance with the LTIP rules.
The awards were also reduced pro rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period not completed at the point of cessation of employment.
The value of these LTIP awards is 138,249.
PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS AUDITED No payments were made to past Directors in the year.

Bonuses will continue to be based on RBs absolute net revenue growth in Sterling at a constant exchange rate and absolute net income growth in Sterling at constant exchange rate, with the outcome under each of the measures combined multiplicatively to give a bonus outcome of 3.57x the target bonus opportunity if both Stretch targets are met.
Following the announcement of the strategic review of RB Pharmaceuticals, for 2014, 90% of the bonus opportunity will be based on the performance of the base business excluding RB Pharmaceuticals and 10% of the bonus opportunity based on the performance of RB Pharmaceuticals.
We have not disclosed the performance targets for 2014 as we consider them to be commercially sensitive.
However, we commit to disclosing the targets retrospectively in the directors remuneration report for the year ending December 2015.
LTIP LTIP awards for FY 2014 were granted in December 2013.
Details of these awards are summarised on page 43.
Awards to be made in December 2014 will be disclosed in the Annual Report of Remuneration in next years Remuneration Report.

Executive Directors Shareholding Requirements audited The table below shows the shareholding of each Executive Director against their respective shareholding requirement as at 31 December 2013: Shares held Options held Owned Performance Vested Performance outright or tested but but not tested but Shareholding vested unvested exercised unvested guideline A B C D # shares Rakesh Kapoor 317,537 700,000 360,000 1,380,000 600,000 Adrian Hennah 13,629 90,000 180,000 200,000 Rakesh Kapoor has exceeded his prorated target based on tenure to date and Adrian Hennah has made good progress towards his target during his first year as an Executive Director to the satisfaction of the Committee.
Due to the levels of shareholdings of the current executive directors, LTIP awards that vest over the next three to five years will be required to be held until the director reaches their share ownership guideline.
Indeed, we require directors to build up their share ownership guideline over eight years in equal instalments.
This results in Directors having to buy shares from their own resources.
The Committee also intends to consider during the year the extent to which Executives may be required to hold shares following their departure from the Board.
