Directors remuneration report Remuneration Committee Report Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Patrick fide Smedt Annual Statement Dear Shareholder This has been a demanding but productive year for the Remuneration Committee.
We remain focused on ensuring that our policies and procedures are right for our business and are capable of driving and incentivising our executives to create long-term value for our shareholders.
The focus of the executives this year has been on further strengthening the organisation and ensuring effective execution of our market-led growth strategies.
Pay for performance We believe in rewarding our executives based on their individual performance and on the value created for our shareholders.
The variable elements of executive remuneration are focused on simple and transparent measures of profit before tax, EPS growth and key strategic objectives.
Our bonus and long-term incentive structures are based on challenging targets, which we believe are in line with market best practice.
These are outlined on pages 49 and 50.
Our executives performed well against their own stretching individual performance targets and were entitled to receive a bonus for their performance.
However, they offered to freeze both their salary for the forthcoming year and to waive that bonus entitlement in the current year, as the Companys targeted profit growth was not achieved.
The Committee accepted this offer.
Our 2010 LTIP award, which is based on a combination of total shareholder return and earnings per share growth, vested at 16.56% of the total award, once again demonstrating the challenging targets we set as a business.
Clarity and openness in disclosure The Committee strives to operate and demonstrate best practice in the area of executive remuneration and disclosure.
This year, we have embraced the new disclosure requirements under the UK Governments reforms on directors pay and trust that our report demonstrates transparency and clarity in our disclosures.
Our report has three sections as follows: this Annual Statement, which summarises and explains the major decisions and changes in respect of directors remuneration: a Directors Remuneration Policy setting out the forward-looking remuneration policy for the Companys Directors, which will operate from 1 October 2013: and an Annual Report on Remuneration, providing details of how the policy for 2014 will be operated and the remuneration earned by the Companys Directors in relation to the year ended 30 September 2013.
At the forthcoming AGM on 4 February 2014, the Directors Remuneration Policy will be subject to a binding shareholder vote and the Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote.
In future years, the Directors Remuneration Policy will be subject to a binding vote every three years sooner if changes are made to the policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an annual advisory vote.
Remuneration policy for 2014 The Remuneration Committee continually reviews the senior executive remuneration policy to ensure it promotes the attraction, motivation and retention of the high quality executives who have been key to delivering the Companys strategy in the past and who will be key to delivering sustainable earnings growth and shareholder return in the future.
The Committees most recent conclusions are that the existing senior executive remuneration policy remains appropriate and should continue to operate for 2014 without major changes.
Specifically, the Committee concluded that: basic salary levels remain appropriately positioned in the market: the structure and quantum of the annual bonus continues to be appropriate and aligned to shareholders interests: and the long-term incentive grant policy, whereby options are granted annually with staggered vesting over 3, 4 and 5 years based on earnings per share and relative total shareholder return performance conditions, provide a strong alignment between the senior executive team and shareholders.
Alignment with shareholders We are mindful of our shareholders interests and are keen to ensure a demonstrable link between reward and value creation.
In addition tothe matters set out in this report, alignment with shareholder interest is further demonstrated by the operation of share ownership guidelines and the inclusion of a clawback provision in LTIP awards.
We are very proud of the support we have received in the past from our shareholders, with 99.8% approval for our report last year.
Wehope that we will continue to receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.
Patrick fide Smedt Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 9 December 2013 48 Victrex plc Annual Report 2013 www.
com Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Directors remuneration policy In formulating the remuneration policy, fullconsideration has been given to the principles set out in the Code and the Committee regularly reviews the policy to ensure it takesdue account of best practice and the particular circumstances of the Company.
Consistent with the new legislation, the Directors Remuneration Policy Report, thepolicy for which will operate from 1 October 2013, will be put to a binding shareholder vote and become formally effective at the 2014 AGM.
Policy overview The Company aims to provide a remuneration structure that is aligned with shareholder interests and, as such, is competitive in the marketplace to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors of superior calibre in order to deliver continued growth of the business.
Company policy is that performance related components should form a significant portion of the overall remuneration package, with maximum total potential rewards being earned through the achievement of challenging performance targets based on measures that represent the best interests of shareholders.
Consideration of shareholder views The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to theAGM each year at a meeting immediately following theAGM.
This feedback, plus anyadditional feedback received during anymeetings from time to time, is then considered as part of the Companys annual review ofremuneration policy.
In addition, theRemuneration Committee will seek to engage directly with major shareholders andtheir representative bodies should any material changes be made to the remuneration policy.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years remuneration report and any matters discussed with shareholders during the year are set out intheAnnual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salaryincreases and remuneration for the executive Directors.
Employees have not beenconsulted in respect of the design of theCompanys senior executive remuneration policy to date, although the Committee willkeep this under review.

2 The following differences exist between the Companys policy for the remuneration of executive Directors as set out above and its approach to the paymentofemployees generally: A lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity or zero bonus opportunity may apply to employees other than the executive Directors and certain senior executives.
Benefits offered to other employees generally comprise provision of healthcare and company car benefits where required for the role or to meetmarket norms.
The majority of employees participate in local defined contribution pension arrangements.
A small number remain in the UK defined benefits sectionwhich closed to new entrants in 2002.
Participation in the LTIP is limited to the executive Directors and certain selected senior managers.
Other employees are eligible to participate intheCompanys share option schemes, details of which are provided on page 87.
In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the various categories ofindividuals.
They also reflect the fact that, in the case of the executive Directors and senior executives, a greater emphasis tends to be placed onperformance related pay.
3 The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflect the Committees belief that any incentive compensation should beappropriately challenging and tied to both the delivery of profit growth and specific individual objectives.
4 The TSR and EPS performance conditions applicable to the LTIP further details of which are provided on page 56 were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term returns to shareholders and the Groups financial growth and are consistent with theCompanys objective of delivering superior levels of long-term value to shareholders.
The TSR performance condition is monitored on the Committees behalf by New Bridge Street whilst the Groups EPS growth is derived from the audited financial statements.
5 T he Committee operates share plans in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC where relevant.
TheCommittee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plans.
6 All employee share plans SAYE and AESOP do not operate performance conditions.
Executive Directors do not participate in the Victrex 2005 Executive Share Option Plan ESOP whichis the primary share incentive arrangement for below Board executives.
7 As highlighted above, the Company has a share ownership policy which requires the executive Directors to build up and maintain a target holding equalto100% of base salary.
Details of the extent to which the executive Directors had complied with this policy as at 30 September 2013 are set outonpage59.
8 For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into withcurrent or former Directors such as the payment of a pension or the vesting exercise of past share awards.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as theyarise.

The salary for a new executive may be set below the normal market rate, with phased increases over the first few years, as the executive gains experience in their new role.
Annual bonus potential will belimited to 125% of salary andlong-term incentives will be limited to 150% of salary 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of theCompany and therefore shareholders to takeaccount of remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and wouldwhere possible reflect the nature, time horizons andperformance requirements attaching tothat remuneration.
Shareholders will beinformed ofany such payments at thetimeof appointment.
For an internal executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect ofthe prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For external and internal appointments, theCommittee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and or incidental expenses asappropriate.
Approach to leavers Annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the financial year served although it will be pro-rated for time and paid at the normal payout date.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive Director under the Companys share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment under the 2009 LTIP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill health, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, good leaver status may be applied.
For good leavers, awards will normally vest on cessation, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions at that time and reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.
However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine that awards vest at a later date and or to disapply time pro-rating.
The default treatment for deferred bonus awards is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain good leaver circumstances as described under the 2009 LTIP above, awards will normally vest in full on the dateof cessation unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise.
The executive Directors may accept outside appointments, with prior Board approval, provided these opportunities do not negatively impact on the individuals ability to perform his duties at the Company.
Whether any related fees are retained by the individual or are remitted to the Company will be considered on a case by case basis.
Non-executive Directors Non-executive Directors are appointed under arrangements that may generally be terminated at will by either party without compensation and their appointment is reviewed annually.

Basic salary The Remuneration Committee agreed tofreeze executive Director base salary levels for2014.
2014 2013 % increase D R Hummel $707,250 $707,250 0% A S Barrow 246,000 246,000 0% T J Cooper 260,000 260,000 0% The Groups employees are, in general, receiving pay rises ranging from 2.5% to 4% depending on promotional increases and individual performance.
Pension arrangements A S Barrow will continue to participate in the defined benefit section of the Groups UK pension scheme until 9 February 2014, as detailed on page 60.
T J Cooper will continue to participate in the defined contribution section of the Groups UK pension scheme as will L Burdett upon commencement of employment.
Members of the UK pension scheme are entitled to life assurance cover of four times salary and a retirement pension subject to the scheme rules: if a member dies whilst in pensionable service, a surviving spouse and dependants are entitled to a pension subject to the scheme rules.
D R Hummel will continue to participate in a defined contribution scheme and a life assurance plan operated inrespect of the Groups US employees.
The Groups contribution to his pension scheme and associated salary supplement remain at 25% ofsalary.
Where the promised levels of benefits cannot be provided through the appropriate scheme, the Group will continue to provide benefits through the provision of salary supplements.
Annual bonus The maximum bonus potential for the year ending 30 September 2014 will remain at 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of basic salary for the Finance Director and VPS Managing Director.
Awards are determined based on a combination of both the Groups financial results, being growth in Group profit before tax, and an executives personal performance achievement level.
For the achievement of growth in Group profit before tax at or above the threshold target, a multiplier, based on personal performance, will apply to the outturn, which can either increase the payout level or reduce it to nil.
Maximum bonus will only be payable when both the financial results of the Group and the Executives individual performance against objectives have significantly exceeded expectations.
The bonus will be payable only if, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, there is an improvement in the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group during the year ending 30 September 2014.
Deferral into shares for any part of the Chief Executives bonus above 100% of salary and the claw back provisions for all executive Directors will continue to apply.
Long-term incentives Consistent with past awards, the extent to which LTIP awards which will be granted in 2014 will vest will be dependent on two independent performance conditions with 50% determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return TSR and 50% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS, as follows: the TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to theconstituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 25% on a pro-rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance: and the EPS element of an award will vest infull if EPS growth exceeds inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, by an average of 12% per annum or more over the three year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 20% on a pro-rata basis if EPS growth exceeds inflation by an average of 5% per annum over the period and is reduced to nil if EPS growth fails to exceed inflation by 5% per annum.
As set out in the Directors Remuneration Policy Report, awards granted from December 2013 onwards will be subject toclawback provisions.
Non-executive Directors The Companys approach to non-executive Directors remuneration is set by the Boardwith account taken of the time andresponsibility involved in each role, including where applicable the Chairmanship of BoardCommittees.
