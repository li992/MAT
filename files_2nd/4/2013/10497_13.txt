Remuneration report Introduction from the DLC remuneration committee chairman I am pleased to present the Committees report on directors remuneration.
In accordance with the new UK regulations governing the disclosure and approval of directors remuneration, our remuneration report has been split into two parts.
The directors remuneration policy is being put to a binding shareholder resolution at the forthcoming AGMs and the annual report on remuneration will be put to an advisory shareholder resolution.
Our remuneration policy for executive directors continues to be based on the principle of pay for performance and alignment with shareholders.
Annual bonuses are dependent on a scorecard of financial and non-financial elements with robust metrics, and 50% of any bonus is deferred into Mondi shares for three years.
The long-term incentive plan rewards sustained financial performance, measured through our percentage Return on Capital Employed ROCE, and our relative Total Shareholder Return TSR compared to other international companies in our sector.
Executive directors are also required to build a personal shareholding in Mondi.
Two changes were made in 2013: For LTIP awards in 2013, the ROCE performance requirement was increased to 16% from 14% previously at the top end of the performance scale.
Following shareholder approval at the 2013 AGMs, dividend equivalent accrual, up to the point of LTIP vesting, will apply to LTIP awards from 2013 onwards, to the extent that awards meet performance conditions.
This provides further alignment with the interests of shareholders.
As described in the strategic report Mondi achieved record financial performance in 2013.
ROCE performance of 15.3% and EBITDA of E1,068 million, which was 15% higher than in the previous year, are reflected in the remuneration received by directors during the year under review: Annual bonuses of approximately 73% of the maximum have been awarded in respect of performance in 2013.
This recognises the Groups good financial performance as well as strong performance against personal operational and strategic objectives that were set at the start of the year.
As a result of the tragic and unacceptable fatalities of contractors engaged in Mondi operations no payment was made under the safety element of the bonus.
The performance period for the 2011 LTIP ended on 31 December 2013.
Half of the award was based on ROCE performance and the other half on relative TSR performance.
ROCE for the three year performance period was 14.6%, above the applicable performance range of 10% to 14%.
The Groups TSR over the performance period was in excess of 100% 120% for Mondi plc shares and 126% for Mondi Limited shares which placed it in the top 25% of the comparator group.
As a result of this performance both the ROCE and TSR elements, and therefore the overall 2011 LTIP award, vested in their entirety.
Base salary increases of 2.6% were implemented with effect from 1 January 2014, once again below the average percentage increase for the wider Mondi population.
The Committee believes that the remuneration policy will continue to motivate our senior team to achieve the Groups objectives and deliver sustained returns for our shareholders.
We also believe that the remuneration of executives during 2013 reflects our successes to date in the delivery of our strategy.
I trust that you will feel able to support the remuneration resolutions at this years annual general meetings.

Directors remuneration policy This part of the directors remuneration report sets out the remuneration policy for the Group and has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the governance codes in South Africa and the UK and the views of our major shareholders and describes the policy to be applied from 2014 onwards.
The policy report will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 annual general meetings and if approved the policy will take formal effect from that date.
The Groups remuneration policy has been set with the objective of attracting, motivating and retaining high calibre directors, in a manner that is consistent with best practice and aligned with the interests of the Groups shareholders.
Remuneration policy for executive directors is framed around the following key principles: remuneration packages should be set at levels that are competitive in the relevant market: the structure of remuneration packages and, in particular, the design of performance-based remuneration schemes, should be aligned with shareholders interests and should support the achievement of the Groups business strategy and the management of risk: a significant proportion of the remuneration of executive directors should be performance-based: the performance-based element of remuneration should be appropriately balanced between the achievement of short-term objectives and longer-term objectives: and the remuneration of executive directors should be set taking appropriate account of remuneration and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.

indd 84 2014 03 10 3:02 PM Differences in remuneration policy for executive directors compared to other employees There are differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for the executive directors and employees, which are necessary to reflect the different levels of responsibility and market practices.
The key difference is the increased emphasis on performancerelated pay in senior roles.
Lower maximum incentive pay opportunities apply below executive level, driven by market benchmarks and the relative impact of the role.
Only the most senior executives in the Group participate in the LTIP and the BSP as these plans are targeted on those individuals who have the greatest responsibility for Group performance.
Executive directors existing service contracts, and policy on loss of office David Hathorn and Andrew King are employed under service contracts with both Mondi Limited and Mondi plc.
Peter Oswald is employed in Austria under a service contract with Mondi Services AG.
The service contracts for David Hathorn and Andrew King provide for one years notice by either party.
They include pay in lieu of notice provisions which may be invoked at the discretion of the Group.
The payment in lieu of notice would comprise base salary, benefits and pension contributions for the notice period and an amount in compensation for annual bonus only for that part of the financial year the individual has worked.
Peter Oswald was recruited, and is based, in Austria.
His service contract is required under Austrian law to be for a fixed period, which renewable fixed period expires on 30 April 2016.
However, the contract has also been structured as far as possible to conform to the accepted practice for directors in the UK, and can be terminated on one years notice by either party.
Prior to 2008, he did not have a notice period, and was entitled to receive compensation on termination equivalent to remuneration for the unexpired term of the five-year fixed term contract.
The Committee re-negotiated this contract in 2008 to substantially reduce the Groups potential liabilities, and introduced a standard 12-month notice period, together with an accompanying lump sum payment on termination, which was necessary to facilitate the transition from the previous contract.
In the event of termination by Mondi, other than for cause, the current contract provides for payment of base salary, benefits and pension contribution in respect of the 12-month notice period and eligibility for annual bonus in respect of the period he has worked.
He would also be eligible for a lump sum amount calculated as E908,800 plus interest on this amount accrued at the Euribor interest rate for the period since 1 January 2008.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive director under the Groups share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee taking into account the individuals performance and the reasons for their departure good leaver status can be applied.
For good leavers, vesting of BSP awards that are not subject to performance conditions is accelerated to as soon as practical after employment termination.
LTIP awards remain subject to performance conditions measured over the original time period and are reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.
The Committee has the discretion to disapply the application of performance conditions and or time pro-rating if it considers it appropriate to do so.
However, it is envisaged that this would only be applied in exceptional circumstances.
In determining whether an executive should be treated as a good leaver or not, the Committee will take into account the performance of the individual and the reasons for their departure.
indd 85 2014 03 10 3:02 PM DIRECTORS REPORT Remuneration report continued Details of the service contracts of the executive directors who served during the period under review are as follows.
These contracts were all signed prior to 27 June 2012.
Executive director Effective date of contract Unexpired term notice period David Hathorn 3 July 2007 Terminable on 12 months notice Andrew King 23 October 2008 Terminable on 12 months notice Peter Oswald 1 January 2008 A fixed term expiring on 30 April 2016 but terminable at any time on 12 months notice A directors service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.
Service contracts for new appointments Normally, for any new executive director appointments, the Groups policy is that the service contracts should provide for one years notice by either party.
The contract would provide that, in the event of termination by the company, other than for cause, the executive would be eligible for: payment of the base salary, pension contribution and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the 12-month notice period: annual bonus only in respect of the period they have served, payable following the relevant performance year-end and subject to the normal performance conditions for annual bonus: share-based awards they hold, subject to the plan rules, which include arrangements for pro-ration of LTIP awards and continued application of performance conditions.
The Group would seek to apply the principle of mitigation to the termination payment by, for example, making payments in instalments that can be reduced or ended if the former executive wishes to commence alternative employment during the payment period.
In exceptional circumstances, such as to secure for the Group the appointment of a highly talented and experienced executive in a market such as Germany or Austria where it is common for the most senior executives to have three-year or five-year fixed term contracts, the Committee may need to offer a longer initial notice period that reduces progressively to one year over a set time period.
In such exceptional circumstances, the Committee would seek to ensure that any special contract provisions are not more generous than is absolutely necessary to secure the appointment of such a highly talented individual.
The Committee would also take account of the remuneration and contract features that the executive may be foregoing or relinquishing in order to join Mondi, in comparison with the overall remuneration package that Mondi is able to offer.
86 Integrated report and financial statements 2013 7230 13 Mondi report 297ES.
indd 86 2014 03 10 3:02 PM Approach to remuneration for new executive director appointments The remuneration package for a newly appointed executive director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Groups approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.
The variable remuneration for a new executive director would be determined in the same way as for existing executive directors, and would be subject to the maximum limits on variable pay referred to in the policy table above.
For an internal appointment, any legacy pay elements awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according to their terms.
For internal and external appointments, the Group may meet certain relocation expenses, as appropriate.
For external appointments, the Committee may also offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of Mondi and shareholders, to replace variable remuneration awards or arrangements that an individual has foregone in order to join the Group.
This includes the use of awards made under section 9.4.
Any such payments would take account of the details of the remuneration foregone including the nature, vesting dates and any performance requirements attached to that remuneration.

All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with Mondi Limited and Mondi plc for an initial period of three years.
In accordance with best practice, non-executive directors are subject to annual re-election at the annual general meetings.
Appointments may be terminated by Mondi with six months notice.
No compensation is payable on termination, other than accrued fees and expenses.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Groups remuneration policy for the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives is set taking appropriate account of remuneration and employment conditions of other colleagues in the Group.
The Committee annually receives a report from management on pay practices across the Group, including salary levels and trends, collective bargaining outcomes and bonus participation.
At the time that salary increases are considered the Committee additionally receives a report on the approach management propose to adopt for general staff increases.
Both these reports are taken into account in the Committees decisions about the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives.

indd 88 2014 03 10 3:02 PM The Group does not engage in formal consultation with employees on directors remuneration policy.
However, employees of the Group are encouraged to provide feedback on the Groups general employment policies, and, in some countries where the Group operates, more formal consultation arrangements with employee representatives are in place, relating to employment terms and conditions, in accordance with local custom and practice.
The Group also conducts periodic employee engagement surveys which gauge employees satisfaction with their working conditions.
The Mondi Boards are given feedback on these survey results.
Shareholder context The Committee considers the views of shareholders in its deliberations about the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives, and consults directly with major shareholders when any material changes to policy are being considered.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Group to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports.
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.

Both EBITDA and ROCE were between target and stretch performance and also exceeded prior year performance.
Executives personal performance was assessed against objectives agreed by the Committee at the start of the year including: development of strategy: operational performance: financial efficiency: stakeholder relationships: credit ratings and financing: streamlining of organisational structures: integration of acquisitions and achievement of synergies.
Safety was measured on total recordable incidents and fatalities.
While total recordable incident targets were achieved there were regrettably and unacceptably four fatalities of contractors engaged in maintenance work for Mondi.
No safety element was therefore paid and an even greater focus is being placed on key aspects of safety in 2014.

Maximum performance was achieved against the TSR targets and ROCE targets.
100% of the shares under award therefore vested in March 2014.
Awards granted in 2013 The maximum award that can be made to any LTIP participant in any year is equal to two times salary.
For 2013, the award made to David Hathorn was 185% of salary and the awards made to Andrew King and Peter Oswald were 130% of salary.
For the LTIP awards made in 2013, the performance conditions are based on two performance measures of equal weight relative TSR and ROCE, measured over a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2015.
The Committee believes that this combination of metrics provides an appropriate means of aligning the operation of the LTIP with shareholders interests and the Groups business strategy.
The TSR performance condition is based on the Groups TSR relative to a group of competitor companies.
For the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards, the following group of companies was selected: 1 Amcor 2013 Mets Board 1 2 Bemis 2013 Norske Skog 2010, 2011, 2012 Billerud Portucel DS Smith Sappi 1 3 As previously reported, Amcor and Bemis were added to the Domtar SCA 2010, 2011 peer group for 2013 and subsequent awards.
