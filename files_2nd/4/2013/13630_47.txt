All directors have confirmed that, save as disclosed in the single figures of remuneration tables above, they have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration.
Annual Cash Bonus for 2013 The annual cash bonus is calculated according to targets which total 80% and which are allocated to directors at 100% of basic salary, except for the Chief Executive where the allocation is 125% of basic salary.
The targets, weightings and achievement in relation to performance in 2013 are as follows: Performance % payable Performance required at at target required at % payable at Performance % bonus target performance maximum maximum outcome awarded Accident Frequency Rate 0.43 5% 0.43 5% 0.33 5.0% CO reduction -1.5% 5% -1.5% 5% -7.1% 5.0% 2 Cash generation 100% 10% 100% 10% 99.6% 9.7% EPS growth 120.2p 10% 120.2p 10% 124.9p 10.0% Three year profit growth 140.0m 15% 155.6m 25% 151.8m 22.6% Annual profit target 142.6m 15% 154.0m 25% 151.4m 23.2% Total 60% 80% 75.5% Overall this resulted in the following bonus payments: RH Arnold 226,000 94.4% of salary JM Davis 255,000 94.4% of salary PI France 486,000 118.0% of salary GM Ogden 189,000 94.4% of salary Rotork plc Annual Report 2013 64 directors remuneration report continued Long Term Incentive Plan The Companys Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP rewards the creation of shareholder value which is a strategic priority.
Performance is measured over a three year period using a combination of earnings per share, growth and relative total shareholder return TSR compared to a comparator group.
The performance measures and weightings are summarised in the table below.
TSR was measured relative to a bespoke group of 17 comparable companies with the Companys TSR performance over the three-year performance period required to be at least equal to the performance of the median company in the comparator group for 25% of the awards to vest, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% of the awards vesting if the TSR performance was equal to or above the upper quartile.
Rotorks actual TSR performance was 123% resulting in 51% of the TSR element of the award vesting.
The Companys EPS growth over the three-year performance period had to be at least equal to RPI 10% for 15% of the awards to vest, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% of the awards vesting if the EPS growth was equal to RPI 25%.
Rotorks actual EPS growth was 39% resulting in 100% of the EPS element of the award vesting.
The overall vesting of the awards was 75.5% and the total number of shares vesting in respect of all executives was therefore 52,241.
The shares vested on 7 March 2013 and were exercised on the same date.
The share price on that date was 29.50. ii The 2011 awards were based on TSR and EPS performance to 31 December 2013 each condition accounting for 50% of the award.
TSR was measured relative to a bespoke group of 18 comparable companies with 25% vesting at median increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance or above.
For the EPS condition, EPS growth must be at least RPI 10% for 25% vesting, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for EPS growth of RPI 25% and above.
Rotorks actual TSR performance was 72% resulting in 34% of the TSR element of the award vesting.
Rotorks actual EPS growth was 42.6% resulting in 100% of the EPS element of the award vesting.
The overall vesting of the awards was 67% and the total number of shares vesting in respect of all Executives was therefore 40,104.
The shares will vest in March 2014. iii The performance conditions for the 2012 awards are based on performance to 31 December 2014.
The targets are the same as for the 2011 awards except that the TSR comparator group is the FTSE 250 Index excluding all financial services, insurance companies and investment trusts.
iv The 2013 awards were granted on 7 March 2013 and are subject to the same performance targets as the 2012 awards albeit based on performance to 31 December 2015.
Further details on the awards are set out in the table below.

The amounts above have been calculated in accordance with Statutory Instrument 2013 No 1981 The Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Account and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
The total accrued pension in the defined benefit scheme as at 31 December 2013 is that which would be paid annually on retirement from normal pension age, based on service to 31 December 2013, except for GM Ogden who became a preserved member of the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme on 5 April 2012.
GMOgdens total benefit as at 31December2013 includes deferred revaluation applied to that date.
The value of benefits in the defined benefit pension scheme is based on the increase in accrued pension over the year incorporating an increase for Consumer Prices Index CPI inflation.
The figures as at 31 December 2012 were not disclosed in the 31 December 2012 accounts but have been calculated as if the new regulations had applied at that date.
GM Ogden became a preserved member of the Scheme as at 5 April 2012 and so did not accrue any additional pension during 2013.
He received a cash allowance of 88,129 in lieu of this pension benefit in 2013.
The pensionable salary used to calculate benefits in the defined benefit scheme for PI France and JM Davis is restricted to a Scheme specific earnings cap which is currently 137,400.
In consideration of this limitation on their benefits under the scheme they receive a monthly cash sum equal to 22.5% and 18% respectively of their basic salary above the Schemes specific cap.
During 2013 this resulted in an additional cash allowance of 61,785 and 23,858 in lieu of the additional pension benefits respectively.
The figures shown for RH Arnold are in respect of his membership of the Rotork Controls Inc. pension scheme and a supplemental executive retirement plan so that, in aggregate, the pension arrangements for RH Arnold are targeted to provide a pension of at least 60% of uncapped basic salary at age 65.
The valuations of the benefits are affected by movements in the US dollar relative to sterling and are therefore not directly comparable with the directors in the UK scheme.
The accrued pension figures for PI France exclude a fixed transfer-in pension amount of 5,123.11 which is payable from his normal retirement date at age 60.

The figures shown for the increase in accrued pension and transfer value over the year exclude any increase for inflation.
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the relevant Technical Actuarial Standards TASs published by the Financial Reporting Council.
The increase in accrued pension and the increase in transfer value over the year for RH Arnold are affected by movements in the US dollar relative to sterling.
The transfer value of accrued pension for RH Arnold reflects the benefits provided by the US scheme together with a US valuation of these benefits and is therefore not directly comparable with the transfer values for directors in the UK scheme.

It is not practical to obtain a breakdown of base salary, benefits and bonuses for the whole Group but total remuneration per employee across the Group rose by 4.1% from 2012 to 2013.
The typical salary increase for the UK workforce was between 2.5% and 3%.

Except for RH Arnold and JM Davis, this is consistent with the typical increase for the UK workforce which was between 2.5%-3%.
JM Davis received a higher increase reflecting his increased experience and performance in the role.
The salaries from 1 January 2014 are therefore as follows: RH Arnold - $382,868 2% JM Davis - 285,000 5.6% PI France - 422,300 2.5% GM Ogden - 205,301 2.5% The annual cash bonus for 2014 will be based on annual profit target 25%, three year profit growth 25%, EPS 10%, cash generation 10%, accident frequency rate 5% and CO emissions 5%.
These targets total 80% and are then allocated to executive directors at 2 100% of basic salary, except for the Chief Executive where the allocation is 125% of basic salary.
The specific targets relating to the bonus have not been disclosed as they are considered by the Committee to be commercially sensitive but full details will be given on a retrospective basis in next years report.
Consistent with the approach used in previous years, LTIP awards of 100% of salary will be granted and the performance conditions will be subject to TSR and EPS performance conditions each accounting for 50% of the award.
TSR will be measured relative to the FTSE 250 Index excluding all financial services, insurance companies and investment trusts 2012 awards with 25% vesting at median increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance or above.
