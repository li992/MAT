MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Directors remuneration report 47 Chairmans introduction and annual statement It is my pleasure to present the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The Remuneration Committee Committee hope that you find the new layout of the report incorporating this annual statement, the Policy report and an annual report on remuneration to be clear and transparent.
The Policy report and annual report on remuneration will be submitted separately to shareholders for approval at our AGM on 7 May 2014.
Shareholders will separately be asked to approve a new Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP which, if approved, will replace the Equity Participation Plan EPP and Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS from 2014 onwards.
Pay philosophy Executive remuneration packages at Meggitt are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of a high calibre, to recognise the international nature of the Groups business and to reward the directors for delivering value to shareholders.
The package targets fixed pay at market competitive levels to companies of a similar size and with similar operating characteristics, supplemented by performance related annual bonuses and an equity-based long term incentive plan designed to reward and incentivise growth, and provide a strong link to Group and individual performance.
2013 activity The key activity of the Committee in 2013 was to review the remuneration package and policy for senior executives, taking into account shareholders interests and views on pay structure simplicity and other areas of good practice, whilst keeping the package and policy aligned with our stated pay philosophy.
The major changes we consulted on were: i simplifying the long term incentive structure into a single LTIP and introducing performance measures which reflect Meggitts strategic goals see page 50 : ii introducing annual bonus deferral into shares see page 49 : iii introducing clawback provisions see pages 49 to 50 : and iv increasing directors share ownership guidelines see page 51.
The intended remuneration arrangements for 2014 outlined in this report are based on this revised remuneration package and Policy.
2013 performance Ongoing demand growth in civil original equipment and energy was tempered by softness in the civil aftermarket and military, and operational challenges in the year caused a further drag on growth.
Revenue grew 2% and underlying profit before tax grew 3%, driving a 3% increase in underlying EPS to 37.5p.
With a strong order book and an improving trend in civil aftermarket, there is good momentum going into 2014.
ESOS awards made in 2011 vested at 76.0% based on three-year cumulative underlying EPS performance to 31 December 2013 see page 59.
Performance of the EPP awards made in August 2011, where vesting has not yet been confirmed, is shown on page 58.
The Committee has used its discretion to reduce the vesting outcome under the Short Term Incentive Plan STIP for 2013 performance and ESOS and EPP for the EPS element of awards vesting in 2014 in relation to the supply from a vendor of nonconforming raw material in 2012, which was discovered in 2013 and impacted our customers.
This issue was caused by a process failure at a properly qualified supplier, and was recovered by the Group with all necessary diligence.
However, the Committee feels the financial impact felt by shareholders should be recognised and has therefore used its discretion to reduce the STIP and LTIP see annual report on remuneration.
This Directors remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
The report meets the requirements of the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
In this report we describe how the principles relating to directors remuneration, as set out in the Code, are applied in practice.
The Committee confirms that throughout the financial year the Company has complied with the Code.
We have identified which sections of the report are audited.
Paul Heiden Chairman of the Remuneration Committee MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 48 Directors remuneration report continued The Policy report This section of the report sets out the Remuneration Policy for the directors, which shareholders will be asked to approve at the 2014 AGM.
The Committee intends that the Policy will come into effect from our AGM on 7 May 2014.
Executive Director Remuneration Policy Table Base salary Function To attract and retain talent by ensuring base salaries are competitive in the relevant talent market.
Operation Salary will be reviewed by the Committee annually, in February, with changes effective from 1 April of that year.
Salaries for the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
In deciding salary levels, the Committee considers personal performance including how the individual has helped to support the strategic objectives of the Group.
The Committee will also consider employment conditions and salary levels across the Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Salaries are paid to existing directors in GBP: however the Committee reserves the right to pay future and existing directors in any other currency converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed.
Opportunity It is not anticipated that percentage salary increases for executive directors will exceed those of the wider workforce over the period this Policy will apply.
Where increases are awarded in excess of the wider employee population, for example if there is a material change in the responsibility, size or complexity of the role, the Committee will provide the rationale in the relevant years annual report on remuneration.
Performance None explicitly, but salaries are independently benchmarked periodically against FTSE companies in similar metrics industries and those with similar market capitalisation.
Personal performance is also taken into account when considering salary increases.
Pension Function To provide post-retirement benefits for executive directors in a cost-efficient manner.
Operation The pension plans operated by the Group which executive directors are, or could be, members of are: Meggitt Pension Plan defined benefit pension plan, closed to new members.
Meggitt Workplace Savings Plan defined contribution personal pension scheme, open to new members.
Salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for directors.
Opportunity From 2013, it has been our Policy that new executive director external appointments including Mr Webb are eligible for a pension allowance of 25% of salary, payable either as pension contribution up to any limit set in current regulations or, above such limits, in cash.
Where agreements have been made prior to the approval of this Policy which entitle an executive to receive a pension allowance higher than 25% of salary, pension allowances up to a maximum of 50% of salary, will be paid: Mr Young and Mr Green had agreements prior to the approval of this Policy which entitles them to receive a pension allowance of 50% of salary and this arrangement will continue for these directors.
metrics MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 49 Benefits Function To provide non-cash benefits which are competitive in the market in which the executive director is employed.
Operation The Group may provide benefits including, but not limited to, a company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, life assurance, a fuel allowance, a mobile phone, relocation costs and any other future benefits made available either to all employees globally or all employees in the region in which the executive director is employed.
Opportunity Benefits vary by role and individual circumstances: eligibility and cost is reviewed periodically.
Benefits in respect of the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
It is not anticipated that the costs of benefits provided will increase significantly in the financial years over which this Policy will apply, although the Committee retains discretion to approve a higher cost in exceptional circumstances e. g. to facilitate recruitment, relocation, expatriation etc or in circumstances where factors outside the Groups control have changed materially e. g. market increases in insurance costs.
metrics Annual bonus - STIP Function To incentivise executive directors on delivering annual financial and personal targets.
Operation Performance measures, targets and weightings are set at the start of the year.
The performance period of the STIP is a financial year.
After the end of the financial year, to the extent that the performance criteria have been met, 75% of the STIP award is paid in cash to the director.
The remaining 25% of the award will be deferred into shares and released with no further performance conditions attached, and no matching shares provided after a further period of two years.
The Committee will have the discretion to apply clawback to reduce the size of deferred STIP awards in the event of a material misstatement of results or personal misconduct, and such awards will lapse in certain leaver circumstances see page 54 for details.
Opportunity The STIP provides for a maximum award opportunity of up to 150% of salary in normal circumstances with an on-target opportunity of 100% of salary and an opportunity of 50% of salary at threshold for any single measure.
The Committee has discretion to make a STIP award of up to 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances e. g. a substantial contract win which has a significant positive financial impact in the long term but which has no, or negative, short term financial impact.
Dividends accrue on unvested deferred STIP awards over the vesting period and are released on the vesting date.
Performance STIP awards are based on the achievement of financial and personal performance targets.
For the executive metrics directors, two thirds of the STIP will be weighted to financial performance, with the remainder subject to personal performance.
The relative weightings of the financial and personal elements for any STIP period, and the measures used to assess financial and non-financial performance, will be set by the Committee in its absolute discretion to align with the Groups operating and strategic priorities for that year.
The award for performance under each element of the STIP will be calculated independently.
The Committee will have discretion to review the consistency of the pay-out of the financial and personal elements and adjust the total up or down within the levels specified above if it does not consider this to be a fair reflection of the underlying performance of the Group or the individual.
The personal performance element will typically be based on three to five objectives relevant to the executives role.
Details of the measures, weightings and targets applicable to the STIP for each year, including a description of how they were chosen and whether they were met, will be disclosed retrospectively in the annual report on remuneration for the following year subject to commercial sensitivity.
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 50 Directors remuneration report continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP subject to shareholder approval Function To align the interests of executive directors with shareholders in growing the value of the Group over the long term.
Operation The LTIP, the introduction of which is subject to shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM, would replace the EPP and ESOS.
Under the LTIP, executive directors will be eligible to receive annual awards over Meggitt shares vesting after three years subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets.
Whilst it is the current intention that LTIP awards will be in the form of nil cost options, the LTIP provides, at the absolute discretion of the Committee, for awards over conditional shares, market value share options and phantom awards.
The Committee will have the discretion to apply clawback to reduce the size of unvested LTIP awards in the event of a material misstatement of results or personal misconduct.
Opportunity Executive directors will normally be eligible for annual LTIP awards of 220% of salary.
Awards up to a maximum of 300% of salary may be granted in exceptional circumstances e. g. to support the recruitment of a key executive or to recognise exceptional individual performance.
The award opportunity under the LTIP has been calibrated to be equivalent, in fair value terms, to that granted in aggregate under the previous EPP ESOS structure.
30% of an award will vest if performance against each performance condition is at threshold and 100% if it is at maximum, with straight line vesting in between.
Dividends accrue on unvested LTIP awards over the vesting period and are released, to the extent the LTIP award vests, on the vesting exercise date.
Performance Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to continued employment and performance against three measures, which are metrics intended to be as follows: Earnings per Share EPS : Return on Trading Assets ROTA, which is underlying operating profit after tax divided by net trading assets, measured at constant currency.
Net trading assets are adjusted to exclude goodwill and other intangibles arising on the acquisition of a business, derivative financial instruments, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax and net debt: and Strategic goals typically to be based on three strategic priorities around execution, growth and innovation.
The way these measures link to our KPIs can be seen on pages 18 to 21.
It is the current intention that the weighting of the measures will be equal i. e. one third each but that the Committee will consider, and adjust if deemed appropriate, the weighting at the start of each LTIP cycle.
Any  information on measures, targets and performance will be disclosed retrospectively.
Awards made under the LTIP will have a performance period of three financial years, starting from 1 January of the year in which the award is made and ending on 31 December of the third year.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of the relevant performance period, awards will lapse.
Vesting of the strategic element will also be subject to a discretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent to which achievement of the strategic objectives is consistent with the underlying financial performance over the three-year period.
The measures and targets in operation for grants made under the ESOS and EPP in the current year, and which are not deemed commercially sensitive are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan Function To align the interests of employees and shareholders by encouraging all employees to own Meggitt shares.
Operation SharesaveAll employee scheme under which all UK employees including executive directors may save up to the maximum monthly savings limit as determined by legislation over a period of three or five years.
Options under the Sharesave Scheme are granted at a discount of up to 20% to the market value of shares at the date of grant.
Share Incentive PlanAll employee scheme under which i all UK employees including executive directors may contribute up to the monthly maximum as determined by legislation to purchase shares monthly from pre-tax pay: and ii all UK employees including executive directors may receive free shares up to the annual maximum value as determined by legislation.
Opportunity Savings, contributions and free shares are capped at the prevailing legislative limit at the time UK employees are invited to participate.
metrics MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 51 Notes to the Policy table The Committee is satisfied that the above Policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-taking.
The Committee retains discretion to make minor, non-significant changes to the Policy without reverting to shareholders.
Payments from outstanding awards Outstanding awards are currently held by the directors under the EPP and the ESOS, the Groups long term incentives operated prior to the introduction of the proposed LTIP in 2014.
These awards will continue to vest subject to performance conditions being met and be capable of exercise during the period over which this Policy applies.
The tables on pages 66 to 67 highlight outstanding and vested awards.
Approach to target setting and performance measure selection Targets applying to the STIP and LTIP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points, including the Groups strategic plan, analyst forecasts for Meggitt and its sector comparators, historical growth achieved by Meggitt and its sector comparators and external expectations for growth in Meggitts markets.
STIP The performance measures used under the STIP reflect financial targets for the year and non-financial performance objectives.
The Policy provides the Committee with flexibility to select appropriate measures on an annual basis.
STIP performance targets are set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular personal performance objectives and the economic environment in a given year.
For financial measures, target is based around the annual budget approved by the Board.
Prior to the start of the financial year, the Committee sets an appropriate performance range around target, which it considers provides an appropriate degree of stretch challenge and an incentive to outperform.
LTIP It is proposed that the vesting of future LTIP awards is linked to EPS, ROTA and the achievement of long-term strategic goals.
EPS is considered by the Board to be the most important measure of Meggitts financial performance.
It is highly visible internally, is regularly monitored and reported, and is strongly motivational for participants.
EPS targets will continue to be set on a nominal cumulative pence basis to incentivise consistent performance and reflect the fact that Meggitts profits are generated to a large degree outside the UK and not significantly influenced by UK retail price inflation.
ROTA helps to balance the achievement of growth and returns.
The Committee believes ROTA is a good internal proxy for total shareholder return TSR which focuses executives on managing the balance sheet and Meggitts operational performance, whilst also being less remote for participants below Board level.
The definition of net trading assets for ROTA excludes goodwill and other intangible assets arising when a business is acquired, to reflect that acquisitions are not within the control of the majority of participants.
In order to safeguard against poor acquisitions the Committee has overall discretion to reduce the outcome under the ROTA element if in its opinion the outcome does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The performance of acquisitions against Board approved targets is also monitored separately.
The Committee believes that the strategic goals component will help reinforce the realisation of Group strategy and the achievement of key non-financial and strategic goals over long product cycles which drive long-term value at Meggitt.
The element will typically comprise a scorecard of three-year targets across a maximum of three core strategic areas for the Group.
The Committee believes that this approach will enable it to reflect the Groups long-term nature and shifting strategic priorities in the LTIP to ensure executives interests remain closely aligned with those of our shareholders over time.
Specific measures and targets for each area will be developed and clearly defined at the start of each three-year cycle to balance leading and lagging indicators of performance.
Vesting of this element is subject to a discretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent to which achievement of the strategic objectives is consistent with Meggitts underlying financial performance over the performance period.
Remuneration policy for other employees The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as that for executive directors.
Annual salary reviews take into account Group performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in comparable companies.
Some employees below executive level are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes: opportunities and performance measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individuals role.
Senior executives are eligible for LTIP on similar terms as the executive directors, although award opportunities are lower and vary by organisational level.
All UK employees are eligible to participate in the Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan on identical terms.
Share ownership guidelines During the year, the Committee increased the minimum shareholding guidelines for executive directors from 100% to 300% of base salary for the Chief Executive and from 100% to 200% of base salary for each of the other executive directors.
There is no set time frame within which directors have to meet the guideline, however until they meet the guideline they are not permitted to sell more than 50% of the after-tax value of a vested share award.
The shareholding requirement ceases when a director leaves the Group.
Further information on the shareholding requirement is in the annual remuneration report see page 65.
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 52 Directors remuneration report continued Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis The charts below provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the executive directors, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Maximum, On-target and Minimum.
S G Young 000 D R Webb 000 P E Green 000 29% 29% 42% 26% 30% 44% 29% 29% 42% Maximum 3,474 Maximum 2,192 Maximum 1,803 48% 31% 21% 44% 34% 22% 48% 31% 21% On-target 2,119 On-target 1,294 On-target 1,101 100% 100% 100% Minimum 1,017 Minimum 564 Minimum 530 Salary and benets Pension STIP LTIP Potential reward opportunities are based on Policy, applied to 2014 base salaries and 2014 incentive opportunities.
Note that the LTIP awards granted in a year will not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value excludes the impact of share price movement or dividend accrual.
The Maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration salary and benefits and pension, plus maximum payout under all incentives 150% of salary under the STIP, and full vesting of LTIP awards.
The On-target scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target STIP based on two-thirds of maximum opportunity and LTIP threshold vesting 30% vesting.
The Minimum scenario reflects fixed remuneration only, being the only elements of the executive directors remuneration package not linked to performance.
Non-executive directors remuneration policy table Non-executive directors are submitted for re-election annually, do not have a contract of service and are not eligible to join the Groups pension or share schemes.
Details of the Policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below: Fees Function To attract and retain non-executive directors of the highest calibre with broad commercial and other experience relevant to the Group.
Operation Fee levels are reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 1 April each year.
The fees paid to the Chairman of the Board are determined by the Committee, while the fees for all other non-executive directors are reviewed by a committee of the Board formed of executive directors.
Fees for the year under review and for the current year are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Additional fees are paid to the chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committee and to the Senior Independent Director, to reflect the additional time commitment of these roles.
In deciding fee increases, the committees consider employment conditions and salary increases across the Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Currently, all fees are paid in GBP, however the committees reserve the right to pay future and existing nonexecutive directors in any other currency converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed.
Opportunity Fee increases will be applied taking into account the outcome of the annual review.
The maximum aggregate annual fee for all non-executive directors including the Chairman as provided in the Companys Articles of Association is 1,000,000.
metrics MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 53 Recruitment External appointments In cases of hiring or appointing a new executive director from outside the Group, the Committee may make use of all existing components of remuneration, as follows: Maximum annual Component Approach grant value Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined based on the experience and skills N A of the individual, internal comparisons, employment conditions and salary levels across the Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Initial salaries may be set below market and consideration given to phasing any increases over two or three years subject to development in the role.
Pension In line with the Policy, new appointees will be entitled to become members of the Meggitt N A Workplace Savings Plan defined contribution plan or receive a cash pension allowance of 25% of salary in lieu.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with the Policy, and will be N A Sharesave SIP eligible to participate in all-employee share schemes.
N A STIP The structure described in the Policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant 150% of salary maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year.
Targets 200% in exceptional for the personal element will be tailored to the appointee.
circumstances LTIP New executive director appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on similar terms 220% of salary as other executives, as described in the Policy table.
300% in exceptional circumstances In determining the appropriate remuneration structure and levels, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of Meggitt and its shareholders.
The Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, i. e. over and above the approach outlined in the table above.
Any such compensatory awards will be made under existing share schemes, where appropriate, and will be subject to the normal performance conditions of those schemes.
The Committee may also consider it appropriate to structure buy-out awards differently to the structure described in the Policy table, exercising the discretion available under UKLA Listing Rule 9.4.
2 R where necessary to make a one-off award to an executive director in the context of recruitment.
In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
The value of any such buy-out will be fully disclosed.
Internal promotion In cases of appointing a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the Policy will be consistent with that for external appointees, as detailed above.
Any commitments made prior to an individuals promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the Policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Group may, where appropriate, seek to revise an individuals existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors and prevailing market best practice: in 2013, the Committee reviewed Mr Youngs service contract, which was subsequently updated on 1 May, on his promotion to Chief Executive.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director, including details of any exceptional payments will be disclosed in the RIS notification made at the time of appointment and in the annual report on remuneration for the year in which the recruitment occurred.
Non-executive directors In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Committee will use the Policy as set out in the table on page 52.
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 54 Directors remuneration report continued Service contracts and exit payment policy Executive director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to manage the Group.
The Committees Policy is that executive director service contracts should be terminable on no more than 12 months notice.
The Committees approach to payments in the event of termination of employment of a director is to take account of the particular circumstances, including the reasons for termination, individual performance, contractual obligations and the rules of the Groups applicable incentive plans which apply to share awards held by the executive directors: C ompensation for loss of office in service contracts Except as set out in the table below, under the terms of their service contracts, the executive directors may be required to work during their notice period or may, if the Company decides, be paid in lieu of notice if not required to work the full notice period.
Payment in lieu of notice will be equal to base salary plus the cost to the Group of providing the contractual benefits pensions allowance, health insurance and company car or car allowance that would otherwise have been paid or provided during the notice period.
Payments will be in equal monthly instalments and will be subject to mitigation such that payments will either reduce, or stop completely, if the executive director obtains alternative employment.
A n executive directors employment can be terminated by the Group without notice or payment in lieu of notice in specific circumstances including summary dismissal, bankruptcy or resignation.
T reatment of STIP Executive directors have no automatic entitlement to any bonus on termination of employment under the STIP, but the Committee may use its discretion to award a bonus normally pro-rated.
W here any bonus is deferred into shares, the award will normally lapse if an executive directors employment terminates unless the executive director leaves for specified good leaver reasons.
The good leaver reasons are death, redundancy, retirement, injury, disability, the business or company which employs the executive director ceasing to be part of the Group, any other circumstances in which the Committee exercises discretion to treat the executive director as a good leaver or on a change of control.
If the executive director is a good leaver their award will vest on the normal vesting date, or earlier on a change of control, and would not be subject to pro-rating.
T reatment of long term incentive plan awards The treatment of awards under the ESOS and the EPP is governed by the rules of plans which have been approved by shareholders and is described below.
Similar treatment will apply under the new LTIP which shareholders are being asked to approve at the 2014 AGM.
A wards under the plans will normally lapse if an executive directors employment terminates unless the executive director leaves for specified good leaver reasons.
The good leaver reasons are the same as described above.
If the executive director is a good leaver, awards will vest to the extent that the attached performance conditions are met, but on a time pro-rated basis, with Committee discretion to allow early vesting.
Under the EPP and ESOS awards vest as soon as practicable after an employee has left.
Under the LTIP awards will vest on the normal vesting date.

As dated 26 February such, remuneration or payments for loss of office that are 2001 required to be made under Mr Greens service contract are not required to be consistent with the Policy set out above.
Payments to Mr Green under his service contract differ from the Policy set out above in the following respects: On termination of employment, Mr Green is entitled to a liquidated damages payment equal to his salary and the value of his contractual benefits bonus, pension allowance, insurance and company car or car allowance at the date of termination, pro-rated to the remaining notice period less an amount equal to 5% of the aggregate sum and the Committee shall exercise its discretion under the Groups share plans to treat Mr Green as a good leaver.
On change of control, Mr Green may give notice to terminate his employment within 6 months of the event and upon such termination he shall become entitled to the liquidated damages payment summarised above.
External appointments held by executive directors The Board believes that the Group can benefit from experience gained when executive directors hold external non-executive directorships.
Executive directors are allowed to hold external appointments and to receive payment provided such appointments are agreed by the Board or Committee in advance, there are no conflicts of interests and the appointment does not lead to deterioration in the individuals performance.
Details of external appointments and the associated fees received are included in the annual report on remuneration on page 64.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company The Committee does not consult with employees specifically on executive remuneration policy and framework but does seek to promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodiesincluding trade unions and works councilsas part of its broader employee engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Salary increases made elsewhere in the Group are amongst the data that the Committee considers in determining salaries for executive directors.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee considers shareholder views received during the year and at the AGM each year, as well as guidance from shareholder representative bodies more broadly.
The majority of shareholders continue to express support of remuneration arrangements at Meggitt.
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 56 Directors remuneration report continued Annual report on remuneration The following report provides details of how our Policy was implemented during the year ended 31 December 2013.
Remuneration Committee2013 membership and attendance Meetings eligible Meetings Name to attend attended Mr P Heiden Committee chairman 6 6 Mr G S Berruyer 6 6 Mr P G Cox 6 6 Ms B L Reichelderfer 6 6 Mr D M Williams 6 6 There was one meeting between the end of the financial year and the date of signing of this report, at which all members attended.
Activities for the year are described in the Chairmans introduction.
The Committee operates within agreed Terms of Reference available on our website.
The Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration policy and packages for all executive directors and Executive Board members covering five of the next most senior executives across the Group and for agreeing the fees for the Chairman.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and Organisational Development Director attend meetings of the Committee by invitation: they are absent when their own remuneration is under consideration.
None of the non-executive directors has, or has had, any personal financial interests or conflicts of interest arising from crossdirectorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
Advisers to the Committee During the year, the Committees independent remuneration advisor was Kepler Associates Kepler.
Kepler, appointed in 2010, was selected by the Committee as a result of a competitive tender process.
The Committee evaluates the support provided by Kepler annually and is comfortable that they provide independent remuneration advice to the Committee.
Kepler provide guidance on remuneration matters at Board level and below.
Kepler do not have any other connection with the Group.
Kepler is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its code of conduct www.
Shareholder consultation and 2013 AGM voting A consultation letter was issued in October 2013 to our top 20 shareholders covering over 65% of our shareholder base on a revised remuneration package and policy, principally covering the proposed introduction of bonus deferral arrangements and a new LTIP with clawback provisions attached to both, on which we received positive feedback from most of these investors.
We issued a second letter in December 2013 with clarifications, particularly related to LTIP performance measures.
The majority of responses were supportive and therefore the Committee agreed to propose the Policy unchanged for shareholder approval at the AGM.
Following feedback received from investor advisory bodies in advance of the 2013 AGM, the Committee also reviewed the level of pension contribution for Mr Young and Mr Green 50% of salary.
These arrangements reflect contractual provisions to participate in the Meggitt Pension Plan MPP, a defined benefit scheme.
On reaching the governments Lifetime Allowance which Mr Young and Mr Green both reached in April 2012, executives may cease accruing further benefit under the MPP and receive the 50% allowance on their full salary.
As part of the wider review of executive remuneration, the Committee considered ways to address this concern.
The Committee decided that rather than rebalance the package e. g. through significant salary increases or higher incentive opportunities, it was simpler and more equitable to make no changes to these legacy pension arrangements.

Further details of the 2013 STIP, including performance measures, actual performance and bonus payouts, can be found on page 58.
4 EPP is calculated as the number of shares vesting based on performance measures substantially completed during the year, valued at the market value of the shares.
For 2013, the figure represents the vesting outcome of the EPS element of the 2011 EPP award the performance period ended on 31 December 2013 and an estimate of the outcome under the TSR element of the 2011 EPP award the performance period of which will end in August 2014 based on performance to 31 December 2013.
The market value of vested shares is based on the average share price over the last quarter of 2013 of 526.38p.
For 2012, the figure represents the actual vesting outcome of 2010 EPP award valued at the share price on the date of vesting 533.00p on 16 August 2013.
The valuation of the 2011 EPP award will be updated for the actual vesting outcome of the TSR element in August 2014 and the share price on date of vesting 17 August 2014 in next years annual report on remuneration.
Further details on performance criteria, achievement and resulting vesting levels can be found on pages 58 to 59.
5 ESOS is calculated as the number of shares vesting based on performance measures substantially completed during the year, valued at the difference between the market value of the shares and the exercise price of the award.
For 2013, the figure represents the vesting outcome of the 2011 award.
The market value of vested shares is based on the average share price over the last quarter of 2013 of 526.38p and an exercise price of 351.70p.
For 2012, the 2010 award vested at 100% and the market value and exercise price were 489.70p and 286.10p respectively.
The valuation of the 2011 ESOS award will be amended for the share price on date of vesting 2 March 2014 in next years annual report on remuneration.

MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 58 Directors remuneration report continued Incentive outcomes for the year ended 31 December 2013 STIP in respect of 2013 performance The Board set stretching financial and strategic targets for the STIP at the start of the 2013 financial year.
These targets, and our performance against these, are summarised in the table below.

The STIP pool generated by the above results is equivalent to approximately 45% of target, however, considering the operational performance of the Group, particularly the supply from a vendor of non-conforming raw material, the Committee has used its discretion to reduce the STIP pool by 20%.
The following awards were made to directors in respect of 2013 performance: % salary 000 Mr S G Young 39 250 1 Mr D R Webb 22 93 Mr P E Green 39 126 1 Mr T Twigger 12 78 1 Amounts shown in respect of Mr D R Webb and Mr T Twigger have been prorated based on service as a director during the year.
2011 EPP The EPP award made in August 2011 vests 50% on cumulative underlying EPS performance, 25% on cash conversion over three financial years and 25% on the Groups relative TSR performance over a three-year period commencing on the date of grant, as follows: Measure Weighting % Period ending Vesting schedule Outcome Vesting % 1 1 EPS 50 31-Dec-2013 0% vesting below 97p 106.2p 76.0 30% vesting for 97p per share 100% vesting for 111p or more: Straight line vesting between these points Cash conversion 25 31-Dec-2013 0% vesting below 87% Below 0 30% vesting at 87% threshold 100% vesting at 95% and above: Straight line vesting between these points 2 2 TSR 25 17-Aug-2014 0% vesting below median TSR n a n a 30% vesting for median TSR 100% vesting for upper quartile TSR: Straight line vesting between these points 1 Represents growth in EPS of 10.5% over the performance period: the vesting outcome of the EPS portion of the award has been reduced to reflect the cash impact of the issue relating to the supply from a vendor of non-conforming raw material.
2 The vesting outcome of the portion of the award subject to the TSR performance condition will be confirmed at the end of the three-year performance period ending in August 2014.
For the purposes of the single figure of remuneration table, the estimated vesting of this element of the 2011 award is 0%, based on Meggitts relative TSR performance to 31 December 2013 which is below median.

2010 EPP As disclosed in the 2012 Remuneration report, the Committee determined that 50% of the 2010 EPP award subject to the three-year cumulative underlying EPS performance condition vested in full, based on performance to 31 December 2012.
The remaining 50% of the award was dependent on the Groups TSR performance compared to a group of 17 international aerospace and defence companies over the three-year period to 16 August 2013.
TSR for all comparator companies is measured on a common currency basis.

To allow for comparability going forward, the Committee has elected to capture the vesting of the entire 2010 EPP award in the financial year ending 31 December 2012 for the purposes of the single figure, as follows: Interests Market price at Value Executive held Vesting % Interests vested Date vested vesting 000 Mr S G Young Basic award 88,379 87.9 77,729 16-Aug-2013 533.00p 414 Matching award 65,526 57,630 307 Mr P E Green Basic award 67,512 87.9 59,376 16-Aug-2013 533.00p 316 Matching award 50,054 44,022 235 MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 60 Directors remuneration report continued Scheme interests awarded in the year ended 31 December 2013 audited 2013 EPP Face value Shares over which 1 2 3 Executive Form of award Date of grant awards granted Award price 000 % of salary Date of vesting Mr S G Young Basic award Nil cost option 18.03.13 114,556 419.01p 480 75 18.03.16 Matching award Nil cost option 66,946 478.00p 320 50 Mr D R Webb Basic award Nil cost option 05.09.13 60,281 528.77p 319 75 05.09.16 Matching award Nil cost option 39,868 533.00p 212 50 Mr P E Green Basic award Nil cost option 18.03.13 58,173 419.01p 244 75 18.03.16 Matching award Nil cost option 33,996 478.00p 163 50 1 Mr Twigger did not receive any awards under the ESOS or EPP in 2013.

The face value has been calculated using the award price for each award.
Consistent with awards made in 2012, vesting of EPP awards granted in 2013 is dependent on the achievement of three-year targets relating to cumulative underlying EPS, cash conversion and relative TSR outperformance.
The three-year period over which performance will be measured will be the three financial years ending 31 December 2015.
This includes the performance period for the TSR element, which the Committee considered it appropriate to align with the other performance measures.

Percentage change in CEO cash remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in remuneration for all executive employees, We have selected our executive population around 250 people for this comparison because it is considered to be the most relevant, due to the structure of total remuneration: most of our senior executives receive benefits under the same STIP and LTIP structure as our CEO.
For 2013, the figures comprise elements paid to Mr T Twigger before his retirement from the Board in May 2013 and payments made to Mr S G Young from his appointment as CEO in May 2013.
The pay for executive employees is calculated using the increase in the earnings of full-time executive employees.
