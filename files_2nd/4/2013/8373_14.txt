Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of the cash flow hedging Interest bearing loans and borrowings instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
The fair value of the floating interest bearing loans and borrowings is equal to the book value, since the floating interest rates were reset just prior to the year end.
The fair value of the fixed interest bearing loans and borrowings has been calculated based on the Other present value of future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the market rate at the reporting date.
This relates to a merger difference that arose in 2002 on the conversion of share warrants into share capital.
Trade receivables and payables For trade receivables and payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All others are estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
