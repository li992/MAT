Non-executive Directors are engaged under Letters of Appointment.
Loss of Office Directors Letters of Appointment expressly prohibit any entitlement to payment on loss of office.

Statement of consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company as the Company has no employees, the process of consulting with employees on the setting of the Remuneration Policy is not relevant.
The remuneration package for any new Chairman or non-executive Director will be the same as the prevailing rates determined on the bases set out above.
The fees and entitlement to reclaim reasonable expenses will be set out in Directors Letters of Appointment 2.
The Board will not pay any introductory fee or incentive to any person to encourage them to become a Director, but may pay the fees of search and selection specialists in connection with the appointment of any new non-executive Director.

Details of the implementation of the remuneration policy are set out below.
The Committee appointed New Bridge Street a trading name of Aon plc to provide general remuneration advice and specific advice on the operation of its long term incentive plans.
