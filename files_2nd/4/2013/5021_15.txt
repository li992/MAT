Advisers During the year, the Committee took advice from Deloitte Birmingham office in respect of the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Deloitte London office also provided tax advice to the Company in relation to capital allowances.
Remuneration policy Executive remuneration policy and alignment with strategy The Remuneration Committees policy is to provide an executive remuneration structure that will pay fairly for the roles and responsibilities of each Director and incentivise strongly for value creation, with an emphasis on the long term.
This is in keeping with the family origin of the business and is important to the Adderley family who remain our majority shareholders.
Since the flotation of the Company our executive remuneration has been structured specifically: To reward performance.
To be focused on long term value creation.
To align executives with shareholders through share ownership.
Our policy is consistent with delivery of the objectives set out in our corporate strategy, which are all long term in nature: namely the growth and development of our specialist product offer, our stores portfolio, our multi-channel capability and our infrastructure.
It is our intention to maintain a simple and transparent remuneration structure that does not frequently change.
Structure of executive remuneration i Base salary Base salaries are set at, or below, the median for comparable companies and increases are expected to be in line with Group-wide awards unless merited by specific circumstances.
In setting base salaries a retail peer group is considered within the FTSE 250 as well as industry wide surveys which cover the FTSE 250 and small-cap sector.
In addition the operational scale and complexity of the role each Director performs is discussed and adjustments are applied to reflect these.
It is our policy that base salary should comprise a minority of the total remuneration that an Executive Director can earn.
ii Pension The Remuneration Committee has decided not to use final salary pension plans as a way of remunerating its Executive Directors.
Instead the Group contributes 10% of base salary to the Executive Directors personal pension plans.
The Remuneration Committee believes this is an efficient way to assist Executives to prepare for retirement.
When determining overall remuneration levels for an Executive, the Remuneration Committee takes account of contributions to pension plans.
48 Dunelm Group plcAnnual report and accounts 2013 Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information iii Performance related pay The Remuneration Committees policy is that a substantial proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration should be variable and performance-related in order to encourage and reward superior business performance and shareholder return.
Constituents Performance related pay consists of: An annual cash bonus of up to 100% of salary.
An annual award of share options to the value of 150% of salary under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, exercisable after three years, subject to performance criteria being met and from 2013 following a two year deferral.
This is set at the median for the annual cash bonus but in the upper quartile for the LTIP in order to incentivise consistent above market average growth.
Nick Wharton, our Chief Executive, has an additional one-off five year LTIP award, approved by shareholders in 2010, which runs until 2015, and which aligns his interests to share price performance over and above the regular three year LTIP.
Balance of fixed and variable remuneration Potential performance pay currently comprises just over two thirds of maximum potential earnings at up to 250% of base salary: the annual cash bonus entitlement is up to 100% of base salary and the three year LTIP is up to 150% of salary.
On an annual basis, around 70% of the maximum earnings opportunity is performance-related and over 40% is measured on a three year cumulative performance.
The following illustrates the balance between fixed and variable remuneration during the year for the Executive Directors: Table 3 Balance of fixed and variable remuneration 400 Variable 350% 350 Variable Fixed 300 LTIP 150% 250 % gures indicate 177.5% proportion of base salary 200 LTIP 37.5% 150 Bonus 100% Bonus 40% 100 Base 100% Base 100% 50 0 On target performance Maximum opportunity The breakdown does not include any share price growth or other benefits e. g. cash car allowance, value of private medical insurance, pension contribution or all employee share ownership plans.
Performance measures financial The Remuneration Committee selects performance measures that it believes are: Aligned with the Groups strategic goals.
Unambiguous and easy to calculate.
Transparent to Directors and shareholders.
The financial performance measure applicable to both the annual cash bonus and the LTIP is based on growth in earnings per share EPS over the performance period.
The Remuneration Committee considered the use of EPS as a performance measure carefully when the Company was floated in 2007 and has discussed it with shareholders on a number of occasions.
EPS is believed to be closely aligned to the drivers of growth for the business and in the long-term, EPS performance is expected to be reflected in shareholder value.
As discussed with institutional shareholders at the recent Corporate Governance presentation, EPS is a more suitable performance measure for Dunelm than for many other companies and it is therefore considered appropriate to use it as a single measure, supplemented by discretion reflecting non-financial performance measures as described below.
The use of EPS for Dunelm specifically is considered appropriate because of the absence of leverage in the business and because the capital expenditure controls exercised by the Board are sufficiently rigorous to avoid EPS accretion by means of ineffective investment of capital.
Should this change the Committee would review whether an additional financial underpin would be appropriate.
In the event of a major capital transaction the Committee reserves the right to adjust the target or change the performance conditions.
Dunelm Group plcAnnual report and accounts 2013 49 Remuneration report continued Performance measures non-financial Payment of the annual cash bonus may be adjusted based on personal, non-financial job objectives linked to delivery of the strategy, set at the commencement of the year and assessed by the Remuneration Committee.
With effect from 1 July 2013, in addition to personal job objectives, the Committee will refer to certain strategic KPIs and share price performance to inform its discretion over the bonus awarded, although there will not be a formulaic link.
Each Directors remuneration is therefore linked to both personal performance and Group strategy and performance.
Future LTIP participation by Will Adderley With effect from 1 January 2012, and in response to shareholder concerns about Will Adderley obtaining creeping control of the company through vesting of share incentive awards, Will Adderley has indicated that he no longer wishes to receive further awards under the LTIP.
He will be entitled to receive shares under existing awards, subject to performance criteria being met.
Claw back From 2012 the Committee decided to introduce a claw back provision under which cash bonus entitlements and unvested LTIP awards made from 2012 onwards will not be paid in certain circumstances.
Claw back will take place at the Remuneration Committees discretion if: performance to which a bonus or LTIP award relates proves to have been misstated: or there has been a miscalculation in the extent to which performance conditions have been met in respect of previous awards made to the individual that have vested and been exercised: or there has been gross misconduct on the part of an individual.
Change of control If there is a change of control of the Company, any awards under the LTIP that have not yet vested will be exercisable at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee taking into account the period of time that has elapsed since grant of the award, and the extent that any performance target has been met.
Share options and dilution It is Group policy to comply with the provisions of the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Executive Remuneration when determining the number of shares over which share scheme incentive awards may be made.
At the date of this report options have been granted over 2.3% of the Companys issued share capital.
The Group does not hold any shares in an employee benefit trust.
iv Shareholding requirements To strengthen the alignment between management and long-term business success, executive Directors and other senior managers in receipt of discretionary share awards are required to build a shareholding as follows: Table 4 shareholding requirements Required holding Period of time to build holding Executive Directors 2 x base salary 1 x salary after 3 years 2 x salary after 5 years Executives receiving LTIP Options 1 x base salary 5 years Executives receiving market priced options 0.5 x base salary Over time These required Director shareholdings are set at above market levels.
In addition, from 2013 awards made to Executive Directors under the LTIP will be subject to an additional two year deferral after the end of the performance period.
Dividend entitlement will accrue during this period, and the Executive will be entitled to exercise his optionover the shares at the end of the two year period, whether or not they are still employed.
This is intended to focus management attention firmly on long-term strategy implementation and to align management with long-term shareholders interests.
Directors shareholdings are disclosed in the Directors Report on page 61.

The Non-Executive Directors do not receive bonuses or participate in any incentive plans.
They are paid annual fees based on the market rate, which reflect any additional responsibilities taken when chairing a committee of the Board.
Senior Executive remuneration The Remuneration Committee provides oversight and guidance on the remuneration structure for below Board senior executives.
The package for new appointments is formally presented to the committee for approval.
In conducting its assessment of senior executive remuneration the committee pays particular regard to whether any individual is incentivised to take risks inappropriate to their role and responsibilities.
For example, in the finance function, managers are not remunerated against individual financial performance, but against corporate performance and personal qualitative objectives.
Sharesave scheme An annual invitation is made to all employees under our savings related share option scheme, or Sharesave.
Options are granted at the maximum 20% discount to the market price at the date of invitation, exercisable after three years.
Last year we were pleased that 9% of colleagues applied to join, compared with 7% in previous years.
We will continue to offer Sharesave as a way of encouraging colleague engagement through share ownership.
Implementation of remuneration policy during the period Executive Directors i Base salary and benefits Prior to the beginning of each financial year the Remuneration Committee sets the base salaries of Executive Directors.
The Committee examines the salaries of Directors in a comparator retail peer group of public companies and also considers all industry surveys for the FTSE 250 and small cap sectors.
In setting base salaries any increase for Executive Directors is expected to be in line with Group-wide salary increases unless specific circumstances merit a different approach.
Base salary comprises just under one third of the total potential remuneration that an Executive Director can earn.
In addition to base salary, the Executive Directors are entitled to benefits comprising a car allowance, a contribution of 10% of base salary to a personal pension, private medical insurance and life insurance.
In June 2012, the base salary review resulted in a 2% increase for all Executive Directors from 1 July 2012, in line with the Group wide award, which was waived by Will Adderley.
Following the review in May 2013, Executive Directors have been awarded a 2% increase in basic salary from July 2013, again in line with the Group-wide award.
Will Adderley has waived this increase.
Dunelm Group plcAnnual report and accounts 2013 51 Remuneration report continued Table6 Base salaries 2012 13 % increase on 2013 14 % increase on salary 2011 12 salary 2012 13 Nick Wharton 408,000 2% 416,160 2% Will Adderley 265,000 0% 265,000 0% David Stead 264,000 2% 269,300 2% ii Annual cash bonus Executive Directors are awarded a performance-related cash bonus, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Performance criteria are based on growth in earnings per share against budget, and personal non-financial objectives relevant to each Director, linked to delivery of strategy.
Any bonus amounts determined to be payable are paid after the year-end results are finalised.
For Nick Wharton and David Stead 100% of the annual bonus is calculated according to performance against budget but may be adjusted at the discretion of the committee, depending on an individuals performance against personal objectives.
For Will Adderley, 50% of the annual bonus is calculated according to the performance against budget and 50% is awarded for performance on strategic projects which are an important focus of his time.
The prospects for the market and the Group are considered when setting the budget EPS target for the year.
In addition we have regard to both market consensus expectations for EPS and individual broker forecasts.
The bonus parameters are described below: Table 7 Bonus parameters for financial target EPS performance Percentage of percentage of maximum target bonus payable Threshold 95% 5% Target 100% 40% Maximum 105% 100% For the year ended 29 June 2013, budget EPS was 38.5p.
Accordingly the target set was that no bonus would be paid until EPS reached 36.5p and at 40.4p maximum bonus would be paid.
Market consensus for 2012 13 EPS at the date the target was set was 37.6p.
After due consideration of job performance progress against strategic objectives and achievement of non-financial performance targets, the committee awarded a discretionary element of bonus as shown below.
This was equivalent to 10% of salary bringing the total award to 97%.
Will Adderley was awarded a bonus of 257,050 and choose to waive 50% of this award and requested the other 50% to be donated to the Groups charity of the year.
Table 8 Annual cash bonus earned Percentage of Bonus earned base salary Nick Wharton 395,760 97% Will Adderley n a n a David Stead 256,080 97% iii Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP, Executive Directors are awarded nominal cost share options annually.
These awards vest three years after date of grant, to the extent that the applicable performance target is met.
The Remuneration Committee has chosen growth in fully diluted EPS over each three-year performance period as the performance target for the awards under the LTIP.
The Committee believes that this measure is closely aligned to the drivers of growth of the business and that in the long term, EPS performance will be reflected in shareholder value.
The committee is satisfied that capital expenditure controls exercised by the Board are sufficiently rigorous to avoid EPS accretion by means of ineffective investment of capital and in any event reserves the right to adjust the target in the event of a major capital transaction.
The LTIP is structured as follows awards vest on a straight-line basis between the threshold and maximum points : Table 9 LTIP performance parameters Plan period Plan period 2011-2014 Amount of Compound Annual Growth in EPS 2010-2013 onwards award to vest Threshold RPI 3% RPI 3% 25% Maximum RPI 12% RPI 15% 100% 52 Dunelm Group plcAnnual report and accounts 2013 Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information The maximum point was increased for awards made from 2011 onwards, in line with the increase in maximum annual award from 120% to 150% of base salary.
This was part of an overall review of Executive Directors remuneration.
It was explained fully in the 2011 annual report and approved by shareholders at the AGM in November 2011.
The Committee meets after the results for each three-year performance period are available to determine the extent to which performance conditions have been satisfied.
Awards cannot be granted to Executive Directors under the LTIP over Ordinary Shares in excess of 5% of the issued Ordinary Share capital in any rolling 10 year period.
Details of outstanding awards made to Executive Directors under the LTIP and awards made and exercised during the financial year are set out in tables 15 to 17 of this report.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the Companys EPS record over the three-year performance period which ended on 29 June 2013.
Reported fully diluted EPS grew at a compound annual rate of 14.1%.
This is 10.4% above the compound annual growth in RPI over the same period.
Accordingly, 86.7% of the December 2010 LTIP award will vest in December 2013 as follows: Table 10 LTIP awards vesting in respect of 2010 13 Percentage of Shares vesting maximum award Nick Wharton 48,262 86.7% Will Adderley 62,956 86.7% David Stead 52,744 86.7% The 2010 LTIP awards which vested in favour of Nick Wharton, Will Adderley and David Stead as described above are included in the single number for total remuneration for 2012 13 set out in table 14.
Their value has been calculated using the average share price over the three months preceding the end of the performance period on 29 June 2013, which is 866.45p.
Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors remuneration is determined by the Board as a whole.
They are paid annual fees which reflect additional responsibilities taken when chairing a committee of the Board.
Fees were reviewed in April 2013 for the first time in three years, and it was found that they are now significantly out of line with the norm for a company of our size.
Fees will therefore be increased from 1 July 2013 as set out below: Table 11 Non-Executive Director Fees Fee between July 2010 and June 2013 per annum Fee from July 2013 Comment Geoff Cooper Chairman 100k 120k Marion Sears SID 40k 50k Fee from 2013 includes SID and Remuneration Nominations Committee Chair fees of 10k Matt Davies Audit and Risk 30k 45k Fee from 2013 includes Committee Chair Audit and Risk Committee Chair fee of 5k Simon Emeny 30k 40k Liz Doherty 40k from appointment on 40k 1 May 2013 Going forward, rather than reviewing fees every three years, fees for the Non-Executive Directors will increase annually in line with the Company average.
Service contracts In accordance with the Groups policy, the service contracts of the Executive Directors have no fixed-term, the notice period for termination is 12 months from either party and payments on termination are restricted to a maximum of the value of salary for the notice period.
The Remuneration Committee will apply mitigation rigorously in respect of any post remuneration payment.
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years with a provision for termination of one months notice from either party, or three months notice from either party in the case of Geoff Cooper, the Chairman.

Relative TSR performance The graph below shows the Groups performance over five years, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the FTSE General Retail Index and the FTSE 250.
The Remuneration Committee has chosen these indices for comparison because they provide a range of comparator companies which have similar market capitalisation, which are in the same sector and which face similar market and economic challenges in the long term.

Will Adderley was awarded a bonus of 257,050 and chose to waive the element of this award that relates to achievement of personal objectives 50% and requested the other 50% to be donated to the Groups charity of the year.
David Stead waived taxable benefits totalling approximately 1,000.
The realisable gain on LTIP awards vesting in the relevant financial period is calculated using the LTIP award whose performance period ends on the last day of the financial period being reported on so for 2012 13, the LTIP award used is the 2010 award, with a performance period of July 2010 to June 2013 inclusive.
The realisable value of the award is then calculated by multiplying the number of shares which will vest after applying the performance criteria, by the average share price for the three months ended on the last day of the performance period.
Nick Whartons 2012 13 remuneration includes the realisable gain in respect of the first LTIP award made to him that has matured since his appointment on 1 December 2010.
This accounts for the large increase in his total remuneration for 2012 13 compared with the previous year.
Directors interests in share options Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP As at 29 June 2013, the Directors beneficial interests in options granted under the LTIP, which unless otherwise noted will vest only if EPS performance conditions are met, are as follows: Table 15 Directors interests in LTIP End of Market price of Share options at performance shares at date of Director Date of award Nature of award 29 June 2013 period award 1 Nick Wharton Dec 2010 Oneoff joining award 198,807 Nov 2015 503p Dec 2010 2010 13 LTIP 120% quantum 55,666 June 2013 503p pro rata to time served Nov 2011 2011 14 LTIP 150% quantum 139,211 June 2014 431p Nov 2012 2012 15 LTIP 150% quantum 95,401 June 2015 642p Will Adderley Dec 2010 2010 13 LTIP 120% quantum 72,614 June 2013 503p pro rata salary 2010 11 Nov 2011 2011 14 LTIP 150% quantum 92,227 June 2013 431p David Stead Dec 2010 2010 13 LTIP 120% quantum 60,835 June 2013 503p Nov 2011 2011 14 LTIP 150% quantum 90,070 June 2014 431p Nov 2012 2012 15 LTIP 150% quantum 61,730 June 2015 642p 1 The nominal cost options over 198,807 shares made to Nick Wharton on 1December2010 can only vest if he remains an employee for five years.

This total includes all rewards that the Director received or will receive pertaining to the year being reported.
In the case of Dunelm our simple remuneration structure means that the total remuneration includes: base salary, value of benefits, pension contribution, cash bonus relating to the year, the actual value of SAYE options vesting and exercised in the year and the value of the gross LTIP shares vesting in respect of the performance period ended in the year, calculated using the average share price over the three months ended on the last day of the performance period which we refer to in the tables as realisable value.
Total remuneration earned by the Executive Directors in 2012 13 was 3.11m and by the Non-Executive Directors was 0.21m.
The total remuneration of all Directors was 3.32m.
