Part B sets out the Directors annual remuneration report and includes details of how our remuneration policy was implemented for the year ended 31 December 2013 and how it will be applied for the year ended 31 December 2014.
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 23 April 2014 there will be Tom Maxwell two resolutions in respect of this Remuneration Report: Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 27 February 2014 the Directors Remuneration Policy Report set out in Part A on pages 59 to 67 will be put to a binding shareholder vote: and the Directors Annual Report on Remuneration in Part B on pages 68 to 76 will be put to an advisory shareholder vote.
Part A: Remuneration Policy Components of executive director remuneration The Committees policy is to set remuneration levels which ensure that executive directors are fairly and responsibly rewarded in return for high levels of performance.
The remuneration policy set by the Committee aims to encourage a performance based culture which reinforces behaviour that will lead to the continued long term successful development of the business, is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executive directors and senior managers and aligns their interests with those of shareholders.
The Committee believes that the aims of the policy are achieved by ensuring that a significant proportion of total remuneration is linked to the achievement of stretching corporate and individual targets both in the short and long term.

2014 Policy on share incentive awards The Committee expects to approve an award of Performance Shares to Eric Hutchinson and Rachel Whiting equivalent to 125 per cent and 60 per cent of annual base salary respectively.
Performance conditions for awards expected to be made in 2014 Having reviewed the appropriateness of the performance parameters for awards under the EIP, the Committee has determined that for awards to be made in 2014, the following parameters are apposite: Performance shares The performance conditions for Performance shares will be calculated over a three year performance period as set out in the following table: 50% of award: 1 Growth in EPS over the performance period % Proportion of Performance shares vesting % Below 15 0 15 30 Above 15 and below 30 On a straight line basis between 30 and 100 30 or above 100 Note 1 EPS means Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share after expensing of share-based payments.
50% of award: Absolute TSR Proportion of Performance shares vesting % Up to 25% growth 0 At 25% growth but below 65% growth On a straight line basis between 30 and 100 At or above 65% growth 100 In determining TSR for the Company, share prices will be averaged over the 90 day period immediately prior to, and at the end of, the performance period.
SARs and share options The performance condition for SARs and share options, where awarded, would continue to be based on the rate of growth in the Companys EPS over the three year performance period.
1 Growth in EPS over the performance period % Proportion of SARs share options vesting % Below 15 0 15 30 Above 15 and below 30 On a straight line basis between 30 and 100 30 or above 100 Note 1 EPS means Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share after expensing of share-based payments.
Shareholder approval for EIP Shareholder approval was given in 2005 to operate the EIP until 2015, subject to further shareholder approval being required on the use of new issue shares and any material changes to the plan.
No material changes to the EIP are proposed and therefore no specific shareholder approval is required at the 2014 AGM to continue to operate this plan.
However, we expect to seek shareholder approval at the 2015 AGM for an extension to the EIPs operating period.
63 SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Report on directors remuneration continued Approach to recruitment remuneration In the event that the Company recruits a new executive director either from within the organisation or externally, when determining the appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including but not limited to quantum, the type of remuneration being offered and the jurisdiction which the candidate was recruited from to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both the shareholders and the Company without paying more than is necessary to recruit an executive of the required calibre.
The Committee would generally seek to align the remuneration package offered with our remuneration policy outlined in the table above.
However, the Committee retains discretion to make proposals on hiring a new executive director which are outside the standard policy.
In the first year of appointment, the Committee may offer additional remuneration arrangements that it considers appropriate and necessary to recruit and retain the individual.
Such remuneration may be in the form of cash or share-based awards which may vest immediately or at a future point in time.
Vesting may be subject to performance conditions selected by the Committee.
The Committee may make awards on appointing an executive director to buy-out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to those awards, the form in which they were granted and the time over which they would have vested.
Generally buy-out awards would be made on a comparable basis to those forfeited.
In the event of recruitment, the Committee may also grant an award to a new executive under Listing Rule 9.4.
2 which allows for the granting of awards, specifically to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment or retention of an executive director, without seeking prior shareholder approval.
The maximum level of variable pay which may be awarded to new executive directors would normally be in line with the maximum level of variable pay set out in the policy table on pages 60 to 62 but in any event would be limited to 400 per cent of base salary, excluding any buy-out awards.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the previous role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment.
When recruiting non-executive directors, the remuneration arrangements offered would normally be in line with those paid to existing non-executive directors, details of which are set out on page 65.
Service contracts Executive directors In normal circumstances, it is the Companys policy that service contracts for executive directors have no fixed term and are capable of termination on no more than 12 months notice from either the Company or the executive director.
It is intended that this policy would also apply to new appointments of executive directors.
However, following the termination of Bill Burns service agreement on 3 September 2013, the Board determined that in order to provide certainty and stability, it was in the best interests of promoting the long-term success of the Company not to comply with Code Provision D. 1.5. of the UK Corporate Governance Code with regard to the length of service agreements for executive directors.
The Company therefore entered into a fixed term contract with Eric Hutchinson, which at the date of this Report has an unexpired term of 15 months and will expire on 31 May 2015.
Following its expiration in 2015, and in line with normal policy, the service agreement with Eric Hutchinson would be renewed on 12 months notice.
Both Eric Hutchinson and Rachel Whiting currently have a service agreement with Spirent Communications plc, and, being UK resident, both their contracts are in line with UK employment practice and are governed by the laws of England.
Rachel Whitings service agreement, dated 1 February 2014 may be terminated on 12 months notice from the Company and six months notice from Rachel.
Eric Hutchinsons service agreement may be terminated on six months from Eric.
Until his termination on 3 September 2013, Bill Burns had a service agreement with Spirent Communications Inc. governed by the laws of California.
The Company recognises that its executive directors may, from time to time, be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the Company.
At the date of this Report, neither Eric Hutchinson nor Rachel Whiting holds any such external positions.
The service agreements of the executive directors are available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection at the 2014 AGM.
64 STRATEGIC REPORT SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Non-executive directors All non-executive directors have a letter of appointment with the Company for a period of not more than three years, subject to the Companys Articles of Association.
However, since 2011 and in accordance with the Code, all directors stand for re-election at each AGM.
Details of individual appointments are as follows: Director First appointed a director Current appointment due to expire Ian Brindle 22 December 2006 2015 AGM Duncan Lewis 1 July 2007 2014 AGM Tom Maxwell 1 October 2007 2014 AGM Sue Swenson 1 February 2012 2015 AGM Alex Walker 22 December 2006 2015 AGM The letters of appointment are available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection at the 2014 AGM.
An example of a letter of appointment for a non-executive director is available on the Companys website at http: corporate.
Remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors The Board aims to recruit high calibre non-executive directors, with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience.
The Companys remuneration policy with regard to fees for non-executive directors, including the Chairman, is to pay fees which are in line with market practice for companies of a similar size and complexity.
Fees for the non-executive directors are normally reviewed by the Board once every three years and were last reviewed on 1 January 2012, having been frozen since 1 January 2008.
It was determined that the basic annual fee for non-executive directors would be set at 40,000 per annum for 2012 to 2014 inclusive.
Fees for the Chairman, which are determined by the Remuneration Committee, were set at 160,000 per annum for 2012 to 2014 inclusive, having been frozen since 1 January 2009.
The Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees each receive additional fees of 11,000 and 9,000 per annum respectively.
It is considered that non-executive director fees are at the median level for comparable companies.
Fees for non-executive directors and the Chairman will next be reviewed on 1 January 2015.
Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in cash incentive or share incentive arrangements and their service does not qualify for pension or other benefits.
No element of their fee is performance related.
When recruiting non-executive directors, the remuneration arrangements offered will generally be in line with those set out above.
Exit payment policy The Committee is committed to ensuring that it does not pay more than is necessary when executives leave the Group and its policy on exit payments is and will continue to be in line with market practice in the country in which the executive director resides: Service contracts contain provisions for the removal of the director without compensation for poor performance or material misconduct: Payment in lieu of notice may be paid under service contracts if the relevant notice period is not given to the director or if, having received notice from the director, the employer does not wish him her to serve it: Unless provided for in the service contract, the Company would seek to apply practical mitigation measures to any payment of compensation on termination, for example by reducing payments to reflect payments received in respect of alternative employment, taking into account all relevant circumstances: Service contracts do not contain provision for additional compensation on termination following a change of control as detailed in the Change of Control provisions set out on page 78 : Service contracts do not contain provision for liquidated damages of any kind: Service contracts contain appropriate provisions to protect the legitimate interests of the Company with respect to preventing any terminated director from working in a business which competes against the Company: and Incentives: Cash incentives: unless otherwise provided in the service contract, to be consistent with market practice in the country in which the executive resides, executives are not entitled to accrued cash incentives payable following termination: Employee Incentive Plan EIP : Leaver provisions were approved by shareholders when they approved the EIP.
Unvested awards will generally lapse at the point of exit.
Participants who leave due to special circumstances including redundancy, ill-health, injury or disability, retirement, death, the Participants employing company ceasing to be under the Control of the Group, a transfer of the undertaking in which the Participant works and any other reason, if the Committee so decides in general or in any particular case may be considered good leavers under the EIP Plan Rules.
In such circumstances, performance conditions are assessed by the Committee at the point of exit by testing the performance conditions up to the date of exit for TSR performance and to the end of the most recent financial period for EPS performance.
Vesting is then pro rated for time and vested awards may be exercised within 12 months following the date of termination of employment.
65 SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 Report on directors remuneration continued Illustrations of the application of our remuneration policy in 2014 The charts below show an illustration of the proportion of total remuneration made up of each component of the remuneration policy and the value of each component.
Three scenarios have been illustrated for each executive director: 1 Minimum performance Fixed remuneration 2 No cash incentive 3 No vesting under the Employee Incentive Plan 1 On target performance Fixed remuneration 2 100% of target cash incentive paid 3 65% vesting under the Employee Incentive Plan 1 Maximum performance Fixed remuneration 2 150% of target cash incentive paid 3 Full vesting under the Employee Incentive Plan Notes 1 Fixed remuneration comprises salary and benefit provision as set out in the policy table.
2 Cash incentive is annual bonus for 2014 as set out in the policy table.
3 Vesting of awards under the Employee Incentive Plan assumes full vesting for awards subject to EPS performance conditions for on target and maximum performance.
The share price is assumed to increase in line with the implied price earnings ratio at 31 December 2013.
For awards subject to Absolute TSR performance conditions, vesting is assumed to be 30 per cent for on target performance and 100 per cent for maximum performance.
The share price is assumed to increase in line with the performance condition required under each scenario.
Depending on share price performance, the actual outcome may be different.

The Committee is kept informed on a regular basis of salary increases for the general employee population and takes these into account when determining salary increases for executive directors.
No salary increase has been awarded for the role of either Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer for 2014.
While the Committee does not directly consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay, the Committee does receive updates and feedback on employee engagement surveys and takes these into account when reviewing executive pay.
An employee engagement survey is scheduled for 2014.
Further details of employee remuneration arrangements can be found in the Our Employees section on pages 36 to 37 of this Annual Report.
66 STRATEGIC REPORT SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consideration of the views of shareholders in setting remuneration policy The Committee is mindful of the views of shareholders in determining appropriate levels of remuneration and in ensuring that shareholder and director interests are aligned.
The Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with shareholders and seeks shareholder views when any significant changes are proposed to remuneration arrangements.
In particular, the Committee consulted with major shareholders regarding the appropriate performance measures for awards granted under the Employee Incentive Plan in both 2010 and 2013 and will continue to do so when changes are proposed to ensure both shareholder and directors interests are aligned.
In particular, the Committee expects to consult key shareholders in relation to the possible extension of the Employee Incentive Plans operating period, prior to making a decision on whether to seek approval by shareholders at the 2015 AGM.
Dilution The Committee is strongly committed to managing shareholder dilution in a responsible manner.
No new shares were issued during the year, with all vesting and exercises of share incentives being satisfied by the transfer of shares held by the Companys ESOT.
At the date of this Report, the ESOT holds 0.7 million Ordinary Shares for the purpose of satisfying the exercises of current and future awards by employees and former employees of the Group.
Overall shareholder dilution resulting from the Companys share incentive plans on a rolling ten year basis has fallen by 0.1 per cent when comparing the positions at 31 December 2013 8.9 per cent and 31 December 2012 9.0 per cent.
The overall number of share incentives outstanding has fallen by 0.3 million during the year to 5.5 million at 31 December 2013 2012 5.8 million.
Legacy matters For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors such as the payment of pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes that have or will have been disclosed to shareholders in remuneration reports before this Policy takes effect.
Details of any payments will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Committee discretion The Committee has powers delegated by the Board under which it operates.
In addition, it complies with rules which have either been approved by shareholders the Employee Incentive Plan or by the Board annual cash incentives.
These rules provide the Committee with certain discretions which serve to ensure that the implementation of the Remuneration Policy is fair both to the individual director and to shareholders, taking overall performance and the position of the Company into account.
The Committee also has discretions to set components of remuneration within a range from time to time.
The extent of such discretions are set out in the relevant rules or in the maximum opportunity and performance metrics sections of the Policy Table.
In addition, the Committee requires discretion to deal with genuinely exceptional or unforeseen circumstances.
This form of discretion will only be applied in the best interests of the Company and is intended to provide for changed circumstances or strategy that has not been provided for in the Remuneration Policy, when it would be disproportionate to seek specific approval from a general meeting of shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee will not exercise discretion to reward failure and will report on any exercise of discretion that changes the amount of remuneration paid in any year.

2 Benefits: taxable value of all benefits in respect of the year which comprise private healthcare, permanent health insurance, life insurance and car allowance.
3 Performance related incentive: cash incentive payable in respect of the year.
4 Long term incentive: value of Performance shares vesting in the year based on the performance condition that ends in the year.
5 Pension: cash value in lieu of pension or US 401 k plan contribution.
6 Bill Burns stepped down as CEO on 3 September 2013.
7 Eric Hutchinson became CEO on 3 September 2013.
8 On 30 November 2012, 129,260 and 51,926 Performance Shares vested and were alloted to Bill Burns and Eric Hutchinson respectively, which at a fair market value of 150.6 pence resulted in a gain of 194,666 $307,572 for Mr Burns and 78,201 $123,557 for Mr Hutchinson.
Quarterly and annual performance incentives During 2013, the cash incentive plan continued to be structured so that two-thirds of the incentive target could be earned in respect of quarterly targets and one-third in respect of annual targets.
Growth targets in the Companys EPS and order intake, representing 70 per cent and 30 per cent of the incentive respectively, determined the maximum incentive which could be earned in respect of the annual incentive element.
Quarterly incentives were structured in two stages.
Growth targets in the Companys quarterly EPS and order intake formed the first stage and determined the maximum incentive which could be earned in respect of each quarter.
Performance against key strategic goals including engineering and product milestones, and other financial targets, determined the actual incentive earned by each executive director in each quarterly performance period.
The engineering and product milestones in particular provide the roadmap to the Groups long term strategic direction and success.
The annual growth targets for EPS and order intake for an on target award for 2013 were 5.6 per cent and 10.3 per cent respectively.
These targets were not achieved and accordingly no award was earned.
The quarterly targets for EPS, order intake and individual goals are set prior to the commencement of each quarter.
The targets set for EPS and order intake were not met in the first three quarters of 2013 and accordingly, no award was earned in respect of those quarters.
In the fourth quarter, the EPS and order intake goals were partially met and all engineering and other personal goals were achieved, resulting in an award of 24,400 to Eric Hutchinson.
Engineering and product milestone goals were 84 per cent achieved during the year.
Other specific target detail for quarterly incentives is considered to be commercially sensitive.
In the prior year, cash incentive payments of $425,500 and $150,200 were paid to Bill Burns and Eric Hutchinson respectively.
For 2014, cash incentives will only be available to executive directors on an annual basis, with a maximum total cash incentive available for Eric Hutchinson and Rachel Whiting of 150 per cent and 75 per cent of base salary respectively.

Policy for Performance shares granted in 2013 The performance conditions for Performance shares awarded in 2013 under the EIP are calculated over a three year performance period as set out in the following table: 50% of award: 1 Growth in EPS over the performance period % Proportion of Performance shares vesting % Below 15 0 15 30 Above 15 and below 30 On a straight line basis between 30 and 100 30 or above 100 Note 1 EPS means Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share after expensing of share-based payments.
50% of award: TSR Ranking Proportion of Performance shares vesting % Below median 0 Between median and upper quartile On a straight line basis between 30 and 100 At or above upper quartile 100 72 STRATEGIC REPORT SPIRENT COMMUNICATIONS PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT 2013 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The comparator group for determining TSR comprises the 30 largest companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE TechMARK 100 Index, excluding those companies who were also constituents of the FTSE 100 Index at the commencement of the performance period, together with one non-UK listed direct competitor.
The Committee considered that the selected comparator group provided a suitable benchmark for the Companys TSR rating.
In determining the TSR for the Company and its comparator group, share prices will be averaged over the 90 day period immediately prior to, and at the end of, the performance period.
Policy for SARs and share options granted in 2013 The performance condition for SARs and share options awarded in 2013 under the EIP is based on the rate of growth in the Companys EPS over the three year performance period.
1 Growth in EPS over the performance period % Proportion of SARs share options vesting % Below 15 0 15 30 Above 15 and below 30 On a straight line basis between 30 and 100 30 or above 100 Note 1 EPS means Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share after expensing of share-based payments.
Share interests vesting during 2014 Awards which are due to vest on 23 March 2014 and are subject to an EPS performance condition have not passed that condition and will lapse on that date.
Awards which are due to vest on 23 March 2014 and are subject to a TSR performance condition will have that performance condition tested on 23 March 2014.
