Governance reMUNeratioN coMMittee rePort I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2013, which has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee the Committee and approved by the Board.
The Group delivered a strong set of results in 2013.
Revenues were 192.3 million 2012: 172.3 million and yielded headline profits before tax of 59.4 million 2012: 53.0 million and headline diluted earnings per share of 19.3p 2012: 16.9p.
Executive reward has continued to be an area of focus for shareholders and the wider public over the past year and the Committee is aware of the sensitivities regarding Executive pay at a time of continued economic challenge and uncertainty.
We fully support the new reporting regulations introduced by the Government earlier this year and the objective of further increasing the transparency of Executive remuneration arrangements.
This years report is therefore presented in line withThe Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 and isdivided into two new sections.
The first is the Policy Report which outlines the Groups remuneration policy, setting outcomponents of pay, how they are linked to business strategy, and the framework for assessing performance for theExecutive Directors.
The second section is the Annual Report on Remuneration which reviews how the policy was implemented in 2013 and includes a table showing a single figure of total remuneration for Executive Directors.
It also summarises how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented in 2014.
Mindful of the increasing length of remuneration reports, we have aimed here to be concise without compromising on transparency.
I hope these changes help make the Remuneration Report clearer and easier to understand and would welcome any feedback or comments.
During the year the Committee reviewed the remuneration arrangements in place at ITE Group to ensure they remain aligned with our business strategy, help reinforce the Groups continued success and provide strong alignment with the delivery of value to shareholders.
As part of its review, the Committee identified some modifications for future longterm incentive cycles which it believes will bring arrangements more into line with developments in market practice since the plans were approved by shareholders in 2004, and will strengthen alignment with shareholders.
Following our review and consultation with major shareholders and shareholder representative bodies, the Board will be seeking shareholder approval at the 2014 Annual General Meeting for a new 2014 Performance Share Plan to replace the existing ITE 2004 Performance Share Plan which expires on 26 February 2014.
The key proposals are: the introduction of an element on relative TSR for future PSP awards granted to the CEO, in addition to headline diluted earnings per share.
These performance conditions will run concurrently, such that relative TSR without EPS growth is notrewarded: the PSP will provide for annual awards of up to 150% of salary in normal circumstances and up to 200% of salary inexceptional circumstances e. g. recruitment : and the normal annual PSP grant size will be set at 150% of salary for the CEO after consideration of the headline diluted EPS and relative TSR performance conditions and at up to 100% of salary for other participants.
Additionally, to further encourage share ownership and strengthen alignment with shareholders, the Committee increased the share ownership guideline for the CEO from 100% to 150% of salary with immediate effect.
Further details of these changes are set out in the Policy Report on page 57 and in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 64.
The Committee was pleased that the majority of shareholders consulted were supportive of these proposals which it believes will assist the Group in continuing to motivate and retain the talent it needs to deliver longterm success.
Following feedback from major shareholders, the Committee toughened the threeyear cumulative headline diluted EPS performance requirements applying to 2014 PSP awards to be equivalent to 7% p. a. to 12% p. a. which it considers to be appropriately stretching over thethreeyear performance period.
Further details are provided on pages 67 and 68.
Resolutions to approve the Policy Report subject to a binding vote and the Annual Report on Remuneration subject to an advisory vote will be put to shareholders at the AGM.

Notes to policy table In addition to the above elements of remuneration, any commitment made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report will be honoured.
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting The measures used under the annual bonus plan are selected annually to reflect the Groups key strategic priorities for theyear and reinforce financial performance and achievement of annual objectives as well as individual performance.
Financial measures include, but may not be limited to, headline profit before tax to reinforce achievement of sustainable profit growth.
The Committee considers that headline diluted EPS is the most appropriate measure of longterm performance of the Group as it is wellaligned with shareholder interests and provides good lineofsight.
The scheme is simple and is well understood by participants.
The additional relative TSR performance condition further reinforces alignment with shareholder interests andhelps to provide a balanced and progressive relationship between pay and performance.
Performance targets are set at such a level as to be stretching and achievable, with regard to the particular strategic priorities and economic environment.
The annual bonus target is based on the annual budget approved by the Board.
Priorto the start of the financial year, the Committee sets an appropriate performance zone Threshold to Stretch aroundthe target, which it considers provides an appropriate degree of stretch challenge and an incentive to outperform.
The Committee reviews the performance targets applying to the PSP annually, prior to the start of the performance period, taking into account a number of internal and external reference points to help ensure they are appropriately stretching.
Threeyear cumulative headline diluted EPS performance targets are calculated as follows: adjust the headline diluted earnings per share figure achieved in the base year to remove the biennial effect: apply a compound increase to establish a Threshold target for each of the three years: apply a compound increase to establish a Stretch target for each of the three years: and, aggregate the performance target figures for each year to produce the cumulative headline diluted earnings per share performance targets for Threshold vesting and for Stretch.
Ahead of the start of each new PSP cycle, the Committee will reconfirm the TSR comparator group to ensure it remains relevant and robust.
differences in remuneration policy operated for other employees ITEs approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group.
All employees are eligible to participate in an annual bonus scheme with similar metrics to those used for the Executive Directors.
Opportunities and specific performance conditions vary by organisational level with business areaspecific metrics incorporated where appropriate.
Senior managers are eligible to participate in the PSP.
Performance conditions are consistent for all these participants, while award opportunities may vary by organisational level but are typically limited to 100% of base salary.
Other employees are eligible for consideration of awards of share options to further support alignment with shareholder interests see page 112 inthe notes to the consolidated accounts for more information on allemployee share option plans.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 60 Strategic report Governance Financial statements shareholding guidelines The Committee recognises the importance of aligning the interests of Executives with shareholders through the building upof a significant shareholding in the Group.
Executive Directors are required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of the aftertax gain made on the vesting of awards under the Plans, until they have built up a minimum shareholding of a value equivalent to at least 100% of annual base salary.
During the year, the Group strengthened the shareholding guideline for the CEO to a minimum holding equivalent of 150% of base salary.
Details of the current personal shareholdings are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 64. remuneration policy for new directors When hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, including by way of internal promotion, the Committee may make use of all the existing components of remuneration as follows: Component Approach Maximum value Base salary Determined in line with the stated policy, and taking Not applicable.

In determining appropriate remuneration for a new Executive, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both ITE and its shareholders.
The Committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a structure not included in the policy, for example to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, and will exercise the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.
In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including the expected value of all outstanding equity awards using a BlackScholes, or equivalent valuation and, where applicable, taking into account toughness of performance conditions attached to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met.
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Group will honour any contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to Executive Director.
In cases of appointing a new Nonexecutive Director, the approach will be consistent with the policy.

The Groupwide pay review budget is one of the key factors when reviewing thesalaries of the Executive Directors.
Although the Group has not carried out a formal employee consultation regarding Board remuneration, it does comply with local regulations and practices regarding employee consultation more broadly.
consideration of shareholder views It is the Committees policy to consult with major shareholders prior to any changes to its Executive Director remuneration structure.
During the year, the Group consulted with major shareholders holding approximately 60% of the Groups issued share capital and shareholder representative bodies, the ABI and ISS on the proposed introduction of a new longterm incentive plan to replace the Performance Share Plan which expires on 26 February 2014.
The Committee was pleased that the majority of investors were supportive of the proposed introduction of an element on relative TSR in addition to headline diluted EPS for future awards to the CEO, the concurrent nature of these two performance conditions such that relative TSRwithout EPS growth will not be rewarded, an opportunity of 150% of salary for the CEO after consideration of the TSR performance condition and an increase in the CEOs minimum shareholding guideline from 100% to 150% of base salary.
Following feedback from major shareholders, the Committee increased the threeyear cumulative headline diluted EPS performance requirement applying to 2014 PSP awards, as described in the Notice of Meeting.
Following discussions with major shareholders on the Groups approach for 2013 PSP awards, the Committee intends to remove the partial adjustment for : exchange rate movements for future awards to simplify the arrangements and aid transparency.
Therefore the achievement of the threeyear cumulative headline diluted EPS requirements for 2014 and future awards will be assessed based on actual results over the three financial years of the performance period, in line with the policy.

Longterm incentives scheme interests awarded during the year The Group has two plans which it operates for the Executive Directors, the ITE Group plc Employees Performance Share Plan 2004 and the ITE Group plc Key Contractors Performance Share Plan 2004.
Awards can be made to Executives over shares worth up to 100% of base salary each year, and under the latter scheme to key individuals who are not Group employees.
Awards granted on 10 January 2013 are subject to cumulative headline diluted EPS for the three financial years ending 30September 2015.
The performance targets are provided below: Cumulative headline diluted 1 2 Vesting percentage EPS for three financial years Equivalent constant growth 0% Less than 57p Less than 5.6% p. a.
Straight line basis Between 57p and 64p Between 5.6% p. a. and 11.6% p. a.
Headline diluted EPS is calculated as defined in the financial statements see the Finance Directors statement on page 33.
50% adjusted for the impact of : exchange rate movements from the 2012 base year average.
The performance conditions were chosen by the Committee to incentivise management to deliver sustained growth in headline diluted EPS performance over the next three financial years.
Actual results are adjusted to reflect 50% of the impact of : exchange rate movements from the base year average to help strengthen the incentive effect ofthe PSP byreducing the sensitivity of results to external uncontrollable factors during the performance period.
In addition, vested awards will be subject to clawback for the later of one year following date of vest or completion of the next audit of the Groups accounts in the event of a fraud or material misstatement of results being identified in relation tothe years in which the PSP is earned.

2014 PsP framework Awards are anticipated to be granted in January 2014 under the new PSP, for which shareholder approval will be sought atthe 2014 AGM as detailed in the policy.
It is proposed that awards will be assessed against cumulative headline diluted EPS for Executive Directors, and against an additional relative TSR performance condition for the CEO.
Both headline diluted EPS and TSRperformance conditions will be measured over the three financial years ending on 30 September 2016.
The proposed cumulative headline diluted EPS performance target is of aggregated fully diluted headline diluted EPS of 63p for a 30% award, 20% for the CEO and 69p for a 100% award to be earned over the three financial years ending on30September 2016.
Between 30% and 100% vesting will be calculated on a straight line basis.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 67 Governance reMUNeratioN coMMittee rePort continued The targets were calculated as follows: Adjusting the fully diluted headline EPS achieved in the financial year September 2013 to remove the biennial effect Applying a compound increase of 7% i. e. inflation 4% to establish a threshold target for each of the three years Applying a compound increase of 12% i. e. inflation 9% to establish a full vesting target for each of the three years Aggregating the target figures for each year to produce the aggregated fully diluted headline EPS targets for threshold vesting 20% for the CEO and 30% for other participants and for maximum vesting 100% The proposed arrangements do not include an adjustment for : exchange rate movements from the base year averagetosimplify the arrangements and aid transparency, although discretion remains to make an adjustment inexceptional circumstances.
For the CEOs award, it is anticipated that the two measures will operate concurrently so that relative TSR without EPSgrowth would not be rewarded, as illustrated in the vesting schedule below: 2014 LTIP vesting schedule TSR multiplier % EPS element for CEO only all participants 100% 1.5 EPS TSR element multiplier vesting X 30% 0% 1.0 Threshold Stretch Median UQ ITEs 3-year cumulative headline diluted EPS, p ITEs 3-year TSR rank vs. FTSE250 It is proposed that awards will be up to 150% of salary for the CEO if both the threeyear cumulative headline diluted EPS and relative TSR performance conditions are met in full, and up to 100% of salary to Executive Directors for full achievement ofthe threeyear cumulative headline diluted EPS performance condition.
The proposed TSR vesting condition is ITEs 3year TSRrank vs. a comparator group which for January 2014 LTIP awards is proposed to be the FTSE 250.
TSR performance in the upper quartile of ranked companies will result in a multiple of 1.5 being applied to the CEOs award.
TSRperformance below median rank will result in a multiple of 1 being applied to the CEOs award, with the multiple being calculated on astraight line basis for TSR performance between median rank and upper quartile performance.
chairman and Nonexecutive director fees During the year the Committee reviewed the Chairmans fee in light of the time commitment and fees payable at comparator companies and increased this from 130,000 to 145,000 p. a. effective from 1 March 2013.
With effect from 1 October 2013, the Nonexecutive Directors receive a base fee of 44,000 2012: 42,500, with an additional fee for the Senior Independent Director of 3,000 2012: 2,500 and for the Audit and Remuneration Committee Chairs of 5,500 2012: 5,000.
The Nonexecutive Directors fees for the year commencing 1 October 2013 are therefore as follows: Michael Hartley 52,500, Neil England 49,500, Linda Jensen 44,000 and Stephen Puckett 44,000.
