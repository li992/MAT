DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the Directors remuneration report for 2013.
Key principles Our remuneration policy for executive Directors is designed to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the high calibre required to ensure that the Group has excellent leadership and is managed successfully for the benefit of shareholders and other stakeholders.
We developed the policy using the key principles set out below which have underpinned our executive remuneration framework for a number of years: Aligned to GKN strategy and performance A significant element of executive remuneration is variable and linked to Group performance.
Our annual bonus plan STVRS rewards the delivery of a balanced selection of financial and strategic measures whilst the long term plan, the Sustainable Earnings Plan SEP introduced in 2012, is specifically designed to focus executives on our strategic objective of delivering sustainable long term earnings growth.
Aligning executives with shareholders A substantial proportion of the remuneration package is delivered in shares through the Deferred Bonus Plan and the SEP.
This supports our shareholding requirement and creates a culture of share ownership, long term stewardship and alignment with our shareholders.
Competitive pay In setting quantum, we consider remuneration practices in comparable businesses to ensure remuneration remains within the competitive range, without paying more than is necessary.
We also consider the remuneration of executive Directors in the context of other executives and employees throughout the Group.

Performance measures STVRS: a combination of financial and strategic measures which support the delivery of the Groups long term strategic objectives.
Appropriate targets are set each year which align with the specific business objectives for that year.
The Committee has discretion to alter targets to reflect changed circumstances such as material changes in accounting standards or changes in the Groups structure.
The Committee also has discretion to reduce payments based on its assessment of underlying performance of the Group, including health and safety performance.
SEP: based on sustained EPS growth over the long term in line with GKNs stated growth strategy and objective of creating long term shareholder value.
Before any vesting can occur, the Committee must be satisfied that this is justified by the quality of earnings.
This will involve consideration of Group return on average invested capital ROIC against internal projections, shareholder expectations, new investment performance and cost of capital to ensure that the level of vesting appropriately reflects shareholder value creation.
In accordance with the rules of the SEP, the Committee can adjust and or set different performance measures and targets if events occur such as a change in strategy, a material acquisition and or divestment of a Group business or a change in prevailing market conditions which cause the Committee to determine that the measures or targets are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that they achieve their original purpose.
Whilst stretching, targets under the STVRS and SEP are designed to discourage inappropriate risk taking.

Policy table for Chairman and non-executive Directors Purpose and link To provide fees within a market competitive range to recruit and retain individuals with the necessary experience and to strategy ability to make a substantial contribution to the Groups affairs.
Operation Fees are reviewed periodically.
The fee structure is: Chairman is paid a single consolidated fee.
Non-executive Directors are paid a basic fee plus an additional fee for any chairmanship of Board Committees and for the role of Senior Independent Director.
Maximum Set at a level which reflects the contribution and commitment required of them, taking into account fee levels in other potential value companies of similar size and complexity.
Overall the fees paid to non-executive Directors will remain within the limit stated in the articles of association, currently 1 million per annum.
The Chairman and non-executive Directors do not receive benefits in kind nor do they participate in the Groups short and long term incentive arrangements or in its pension scheme.
Difference in remuneration policy for other employees GKN is a global organisation with employees at a number of different levels of seniority and in a number of different countries and industry sectors.
Reward policies for employees other than Directors vary by geography and are determined by reference to grade, role, statutory requirements, local market practice and performance.
The remuneration framework for executives in senior management grades is broadly consistent with that for executive Directors.
For GKN employees, base pay is generally reviewed on an annual basis: reviews consider market practice, economic conditions and the companys budget.
Benefits vary according to statutory requirements and local market practice: employees in senior management grades receive benefits similar to those provided to executive Directors.
They also participate in the same incentive schemes as executive Directors.
Where appropriate, local arrangements apply to other employees providing them with participation in an annual bonus plan.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company GKN seeks the view of employees on a range of matters: however there is no explicit employee consultation process in relation to the Directors remuneration policy.
The Committee also considers the most recent pay awards in the Group generally, with the aim of maintaining salary increases for executive Directors in line with the average increase awarded to other employees in the Group other than as described in the policy table.

c Maximum is 110% of base salary for STVRS and 100% vesting of the maximum SEP award 174% of base salary.
d The illustrations for on target and maximum performance levels do not include the accrual of dividends over the relevant performance periods under the SEP.
Recruitment policy The policy aims to facilitate the appointment of individuals of sufficient calibre to lead the business and execute the strategy effectively for the benefit of shareholders.
When appointing a new executive Director, the Committee seeks to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of the Company and not to pay more than is appropriate.
The Committee will take into consideration a number of relevant factors, including calibre, existing remuneration package, and specific circumstances of the individual including the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited.
The Committee will typically seek to align the remuneration package with the Companys remuneration policy as set out in the policy table.
The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted excluding buy-out awards referred to below is 310% of base salary in line with the policy.
Any awards of variable remuneration will be linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance measures.
The Committee retains discretion to include other remuneration components or awards which are outside the specific terms of the policy to facilitate the hiring of candidates of an appropriate calibre, where the Committee believes there is a need to do so in the best interests of the Company.
The Committee will not use this discretion to make a non-performance related incentive payment such as a golden hello.
In some circumstances, the Committee may make payments or awards to recognise or buy-out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
The Committee will normally aim to do so broadly on a like-for-like basis taking into account a number of relevant factors regarding the forfeited arrangements which may include the form of award, any performance conditions attached to the awards and the time at which they would have vested.
The Committees intention is that the value awarded would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements and would be paid in shares not cash.
These payments or awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above.
Any share awards will normally be granted under the Companys existing share plans.
If necessary, and subject to the limit referred to above, recruitment awards may be granted outside these plans as currently permitted under the Listing Rules which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of a Director.
In accordance with the policy on page 82, new non-executive Directors are paid a base fee in relation to their appointment as Director.
No sign on payments are offered to non-executive Directors.

Policy on payment for loss of office Notice period The Companys policy is for all executive Directors to have a notice period of 12 months from the Company and 6 months from the executive Director.
Termination The Committee has discretion to choose whether to terminate a service contract with or without due notice or by paying in lieu of notice, dependent upon what it considers to be in the best interests of the Company in the circumstances.
Termination payments An executive Director will be entitled to be paid during his notice period or to a termination payment amounting to no more than 12 months salary, pension and other benefits.
The Committee may make additional termination payments where such payments are made in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Directors office or employment.
An executive Director would normally be expected to mitigate his loss.
The Committee retains discretion not to reduce or cancel termination payments if an executive Director obtains alternative employment if it is considered to be in the Companys best interests not to do so or if no duty to mitigate is applicable.
Benefits Benefits normally cease to be provided on the date employment ends.
However, the Committee has discretion to allow some minor benefits such as health insurance and repatriation allowances to continue to be provided for a period following cessation where this is considered fair and reasonable or appropriate on the basis of local market practice.
Appropriate out-placement assistance will generally be offered to an executive Director in line with practice applicable to executives in senior management grades.
Annual bonus An executive Director has no entitlement to an annual bonus in respect of the year of termination.
However, the Committee retains discretion to make a bonus payment dependent upon the particular circumstances of the executive Directors departure and performance.
Any such payment would normally be made on a pro rata basis to take account of time served during the financial year and can, at the discretion of the Committee, be paid wholly in cash.
Unvested long term All awards lapse on termination other than for good leavers see definition below in respect of whom the incentive awards and following applies: awards under the DBP under the SEP, provided termination occurs on or after the first anniversary of the start of the core performance period, on termination vesting of an award is dependent upon the achievement of relevant performance targets and is normally pro-rated to reflect time employed during the measurement period: deferred shares under the DBP are released as soon as practicable following termination.
All awards under the LTIP and ESOS have vested and would be released as soon as practicable following termination.
Unvested long term Outstanding SEP awards vest on a change of control subject to the Committees assessment of the performance incentive awards and of the Company and taking into account the period of time from the grant date to the effective date of the change awards under the DBP of control.
on change of control Deferred shares under the DBP are released as soon as practicable following a change of control.
All awards under the LTIP and ESOS have vested and would be released as soon as practicable following a change of control.
Discretion Where the Committee retains discretion, it will be used to provide flexibility in certain situations taking into account the particular circumstances of the Directors departure and performance, with the objective of ensuring that a Director is not paid for poor performance.
Good leavers: death, disability, illness, injury, redundancy, sale of business outside the Group, retirement at the Committees discretion under the SEP, termination by the Company other than for dishonesty or misconduct and other circumstances at the Committees discretion.
84 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Provisions in service contracts Contracts entered into since 2012: Payment in lieu Payments in lieu of notice are made on a monthly basis.
Executive Directors have a duty to mitigate their loss: if an of notice executive Director obtains alternative employment, payments are subject to reduction or cancellation up to the value of the remuneration, benefits and incentives received in respect of the new role.
The Committee retains discretion not to reduce or cancel payments in these circumstances if it is considered to be in the Companys interests not to do so.
Clawback Any payment in lieu of notice will stop and any payments made will be subject to repayment if it is discovered that an executive Director failed to comply with his duties under the contract.
Change of control In line with best practice and the Companys policy for all future contracts, the service contract entered into with Adam Walker in 2013 does not include any provision for payment of a pre-determined amount on a change of control.
The service contracts of the other executive Directors other than William Seeger who retires from the Board on 25 February 2014 were amended on 19 February 2014 to remove the change of control provision from their contracts.

Termination There are no provisions for termination payments for the Chairman or non-executive Directors.
Legacy arrangements The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the payment is made pursuant to terms that were agreed i before the policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes payments include the satisfaction of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment were agreed at the time the award was granted.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee Chairman consults with the Companys major shareholders on a regular basis to understand their expectations with regard to executive remuneration generally and to seek their views on the application of GKNs remuneration policy.
Shareholders were consulted extensively in early 2012, following a thorough review of the policy and structure of remuneration for executive Directors, and the Committee took into account their views in setting the current policy, as described above, including in particular the design of the SEP. A further consultation was conducted in late 2013 during which shareholders expressed their continuing support for the policy and how it is being applied by the Committee.
Taxable benefits Taxable benefits principally comprise healthcare and car and fuel allowances.
The amount for William Seeger also includes US benefits medical, life insurance, long and short term disability and fees for computation of annual tax return.
For the purpose of this table, the US benefits have been converted into UK sterling using the average exchange rate for the first business day of each month.
The 2012 value for Marcus Bryson includes an amount of 181,625 for relocation expenses inclusive of income tax and employee national insurance contributions paid by the Company.
Pension The pension value includes all cash allowances contributions in respect of pension and, where appropriate, the value of defined benefit participation using the methodology prescribed in the Regulations.
Further details are set out on pages 91 and 92.
STVRS The amounts represent the total STVRS payment: amounts up to 65% of base salary are made in cash and the balance deferred into shares.
For 2013, the amounts deferred into shares as a percentage of base salary are as follows: Nigel Stein 17%: Marcus Bryson 10%: Andrew Reynolds Smith 22%: and William Seeger nil.
William Seeger retires during 2014 and the Remuneration Committee has determined that his 2013 STVRS is payable wholly in cash.
The amounts deferred into shares will be released, subject to continued employment, following a two year deferral period.
No amounts were deferred into shares in 2012 as the STVRS payments were less than 65% of base salary.
Further details are shown below.
Long term incentives For 2013, the amounts represents the value of the 2011 ESOS awards excluding option price of 199.58p per share and the 2011 LTIP awards including amount equivalent to the net dividends per share paid in the final year of the performance period, the performance periods for both of which ended on 31 December 2013, by reference to the GKN share price on 18 February 2014 412.9p the date on which the Committee determined the performance outcome for these awards.
The equivalent value shown for 2012, in relation to the 2010 ESOS and LTIP awards, was calculated using the GKN share price on 19 February 2013 261.9p.
Further details are shown on page 88.
Overseas director William Seeger is a US national who relocated to the UK in 2008.
During 2013, his emoluments were paid in US$ subject to full US State and Federal hypothetical tax withholding.
The Company operates hypothetical tax and social security withholding so that he is placed in a tax neutral position mitigating him against double taxation in the UK and US.
This treatment has resulted in GKN making a payment of 1,055,689 2012: 429,333 to the UK and US tax authorities with any overpayment of taxes being subsequently refunded to the Company.
For 2013, the best estimate of the amount which is not expected to be refunded to the Company, based on information available to date, is 26,298.
For 2012, the Company held a credit balance of 109,160 due to the timing of hypothetical taxes withheld from William Seeger on an ESOS exercise and the date on which the tax payment was actually made to the relevant authorities.
These amounts are not included in the table above for 2012 or 2013.
Performance against targets in 2013 audited 2013 STVRS The payments under the STVRS were triggered by performance against targets set for financial and strategic measures.
The financial element represented a maximum opportunity of 90% of base salary and comprised measures based on Group, and where appropriate individual portfolio, targets relating to profit, margin and cash flow.
86 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Group profit and margin targets for 2013, and the performance achieved in respect of them, are set out below: Measure Threshold Target Maximum Actual Payout Profit m 535 563 591 571 32% Margin % 8.4 8.7 9.0 8.6 3% The profit and margin figures above are calculated using 2013 budget exchange rates to eliminate the impact of translational currency fluctuations: actual performance has been adjusted to remove the impact of significant one-off items to ensure that payout levels reflect underlying performance.
Cash flow targets which are not disclosed are set on a monthly, cumulative basis to reflect the budgeted cash profile for the year and also include an element in relation to cash conversion.
The strategic measures represent the remaining bonus opportunity of 20% of base salary, and at Group level applicable to the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director included objectives built around the following themes: Integration of acquired business GKN Aerospace Engine Systems a strong performance was delivered against this objective as outlined in the Strategic Review see in particular pages 30 and 31.
New business wins at appropriate margins the Group overall made good progress as evidenced by the improvement in trading margin.
Implementation of capital allocation process a more rigorous process to determine the optimal allocation of capital was deployed successfully across the Group and used through the annual budget process and strategy review.
STVRS is based on performance against stretching targets set by the Committee at the start of the year.
Whilst the Committee is aware that some shareholders wish to see detailed retrospective disclosure of all bonus targets, the Board believes that divisional targets are commercially sensitive.
The Committee is committed to providing as much information as possible in order to assist investors understanding of how GKNs incentive payouts relate to performance.
The disclosure set out below in relation to 2013 STVRS provides information on the level of performance achieved against the various measures during 2013 and demonstrates the extent to which this performance met threshold, target and maximum levels.

The performance targets and vesting levels, based on EPS growth LTIP and GKNs TSR performance against the FTSE 350 comparator group ESOS, are set out below: a Target for vesting Actual vesting 2011 LTIP awards Threshold Maximum b Performance measure EPS growth 6% 12% 15% Vesting level 30% 100% 100% a Target for vesting Actual vesting 2011 ESOS awards c Performance measure TSR Median level Upper quartile Upper quartile ranked 52 out of 350 Vesting level 35% 100% 100% a Vesting between these points is on a straight line basis.
b Compound annual growth in management EPS normalised for tax, and excluding exceptional items, post-employment finance charges and volatile IFRS charges or credits.
c TSR data and ranking information is obtained from New Bridge Street to ensure that the comparative performance is independently verified.
In determining vesting under both the LTIP and ESOS, the Committee also considered the Companys underlying financial performance over the measurement period.
Strong EPS growth was achieved as well as a ROIC performance well above the Companys cost of capital before tax.

As noted previously, before any awards can vest the Committee must be satisfied that this is justified by the quality of earnings.
This will involve consideration of Group ROIC against internal projections, shareholder expectations, new investment performance and cost of capital to ensure that the level of vesting appropriately reflects shareholder value creation.
The key conclusions of the Committees assessment of and satisfaction with the quality of earnings, and the basis of any adjustment to the levels of vesting, will be disclosed retrospectively.

The value excludes the amount attributable to dividend equivalents paid in additional shares or cash over the relevant performance periods released at the same time as the Core and Sustainability Awards.
Statement of Directors shareholdings and share interests audited The shareholding requirement for executive Directors was increased in July 2012 from 100% to 200% of base salary.
Executive Directors in post at that time are expected to meet the requirement within five years whilst newly appointed Directors are expected to acquire shares with a value of 100% of base salary within five years of appointment and 200% of base salary as soon as possible thereafter.
Until the requirement has been met, executive Directors must retain all vested long term incentive awards net of tax.
The only shares that count towards the requirement are those held outright by the Director or their connected persons.
The shareholding requirement is tested annually on 31 December with shares valued at the average share price for the final three months of the year.
Non-executive Directors are required to achieve a shareholding of 30% of base fees within three years of appointment.

Pension entitlements audited Historical arrangements exist in relation to Nigel Stein, Marcus Bryson and Andrew Reynolds Smith such that they receive their retirement benefits in part through the executive section of the GKN Group Pension Scheme 2012 Scheme, a defined benefit section of the Scheme which provides Directors with a pension of up to two-thirds of pensionable salary on their normal th retirement date with a maximum annual accrual rate of 1 30.
However, from 1 September 2007, benefits under the Scheme have been calculated on a career average basis.
Directors participating in the defined benefit section of the Scheme receive a supplementary cash allowance of up to 40% of the difference between their individual pensionable salary and base salary.
Directors appointed from 1 January 2013 are entitled to an allowance of up to 25% of base salary which may be delivered in cash or as a payment into the defined contribution section of the Scheme.
No compensation is offered for any additional tax suffered by a Director in the event that the value of their pension exceeds the statutory Lifetime Allowance.
William Seeger does not participate in the Scheme but receives an overall allowance of 40% of base salary, which includes GKN contributions to qualified and non-qualified defined contribution pension arrangements consistent with US practice.

In respect of both awards, a cash amount equivalent to the dividends on the vested shares from the beginning of the final year of the relevant measurement period to the release date will also be paid.
In respect of unvested SEP awards granted in 2012 and 2013, the Committee has exercised discretion and determined that he will be treated as a good leaver under the terms of the plan.

The Board recognises the benefits that such appointments can bring both to the Company and to the Director in broadening their knowledge and experience in other markets and countries.
In light of the demands placed on directors, GKNs policy is that only one non-executive directorship may be accepted.
The fees received for such a role may be retained by the Director.
