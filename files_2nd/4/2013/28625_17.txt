These have been The committee approved executive profit share made following the introduction of new regulations in awards for 2013 which reflected the strong performance October.
I welcome the new regulations, which should by the company in terms of growth of funds under provide shareholders with greater clarity of remuneration management, profit before tax and EPS as well as taking structures and total compensation and greater consistency into account achievement against personal performance of reporting.
The performance of the business also meant that The regulations now give shareholders the power 2011 13 LTIP performance targets TSR and EPS growth to approve the directors remuneration policy by way of were achieved in full.
Our policy, which has been reviewed and In addition the committee approved Andy Pomfrets amended by the remuneration committee, is set out below settlement arrangements in accordance with his contract, the and will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the specifics of which are set out in greater detail in this report.
You will see that the committee Finally, during the year Mark Nicholls and I met a is seeking approval of the policy for one year 2014.
A number of our major shareholders to seek their views on new management team is in place and a further review of remuneration policies generally and particularly in relation the policy, particularly its longer term elements, is to be to the then pending changes in regulation.
We have borne in undertaken in 2014.
I intend to submit a revised policy for mind those helpful discussions when reviewing our policies approval at the 2015 AGM, which will remain in place for and will continue to do so as we further refine our policies three years.
During 2013 and as part of the process referred to above, the committee approved the replacement of David Harrel the existing executive profit sharing scheme with a new Chairman of the remuneration committee performance targeted bonus scheme.
These changes which are set out in the Remuneration Policy Statement, included 19 February 2014 the reduction of the maximum bonus opportunity from 200% to 125% of salary coupled with objective performance metrics and personal performance targets which will come into effect from 1 January 2014 subject to shareholder approval.
No changes to the Long Term Incentive Plan are currently proposed with conditional awards of 75% of salary 100% in exceptional circumstances.
The committee also introduced some changes to the existing profit share scheme for 2013 to reinforce alignment of awards to performance.
By making these changes, the committee believes that management is incentivised to deliver the strategy as set out earlier in the report and accounts with an appropriate balance of fixed and variable remuneration.
The profit and operating margin metrics ensure that sufficient regard is given to the quality of business growth and its risk management.
There remains uncertainty regarding the implementation of CRD IV, its impact on small banks and the remuneration of their senior management.
The PRA reported in December that it will not revise its guidance on the application of proportionality issued in April 2013 until the European Banking Authority publishes revised remuneration guidelines in 2014.
In view of the uncertainty, we currently intend to seek shareholder approval for a variable pay cap of 200% of salary at the 2014 AGM.
Executive salaries were increased during the year in line with the increase given to most employees.
