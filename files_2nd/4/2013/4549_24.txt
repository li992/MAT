com Stock code: DPH Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman Dear Shareholder On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present Dechras Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 June 2013.
During the year the Remuneration Committee: reviewed the Chief Executive Officers remuneration package: reviewed the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP performance metrics: and determine remuneration for the new Chief Financial Officer, Anne-Francoise Nesmes.
In respect of Ian Pages remuneration package the Committee believed that a repositioning was required in order to reflect his experience, performance and overall contribution to the Group.
With regards to the proposed changes to the LTIP performance metrics, the Committee was of the opinion that the introduction of another performance measure alongside relative TSR would allow for a more balanced assessment of success and reward of long term shareholder value.
The Committee consulted with the Companys major Shareholders on the proposed changes and, taking into account feedback from investors, a number of changes were made to both Ian Pages remuneration package and the LTIP performance criteria.
Detail in respect of these changes are contained within the following report.
The Committee believes that these changes align and focus remuneration to reward longer term, sustainable performance.
During the year Dechra appointed a new Chief Financial Officer, Anne-Francoise Nesmes.
Details of her remuneration package are provided in the following report including details of the one-off recruitment reward which it was agreed to grant her as partial compensation for the loss of share options granted to her by her previous employer.
The Board considers Anne-Francoise as pivotal in assisting Ian Page to direct the Group to its next strategic stage and considers that it was in the best interests of the Company to create an overall recruitment package that would attract her to the role within Dechra and to incentivise and motivate her going forward during her career with the Company.
It should be noted that all the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors have agreed to waive an increase to their respective salaries and fees for the 2013 2014 financial year.
An above inflation fee increase has been made to the Chairman and the reasons for this are detailed in the following report.
Below Board level the average pay increase across the Group was 1.5%.

Finally, the Committee and I believe that ongoing dialogue with our major Shareholders is of key importance, should you have any queries in relation to this report please do not hesitate to contact myself or the Company Secretary.

Executive Directors are only permitted to accept external appointments with the approval of the Board.
The only Executive Director to hold an external appointment is Ian Page.
He is Non-Executive Chairman of Sanford DeLand Asset Management Limited, a position which he has held since 7 October 2010.

To facilitate the hiring of candidates of the appropriate calibre required to implement the Groups strategy, the Committee retains the discretion to make remuneration decisions which are outside the Policy.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including the quantum and nature of remuneration to ensure the arrangements are in the best interests of Dechra and its Shareholders.
The Committee may make an award in respect of hiring an employee to buyout incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards and the time over which they would have vested.
The Committee would seek to incorporate buyout and recruitment awards to be in line with the Companys remuneration framework so far as is practical.
The Committee may consider other components including cash or shares awards, restricted stock awards and share options where there is a strong commercial rationale for doing so.
Reasonable costs and support will be covered if the recruitment requires relocation of the individual.
Expat allowances may also be paid in these circumstances.
The Company recruited a new Chief Financial Officer, Anne-Francoise Nesmes, during the financial year, following the departure of Simon Evans.
The Committee positioned the overall package for the new Chief Financial Officer at a level that was sufficient to recruit and retain a Chief Financial Officer of the required calibre and quality.

In December 2012 the Non-Executive Directors agreed to an amendment to their respective service contracts reducing the notice period after the initial 12 month period from 12 months to three months termination by either party.
The Non-Executive Directors are entitled to compensation on termination of their appointment confined to three months remuneration.

During the 2012 2013 financial year, a comprehensive review of Ian Pages remuneration was undertaken, which highlighted that his base salary had fallen behind that of his peers.
Our policy on base salary continues to be to provide a fixed remuneration component which reflects the experience and capabilities of the individual in the role, the demonstrated performance of the individual in the role, and which is competitive in the market we operate.
Following the comprehensive review of Ian Pages remuneration package, and after consultation and support from the major Shareholders, the Committee unanimously concluded that a significant step up in salary was appropriate.
This reflects a number of factors: his achievements since being appointed to Chief Executive Officer in 2001, in particular his energetic leadership of the business and the contribution he has made to the Groups significant strategic and financial progress: his delivery of significant and sustained increases in Shareholder value in what has been a very difficult environment for most businesses.
In a period where many companies have had to settle for navigating through a crisis, our business has grown in size, both in terms of its complexity and geography: his successful integration of a number of significant strategic acquisitions, most recently the acquisition of Eurovet: and the market positioning of the salary against companies of a similar size and complexity.
The increase in base salary in January to 440,000 represented an increase of 15%.
This positions his salary around the median levels compared to companies of a similar size and complexity.
All the Executive Directors have agreed to waive an increase in salary for the 2013 2014 financial year.

Furthermore, they waived any increase in 2009 and 2010.
During the year a review of the Chairmans remuneration during the year identified that his fee was substantially lower than that of other Chairmen of companies of comparable size and complexity.
After due consideration, the Committee decided to increase his fee to a level more commensurate with his experience, performance and overall contribution to the business.
The remaining Non-Executive Directors have agreed to waive an increase in their fees for the 2013 2014 financial year.

The TSR will be calculated by comparing average performance over three months prior to the start and end of the performance period.
Vesting will be on the following basis: TSR Performance Vesting Percentage Below median 0% Median 25% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata vesting based on the Companys ranking in the comparator group Upper quartile 100% As set out on page 82 for the three year period to 30 June 2013 the Companys TSR performance was over 98% compared with an 84% TSR for live companies in the top quartile of the comparator group.
In addition the Groups underlying diluted EPS increased by 44.09% over the performance period as a result the LTIPs awarded in December 2010 will vest fully.
LTIP Awards Made During the Year Ended 30 June 2013 Awards were granted to the Executive Directors on 5 March 2013, on the following basis: 150% of salary for Ian Page: and 100% of salary for the other Executive Directors.
In various consultations with our major Shareholders, we have received strong support for the introduction of another performance measure alongside relative TSR under the LTIP to allow for a more balanced assessment of success and to reward the delivery of long term Shareholder value.
Following consultation, the Committee resolved that 50% of the LTIP award will continue to be based on the Companys relative TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 and 50% will be based on stretching EPS targets.
Furthermore, to ensure the quality of earnings and delivery of other key financial performance indicators the vesting of awards under the LTIP will be subject to an additional Return on Capital Employed ROCE underpin.
Following the disposal of the Services Segment, and in line with the LTIP scheme rules, the Committee are in the process of reviewing the performance targets attaching to the LTIP awards granted in March 2013 and intends to consult with major Shareholders by the end of the calendar year in respect of the same.
22581-04 22 08 2013 Proof 3 Strategic Report Our Business Our Performance Our Governance Our Financials Shareholder Information 79 www.
com Stock code: DPH Recruitment Award for Anne-Francoise Nesmes On appointment the Committee agreed to award Anne-Francoise Nesmes two LTIP awards to the value of 100% of her base salary: 100% to be subject to a performance period ending 30 June 2014 with a further one years continued employment subject to claw back: and 100% to be subject to a performance period ending 30 June 2015.
This tranche will be subject to the same performance conditions as those attaching to the LTIP awards granted to the Executive Directors on 5 March 2013.
In the event of a change of control of the Company prior to the vesting dates stated above, the Remuneration Committee has confirmed that it will exercise its discretion to allow the two LTIP awards to vest in full and that the performance conditions would be waived.
The rationale behind the additional LTIP grants was as an offer of partial compensation for the loss of Performance Share Plan and Share Value Plan awards which Anne-Francoise Nesmes had been granted by her previous employer and which lapsed on the cessation of her employment with them.
When Anne-Francoise Nesmes commenced her appointment with Dechra the Company was deemed to be in a close period by reason of the disposal of the Services Segment and therefore unable to grant the recruitment award.
It is therefore proposed that both awards will be granted as a nil-cost option in early September once the Company has announced its year end results.
The grant will be made outside of the LTIP scheme rules and will be satisfied using market purchase shares.
LTIP Awards for the Year Ending 30 June 2014 To align and focus Ian Pages total remuneration package to reward longer term, sustainable performance the Committee granted a LTIP award to Ian Page of 150% of his salary in March 2013 and has proposed, after due consultation with major Shareholders, to award 200% of salary in respect of future financial years.
Shareholder approval will be sought at the Annual General Meeting for the increase in long term incentive opportunity to 200% of salary.
However, for the avoidance of doubt this level of award will not be a guaranteed entitlement.
Whilst the Committee intends to make awards up to 200% of salary to Ian Page in the future, in line with best practice the Committee will review the level of award to be made each year and this level of award will be dependent on the Committees assessment of the continued growth and financial success of the Group and Ian Pages personal performance.
The Committee intends to make awards of 150% of base salary to Anne-Francoise Nesmes on an annual basis.
LTIP awards for the other Executive Directors will remain at 100% of base salary.
Payments to Past Directors There were no payments made to past Directors during the period.
Payments for Loss of Office A compensation payment was made to Simon Evans during the financial year and equated to 12 months of his salary and benefits plus the use of a company car until the expiry of the lease 31 March 2015.
A compensation payment was also made to Bryan Morton during the financial year which equated to two months of his salary.
No other compensation payments were made to Executive or Non-Executive Directors during the year.
