Introduction 64 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Report Directors Remuneration Policy The policy described in this section is intended to apply for the three years beginning on the date of the 2014 AGM, subject to shareholder approval.

Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 69 Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Report Ultras strategic framework Annual Report on Remuneration Summary of how the remuneration policy will be implemented in 2014 A summary of how the Directors Remuneration Policy will be applied for the year ending 31 December 2014 is set out below.
Salaries The Executive Directors salaries have been reviewed by the Committee which has determined that the following levels should be implemented with effect from 1st January 2014: 2014 2013 % 2 Salary Salary Increase 000 000 % Chief Executive 474 460 3.0 2 1 Group Finance Director 302 275 9.8 2 Group Marketing Director 225 205 10.0 1 This amount relates to the annual salary of the incumbent Group Finance Director, Mary Waldner, who joined Ultra on 1 July 2013.
Her predecessor, Paul Dean, was the Group Finance Director up until his resignation on 31 March 2013.
Paul Deans annual salary until his resignation was 305,000.
2 The Group Finance Directors salary was brought in line with median salary levels for that role.
The Group Marketing Directors salary was increased to bring it towards median levels, although the Committee recognises that the Group Marketing Directors salary is still below median levels and will address this going forward in line with the Directors Remuneration Policy.
Directors pension entitlements The Group will continue to operate a defined benefit pension scheme for Rakesh Sharma.
As Mary Waldner and Mark Anderson joined Ultra after the defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants, they will participate in a defined contribution scheme and receive annual company contributions of 18% of their salary.
Annual bonus for 2014 The maximum bonus for Executive Directors in 2014 will continue to be 100% of base salary with a maximum of 25% of salary payable for the achievement of an agreed profit target and a maximum of 75% payable for achievement of an agreed operating cash flow target.
While the Committee believes that commercial sensitivities restrict the disclosure of forward looking annual bonus targets, full retrospective disclosure of the financial targets will be made in the 2014 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Long term awards to be granted in 2014 Consistent with the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee intends to grant annual LTIP awards to Executive Directors in the form of shares worth 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for other Executive Directors during 2014.
For this grant, 20% of awards will vest at median TSR ranking, increasing to 100% vesting for an upper quartile TSR ranking, measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
In addition to the TSR target, there is an underpin requiring an average annual growth of EPS after adjustments to exclude gains or losses on financial instruments and the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition of 5% p. a. over the three year performance period.

Annual bonus for year under review Annual bonuses in relation to 2013 were based upon the achievement of a sliding scale of underlying profit before tax and operating cash flow targets.
These targets were derived from the annual budgets approved by the Board.
They were adjusted where appropriate to provide an appropriate degree of stretch challenge and incentive to outperform.
Profit and cash are two of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured.
Please refer to pages 16 and 17 for details.
The bonus targets set by the Committee for 2013 were a maximum of 25% of salary subject to the achievement of 120.8m profit before tax and loss on fair value movements on derivatives and amortisation of intangibles on acquisition, and a maximum of 75% of salary subject to achieving an operating cash flow of 138.1m after capitalised development costs, capital expenditure, purchase of long-term incentive plan shares and taking account of movements in working capital.
The Committee assessed the achievement of performance against each target as follows: Actual Bonus 1 Threshold Maximum Achieved Payable 000 000 000 % Underlying profit before tax 108,720 120,800 116,806 0 Operating cash flow 73,125 138,125 79,040 0 1 No bonus was payable in 2013 because in accordance with the bonus scheme rules, the operating cash flow was negatively adjusted to reflect working capital performance throughout the year.
In order for a bonus to be payable both profit and cash bonus criteria are required to be met.
LTIP vesting for year under review The LTIP award granted on 14 March 2011 was based on performance to the year ended 31 December 2013.
As disclosed in previous annual reports, the performance condition for this award was as follows: Threshold Stretch % Metric Performance condition target target Actual Vesting Total TSR against the constituents of a comparator group.
