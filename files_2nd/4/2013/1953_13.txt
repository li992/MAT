Overview Performance Governance Accounts Other Information 39 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Go vernance RE PORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS REM UNERATION Annual statement Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to take this opportunity to introduce the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
In June 2013, TheDepartment of Business, Innovation and Skills published regulations that change the way directors remuneration will be reported and voted upon.
The regulations do not take effect until next years report: however the Board has decided to disclose, in advance, additional information which it believes will make this Report easier to understand, consistent, as far as possible, with the requirements of the new regulations, and more helpful to shareholders.
Remuneration policy The Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration the Committee reviews executive remuneration arrangements to ensure they are effective in supporting the business strategy, are competitive and align the remuneration of the executives with the interests of shareholders.
Remuneration paid in 2012 13 The basic salaries of the executive directors in 2012 13 were determined in July 2012 and were set out in last years report.
Thetotal remuneration earned was determined in large part by the bonuses awarded for performance.
Pages 3 and 4 of the Annual Report highlights the progress made by the Company which moved forward strongly throughout the year with significant gains in sales, average selling price, margin, operating profit, dividend and NAV.
Importantly the year concluded with a strong forward order book and a significant increase in plots available with detailed planning permission.
Operating performance exceeded the expectations of the Board and investors at the start of the year.
This performance is reected in the annual bonus earned by executive directors for the year under review.
The increase inoperating profit of 31.8% was at the top of the target range and there was an improvement in all the non-financial target measures health and safety, customer care and land bank.
As a result, the executive directors earned a full bonus of 120% ofbasic salary.
Neither of the executive directors were granted awards under the existing Bellway p. l. c. 2004 Performance Share Plan 2004 PSP in 2010.
The performance conditions were not achieved, and all the awards granted to other participants on 21 October 2010 under the 2004 PSP will lapse.
Implementation of the remuneration policy in 2013 14 For the current year, the Committee focused on two specic areas.
The first was the review of basic salary increases for the executive directors and the second related to the introduction of a new long-term incentive arrangement to replace theexisting incentive plan.
The latter was undertaken with the benefit of consultation with major investors, in accordance with the UKCorporate Governance Code.
As disclosed last year, when the Chief Executive and Finance Director were appointed to the Board, their salaries were positioned at levels signicantly below those of their more experienced predecessors, but with a stated intention of raising these towards competitive market levels, subject to good performance and increased experience in their roles.
Ted Ayres was promoted to Chief Executive in February 2013 on a salary of 400,000 per annum and Keith Adeys salary throughout the year was 225,000 per annum.
These salaries are signicantly below the levels at other comparable housebuilders and FTSE 250 companies.
Their predecessors had retired on salaries of 560,300 in 2013 and 354,000 in 2012 respectively.
During the year, the Committee considered its approach to increasing salaries to market competitive levels and believes that phasing the increases is appropriate.
The Committee not only recognises the strong Company performance during the year but also the steps taken to position the Company well for the future, including an increased level of land buying, the opening of new divisions and changes to the management team.
It therefore decided to award salary increases of 25% for Ted Ayres and 27% for Keith Adey, bringing their salaries to 500,000 per annum and 285,000 per annum respectively from 1 August 2013.
These remain below market levels and subject to continued strong performance in their respective roles, the Committee envisages making a further increase next year to bring salaries up to market levels in each case.
Before doing so the Committee will seek up-to-date independent advice on market levels of basic salary at other housebuilders and consider this in light of the relative size, complexity and performance of the comparator companies.
The second major item considered by the Committee related to a new long-term incentive plan, to replace the existing 2004 PSP which reaches the end of its 10-year life in January 2014.
In determining an appropriate new long-term incentive for executives, the Committee has undertaken a full review of the Companys arrangements to ensure that this policy is appropriate, straightforward and reects institutional investors views andmarket practice.
Following this review, the Committee has concluded that the current policy for the annual bonus and performance share plan remains appropriate for the Company and has determined that the new Bellway p. l. c. 2013 Performance Share Plan 2013 PSP should incorporate the current terms of the 2004 PSP, albeit ensuring that it incorporates the latest best practice.
There will beaslight change in relation to the calculation of one of the Total Shareholder Return TSR performance conditions, and these are described later in the Report.
40 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Go vernance RE PORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS REM UNERATION CONTINUED A number of the shareholders who were consulted on the new 2013 PSP queried the need for the Company's current Share Matching Plan 'SMP', which expires in 2018, to run alongside the PSP.
The Committee believes that the plan has provided a useful vehicle for the new directors to start to build shareholdings in the Company, but in response to the points raised during the consultation, the Committee intends to discontinue the plan after the 2014 round of awards.
Other than the changes to base salaries and a new performance share plan, the Committee is not proposing any other changes to the remuneration policy for the 2013 14 financial year, which is set out on pages 41 to 46.
During the year it will review themetrics for the non-financial elements of the annual bonus to ensure that they remain aligned to the business strategy.
Conclusion The Committee considers that there has been a robust link between performance delivered and payments to executives and that the remuneration policy will both support and motivate the executive directors whilst aligning their remuneration to the Companys strategic objectives and to achieving long-term growth for shareholders.
The Committee seeks to maintain a good relationship with investors and will consult with major shareholders, the Association of British Insurers ABI, and key advisory bodies ahead of any significant future changes to the remuneration policy.
The Board was pleased that the 2012 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration received a 99% vote in favour at the last AGM.
Shareholders are invited to approve the 2013 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration which will be subject toanadvisory vote at the AGM to be held on Friday 13 December 2013.
Mike Toms Chairman of the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration 14 October 2013 Overview Performance Governance Accounts Other Information 41 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration has been prepared pursuant to, and in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the AGM of the Company to be held on 13 December 2013.
The Board supports the focus on transparency in the new disclosure regulations for UK listed companies which are due to take effect from October 2013.
The Company has, therefore, decided to structure the Report to incorporate, voluntarily, as many of the proposed features as practicable this year.
Accordingly, this Report has two sections the Directors Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The section on Directors Remuneration Policy, which will in future years normally on a triennial basis be subject to a binding shareholder vote, includes: a description of the Groups remuneration policy: a description of how the conditions of other employees and the views of shareholders are taken into account in the Committees deliberations about executive pay: a future policy table which outlines the features of key elements of remuneration: the terms of executive directors service contracts: the Groups policy on exit payments: and an outline of remuneration scenarios for executive directors at different performance levels.
The Annual Report on Remuneration details the remuneration of directors in respect of the financial year under review.
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION POLICY The remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman is determined by the Committee within a framework set by the Board.
As at the date of this Report, the Committees members are the non-executive directors and Mike Toms is the Chairman.
None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
There are no conicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
TheTerms of Reference of the Committee are available on the Groups website www.
During the year, the Group Company Secretary provided advice on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration.
The Committee also received independent external advice from New Bridge Street NBS, atrading subsidiary of Aon plc.
NBS was appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other services to the Company other than to the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration.
NBS is also a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and abides by its Code of Conduct.
The Committee is satisfied that NBS is independent.
The total fee paid to NBS for advice to the Committees during the year was65,560.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors apart from the Chairman is determined by the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors.
It also receives advice from the Group Company Secretary and NBS.
The remuneration policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code published in 2012 and the views of the Companys major shareholders.
Objectives of remuneration policy The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and motivate executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has a policy of paying a level of remuneration at around the mid-market level of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses, subject to experience and performance.
The Committee uses this comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising the relatively low number of direct housebuilding comparators, their differing size and the risk of an upward ratchet effect with any peer-based analysis.
The structure of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance-related elements of remuneration annual bonus and long-term incentives constitute a significant proportion of an executives potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable if stretching performance targets are achieved.
There is both encouragement and an incentive for executives to build a significant shareholding.
The structure of the performance conditions for annual bonus and long-term incentives has been designed to provide a strong link to the Companys performance, namely a focus on maximising profit in a sustainable fashion and generating superior shareholder returns, thereby generating a strong alignment of interest between senior executives and shareholders.
The components of the nonnancial elements of the bonus have been in place in, substantially, their present form for three years and performance against the targets has now reached high levels.
The Committee believes that it would be timely to review them during the current year with a view to introducing possible changes from 2014 15.
In framing the Companys remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best practice provisions in the UK Corporate Governance Code and ABI guidance.
42 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Go vernance RE PORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS REM UNERATION CONTINUED Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group While the Company does not consult directly with employees when drawing up the executive remuneration policy, indetermining the elements of remuneration for the executive directors the Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group as a whole, paying particular attention to the levels of basic pay increase awarded to the workforce generally.
Normally the salaries of the directors are increased in accordance with the pay increase awarded to the workforce and it is the intention of the Committee to revert to this practice when the executive directors' salaries have reached mid-market levels.
All employees, including the executive directors, can join the Companys savings related share option arrangements, have life assurance benets and a significant proportion of employees benefit from health insurance, acompany car or car allowance.
Following the introduction of auto-enrolment in October 2013, all employees now have access to pension arrangements.
The Committee is apprised regularly of any significant policy changes for the workforce generally andmanagement below Board level in particular.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee takes into account the views of shareholders.
When any significant changes are proposed to the remuneration policy, the Chairman of the Committee will consult with major shareholders in advance.
During 2012 13 remuneration issues generally were discussed with shareholders as part of the consultation on management succession.
Shareholders have also been consulted on the proposals for the new performance share plan described below.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years remuneration report are provided on page 53.

000 Overview Performance Governance Accounts Other Information 47 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION Implementation of remuneration policy in 2013 14 This section sets out how the Company has implemented the remuneration policy for the 2013 14 financial year.
Base salaries As stated in the section on Directors Remuneration Policy, on their promotions to Chief Executive and Finance Director, their salaries were positioned signicantly lower than their predecessors and market levels at the time.
As indicated in last years report, the Committee has decided to move salaries towards market levels in stages.
The Committee believes that the new executives have settled well into their roles.
They have taken advantage of market conditions and government policy to increase sales reservations, average selling price, legal completions and operating margin.
The land bank has been increased and actions have been taken to develop management below Board level.
Both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director have established sound relationships with investors and other stakeholders.
Recognising both the strong Group and personal performance demonstrated during the year, it is intended that their salaries are increased to market levels in two instalments.
The second instalment on 1 August 2014 will be contingent upon continuing strong performance of both the business and the executive over the year and on a current and independent review of the salaries of the executives of other housebuilders.
For 2013 14, theirsalaries are as follows: Chief Executive 500,000 p. a.
Annual bonus For the 2013 14 financial year, the bonus opportunity will be 120% of basic salary.
The performance conditions relate toastretching target range of pre-exceptional operating profit 90% and non-financial performance 30%, with non-financial performance being assessed by reference to land bank management 10%, health and safety 10% and customer care 10%.
The Committee considers that performance in relation to targets based on annual profitability and non-financial metrics provide a good link to the long-term performance of the business.
The focus on profitability is balanced by there being a meaningful weighting of the overall bonus on a number of core non-financial performance measures which are considered to have a strong link to short and long-term shareholder returns.
The bonus will be payable in cash, with executives having the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus in Bellway shares under the SMP.
The Committee encourages the executives to take the opportunity provided by this scheme to build up their own personal shareholdings.
Long-term incentive plans The Company will make awards under the new 2013 PSP for which it is seeking shareholder approval at the AGM on 13 December 2013.
Performance shares with a face value of 100% of salary will be granted to the executive directors and Group Company Secretary.
Grants at lower levels, in percentage of salary terms, will be made to other selected senior employees.
The executives will also have the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their 2012 13 net bonus for a period of three years in the SMP, for which they will receive a match of up to 2 times the level of investment on a gross of tax basis.
The 2013 14 PSP awards and SMP awards to the extent they are made will vest to executives after three years, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, based around TSR, which measures the total return share price growth and dividend on a notional investment in Bellway shares, compared to the return on the same notional investment in shares in a group of other companies or an index.
The TSR condition will comprise two equal parts.
Half the award will be based on performance relative to the Housebuilders Index and half by reference to the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts and companies in the financial services sector.
The Housebuilders Index will comprise The Berkeley Group plc, Taylor Wimpey plc, Barratt Developments PLC, Persimmon plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Redrow plc and Crest Nicholson Holdings plc.
Previously the TSR calculation has been based on the average TSR of the other housebuilders, with a requirement for Bellways TSR to match this average for 25% of an award to vest rising to 100% vesting for Bellways TSR outperforming the average TSR plus 7.5% per annum.
Having reviewed the basis for TSR performance measurement the Committee is proposing to change from using the average TSR to using the median TSR as the reference point.
This is because the median value is less inuenced by the performance ofextreme outliers of the Index and so represents a more robust and comparable benchmark.
The Committee has re-examined the 7.5% hurdle for out performance to establish whether this remains appropriately stretching and is comfortable that, based on robust back-testing, this is broadly equivalent to upper quartile performance.
For the other half of the award, the TSR will be based on performance against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts and financial services companies, with a median to upper quartile vesting scale for between 25% and 100% of the award to vest.
Regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been an improvement in underlying financial performance over the performance period, taking into account, inter alia, operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and NAV.
The Committee will scale back the level of vesting indicated by the TSR performance condition potentially to zero in circumstances where there has not been an improvement.

For 2013 14 the base fee for non-executive directors will remain at 51,500.
Fees for chairing the Audit Committee and the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration will rise from 3,000 to 5,000 and the additional fee for the senior independent non-executive director will increase from 4,000 to 5,000.
