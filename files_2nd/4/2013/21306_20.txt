The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Remuneration report Annual statement from the Chairman of the Board Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholders As Chairman of the Board Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to introduce the Directors Remuneration Report for 2013.
Building on the 2012 changes to our approach to remuneration, we continued throughout 2013 to ensure remuneration decisions support the delivery of our goal of achieving sustainable performance for all our stakeholders.
Barclays is in the process of introducing the Balanced Scorecard refer page 10.
By the end of 2014, all employees performance assessments will be aligned to the Balanced Scorecard and will be measured against both what they achieve and how they achieve it.
By linking employee performance assessments and remuneration decisions to the Balanced Scorecard, we are promoting a clear and direct alignment between Barclays strategy, performance management and remuneration.

We remain fully committed to reducing Remuneration Committee work in 2013 The Committees objective is to maximise long term value for the ratio of compensation to adjusted net operating shareholders by ensuring that we do not pay more than is necessary income over time.
Determining the 2013 incentive pool was an extremely difficult decision for the Committee.
We were acutely aware of public sentiment and of the challenge of presenting shareholders with an increased pool in a year where profits have fallen.
The Committee concluded that a 2013 Remuneration Committee members incentive pool of 2,378m was warranted.
This was up 10% on the final 2012 incentive pool but it remains 32% below pool levels in 2010 when Chairman Members we started to reposition Barclays remuneration.

How do you justify a 2013 incentive pool of 2,378m when the banks financial performance has declined?
Barclays needs to pay competitively to ensure it has people with the skills and experience needed to deliver our strategy.
In some parts of When considering the appropriate level of incentive awards for 2013, the Committee has had to establish the right balance between ensuring the banking sector, particularly investment banking, variable remuneration in the form of bonuses forms a high proportion of an that the progress on repositioning remuneration, which began after 2010, was sustained, while also ensuring Barclays remains competitive employees total remuneration.

Total risk and conduct adjustments of 290m were made in 2013.
Of this, 176m of adjustments were made through reductions in long-term incentive awards that were granted in previous years and 114m of reductions were made from total incentive awards granted in 2013.
The two main components of the 2013 adjustment reflect the further provisions in respect of the costs of redress for PPI and Interest Rate Hedging Products.
The process for reviewing risk and conduct adjustments to the incentive pool has also been strengthened in 2013 by the formation of the Remuneration Review Panel which provides recommendations to the Board Remuneration Committee.
The Panel is independent of the business and it includes representatives from the key control functions of Risk, Compliance, Internal Audit and HR.
The Panels other responsibilities include reviewing proposed malus adjustments to individual incentives in respect of risk and conduct events and ensuring that risk, compliance, behaviour and conduct are also appropriately considered in the determination of individual remuneration.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Remuneration report Remuneration policy for all employees This section sets out Barclays remuneration policy for all employees, explaining the purpose and principles underlying the structure of remuneration packages, and how the policy links remuneration to the achievement of sustained high performance and long-term value creation.
Remuneration policy The Committee formally adopted a new remuneration policy for 2013 as part of the Transform programme.
The principles set out in the policy are set out below and underpin 2013 remuneration decisions and the Committees objectives for 2014 and beyond.
Support the goal of becoming the Go-To bank by attracting, retaining and competitively rewarding colleagues with the ability, experience, skill, values and behaviours to deliver that goal.
Will only reward business results when these are achieved in a manner consistent with Barclays values and behaviours: Respect: We respect and value those we work with, and the contribution that they make Integrity: We act fairly, ethically and openly in all we do Service: We put our clients and customers at the centre of what we do Excellence: We use our energy, skills and resources to deliver the best, sustainable results Stewardship: We are passionate about leaving things better than we found them.
Protect and promote shareholder interests by incentivising colleagues to deliver sustained performance and create long-term value through the delivery of Barclays goal.
Those decisions will reflect that performance for individuals and in aggregate.
Barclays will pay competitively for high performance but will not pay more than the amount appropriate to maximise the long-term value of the bank for its shareholders.
Create a direct and recognisable alignment between remuneration and risk exposure, as well as adjusting current and deferred incentives for current and historic risk, including malus adjustments, as appropriate.
Should be as simple and clear for colleagues and stakeholders as possible as is the process used to determine them.
Ensure that the balance between shareholder returns and remuneration is appropriate, clear and supports long-term shareholder interests.
Remuneration and performance Adherence to the remuneration policy means that remuneration decisions for all employees across the whole of Barclays are aligned with and support the achievement of Barclays goal of becoming the Go-To bank.
This is achieved by linking remuneration to a broad assessment of all aspects of performance.
At an individual level, a new approach to performance assessment was implemented for senior management in 2013 and will be implemented for all employees in 2014.
Under the new approach, individual performance is measured jointly against objectives the what and demonstration of Barclays Values and Behaviours the how.
This ensures that our Values and Behaviours are firmly embedded in the way we manage individual performance and remuneration.
Furthermore, to ensure clear and direct alignment between individual performance and Barclays strategy, all employees are required to align their 2014 objectives to the 5Cs of the Balanced Scorecard Customers & Clients, Colleagues, Citizenship, Conduct and Company.
This was implemented for senior management in 2013.
This will help employees understand how their day to day activities contribute to the overall performance of the business or function in which they work and, ultimately, the overall performance of Barclays as represented by the Balanced Scorecard.
Linking individual performance assessment and remuneration decisions to both our Values and Behaviours and the Balanced Scorecard in this way promotes the delivery of sustainable individual and business performance and establishes clear alignment between remuneration policy and Barclays strategy.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 93 Remuneration report Remuneration policy for all employees continued Remuneration structure Employees receive salary, pension and other benefits and are eligible to be considered for an annual bonus.
Employees in some customer-facing businesses participate in incentive plans including plans based on customer feedback and other measures of the quality of service they provide to customers.
This page provides further details of our employee remuneration structure.
Some senior employees also receive Role Based Pay RBP from 2014.
The remuneration structure for employees is aligned with the remuneration structure for executive Directors set out in more detail in the Directors remuneration policy section of this report.
Fixed remuneration Salaries reflect individuals skills and experience and are reviewed annually in the context of annual performance assessment.
Salary They are increased where justified by role change, increased responsibility or where justified by the latest available market data.
Salaries may also be increased in line with local statutory requirements and in line with union and works council commitments.
As a response to CRD IV and to ensure Barclays remains appropriately competitive for global talent from 2014, a small number Role of senior employees will receive a new class of fixed pay called RBP to recognise the breadth and depth of the role.
Further Based Pay information on RBP can be found on page 95.
The provision of a market competitive package of benefits is important to attracting and retaining the talented staff Barclays Pension needs to deliver Barclays strategy.
A defined contribution pension scheme, the Barclays Pension Savings Plan, and a flexible and benefits scheme, My Rewards, enable employees to choose from a range of benefits including the level of their pension benefits contributions, life assurance and private health benefits, annual leave with the ability to buy and sell subject to certain parameters, and participation in Barclays all employee share plans HMRC approved for UK participants.
The cost of providing the benefits is defined and controlled.
Following its launch in 2012 in the UK, My Rewards will be rolled out globally over the next few years.
Variable remuneration Annual bonuses reward and incentivise the achievement of Group, business and individual objectives Annual bonus The ability to recognise performance through variable remuneration enables the Group to control its cost base flexibly and to react to events and market circumstances.
Bonuses remain a key feature of remuneration practice in the highly competitive and mobile market for talent in the financial services sector.
The Committee is careful to control the proportion of variable to fixed remuneration paid to individuals Bonus deferral levels are significantly in excess of PRA requirements For PRA Remuneration Code Staff Code Staff the deferral rate is a minimum of 40% for bonuses of no more than 500,000 or 60% for bonuses of more than 500,000 For non-Code Staff, bonuses over 65,000 are subject to a graduated level of deferral 2013 bonuses awarded to Managing Directors in the Investment Bank are 100% deferred Deferred bonuses are generally split equally between deferred cash bonuses under the Cash Value Plan CVP and deferred share bonuses under the Share Value Plan SVP, each typically vesting in equal annual tranches over three years subject to the rules of the plans and continued service Deferred bonuses are subject to malus provisions which enable the Committee to reduce the vesting level of deferred bonuses including to nil at its discretion.
Events which may lead the Committee to do this include, but are not limited to, employee misconduct or a material failure of risk management.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Remuneration report Remuneration and CRD IV This section sets out our plans for remuneration compliance with CRD IV in respect of the CRD IV pay ratio.
The CRD IV pay ratio of 2:1 is subject to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM.
CRD IV is EU regulation that has been effective from 1 January 2014.
CRD IVs remuneration provisions include a maximum ratio between variable and fixed remuneration CRD IV pay ratio for Code Staff.
Code Staff include senior management, risk takers, staff engaged in control functions and any other employees whose professional activities have a material impact on Barclays risk profile.
The maximum CRD IV pay ratio is either 1:1 without shareholder approval or 2:1 with shareholder approval.
The maximum ratio will apply to variable remuneration awarded in respect of the 2014 performance year onwards.
Barclays had 530 Code Staff in 2013.
While the number of impacted employees will still be a small proportion of total employees, we expect this figure to increase in 2014 under the European Banking Authoritys new definition of Code Staff.
The current estimate for 2014 is between 1,100 and 1,400 Code Staff.
As an EU headquartered bank, the CRD IV pay ratio applies to Barclays Code Staff globally.
This is not the case for Barclays non-EU headquartered competitors, for example US financial services firms.
For these firms, the CRD IV pay ratio only applies to their EU operations.
Accordingly, the CRD IV pay ratio creates a competitive disadvantage for Barclays in the global market for talent, particularly in the US, Asia and Africa.
60% of Barclays' Code Staff in 2014 are expected to be based outside the EU.
Shareholder approval and remuneration compliance with the CRD IV pay ratio We will comply with CRD IVs remuneration provisions in a simple and transparent manner.
We have discussed our approach with the PRA and with some of our major shareholders.
Our approach is legally compliant and based on the following principles: We do not want to increase fixed cost more than required We need to retain flexibility in our remuneration structure We must have the ability to be competitive on remuneration in the global environment in which we operate.
Barclays is seeking shareholder approval at the April 2014 AGM for the maximum CRD IV pay ratio of 2:1.
A 2:1 ratio will limit the transfer from variable to fixed pay required to continue to pay our employees competitively.
Role Based Pay RBP Consistent with developing market practice, our approach to CRD IV remuneration compliance for the small number of impacted employees is a new class of fixed pay called RBP which has the flexibility to be decreased as well as increased.
Salaries can typically only be adjusted upwards.
The key features of RBP are as follows: It reflects the breadth and depth of responsibility associated with senior positions at Barclays It is fixed but will be reviewed typically annually It is paid monthly in cash alongside salary with effect from 1 January 2014 excluding executive Directors and Group Executive Committee members who will be paid quarterly in shares or share equivalents where local law makes this necessary and certain other senior employees who will be paid partly in shares and partly in cash.
The decision to pay in cash reflects the current very high levels of deferral within Barclays which are significantly in excess of regulatory requirements and the market It can go down as well as up in certain circumstances, for example, following changes to role, responsibilities or accountabilities, or external factors, such as changes in business and economic environment, which may have a bearing on the role in terms of equivalent market opportunities or the particular skill set required for a role It is not adjusted for performance individual, business or Group and is not salary for pension and benefits purposes except where required under local law.
As a result of implementing RBP with a ratio of 2:1 we expect a small increase in fixed costs and decrease in variable costs for 2014.
RBP will represent a relatively small proportion of total compensation costs.

As well as every colleague completing a mandatory training programme, Barclays Purpose and Values was integrated into the day to day management processes covering recruitment, talent management, performance assessment and reward In the case of our Managing Director population, their 2013 performance has been formally assessed against whether they have exhibited the right values and behaviours, as well as producing the desired business outcomes.
This criteria will apply to all employees in 2014.
2013 incentives repositioning journey and impact of 2012 decisions 2013 compensation and incentive headlines Total compensation costs decreased 1% to 9,616m.
Total compensation costs in the Investment Bank were slightly down at 4,634m 2012: 4,667m This reduction in compensation costs in part offset the reduction in adjusted net operating income and meant that the Group compensation to adjusted net operating income ratio increased slightly to 38.3% 2012: 37.5% Before making adjustments for risk and conduct events, the 2013 incentive awards of 2,492m had been reduced 18% from 2012.
After adjustments for risk and conduct, total incentive awards granted were 2,378m, up 10% on 2012 While the final incentive pool is up on 2012, it is 1,106m or 32% below the 2010 outcome from when the Committee started its repositioning journey to reduce compensation.
In the Investment Bank incentive awards granted were 41% 1,086m below 2010 There has been strong differentiation on the basis of individual performance to allow the Group to more effectively manage compensation costs Average value of incentive awards granted per Group employee is 17,000 2012: 15,600 with the average value of incentive awards granted per Investment Bank employee of 60,100 2012: 54,500.
Average value of incentive awards granted per Group employee excluding the Investment Bank is 7,100 2012: 6,800 Levels of deferral continue to significantly exceed the PRA Remuneration Codes minimum requirements and are expected to remain among the highest deferral levels globally.
2013 bonuses awarded to Managing Directors in the Investment Bank were 100% deferred.
We recognise the importance that our stakeholders attach to the judgements that we apply in managing remuneration.
Remuneration must be managed in a way which incentivises employees, ensures pay is linked to performance and is appropriately aligned to risk and conduct.
Following 2010, material reductions were made to the incentive pool, particularly in the Investment Bank.
In 2011 the Investment Bank pool was reduced by 35% from 2,660m to 1,737m and again in 2012 by a further 20% to 1,394m.
Over this two-year period, incentives within the Investment Bank were almost halved total incentive awards granted were down 48%.
From a Group perspective, the pool was down by 38% over the same period.
In making these reductions the Committee and management took measured risks with the aim of exerting further downward pressure on remuneration.
The Committee closely monitored the impact of these decisions.
The evidence suggested that similar actions were not taken by our peers, most notably in the major US banks.
This, together with uncertainty generated by CRD IV and high deferral levels which significantly exceed regulatory requirements and the market meant that Barclays, in certain areas of the business, was no longer appropriately competitive on remuneration, and this caused demonstrable damage to our business.
While we remain committed to controlling pay levels, we also must seek to ensure that the health of the franchise is protected.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information In considering the appropriate level for the 2013 incentive pool, the Committee tried to find the right balance between ensuring the work on repositioning was not undone, reflecting performance both financial and our long-term strategy, and keeping Barclays remuneration appropriately competitive.
The outcome of this balancing process is that before adjustment for risk and conduct events, the 2013 incentive pool was reduced by 18% on the equivalent 2012 pool.
The total 2013 risk and conduct adjustment was 290m of which 176m was applied through reduced LTIP payouts, the balance of 114m was taken by reducing the 2013 incentive pool.
The level of adjustment required in 2013 was considerably less than that required in 2012, in which 860m was deducted from the pool for risk and conduct events including the investigation into the setting of inter-bank offered rates in 2012.
The final 2013 incentive pool after adjustments for risk and conduct events was 2,378m, up 10% on 2012.
The increase should be seen in the context of the multi-year reductions already achieved, the competitive pressures sustained in some parts of the business, the reduced adjustments for risk and conduct events required in 2013 and the overall repositioning journey that the Committee remains focused on achieving in a way that ensures that the long-term value of the Bank is maximised for shareholders.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 99 Pension Pension 363 363 Pension Pension 200 200 Remuneration report Directors remuneration policy This section sets out Barclays forward looking remuneration policy for Directors, explaining each element of the Directors remuneration policy and how it operates.
The policy described in this section is intended to apply for three years beginning on the date of the 2014 AGM, subject to shareholder approval.
This remuneration policy sets out the framework for how the Committees remuneration strategy will be executed for the Directors over the next three years.
This is to be achieved by having a remuneration policy that seeks to: provide an appropriate and competitive mix of fixed and variable pay which, through its short and long-term components, incentivises management and is aligned to shareholders: provide direct line of sight with Barclays strategy through the incentive programmes: and comply with and adapt to the changing regulatory landscape.
Impact of CRD IV on Directors remuneration policy Barclays is seeking shareholder approval for a maximum CRD IV pay ratio of 2:1 in accordance with CRD IV and has consulted with some of its major shareholders on this matter.
Barclays response to CRD IV and to ensure that it remains appropriately competitive for global talent is to introduce a new class of fixed pay called Role Based Pay RBP.
For the Group Chief Executive, Antony Jenkins, the maximum value of RBP will be 950,000 and for the Group Finance Director, Tushar Morzaria, the maximum RBP will be 750,000.
RBP will be delivered in shares which will be subject to a maximum holding period over five years with restrictions lifting 20% per annum.
In line with the current approach, at the maximum level of variable pay 40% will be delivered as bonus and 60% as a Barclays Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP award.
Barclays recognises that in return for greater certainty on fixed pay there should be a reduced total remuneration opportunity.
An illustration of the impact of CRD IV on the structure of the executive Directors remuneration together with the reduced maximum remuneration opportunity is set out below: Group Chief Executive, Antony Jenkins maximum remuneration opportunity Current structure 000 Salary Annual Bonus 2,750 Long Term Incentive Plan 4,400 1,100 250% of salary 400% of salary New structure maximum remuneration 000 Salary Role Based Pay Annual Bonus 1,930 Long Term Incentive Plan 2,896 Reduction in maximum 1,100 950 80% of Fixed Pay 120% of Fixed Pay opportunity Fixed Pay Maximum 200% of Fixed Pay c. 16% 1,374 The maximum remuneration opportunity for the Group Chief Executive, Antony Jenkins, will reduce in 2014 by 1,374,000 as set out above.
This comprises a reduction in maximum variable pay opportunity of 2,324,000, of which 950,000 transfers to fixed pay as RBP.
The net resulting reduction of 1,374,000 is a 59% discount on the portion of variable pay which is being transferred into fixed pay.
Overall there is a 16% discount in the maximum total fixed and variable remuneration opportunity.
Group Finance Director, Tushar Morzaria maximum remuneration opportunity Current structure 000 Salary Annual Bonus 2,000 Long Term Incentive Plan 3,200 800 250% of salary 400% of salary New structure maximum remuneration 000 Salary Role Based Pay Annual Bonus 1,400 Long Term Incentive Plan 2,100 Reduction in maximum 800 750 80% of Fixed Pay 120% of Fixed Pay opportunity Fixed Pay Maximum 200% of Fixed Pay c. 15% 950 The maximum remuneration opportunity for the Group Finance Director, Tushar Mozaria, will reduce in 2014 by 950,000 as set out above.
This comprises a reduction in maximum variable pay opportunity of 1,700,000, of which 750,000 transfers to fixed pay as RBP.
The net resulting reduction of 950,000 is a 56% discount on the portion of variable pay which is being transferred into fixed pay.
Overall there is a 15% discount in the maximum total fixed and variable remuneration opportunity.
European Banking Authority consultation paper Although the European Banking Authority has published a consultation paper on the draft guidelines for the notional discount rate for long-term remuneration, this is still at consultation stage and it is not expected to be significant.
Therefore it has not been factored in to the above illustration.
We will review market positioning once the regulation is finalised and will consult with major shareholders on whether it is appropriate to amend our policy in future to allow for the discount.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Notes to the table on pages 101 to 104: Performance measures and targets The Committee selected the relevant financial and risk based performance measures because they are key to the banks strategy and are important measures used by the executive Directors to oversee the direction of the business.
The Balanced Scorecard has been selected as it demonstrates the performance and progress of Barclays in the journey of becoming the Go-To bank as measured across the following dimensions 5Cs : Customers & Clients, Colleagues, Citizenship, Conduct and Company.
Each of the 5Cs in the Balanced Scorecard will have equal weighting.
All targets are set to be stretching but achievable and aligned to enhancing shareholder value.
The Committee is of the opinion that the performance targets for the annual bonus and Balanced Scorecard element of the LTIP are commercially sensitive in respect of the Company and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them before the start of the relevant performance period.
The performance against those measures will be disclosed after the end of the relevant financial year in that years remuneration report subject to the sensitivity no longer remaining.

The broader employee population typically does not have a contractual limit on the quantum of their remuneration and does not receive RBP which is paid only to some, but not all, Code Staff.
Executive Director RBP is determined on a similar basis to other Code Staff.
The Committee approaches any salary increases for executive Directors by benchmarking against market data for named banks.
Incremental annual salary increases remain more common among employees at less senior levels.
As with executive Directors, bonuses for the broader employee population are performance based.
Bonuses for executive Directors and the broader employee population are subject to deferral requirements.
Executive Directors and other Code Staff are subject to deferral at a minimum rate of 40% for bonuses of no more than 500,000 or 60% for bonuses of more than 500,000 but the Committee may choose to operate higher deferral rates.
For non-Code Staff, bonuses in excess of 65,000 are subject to a graduated level of deferral.
The terms of deferred bonus awards for executive Directors and the wider employee population are broadly the same, in particular the vesting of all deferred bonuses subject to service and malus conditions.
The broader employee population is not eligible to participate in the Barclays LTIP.
How shareholder views and broader employee pay are taken into account by the Committee in setting policy and making remuneration decisions We recognise that remuneration is an area of particular interest to shareholders and that in setting and considering changes to remuneration it is critical that we listen to and take into account their views.
Accordingly, a series of meetings are held each year with major shareholders and shareholder representative groups including the Association of British Insurers, National Association of Pension Funds and ISS.
The Committee Chairman attends these meetings, accompanied by senior Barclays employees including the Reward and Performance Director and the Company Secretary.
Matters discussed for 2013 included our forward looking Directors remuneration policy, 2013 remuneration and remuneration aspects of CRD IV.
The Committee notes that shareholder views on some matters are not always unanimous, but values the insight and engagement that these interactions and the expression of sometimes different views provide.
This engagement is meaningful and helpful to the Committee in its work and contributes directly to the decisions made by the Committee.
For example, the Committees proposals on which employees should receive RBP in shares and on certain individual RBP levels were amended following discussions with shareholders.
Shareholders also contributed directly to the Committees approach to the level of discount in the total remuneration opportunities of the executive Directors to reflect the increased certainty of RBP.
Shareholders provided feedback which was used to shape the Directors remuneration policy.
The Committee takes account of the pay and employment conditions of the broader employee base when it considers the remuneration of the executive Directors.
The Committee receives and reviews analysis of remuneration proposals for employees across all of the Groups businesses.
This includes analysis by corporate grade and by performance rating and information on proposed bonuses and salary increases across the employee population and individual proposals for Code Staff and highly paid individuals.
When the Committee considers executive Director remuneration, it therefore makes that consideration in the context of a detailed understanding of remuneration for the broader employee population and uses the all employee data to compare remuneration and ensure consistency throughout the Group.
Employees are not consulted directly on the Directors remuneration policy.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2013 105 Remuneration report Directors remuneration policy continued Executive Directors' policy on recruitment Barclays operates in a highly specialised sector and many of its competitors for talent are outside of the United Kingdom.
The Committees approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract appropriate candidates to the role.
The remuneration packages offered on appointment to any new executive Director are a specific part of the Committees Terms of Reference.
The terms of such packages must be approved by the Committee in consultation with the Chairman and except for the terms of his own remuneration the Group Chief Executive.
Any new executive Director's package would include the same elements, and be subject to the same constraints, as those of the existing executive Directors, as shown below.
Element of remuneration Commentary Maximum value Determined by market conditions, market practice and ability In line with policy.
For a newly appointed executive Director, whether through external recruitment or internal promotion, if their salary is at a level below the desired market level, the Committee retains the discretion to realign their salary over a transitional period which may mean that annualised salary increases for the new appointee are higher than that set out in the salary section of the remuneration policy on page 101.
Determined by role, market practice and ability to recruit.
Role Based Pay may decrease or increase in certain circumstances subject to maximum value.
Benefits In line with policy.
33% of salary Group Chief Pension Executive, 25% of salary Group Finance Director and 25% if another executive Director is appointed.
Annual Bonus In line with policy.
Long Term Incentive Plan The Committee can consider buying out forfeited bonus opportunity or The value of any buy out is not included Buy out incentive awards that the new executive Director has forfeited as a within the maximum incentive levels result of accepting the appointment with Barclays, subject to proof of above since it relates to a buy out of forfeiture where applicable.
forfeited bonus opportunity or incentive awards from a previous employer.
As required by the PRA Remuneration Code, any award made to compensate for forfeited remuneration from the new executive Directors previous employment may not be more generous than, and must mirror as far as possible the expected value, timing and form of delivery, the terms of the forfeited remuneration and must be in the best long-term interests of Barclays.
Barclays deferral policy shall however apply as a minimum to any buy out of annual bonus opportunity.
Where a senior executive is promoted to the Board, his or her existing contractual commitments agreed prior to his or her appointment may still be honoured in accordance with the terms of the relevant commitment including vesting of any pre-existing deferred bonus or long-term incentive awards.
