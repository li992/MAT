B3.3 Annual report on remuneration continued B3.3.
2 Directors remuneration for the year ended 30 September 2013 The information provided in this section has been audited Single total gure of remuneration for each director The following tables have been prepared using the measures prescribed by The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
In accordance with the Regulations, the amounts shown in respect of pension accrual have been calculated by applying a factor of 20 to the increase in accrued pension, after adjusting for in ation, whilst the values shown for share awards vesting in the year have been calculated on the basis of the share price at the vesting date, which may not necessarily equate to the price at which the awards have been or may be exercised.
Allowances and bene ts includes bene ts in kind, comprising private health cover, fuel bene t, life assurance and company car provision.
The company car allowance paid to executive directors 10,000 - 12,000 is also included in allowances and bene ts.
Dividend is the accrued dividend paid on deferred bonuses which vested during the year.
Remuneration in respect of share awards is calculated by multiplying the number of shares vesting during the year by the mid-market closing price of the shares on the vesting date.
The link between pay and performance - Annual bonus for the year ended 30 September 2013 The annual bonus for the year under review was based on performance against financial and risk measures: performance against each of these measures is then subject to individual scale factors according to performance against personal strategic objectives.
The performance for the year, and the resulting accrual levels, were as follows: Award Measure Weighting Outcome level Financial Adjusted operating pro t 33.33% 104.1m 18% performance BTL lending 359.8m Future value of Projected pro ts from lending activities transacted in the year 33.33% 30% new business and projected residual cash ow from acquired portfolios Idem investments 92.8m The business having operated within the key risk tolerance Risk 33.33% See below 28% levels agreed by the Board Totals 100% Bonus achieved for 2013 76% Of maximum under scheme, subject to individual performance scale factors of 0.5 to 1.5 times.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 55 B Corporate governance B3.3 Annual report on remuneration continued Financial performance Operating pro t for the year has exceeded the targeted level of 102.0 million and cash generation from the originated and acquired portfolios was at strong levels.
Firm control was maintained over costs, despite the costs associated with the banking licence application and the impact of the increased share price on share based costs.
Future value Buy-to-let lending volumes were, at 359.8 million, well in excess of the target, with margins broadly in line with target.
In addition to the buy-to-let volumes completed, the business ended the financial year with a strong pipeline of 231.9 million for future completions.
Acquisitions by Idem Capital, the Groups investment subsidiary, at 92.8 million, were also well in excess of target, placing Idem Capital at the core of the market.
The business is also widening its franchise on the back of deals completed to date.
Risk The Group has operated within the risk tolerance levels approved by the Board in respect of capital ratios, liquidity positions, the risk appetite of new business, the management of operational risk, the development of plans to mitigate longer-term strategic risk, and the management of regulatory risk.
During the year complaint levels have been minimal, arrears levels remain low by industry averages, funding sources have been further diversi ed, liquidity has been strong and comfortably in excess of policy limits and capital ratios are highly prudent.
Target business volume gures are not disclosed for the year because the Committee believes that disclosure of targeted margins, arrears levels, volumes, cash plans and funding assumptions would provide competitors with information which would put the future of the business at risk.
Accordingly the Committee considers that such information is commercially sensitive.
The final level of each executive directors bonus is adjusted to re ect personal performance against strategic objectives related to each of the elements.
These individual performance scale factors are between 0.5 and 1.5 times, according to performance.
The objectives for the year ended 30 September 2013 were as follows: N S Terrington and N Keen Working within the parameters of the Groups risk appetite, to deliver the planned financial performance for the year, whilst ensuring future pro t streams and strategic delivery position the Group to meet its longer term goals.
J A Heron The Committee, with advice from the Chief Executive, assessed the performance of the director with reference to the following objectives: First Mortgage business to: - Achieve target operating pro t - Achieve target new lending volumes - Improve application conversion rates Oversee bank authorisation project Manage resource levels to meet immediate and longer-term strategic requirements The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 56 B Corporate governance R J Woodman The Committee, with advice from the Chief Executive, assessed the performance of the director with reference to the following objectives: Idem division to: - Achieve target operating pro t - Achieve target return rate - Raise pro le and investor market awareness of Idem Capital - Develop and embed operational and migration capacity along with governance, compliance and reporting capabilities Maintain and lead corporate merger and acquisition activities Effectively manage the Business Analysis and Planning division Provide support to the project to establish a banking subsidiary Performance against the objectives is assessed by the Committee at the end of the year with input from the Chief Executive as appropriate.
Each objective is scored from 0 to 4, with target scale factor being for a score of 2, equating to a scale factor of 1.0 times, as set out in the table below: Scale factor Average score Performance 0.50 0 Poor 0.75 1 Below target 1.00 2 Target 1.25 3 Above target 1.50 4 Exceptionally good The Committee, having considered individual performance against the objectives set at the beginning of the year, has agreed the following scale factors for the year ended 30 September 2013: N S Terrington 1.12 N Keen 1.12 J A Heron 1.00 R J Woodman 1.22 The resulting bonuses for 2013, after applying the scale factors to the award levels, were as follows: Executive Financial Future Risk Scale Total Total Cash Share performance value factor percentage value of new of max business capped at max 33% max 33% max 33% times 100% 000 000 000 N S Terrington 18% 30% 28% 1.12 85.0% 739 567 172 N Keen 18% 30% 28% 1.12 85.0% 553 427 126 J A Heron 18% 30% 28% 1.00 76.0% 352 277 75 R J Woodman 18% 30% 28% 1.22 92.5% 429 314 115 The maximum bonus entitlement is 200% of salary.
25% of amounts awarded in excess of 50,000 are deferred, to be payable in shares after three years, net of any clawback applied see below.
For Mr Woodman, this policy applies to his bonus up to and including 150% of his salary, with the amount in excess of 150% being subject to 50% deferral.
No further performance conditions apply to the deferred shares.
A clawback mechanism applies to all participants in the event of misconduct or a material misstatement of the Groups accounts.
The Committee is satis ed that the level of bonus earned by each director re ects both the performance of the individual and the Group during the year.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 57 B Corporate governance B3.3 Annual report on remuneration continued Directors pensions The total amount charged to the pro t and loss account of the Group in respect of pension provision for directors was 555,000 2012: 480,000.
Mr N S Terrington, Mr N Keen, Mr J A Heron and Mr R J Woodman were members of the Group fide ned bene t pension plan during the year.
The amounts shown below describe their entitlement in accordance with paragraph LR 9.8.
Normal Increase decrease Transfer value Accumulated Accumulated Retirement in accrued pension of increase total accrued total accrued date during year decrease less pension at pension at excluding any directors 30 September 30 September increase for in ation contributions 2013 2012 000 000 000 000 N S Terrington 13 12 2019 1 14 167 162 N Keen 13 01 2018 - - 97 94 J A Heron 04 01 2019 - 7 94 92 R J Woodman 10 05 2025 - - 58 56 The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the following dates on which the director elected to suspend future bene t accrual within the plan: Messrs Terrington and Heron, 6 April 2006: Mr Woodman, 9 October 2007: and Mr Keen, 1 April 2011.
The pension entitlements for Messrs Terrington and Heron continue to be linked to pensionable salaries, while Messrs Keen and Woodman elected on 1 April 2011 that their bene ts would no longer be linked to pensionable salaries and their accrued pension gures have, therefore, been calculated based on a date of leaving of 1 April 2011 with deferred pension revaluation, where relevant.
The increase in accrued pension during the year and transfer value of the increase excludes any increase for RPI in ation which is used for applying deferred pension revaluation which is capped at 5.0% per annum over the whole period of revaluation if relevant.
The increase in RPI in ation used to calculate the accrued pensions as at 30 September 2012, for those members who elected to remove the link to increases in pensionable salary from 1 April 2011 was capped at 5% for consistency with the deferred revaluation applied to the accrued pension over a one year period to 2012.
This year, the deferred revaluation applying over the two year period to 2013 is not capped, as RPI in ation has been less than 5% per anum on average and therefore the increase in accrued pension over the year includes the catch-up from the capping applied last year.
As such the accrued pension has increased by more than the one year increase in RPI in ation, however the increase in accrued pension net of any increase for in ation is shown as nil.
This is consistent with the treatment in the previous year.
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the Occupational Pensions Schemes Transfer Values Regulations 1996 and the Occupational Pensions Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008, in force from 1 October 2008.
Members of the plan have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting bene ts are included in the above table.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum either paid or currently payable to the individual director by the Group or the scheme.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme should the director request a transfer, calculated at the balance sheet date.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 58 B Corporate governance The pension accrual gure included in the single total gure of remuneration table represents the increase in the accrued pension, excluding the effect of CPI in ation, during the year multiplied by 20, in accordance with the methodology set out in the Regulations.
The increase in accrued pension excluding in ation in the table above, being as it is calculated using the RPI based methodology described, is not directly comparable.
During the year the Group made contributions in respect of further pension provision of 165,000 2012: 150,000 for Mr Terrington, 198,000 2012: 192,000 for Mr Keen, 88,000 2012: 78,000 for Mr Heron and 103,000 for Mr Woodman 2012: 61,000 following his appointment and these amounts are shown as pension allowance in the single total gure of remuneration table.
Details of share-based awards Awards granted in January 2010 under the Groups LTIs the PSP and MSP which vested during the year were subject to performance conditions measured over three financial years, comparing the Groups relative TSR performance against a comparator group of companies comprising the constituents of the FTSE-250 on the date of grant over the three years commencing on the date of grant.
The vesting percentage was then reviewed by the Committee against a financial underpin.
The Company was ranked above the upper quartile position, giving a 100% vesting percentage and the Committee determined that such level of vesting was consistent with the Companys financial performance.
Annual Report & Accounts 2013 59 B Corporate governance B3.3 Annual report on remuneration continued Paragon Performance Share Plan Awards under this plan comprise a right to acquire shares in the Company for nil or nominal payment and will vest on the third anniversary of their grant to the extent that the applicable performance criteria have been satis ed.
The awards granted during the year were calculated so as to have a face value of 200% of salary, using the average closing mid-market price of the Companys shares on each of the five dealing days up to and including the day before the grant date.
Therefore the face value of the awards granted during the year being the number of shares in each case multiplied by 3.1192, that being the average of the closing prices of the Companys shares at the end of each of the five dealing days ending on the day before the grant date were 869,500 for Mr Terrington, 651,000 for Mr Keen, and 463,500 for each of Mr Heron and Mr Woodman.
25% of the awards will vest for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 60 B Corporate governance 50% of these awards are subject to the TSR test, as above, and 50% are subject to an EPS test.
The EPS test provides that 25% of EPS tested awards will vest where EPS growth is equal to the increase in the retail price index plus 3%, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for EPS growth equal to the increase in the retail price index plus 7% or more.
The share prices at the exercise dates were 2.577 on 18 December 2012, 3.2992 on 5 August 2013 and 3.421 on 13 August 2013.
The awards maturing during the year, granted on 4 January 2010, achieved 100% vesting after the application of the performance criteria.
Awards are exercisable from the date on which the Remuneration Committee determines the extent to which the performance conditions have been satis ed to the tenth anniversary of the grant date.
