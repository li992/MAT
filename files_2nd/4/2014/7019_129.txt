Directors pensions As noted below, the UK executive Directors are members of the appropriate section of the Halma Group Pension Plan Plan.
This section is a funded final salary occupational pension plan registered with HMRC, which provides a maximum pension of two-thirds of final pensionable salary after 25 or more years service at normal pension age 60.
Up to 5 April 2006, final pensionable salary was the greatest salary of the last three complete tax years immediately before retirement or leaving service.
From 6 April 2011, final pensionable salary was capped at 139,185 and is increased annually thereafter by CPI currently 153,684.
Bonuses and other fluctuating emoluments and benefits-in-kind are not pensionable nor subject to any pension supplement.
The Plan also provides for life cover of three times salary, pensions in the event of early retirement through ill-health and dependants pensions of one-half ofthe members prospective pension.
Early retirement pensions, currently possible from age 55 with the consent of the Company and the trustees of the Plan, are subject to actuarial reduction.
Pensions in payment increase by 3% per annum for service up to 5 April 1997, by price inflation subject to a maximum of5% through to 31 March 2007 and 3% thereafter.
Whilst pension benefits are accruing, executive Directors receive pension supplements to compensate them for the fact that their pension accrual entitlement under the Halma Group Pension Plan defined benefit arrangements is limited by the pensionable salary cap introduced from 6 April 2006 or the Lifetime Allowance.
The Company introduced a pensionable salary cap in order to address changes affecting the Plan made in the Pension Act 2006.
88 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements During the year, the Company announced the closure of the DB section to future accrual with effect from 1 December 2014.
The Company obtains external advice regarding the changes to the Plan and executive pension arrangements and provides educational seminars on the impact of pension legislation changes annual and lifetime allowances on individuals.
Otherwise, executive Directors are responsible for obtaining advice specific to their circumstances.
Prior to drawing his pension, to the extent that an executives current salary exceeds the Plan salary cap, the Company compensates him at an annual rate of 26% of the excess.
In April 2006, Kevin Thompson chose to cease future service accrual in the Plan in return for the pension supplement on his full salary.
In April 2014, Andrew Williams chose to cease future service accrual in the Plan in return for the pension supplement on his full salary.
This change is, broadly, cost neutral.
Neil Quinn has reached the Normal Retirement Date and is drawing his pension, therefore no future pension contribution or cash supplement is payable.
Two Directors accrued benefits under the Companys Defined Benefit pension plan during the year as follows.

Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension plan.
The transfer values are Gilt-related and depend upon the relative standings of the Gilt market at the respective valuation dates.
The increase in transfer values in recent years is predominantly due to the significant reduction in the yields available on UK Gilts.
Other factors that have increased the transfer values are the impact of any additional service, revaluation in line with inflation and any real salary increases as well as the anticipated ageing of the member.
These values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
Adam Meyers is a member of the US 401k money purchase scheme.
