Directors Remuneration Report Statement by Chairman of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee This is the second reporting period that we have reported in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
This Remuneration Report includes the Annual Report on Remuneration required by the Regulations and also, for information only, the Remuneration Policy which was approved by the Companys members at the Annual General Meeting in March 2014.
The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out annually how the Remuneration Policy has been implemented, including a single figure for the total remuneration of each of the Directors in the financial year to 30 September 2014.
The Annual Report on Remuneration is subject to the approval of the members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The vote will be advisory but if the Company fails to pass a resolution in a year where the Remuneration Policy was not put to a members resolution this will trigger the need for the Company to put the Remuneration Policy to a vote of its members the following year.
The Remuneration Policy sets out how the Company pays the Directors, including each element of remuneration to which the Directors are entitled and how this supports the Companys long-term strategy and performance.
The policy also includes details of the Companys approach to recruitment and loss of office payments.
The Remuneration Policy was subject to the approval of the members at the 2014 Annual General Meeting and following the approval by the members is binding on the Company.
The Remuneration Policy must be put to a shareholder resolution at least every three years and if the Company wishes to make any changes to the Remuneration Policy it will have to put the new policy to a vote of its members at a general meeting.
There have been no substantial changes in the Companys approach to the remuneration of its Directors during the year and the Remuneration and Nomination Committee did not consider it necessary to recommend any changes to the existing Directors fee arrangements during the year.
Remuneration Policy The Directors prepared this policy in accordance with the requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
An Ordinary Resolution for the approval of this policy was put to members at the 2014 Annual General Meeting and following the passing of the resolution the policy took effect from the date of the Annual General Meeting.
All provisions of this policy are expected to remain in effect until the Annual General Meeting in 2017 when the Company is next required to submit its policy on the remuneration of its Directors to the members.
Future Policy Table The fee levels paid to the Companys Directors are determined by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee.
The Companys policy is that the remuneration of non-executive Directors should be fair and sufficient to oversee the affairs of the Company and should reflect the specific circumstances of the Company, the duties and responsibilities of the Directors and the value and amount of time committed to the Companys affairs.
The policy is to pay a basic fee to each Director and to pay additional fees to the Chairman of the Company, the Chairmen of the Boards Committees and the Senior Independent Director as set out in the future policy table below.
Fees may be increased in line with inflation from time to time.
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee may consider paying additional fees to a Director or Directors in the event that they carry out additional work for the Company, except that non-executive Directors are not eligible to receive bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other benefits and are subject to the requirement that the total remuneration of the Directors is determined by the provisions of the Companys Articles of Association and by shareholder resolution.

Statement of Principles of the Companys Approach to Recruitment Remuneration 1 Remuneration of non-executive Directors should be fair and sufficient to enable Directors properly to oversee the affairs of the Company and should reflect the specific circumstances of the Company, the duties and responsibilities of the Directors and the value and amount of time committed to the Companys affairs.
2 Non-executive Directors are not eligible to receive bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other benefits.
3 The total remuneration of the Directors is determined by the provisions of the Companys Articles of Association and by shareholder resolution.
4 The basic Directors fee will be paid to each Director with an additional fee per annum for the Chairman of the Company.
An additional fee per annum will be paid to the Chairman of each of the Audit, Valuations, Management Engagement, Remuneration and Nomination Committees and to the Chairman of any other Committees that the Company forms and to the Senior Independent Director.
5 Directors are not entitled to any variable remuneration.
Service Contracts None of the Directors has a service contract with the Company.
No arrangements have been entered into, nor is it proposed that arrangements be entered into, between the Company and the Directors to entitle any of the Directors to remuneration or compensation for loss of office which is not disclosed elsewhere in this policy.
Notice Period and Loss of Office Payment Policy The Directors are subject to a notice period of one month.
It is the Companys policy not to enter into any arrangement with any of the Directors to entitle any of the Directors to compensation for loss of office.
Statement of Consideration of Conditions elsewhere in the Company The Company has no employees and therefore the Company cannot take into account the pay and employment conditions of its employees when setting the remuneration policy.
For similar reasons the Company cannot consult with its employees when setting the policy for Directors Remuneration or use comparison metrics or other specific information comparing its employees remuneration when determining Directors Remuneration.

Remuneration and Nomination Committee The Remuneration and Nomination Committee comprises all the non-executive Directors of the Company: I am Chairman of the Committee.

The Committee did not consider it necessary to recommend any changes to the existing fee arrangements during the year which are set out in the Future Policy Table of the Remuneration Policy.
The Company has no employees.

No loss of office payments were made to any person who served as a Director of the Company at any time during the year ended 30 September 2014 2013:nil.

It is not meaningful to compare the overall expenditure on Directors fees with the amounts distributed by dividend or share buybacks and with employee remuneration as these amounts were nil for the current and previous financial years.
Total Shareholder Return The Directors consider that, since the Company invests in a broad range of commercial sectors, the FTSE All-Share Index is the most appropriate index against which to compare the Companys performance.
