LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS AND RISK MANAGEMENT KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN VALUE-IN-USE CALCULATIONS The following section provides an analysis of the Groups available liquidity and the liquidity requirements that result from the Groups Projected future cash flows for the US CGU were based upon the Board-approved budget for the financial year ending 31 May 2015. business model, and sets out the key measures used by the Group to monitor and manage the level of liquidity available to the Group.
Forecasts to the year ending 31 May 2019 were then extrapolated from the budget using a range of client recruitment, client retention The key measures used by the Group are explained below: rates and average revenue per client assumptions.
These were based upon actual amounts measured in prior periods which were projected forward in accordance with expected trends.
This methodology is consistent with that used for the 31 May 2013 year-end impairment review.
Liquid assets: These are total liquid assets that the Group can access.
These include cash held at bank both own cash and title transfer The revenue growth rates disclosed in the following table are consistent with the long-term growth rates of other funds as well as at brokers, the liquid assets buffer held by the Group and other cash amounts due to the Group.
Group businesses measured over a five-year period.
Own funds: These are liquid assets less title transfer funds.
Title transfer funds are client monies held by the Group under a Title Transfer The calculation of value-in-use for the US CGU is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Collateral Arrangement TTCA.
Client recruitment and retention rates Available liquid assets: Certain of the Groups funds are not immediately available for the purposes of central market risk management Average revenue per client as they are required to provide regulatory capital balances in regulated subsidiaries.
Additionally, the Groups overseas businesses require working capital balances to fund daily operations and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to fund the local client segregation The discount rate requirements.
Available liquid assets are therefore liquid assets less both amounts held in overseas subsidiaries and amounts due from The long-term growth rate used for the terminal value calculation segregation each of which are not considered immediately available to the Group.
Cash flows were translated into sterling using year-end exchange rates.
Net available liquidity: This is the remaining liquidity available to the Group after the funding of the broker margin requirement associated with market risk management.
The cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate as disclosed in the table below.
This was derived using a region-specific, market-based cost of equity and debt assumption, in order to reflect both the financing cost and risk associated with the US CGU.
The Total available liquidity: This measure is the total of the Groups liquid assets and the Groups undrawn committed banking facilities.

LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED A number of measures are used by the Group for managing liquidity risk, one of which is the level of total available liquidity.
For this purpose total liquidity is calculated as set out in the following table inclusive of the undrawn committed facility.
19 B THE GROUPS LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS The Group requires day-to-day liquidity for each of: the full segregation of client monies: the funding of regulatory and working capital in 2014 2013 overseas businesses: the funding of margin requirements at brokers to hedge the underlying client positions under both normal and stressed 000 000 conditions: the funding of a liquid asset buffer and amounts associated with general working capital.

1 Drawdown of the committed banking facility is capped at 80% of the actual broker margin requirement on the drawdown date.
The maximum available drawdown was 200.0 million at 31 May 2014 2013: 180.0 million based on the broker margin requirements on those dates, of which nil was drawn down as at 31 May 2014 These requirements are analysed in the following table: 31 May 2013: nil.

Utilisation of the liquid assets buffer is allowed in times of liquidity stress, and therefore it is considered as available for the Note 000 000 purposes of overall liquidity planning.

client funds in segregated client money bank accounts.
This daily segregation requirement occurs prior to the release of funds from the UK note: market risk management is performed centrally for the Group in the UK in relation to the associated hedging positions held at external brokers.
Accordingly cash balances are held in each of the overseas businesses in order to ensure client money segregation obligations are met.
These regulatory or working capital cash balances are not available to the Group 2014 2013 for the purposes of market risk management.
It is anticipated that following the granting of a regulatory license in Switzerland the overseas regulatory and working capital 000 000 balances will increase.

The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure it will have sufficient 1 Movement in working capital 3,298 12,038 liquidity to meet its broker margin requirements and other financial liabilities when due, under both normal circumstances and stressed Outflow inflow from investing activities conditions.
The Group has carried out an Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment ILAA during the year, and while this applies specifically Interest received 1,537 2,172 to the Groups FCA regulated entities, it provides the context in which liquidity is managed on a continuous basis for the whole Group.
Purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 11,504 16,762 The Group does not have any material liquidity mismatches with regard to liquidity maturity profiles due to the very short-term nature of its Purchase of non-controlling interests 1,319 financial assets and liabilities.

32 days in October to December 2013, and to 30.0 million for 28 days during February and March 2014 following the reduction in available liquidity after payment of dividends and at a time of relatively high levels of broker margin.
In the year ended 31 May 2013 the facilities were drawn down to a maximum of 25.0 million for a period of 22 days in April 2013, when the broker margin requirement reached a level of 19 E SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 294.7 million and the Group held a liquid assets buffer of 50.5 million.
The Group has on 15 July 2014 completed the renegotiation of the 200.0 million liquidity facility with a syndicate of three banks.
In doing so the Group has renewed the 120.0 million element of the facility available for a period of one year with an option to extend for a further As well as the three-year liquidity forecast, the Group also produces more detailed short-term liquidity forecasts and detailed stress tests year and renegotiated the 80.0 million element of the facility to be available for a further three years respectively from 31 July 2014.

In the Directors opinion the Group has sufficient liquidity available to meet operational requirements under both normal and stressed conditions.
Liquidity management is also dependent on credit risk management, subsequently described in note 36 ii.

For each award, a minimum performance target has to be achieved before any shares vest, and the awards vest fully once the maximum performance target is achieved.
For LTIP awards, the fair value at grant date is determined by taking the share price at grant date.
An adjustment for the present value of future dividends is not required, as dividend equivalents are awarded on options granted under the LTIP.
The LTIP awarded in the current year vests after three years with a predefined number of shares allocated pro-rata, based on achieving diluted earnings per share growth of between zero and 9%, with straight-line vesting in between.
For potential SPP awards made under the Total Shareholder Return TSR criteria, fair value is calculated using an option-pricing model prepared by advisers.
For the SPP awards made under the earnings-per-share and non-financial operational measures, the fair value is The maximum number of LTIP awards that can be exercised are: determined by taking the share price at deemed grant date less the present value of future dividends for the duration of the performance period.

You must have deposited sufficient funds to cover any running losses.
