The performance multiplier operated to increase the core award by 22.8% as a result of the achievement of various strategic and personal performance criteria.
Each executive director has two strategic personal performance measures linked to areas that the committee has identified for the year.
The committee reviews the progress in each area and then makes an assessment whether the executive has delivered relative to expectations.
The committee believes that the multiplier is both a strong incentive for management to drive outstanding performance.

90 Berendsen plc Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Details of 2014 grant The PSP remains the primary long-term incentive plan for senior executives.
Awards were granted to executive directors equal to 100% of base salary which equals 53,236 awards 550,992 for Peter Ventress and 32,850 awards 339,997 for Kevin Quinn.
Vesting of these awards is subject to two performance conditions that operate independently of each other.
Half of an award was based upon a performance condition relating to adjusted EPS and the other half was based upon weighted average posttax ROIC.
Both performance conditions are measured over a three-year performance period.
To the extent that awards vest, the directors would receive the benefit of any dividends paid over the vesting period in the form of share-based dividend equivalents.
In return for investment shares which can be worth up to a maximum of 35% of base salary per annum being invested into the CIP, the director was granted a matching award over company shares that matches the number of investment shares on a 2 :1 pre-tax basis.
Matching awards were subject to the same performance conditions and with the same right to receive a dividend equivalent, as PSP awards.
Peter Ventress and Kevin Quinn invested shares amounting to 35% of base salary and were granted 74,532 and 45,992 matching awards respectively.
Outside appointments for executive directors Subject to board approval, the company encourages its executive directors to hold one non-executive position outside of the group, thereby broadening their experience and knowledge.
Any fees may be retained by the director.
Peter Ventress was appointed as a non-executive director of Premier Farnell plc, with effect from 1 October 2013, for which he received fees of 50,634 during 2014.

Below we detail how this policy will apply in 2015.
Base salary and fees Effective from 1 January 2015, the base salary of executive directors will be 565,000 for Peter Ventress increased by approximately 2.5% and 350,200 for Kevin Quinn increased by approximately 3.0%.
These increases are consistent with the average increases awarded across the broader employee population.
Non-executive directors base fees were increased by 11.5%.
These increases reflect the significantly increased workloads in recent years and are also designed to bring them into line with levels paid at similar sized companies.
Further details of the fees effective from 1 January 2015 are detailed below: Changes to Policy effective 1 January 2015 Senior Chairman of Independent Non-executive Chairman fee Base fee committee director 175,000 52,000 10,750 6,000 The committee does not anticipate any changes to the implementation of the policy in the following year.
Performance targets and variable remuneration will be granted on a similar basis as the current financial year.
Annual bonus: target setting for 2015 The annual bonus targets for 2015 will be set in accordance with our remuneration policy and will remain aligned to our current strategic goals, namely: Strategic goals Link to strategic objectives kk Adjusted earnings per share 50% kk Improving financial returns by leveraging operational efficiency kk The generation of free cash flow 25% kk Improving capital efficiency kk Revenue 25% kk Delivering sustainable organic growth q See pages 14 to 19 for a summary of our main KPIs and strategic objectives Berendsen plc Report and Accounts 2014 91 Report on directors remuneration continued The committee will set calibrated targets for each of these three measures and intends to disclose these targets retrospectively in next years directors remuneration report.
The actual targets are therefore not being disclosed now as this is considered by the committee to be commercially sensitive information because the majority of our competitors are in the private, unquoted sector and so are not required to publicly disclose the same level of information as Berendsen.
LTIP: target setting for 2015 Awards will be granted in accordance with our policy, namely: up to 100% of base salary for PSP awards and up to 140% of base salary for CIP awards.

The EPS targets above 72 pence to 82 pence maximise with a growth of 32% over the three-year period.
Aligning long-term awards with strategic objectives Both EPS and ROIC measures are main group KPIs and link to two of our strategic objectives, improving financial returns by leveraging operational efficiency and improving capital efficiency, respectively.
