Governance Remuneration report Ian Chippendale Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2014.
In line with the new reporting requirements, we have made some changes to the format and content of the report and we will be seeking shareholder approval for our remuneration policy at the forthcoming AGM.
Performance and reward The Group has made good progress during the year: there has been further focus on customer service in the UK and our International businesses have shown continued strong growth.
Customer satisfaction has increased in all of our businesses and the number of complaints has decreased across the Group.
As a result, the stretching commercial and customer targets for FY14 have been met.
The exceptional expenditure in the year relates to historic issues identified in the UK in FY12: no bonuses were paid in that year.
In respect of longer-term performance, the LTIP awards granted in 2010 did not vest and, based on performance to date, it is not expected that the awards granted in 2011 will vest either.
The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration paid to the Executive Directors in the year fairly reflects both corporate and individual performance during the year.
