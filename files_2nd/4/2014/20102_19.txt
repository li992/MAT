Strategic Report 0141 Governance 4274 Financial Statements 75131 Directors Letter from Russell King Remuneration Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Report Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the 2014 Directors Remuneration Report.
I should like to express your Committees thanks to our investors for the overwhelming support given to the new Directors Remuneration Policy at the 2014 AGM.
The changes introduced within the Policy remain appropriate for the Companys needs and, consequently, no amendments are being proposed for consideration at the 2015 AGM.
Russell King Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Remuneration strategy Linking total reward closely to business strategy and performance continues to underpin your Committees consideration of executive remuneration.
We aim to ensure that the Companys Remuneration Policy is designed to promote long-term success, taking account of appropriate risk considerations.
Accordingly, the Executive Directors overall package provides an appropriate balance between fixed and performance-related remuneration, with the latter elements being subject to demanding performance conditions aligned with the Groups strategic objectives.
The key elements of the Executive Directors remuneration arrangements are: base salary and total package set modestly below the median of UK quoted companies of comparable size, subject to adjustment up or down to reflect the experience and performance of individual incumbents: on-target and maximum annual bonus of, respectively, 60% and 125% of salary, only payable on achievement of stretching profit and individual objectives: annual awards under the Companys Performance Share Plan PSP of up to 200% of salary, with vesting after three years based one-third upon Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to the FTSE 250 index, one-third upon Earnings Per Share EPS growth, and one-third on economic profit delivery: benefits provided on a market competitive basis: and any bonus payment in excess of 60% to be applied to the purchase of Spectris shares and any shares arising post tax from PSP vesting to be retained until a three times base salary shareholding is achieved.
The anticipated reward mix for the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director is shown in the chart opposite.
This assumes PSP awards with a value on grant equal Anticipated reward mix for Chief to 200% of the Directors base salary leading to an expected vesting of 110% Executive and Group Finance Director of base salary and an annual bonus on-plan expectation of 60% of salary.
The recently released update to the UK Corporate Governance Code asks Remuneration Committees to consider requiring an extended holding period for shares arising after the vesting of three-year PSP grants.
I can confirm that this possibility was considered prior to submission of the Directors Remuneration Policy to the 2014 AGM and has been reviewed subsequently.
Whilst appreciating the desirability of longer-term alignment with shareholders interests, your Committee Base pay 40% believes that this is equally achieved by the three times base salary shareholding Pension 10% guideline, which was introduced within the new policy and lies significantly above Annual bonus 24% normal practice elsewhere.
However, the issue will be brought forward for further Performance Share Plan 26% review in 2015.
Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 61 Strategic Report 0141 Governance 4274 Financial Statements 75131 2014 remuneration Directors The Spectris Executive Team has produced satisfactory results for 2014 in challenging Remuneration conditions for certain markets.
However, the target profitability established by your Committee at the outset of the year was not achieved and hence no payment will Report be made under this element of the annual bonus plan.
continued A good level of performance was achieved against the personal objectives set in respect of 2014, and an average bonus was achieved for the Executive Directors of 17% out of a potential 25% of base salary for these objectives.
In the period from the end of the base year, 2011, to 2014, the Companys share price has risen by 63% and the annual dividend by 38%.
However, the PSP awards maturing on 24 February 2015 will not vest on the EPS measure and are not expected to vest on the TSR measure.
In the period from 2012 to 2014, the EPS compound annual return growth was modest at 0.2%, largely due to measuring this growth from a high EPS base year in 2011.
Whilst only a snapshot in time, as at the end of 2014 the PSP grants maturing in 2016 are also unlikely to vest on either of the EPS or TSR measures.
The grants made in March 2014 are too early in their three-year performance period to make reliable predictions as to outcome.
Future reviews The Committees remuneration advisers, FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP FIT, completed the biennial benchmarking review of the Chairmans fee during the year.
Based on the results of that review, your Committee determined that an increase from 180,000 to 200,000 should be implemented with effect from 1 January 2015: with a subsequent increase to 210,000 to follow at 1 January 2016.
FIT benchmarking data shows a median Chairman fee of 220,000 for companies of comparable size to Spectris.
2015 salary Increase J E OHiggins 569,500 1.8% C G Watson 361,800 1.8% In line with the undertaking I provided last year, the Executive Directors salaries were increased at a level consistent with average UK wage inflation as shown above although, in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee reserves the right to award future increases in excess of this should this be considered appropriate.
I hope that you will agree that our remuneration strategy and its implementation remain appropriate and that you will support the advisory vote on the 2014 Directors Remuneration Report at the 2015 AGM.
