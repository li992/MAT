76 Vesuvius plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Section Four: Governance Annual Directors remuneration report Remuneration committee structure and remit composition of the Remuneration committee The current members of the Remuneration Committee the Committee are all the independent Non-executive Directors of the Company: Jane Hinkley who also serves as the Committee Chairman, Nelda Connors and Jeff Hewitt all of whom served on the Committee throughout 2014 and in 2015 to date.
The Committee complies with the obligations of the UK Corporate Governance Code for the composition of Remuneration Committees.
Each of the members brings a broad experience of international businesses and an understanding of their challenges to the work of the Committee.
Jeff Hewitt brings his significant experience of Vesuvius to the Committee, and both Jane and Nelda add extensive international business experience to the Committees deliberations.
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee.
Members biographies are on pages 56 and 57.
As set out in the Chairmans Statement, and the Governance Report, Jeff Hewitt will step down from the Board and leave the Committee at the forthcoming AGM.
Hock Goh and Douglas Hurt will join the Company on 2 April 2015 and will serve on the Committee with effect from that date.
The Committee will therefore continue to comply with the Corporate Governance Code requirements on its composition.
meetings The Committee met four times during the year with full attendance, other than in respect of two meetings where Nelda Connors was prevented from attending the first due to personal reasons and the second due to adverse weather conditions preventing her travel.
The Group Chairman, Chief Executive, and Vice President Human Resources were invited to each meeting, together with Christer Gardell, our nonindependent Non-executive Director, though none of them participated in discussions regarding their own remuneration.
In addition the Chief Financial Officer attended where the agenda of the Committee required it.
This attendance supports the work of the Committee, giving critical insight into the operational demands of the business and their application to the overall strategy of remuneration within the Group.
In receiving views on remuneration matters from the Executive Directors and senior management, the Committee recognised the potential for conflicts of interest to arise and considered the advice accordingly.
The Chairman of the Committee reported the outcomes of all meetings to the Board.
The Committee operates under formal terms of reference which were reviewed and updated during the year and approved by the Board.
The terms of reference are available on the Group website www.
The Committee members are also empowered to obtain outside legal advice at the cost of the Company in relation to their deliberations powers which were not exercised during the year and to secure the attendance at its meetings of any employee or other parties should it be considered necessary.
Role and responsibilities The Committee is responsible for: Setting the appropriate remuneration for the Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary Recommending and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management, being the first layer of management below Board level and their direct reports Overseeing the operation of any executive share incentive plan advice provided to the Remuneration committee The external advisers Towers Watson Towers were appointed by the Committee in 2013 to provide remuneration advice following the Companys demerger from Cookson Group plc.
Towers was appointed directly by the Remuneration Committee to provide advice on executive remuneration matters, including remuneration structure and policy, updates on market practices and trends, and guidance on the implementation and operation of long-term incentive plans.
Towers also provided the Remuneration Committee with ongoing calculations of Total Shareholder Return to enable the Committee to be updated on the performance of long-term share incentive plans.
During the year, the Committee decided that it would be appropriate to review the appointment of the Committees external adviser.
A tender process was therefore undertaken, with invitations to pitch sent to four remuneration consultants.
As a result of this process Deloitte was appointed as the new external adviser to the Committee in December 2014.
Both Deloitte and Towers are signatories to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct in relation to Executive Remuneration Consulting in the UK.
Governance 77 The Committee is also advised by the Chief Executive, the Vice President Human Resources, the Company Secretary, and by the law firm Clifford Chance LLP Clifford Chance.
Clifford Chance was appointed at the time of the demerger by the Company Secretary to advise on the sharebased incentives.
Clifford Chance provides advice to the Group on the operation of its executive share plans.
In addition to work undertaken for the Committee, Deloitte provide other tax and accounting services to the Group, Towers provide other remuneration and benchmarking advice to the Company, and Clifford Chance provide legal advice to the Company.
During 2014 Deloittes fees for advice to the Remuneration Committee, charged on a time spent basis amounted to 21k.
The Committee has considered and concluded that it is satisfied that the advice provided to it on executive remuneration matters is objective and independent and that no conflict of interest arises as a result of other services provided to the Company.
activities of the Remuneration committee The Remuneration Committee met four times in 2014.
The key matters it considered included: The salary review proposals for the Executive Directors and senior management Reviewing achievement against performance targets, and approving payouts, in respect of 2013 annual cash bonus incentive arrangements Setting performance targets and approving the structure of the 2014 annual cash bonus incentive arrangements Considering the Companys performance against the performance conditions applicable to the 2011 Cookson Long Term Incentive Plan, andauthorising the vesting of these awards where relevant Setting the performance conditions and authorising the grant of awards under the Vesuvius Share Plan and Medium Term Incentive Plan In the light of advice received from the external advisers regarding trends in remuneration practice and governance, and any feedback from Institutional shareholders, discussing the Companys overall approach to executive remuneration and reviewing whether any changes should bemade Reviewing the Executive Directors shareholding policy Reviewing the Remuneration Committees terms of reference, and recommending any amendments to the Board for approval Reviewing and approving the 2013 Directors remuneration report.
Regulatory compliance The Remuneration Policy set out on pages 86 to 93 of this report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
It also meets the requirements of the UK Listing Authorities Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
This Annual report on remuneration sets out how the provisions of the September 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code are applied by the Company in relation to matters of remuneration.
We are happy to confirm that the Company has complied with these governance rules for the year under review.
Share usage Under the rules of the Cookson Long Term Incentive Plan and Vesuvius Share Plan, the Company has the discretion to satisfy awards either by the transfer of Treasury shares or other existing shares, or by the allotment of newly issued shares.
Awards made to senior managers by the Company over shares pursuant to the Medium Term Incentive Plan must be satisfied out of shares held for this purpose by the Companys employee share ownership trust ESOP.
The decision on how to satisfy awards is taken by the Remuneration Committee which considers the most prudent and appropriate sourcing arrangement for the Company.
At 31 December 2014 the Company held 7,271,174 ordinary shares in Treasury and 731,698 Vesuvius shares were held in the ESOP.
The Trustee of the ESOP can be gifted Treasury shares by the Company, can purchase shares in the open market or can subscribe for newly issued shares as required, to meet obligations for the provision of shares to satisfy options and awards that vest.
The Vesuvius Share Plan complies with the current IA guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a ten-year period in relation to the Companys issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten-year period on discretionary schemes.
No Treasury shares have been transferred or newly issued shares allotted under the Plan.
The following section provides details of how the Companys remuneration policy was implemented during the financial year 2014 and how it will be implemented in the financial year 2015.

Loss of office payments audited There were no payments made to any Director for loss of office during the year ended 31 December 2014.
Governance 79 Base salary and fees In the year under review, the Chief Executive received a base salary of 550,000 per annum, and the Chief Financial Officer received a base salary of 340,000 per annum.
Non-executive Directors fees were set at 45,000 per annum.
Supplementary fees of 15,000 per annum were payable to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
A supplementary fee of 5,000 per annum was also payable to the Senior Independent Director.
The Chairman was paid a fee of 185,000 per annum.
Neither the Chairman, nor the other Non-executive Directors are members of the Groups pension plans, nor do they participate in the Groups incentive schemes.
There were no increases to the Directors base salary and fees in 2014.
In 2015 it is proposed that the base salary of the Chief Financial Officer is increased by 5% to 357,000, which is in line with the cumulative average base salary rises of the UK salaried workforce of 6.9% over the same period.
This increase is the first received by the CFO since joining Vesuvius in 2012 and was determined by the Committee in a manner consistent with our policy of appraising changes to base salary over a two to three-year period.
Pension arrangements audited In accordance with their service agreements, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer are entitled to pension allowances of 30% of base salary, which they can use to participate in Vesuvius pension arrangements, invest in their own pension arrangements or take as a cash supplement or any combination of the aforementioned options.
Pension allowance 2014 2013 Director 000 000 Franois Wanecq 165 165 Chris OShea 102 102 annual Bonus The Executive Directors are eligible to receive an annual incentive calculated as a percentage of base salary and based on achievement against specified targets.
There is no deferral of annual bonuses for Executive Directors.
Each year the Remuneration Committee establishes the financial performance criteria for the forthcoming year.
These criteria are set by reference to the Companys financial budget and prior year actual financial results.
The target range is set to ensure that maximum bonuses are only paid for significantly exceeding performance expectations.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the setting and attainment of these targets is important in the context of achievement of the Companys longer-term strategic goals.
The annual incentive has a threshold level of performance below which no award is paid, a target level and a maximum performance level at which a maximum award is earned.
Franois Wanecqs maximum annual incentive potential is 125% of base salary and his target annual incentive potential is 62.5% of base salary.
Chris OSheas maximum annual incentive potential is 100% of base salary and his target annual incentive proposal is 50% of base salary.
For the financial year 2014, Franois Wanecq and Chris OSheas annual incentives were based on Vesuvius Group headline earnings per share, with an adjustment based on Vesuvius working capital performance to focus greater attention on cash flow.
As set out in the Remuneration Policy, the effect of this is to reduce the level of payout that could be achieved by up to 10% if specified working capital targets are not attained.
This kicker can also increase the level of payout by up to 10%, but not above the stated plan maximum.
For 2014 the Vesuvius Group headline earnings per share performance targets were set at the December 2013 full year average foreign exchange rates being the rates used for the 2014 budget process : Threshold: 33.5 pence On target: 35.3 pence Maximum: 38.1 pence In order to achieve the working capital target, the Groups working capital as a percentage of sales had to be between 23.1% to 24.1% of sales.
In order for the Committee to assess the Groups performance against these targets, the 2014 full year EPS performance was retranslated at the original budget December 2013 full year average foreign exchange rates, consistent with practice in previous years.
Consequently, in 2014 Vesuvius retranslated EPS performance was 36.5 pence, and working capital was 24.9% meaning that Franois Wanecq and Chris OSheas annual incentives paid out at 80.4% and 64.3% of base salary respectively reflecting a 10% reduction to the payouts arising from the EPS performance as a result of the working capital adjustment.
Franois Wanecq and Chris OShea were therefore entitled to receive payouts under the 2014 Annual Incentive as follows: Outturn Achieved Incentive 1 Name Measure Weighting retranslated % of salary to be paid Franois Wanecq Group headline earnings per share 100% 36.5p 80.4 441,964 Chris OShea Group headline earnings per share 100% 36.5p 64.3 218,571 NOTE 1.
The 2014 awards were also subject to the working capital kicker: this had the effect of reducing the awards by 10%.
80 Vesuvius plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Section Four: Governance Annual Directors remuneration report continued The Remuneration Committee has determined that for 2015 Franois Wanecq and Chris OSheas annual incentives will again be based on Group headline earnings per share, with a similar adjustment based on the Groups working capital performance.
Franois Wanecqs and Chris OSheas maximum annual incentive bonus potential for 2015 remain unchanged at 125% and 100% respectively.
The Company will not be disclosing the targets set until after the relevant performance period because of commercial sensitivities.
malus clawback arrangements in 2015 Vesuvius has operated clawback arrangements in respect of Executive Directors variable remuneration since 2012.
The existing structure of those arrangements is outlined in our Remuneration Policy.
As highlighted in the statement of the Committee Chairman at the start of this Directors remuneration report, the Committee has reviewed these arrangements in light of the revised Corporate Governance Code and evolving market practice.
Following that review, the Committee has decided to strengthen the implementation of the existing Policy from 2015 as follows: Malus provisions will be added to the existing clawback provisions.
This will provide the Committee with the flexibility, if required, to withhold or recover payments made to Executive Directors under the Annual Incentive Plan and or to withhold or recover share awards granted to Executive Directors under the Vesuvius Share Plan Circumstances in which the Committee could potentially elect to apply malus and clawback provisions will be extended.
Going forward, potential events which could trigger the application of these provisions will encompass a misstatement in the Companys financial statements which requires restatement of a prior years accounts: an error in the calculation of the extent of payment or vesting of an incentive: gross misconduct by an individual: or significant financial loss or serious reputational damage to Vesuvius plc resulting from an individuals conduct, a material failure of risk management or a serious breach of health and safety Our existing arrangements permit the application of clawback provisions for a period of up to three years after the end of a performance period.
The Committee is satisfied that this time period is sufficient and is making no changes in this regard.
Outstanding longer-term pay audited Vesuvius Performance Share awards Performance Share awards are allocated to the Executive Directors under the Vesuvius Share Plan.
They are eligible to receive, on an annual basis, a performance share award with a face value of up to 200% of base salary.
Vesting of 50% of shares awarded is based upon the Companys three-year TSR performance relative to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts, and 50% on headline EPS growth, as compared with the compound annual growth in global GDP over a three-year period.
The specific level of compound headline EPS growth specified in the targets is set by the Remuneration Committee each year, taking into account the Groups prospects and the broader global economic environment.
The two measures operate independently.
The use of these performance measures is intended to align executive remuneration with shareholders interests.
The performance scale for the 2013 Vesuvius Share Plan awards was set to be stretching.
The nominal figures for the headline EPS part of the award were selected in the light of a relatively low base period result.
For awards in 2014 the Committee reinforced the message that targets for full vesting should remain truly stretching, rewarding significant out-performance.
However, they also recognised that the vesting threshold for the first Vesuvius Performance Share awards in 2013 was not necessarily appropriate for subsequent awards once the baseline of performance had been set.
They therefore resolved that the vesting threshold for the 2014 awards should be set at a lower level of performance than was applicable for the 2013 awards.
Thus the vesting threshold for EPS growth above global GDP for the 2014 awards is at 3% above global GDP growth rather than the 7% threshold used for awards made in 2013.
In order for maximum payouts to be achieved the same stretching target of EPS growth of 15% above global GDP has been maintained.
The 2015 awards will be made on the same basis.

The performance targets applicable to these awards are as follows: Vesuvius Share Plan performance targets TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts annual compound headline EPS growth above global GDP Vesting percentage Vesting percentage Below median 0% Below 3% 0% Median 12.50% 3% 12.50% Upper quintile 50% At or above 15% 50% Between median and Pro rata between Between 3% and 15% Pro rata between upper quintile 12.5% and 50% 12.5% and 50% Vesuvius Performance Share award allocations The following Performance Share awards were allocated in 2013 and 2014 under the Vesuvius Share Plan: Additional Total share shares Shares allocations allocated vested Total share Grant and type as at during during allocation Performance Earliest of award 31 Dec 2013 the year the year 31 Dec 2014 period vesting date Franois Wanecq 1 22 april 2013 Performance shares 341,509 341,509 1 Jan 13 22 Apr 2016 31 Dec 15 2 17 march 2014 Performance shares 253,748 253,748 1 Jan 14 17 Mar 2017 31 Dec 16 Total 341,509 253,748 595,257 chris OShea 1 22 april 2013 Performance shares 211,115 211,115 1 Jan 13 22 Apr 2016 31 Dec 15 2 17 march 2014 Performance shares 156,862 156,862 1 Jan 14 17 Mar 2017 31 Dec 16 Total 211,115 156,682 367,977 NOTES 1.
In 2013 Franois Wanecq and Chris OShea received potential maximum allocations of Performance Shares worth two times their base salaries, being 341,509 shares and 211,115 shares respectively.
In 2014 Franois Wanecq and Chris OShea received potential maximum allocations of Performance Shares worth two times their base salaries, being 253,748 shares and 156,862 shares respectively.
These allocations were made on 17 March 2014 and were calculated based upon the average closing mid-market price of Vesuvius shares on the five dealing days before the awards were made, being 433.5 pence.
The total value of Chris OSheas award on the date of grant was therefore 679,997 and Franois Wanecqs 1,099,998.
12.5% of this award would vest if the threshold level of one of the two performance targets is met.
These awards have been made in the form of nil cost options with no exercise price.
The Remuneration Committee also has the discretion to award cash or shares equivalent in value to the dividend that would have accrued during the vesting period on any awards that vest.
The mid-market closing price of Vesuvius shares ranged between 400p and 497.6p during 2014 and on 31 December 2014 was 446.2p.
82 Vesuvius plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Section Four: Governance Annual Directors remuneration report continued cookson LTIP allocations Following the demerger of Cookson Group plc, Franois Wanecq retained an entitlement to allocations of Performance and Matching Shares made under the Cookson Long Term Incentive Plan.
His entitlement to shares in Cookson Group plc was rolled over into Vesuvius plc shares.
The vesting of these awards is based 50% upon relative TSR performance and 50% on headline EPS performance.
Performance is measured by reference to Cookson performance up to the demerger effective date 19 December 2012 and Vesuvius performance thereafter.
The performance period applicable to the awards made in 2012 ended on 31 December 2014.
Cookson and Vesuvius TSR performance during this three-year performance period was assessed against the comparator group and it was determined that the Companys performance was between median and upper quintile, a level which results in the vesting of 26.9% out of a maximum of 50% of Performance Share awards and Matching Share awards vesting at a ratio of 0.586:1.
Following the demerger, the threshold 2014 EPS target, as previously reported, was set at 50.4p.
Headline EPS for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 33.4p.
As a result no Performance or Matching Share awards will vest under the EPS performance element.
Prior to the vesting of any award, the Committee stipulates that, as an additional hurdle, it needs to be satisfied that vesting has been justified by the underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period.
Having carefully considered the Groups performance over the three-year period, and taking into account the significant improvement in the Groups financial results including the Groups revenue, trading profit, return on sales margins, and profit before tax the Committee concluded that the vesting of the 2012 LTIP awards is justified by the underlying financial performance of the Group.
In addition the Remuneration Committee has determined that participants in the 2012 Cookson Long Term Incentive Plan should receive the dividends that would have been paid on the number of shares that vest in respect of dividend record dates occurring during the period between the award date and the date of vesting.

The performance period for the LTIP awards made in 2011 ended on 31 December 2013.
The TSR performance was based upon Cooksons TSR from 1 January 2011 to 18December 2012 to which was added the Vesuvius TSR from 19 December 2012 to 31 December 2013 for a combined figure, being 84.3% between median and upper quintile, which allowed vesting of 28.4% of the Performance Share Award and 0.621:1 for the Matching Share Award.
Following the demerger, the 2013 EPS target, as previously reported, was set at 48.6p at threshold.
Headline EPS for the year ended 31 December 2013 was 31.9p.
Hence there was no vesting of either the Performance Share Award or the Matching Share Award for EPS performance.
A further award of shares was made to Franois Wanecq on the vesting of his award to cover the dividends accrued between the date of grant and the date of vesting in accordance with the rules of the Plan.
42,105 Performance Shares and 91,752 Matching Shares vested to Franois Wanecq on 1April 2014 and an additional 16,905 shares were transferred to him in respect of the dividend accrual.
The mid-market closing price of the Companys shares on the date of vesting was 4.355 and the total value of the 150,762 shares that Franois Wanecq received on the date of vesting was therefore 656,569.
The performance period for the LTIP awards made in 2012 ended on 31 December 2014.
In accordance with the Companys achievement of the specified performance conditions, 26.9% of Franois Wanecqs Performance Share awards are expected to vest on 7 April 2015, and his Matching Shares will vest at a ratio of 0.586:1.
In addition the Remuneration Committee has determined that Mr Wanecq will receive a cash payment of 29,000 which is equivalent to the value of the dividends that would have been paid on the number of shares that vest in respect of dividend record dates occurring during the period between the award date and the date of vesting.
Governance 83 Restricted Share award On joining the Company Chris OShea received a Restricted Share award with a face value of 100% of base salary.
Half of the award vested on the first anniversary of his date of joining and the remainder a year later.
Vesting of the shares was subject to him remaining employed by the Company and not under notice of termination.
No other performance conditions applied to this award.
Details of the portion of the Restricted share award that remained outstanding as at 31 December 2013, as adjusted for the demerger from awards over Cookson Group plc shares into awards over shares in Vesuvius plc are given in the table below: Total share Additional Total share Market price of the allocations shares allocations shares on the day as at allocated as at before award Earliest 31 Dec during Shares vested 31 Dec as adjusted for the vesting 1 Date of award 2013 the year during the year 2014 demerger p date 5 November 2012 Restricted Share award 54,403 3,914 58,317 312.48 11 Oct 2014 NOTES 1.
54,403 shares vested to Chris OShea on 20 October 2014.
An additional 3,914 shares were transferred to him in respect of the dividend accrual.
