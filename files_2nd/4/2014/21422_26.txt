No non-executive director participates in the groups incentive arrangements or pension plan.
Basic fee Payment of a basic annual fee Additional Additional fees are paid to reflect additional responsibilities of certain non-executive directors, as follows: fees senior independent director audit and risk committee chairman remuneration committee chairman subsidiary board membership and chairmanship fees.
Expenses incurred in the performance of non-executive duties for the company may be reimbursed or paid for directly by the company, including any tax due on the expenses.
Total fees paid to non-executive directors will remain within the limit stated in the Articles of Association.
Clawback of awards via malus may apply where stated in the above table.
Other elements of remuneration are not subject to recovery provisions.
Note: Accurate at 26 March 2014 when the policy report was approved.
Following approval further reclaim provisions have been implemented.
The committee may increase the proportion of bonus deferred into shares at any time.
LTIP and MSIP share awards shall be operated in accordance with the rules of the plan as approved by shareholders.
In accordance with those rules the committee has discretion in the following areas: in the event of a variation of Beazleys share capital or a demerger, delisting, special dividend, rights issue or other similar event, which may, in the committees opinion, affect the current or future value of shares, the number of shares subject to an award and or any performance condition attached to awards, may be adjusted.
Awards under Beazleys other share plans have similar adjustment provisions: the committee may determine that awards may be settled in cash: the committee may substitute or amend a performance condition if one or more events occur which cause the committee to consider that a substituted or amended condition would be more appropriate and would not be materially more or less difficult to satisfy: and the committee may determine the basis on which dividends will be calculated which may include notional reinvestment.
The committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out in this report where the terms of the payment were agreed before the policy came into effect, or at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the company and, in the opinion of the committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the company.
For these purposes payments includes the committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an award over shares is agreed at the time the award is granted.
Performance measures and targets Annual bonus plan The pool calculation is based on the profit and ROE results for the financial year whilst the committee exercises its own judgement on the level of individual bonus awards.
The committee believes this approach to the determination of bonuses creates alignment to shareholders interests and ensures that bonuses are affordable, while the ROE targets increase the performance gearing.
The committee reviews the bonus pool framework each year to ensure that it remains appropriate and targets are set taking into account the prevailing environment, interest rates and expected investment returns, headcount and any other relevant factors.
Investment in underwriting The Beazley staff underwriting plan provides for participants to contribute personal capital to Beazley syndicates.
Selected staff are invited to participate through bonus deferral with an element of cash incentives at risk as capital commitments.
Long term incentive plan The long term incentive plan performance measure and targets are chosen to align with value creation for shareholders.
Long term incentive plan awards are based on growth in net asset value per share NAVps.
This creates alignment to one of Beazleys key performance indicators.
com 88 Beazley Annual report 2014 Directors remuneration report continued The committee reviews the NAVps targets periodically to ensure they remain appropriate with reference to the internal business plan, the external environment and market practice.
In the event that NAVps were to become unsuitable as a performance measure in the opinion of the committee for example due to a change in accounting standards the committee would substitute a measure which followed broadly similar principles.
Differences in policy from broader employee population The policy for executive directors follows the same broad principles in place for all employees in Beazley.
Differences in policy for executive directors and senior management as compared to the broader employee population reflect different market levels for seniority, as well as their group responsibilities.
For example, incentive performance conditions for executive directors and senior management are more closely aligned to group performance, whereas underwriters participate in incentive plans linked to the performance of their business area.
All employees in the group may participate in a defined contribution pension plan, and are offered benefits such as private medical insurance and permanent health insurance.
Beazley also operates all-employee share plans to create staff alignment and promote a sense of ownership.
Illustrations of application of remuneration policy The charts below set out an illustration of the remuneration policy for 2014 in line with the remuneration policy above and include base salary, pension, benefits and incentives.
Note that, as prescribed by the legislation, the illustrations are based on initial award value and therefore do not reflect potential share price growth or any dividends received over deferral periods, which may impact the overall value of deferred annual and long term remuneration delivered.

com 88 Beazley Annual report 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Beazley Annual report 2014 89 Approach to recruitment remuneration The committee would have regard to the following principles when agreeing the components of a remuneration package upon the recruitment of a new director: in order to facilitate the future success of the company it is important that we are able to recruit directors of the calibre required to deliver our strategic priorities.
Although the company operates in a highly competitive market for executive talent, the committee remains conscious of the need to avoid paying more than is necessary on recruitment: the committee will, so far as practical, seek to align the remuneration package for any incoming executive with the policy set out in the table on page 88: on recruitment salaries will be set to take into account role and responsibilities.
For interim positions a cash supplement may be paid rather than salary for example a non-executive director taking on an executive function on a short term basis : the committee may, on appointing an executive director, need to buy out remuneration arrangements forfeited on joining the company: any buyout would take into account the terms of the arrangements e. g. form of award, performance conditions, timeframe being forfeited in the previous package.
The form of any award would be determined at the time and the committee may if necessary make use of LR 9.4.
2 of the Listing Rules for the purpose of buyout awards only.
The committee would seek to structure buyout awards to be in line with Beazleys remuneration framework so far as practical.
The overriding principle will be that any replacement buyout awards would be of comparable commercial value to the awards which have been forfeited: all buyout awards would normally be liable to forfeiture or clawback on early departure.
For executive directors early departure is defined as being within the first two years of employment: the maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted in the first year excluding buyouts is in line with the aggregate maximums set out in the policy table.
The committee retains the flexibility to determine that for the first year of appointment any annual bonus award will be subject to such conditions as it may determine: and where an executive is appointed from within the organisation, the normal policy of the company is that any legacy arrangements would be honoured in line with the original terms and conditions.
Similarly, if an executive director is appointed following Beazleys acquisition of or merger with another company, legacy terms and conditions would be honoured.
Service contracts and loss of office payment policy Executive directors have service contracts with Beazley Management Limited.
In June 2009, following the redomiciliation to Ireland, the directors were issued with new service contracts from Beazley Management Limited and appointment letters as directors of Beazley plc.
It is company policy that such service contracts with executive directors contain notice periods, from the company or employee, of not more than 12 months.
The company may at its absolute discretion elect to terminate an executive directors employment by making a payment in lieu of notice of the individuals salary for that period.
Subject to these notice requirements, there is no provision in the service agreements for compensation to be payable on early termination of the contract.
The committee has discretion to structure any compensation payments in such a way as it deems appropriate taking into account the circumstances of departure.
Any payments of compensation will be subject to negotiation and the group policy includes consideration of appropriate mitigation, including phasing of payments.
The current contracts in place for executive directors are as follows: Date of contract M L Bride 9 Jun 2009 A P Cox 6 Dec 2010 D A Horton 9 Jun 2009 N P Maidment 9 Jun 2009 C A Washbourn 9 Jun 2009 The notice period for each of the above contracts is 12 months.
There is no unexpired term as each of the executive directors contracts is on a rolling basis.
com 90 Beazley Annual report 2014 Directors remuneration report continued In the event of a directors departure any outstanding share awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules.
The following principles apply for the treatment of remuneration elements following loss of office for a director: Remuneration element Treatment upon loss of office Bonus There is no automatic entitlement to annual bonus.
Taking into account the circumstances of leaving, the committee retains the discretion to award a bonus in respect of performance in the financial year with appropriate consideration of time pro-rating.
Deferred shares If a director ceases office or employment with the group any unvested awards will lapse unless the individual is a good leaver.
Good leaver circumstances are cessation by reason of injury, ill-health, permanent disability or retirement with the agreement of the employing company and, if the committee so determines, redundancy, the sale of the individuals employing company or business out of the group, or such other circumstances as the committee may determine.
In these good leaver circumstances awards may vest in full or be time pro-rated, and be delivered on cessation or at the normal time.
If a director dies his or her awards will vest in full.
Conditional shares For the conditional awards made at the time of M L Brides recruitment, good leaver circumstances are as for deferred shares above except that the committee may determine the extent and the terms on which shares may vest.

If a participant dies his or her personal representatives may exercise his or her awards.
Good leavers are those participants who leave by reason of injury, ill-health, disability, retirement with the agreement of the employing company, the sale of the individuals employing company or business out of the group or such other circumstances as the committee may determine.
For good leavers awards are time pro-rated and the performance condition is tested at cessation.
2012 LTIP and MSIP If a director ceases office or employment with the group any unvested awards will lapse unless the individual is a good leaver.
An individual is a good leaver if employment ceases because of death, ill-health, injury, disability, the sale of the individuals employing company or business out of the group or for any other reason at the committees discretion except where a participant is dismissed lawfully without notice.
Awards will vest on the normal vesting date, unless the committee determines that awards should vest at the time the individual ceases employment.
If the participant dies awards will vest as soon as practicable after the date of death.
Awards will vest taking into account the satisfaction of any performance condition and, unless the committee determines otherwise, the period of time that has elapsed since the award was granted until the date of cessation of employment.
Pension The director will be eligible to receive the standard 15% of salary contribution to the defined contribution pension plan during the notice period, or cash equivalent.
Under the Beazley Furlonge Limited Final Salary Pension Scheme, on early retirement the director receives a pension which is reduced to reflect early payment in accordance with the rules of the scheme.

Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the company As part of the regular cycle, the committee is informed of pay and employment conditions of wider employees in the group and takes these into account when determining the remuneration for executive directors.
While the review includes various statistics on the outcome of the wider employee pay review, the review does not currently include any direct comparison measures between executive directors and wider employee pay.
The company does not consult with employees on executive director remuneration.
Consideration of shareholders views The remuneration committee also regularly reviews guidance from shareholder advisory bodies such as the Investment Association, NAPF and ISS.
Recent changes to our policy such as the introduction of a bonus cap have been incorporated into Beazleys policies as a result of these reviews.
The committee undertook a gap analysis of Beazley policy against the guidance from these bodies in May 2013.
The committee has consulted with shareholders on a number of occasions regarding remuneration policy, and shareholder views were taken into account during the formulation of policy.
Minor changes The committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax, or administrative purposes, or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for such amendments.
Annual remuneration report This part of the report sets out the remuneration out-turns for 2014 and how these relate to our performance in the year as well as details of the operation of our policy for 2015.
Remuneration principles The remuneration committee has oversight of the remuneration policy.
The general philosophy underlying the reward strategy for executive directors is the same as that applied to all other employees.
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and data on comparable positions in other similar organisations are taken into consideration when determining executive directors remuneration.
The main aim of the policy is to ensure that management and staff are remunerated fairly and in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualified personnel.
We believe that: performance-related remuneration is an essential motivation to management and staff and should be structured to ensure that executives interests are aligned with those of shareholders: individual rewards should reflect the group objectives but be dependent on the profitability of the group and should be appropriately balanced against risk considerations: the structures of packages should support meritocracy, an important part of Beazleys culture: reward potentials should be market-competitive: and executives pay should include an element of downside risk.

The committee continues to review remuneration against various guidelines and to monitor developments.
The chief risk officer reports annually to the remuneration committee on risk and remuneration as part of the regular agenda.
The committee believes the group is adopting an approach which is consistent with and takes account of the risk profile of the group.
We believe reward at Beazley is appropriately balanced in light of risk considerations, particularly taking into account the following features: Features aligned with risk considerations Share deferral A portion of bonus is normally deferred into shares for three years.
These deferred shares, together with shares awarded under the LTIP, mean that a significant portion of total remuneration is delivered in the form of shares deferred for a period of years.
Extended performance A portion of the LTIP has performance measured over an extended five-year period, in line with the periods Walker recommendations and FCA guidelines.
Shareholding Executive directors are expected to build up and maintain a shareholding of 150% of salary requirements 200% for the CEO.
Investment in Management and underwriters may defer part of their bonuses into the Beazley staff underwriting underwriting plan, providing alignment with capital providers.
Capital commitments can be lost if underwriting performance is poor.
Underwriters Under the profit related bonus plan payments are aligned with the timing of profits achieved on the remuneration aligned account.
For long tail accounts this may be in excess of six years.
with profit achieved If the account deteriorates then payouts are clawed back through adjustments to future payments.
From 2012 onwards any new profit related pay plans may be at risk of forfeiture or reduction if, in the opinion of the remuneration committee, there has been a serious regulatory breach by the underwriter concerned, including in relation to the groups policy on conduct risk.
Clawback and malus of For deferred share awards and LTIP awards from 2012 malus provisions were introduced.
For LTIP deferred and LTIP shares awards from 2015 and deferred shares in respect of 2015, clawback provisions will also apply.

The figures in the table reflect the following: salaries for 2014 increased by an average of 2.2% which was below the average increase for all-employees: annual bonus out-turns were generally lower than last year.
Although Beazley delivered another strong performance in 2014, ROE was lower: and the increase in total remuneration in 2014 reflects the impact of the 5 year LTIP tranche vesting for the first time as explained on the next page.

Salary The committee reviews salaries annually taking into consideration any changes in role and responsibilities, development of the individual in the role and levels in comparable positions in similar financial service companies.
It also considers the performance of the group and the individual as well as the average salary increase for employees across the whole group.
Salary reviews take place in December of each year, with new salaries effective from 1 January.
The average salary increase in 2014 for executive directors was 2.2%, which was below the average salary increases across the group.
For 2015, the average salary increase for executive directors is 1.1%, which was below the average salary increases across the group.

Annual bonus plans The enterprise bonus plan is a discretionary plan in which all employees are eligible to participate.
The framework for determining bonuses is as follows: a percentage of profit is allocated to a bonus pool subject to a minimum group return on equity: and the percentage of profit increases for higher levels of return on equity.
Recommended awards to individuals from the available pool are then determined by taking into account performance based on each individuals contribution to the group including a review of performance against individual objectives.
For heads of the business divisions divisional performance is also taken into account.
The bonus is discretionary and, rather than a prescriptive formulaic framework, the committee considers wider factors in its deliberations at the end of the year, for example quality of profit and risk considerations.
In determination of awards, the committee will not necessarily award the enterprise bonus pool in aggregate i. e. the sum of the bonus awards may be less than the enterprise bonus pool.
For heads of divisions a bonus may be awarded outside of the incentive pool in circumstances where the performance of a division in relation to the group is very strong.
The approach to the calculation of bonuses is aligned to shareholders interests and ensures that bonuses are affordable, while the ROE targets increase the performance gearing.
The committee reviews the bonus pool framework each year to ensure it remains appropriate, taking into account the prevailing environment, interest rates and expected investment returns, headcount and any other relevant factors.
Performance out-turn for 2014 For 2014, the process for determining bonuses was as follows: ROE for 2014 was 17% and the overall enterprise bonus pool in which executive directors as well as other senior employees participate was calculated based on this.
The risk-free return was set at 1% taking into account the yield on US treasuries of two to five year maturities: the committee then considered the individual bonus award for the executive directors and other senior employees within the committees remit.
In determining the bonus award for each individual the committee took into account the individuals contribution including, where relevant, the performance of their division: and in considering individual awards in respect of executive directors for 2014, the committee had regard to the following broad framework: ROE performance hurdles Guideline illustrative bonus award as a % of maximum RFR 0% These are indicative only and based on broad group results.
Within the pool framework bonus out-turns RFR 3% 12.5% may be higher or lower taking into account divisional, RFR 10% 37.5% strategic and personal performance.
com 96 Beazley Annual report 2014 Directors remuneration report continued The framework on page 95 is used by the committee as a broad guideline rather than being formulaic and applies to a broader group of executives than board directors.
A key principle of the process is that the committee exercises its judgement in determining individual awards taking into account the individuals contribution and performance.
In particular, there may be a diverse spread of returns earned across the various divisions within the business which will be reflected in bonus out-turns achieved.
Corporate achievements for the year included the following: the delivery of profit after tax of $217.8m, and the return of $212.6m to shareholders by way of dividends: delivery of growth in our gross premiums written of 3% in a market where premium rates were under increasing pressure: acceleration of growth in the US in line with our strategic objective, where gross premiums written grew 19% in 2014: and continued focus on attracting and retaining the best talent, with the recruitment of some of the top underwriting talent within the property market to succeed Jonathan Gray and strengthen the team.
While the specific individual objectives of the executive directors are considered commercially sensitive the following provides details of some of the executive director achievements which the committee took into account: the marine division continues to consistently deliver excellent levels of profit whilst diversifying the portfolio through the attraction of new underwriters: the US strategic initiative has benefited from increased leadership and focus, with US onshore premiums increasing from $451.8m in 2013 to $537.0m in 2014: and continued effort on Solvency II has ensured we are well placed for the new risk and capital framework that is due to be implemented in 2016.

The deferral will range from 0% to 37.5% dependent on the level of bonus.
Deferred shares are generally subject to continued employment.
Deferred share awards include a malus provision.
A portion of bonus may also be deferred under the investment in underwriting plan, and this capital can be lost if underwriting performance is poor.
No such deferral was made in 2014 see investment in underwriting on page 99 for further details.
For 2014, the portion of each directors annual bonus deferred into shares was as follows: Deferred into shares M L Bride 240,000 A P Cox 300,000 D A Horton 390,000 N P Maidment 300,000 C A Washbourn 300,000 Long-term incentive plan LTIP Under the LTIP, executive directors, senior management and underwriters receive awards of shares subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions measured over three and five years.
The key features of the plan are as follows: 50% of the award is measured after three years and 50% after five years: awards are in the form of nil-cost options with a ten-year term: and participants are expected to build a shareholding in Beazley equal to their annual award level.
For example the CEO has a shareholding requirement of 200% of salary.
Participants have three years to build this shareholding.
Given the five year performance period for 50% of the award, as well as the significant shareholding requirement and additional clawback provisions which extend to seven years from date of award, the committee considers that the LTIP is significantly aligned to long term performance.
Against that background it does not consider that further holding periods are required.
Vesting of awards is based on growth in net asset value per share NAVps, one of Beazleys key performance indicators.
The committee considers the LTIP NAVps growth targets to be very stretching, particularly taking into account that growth must be over a sustained three and five year period.
Growth in NAVps is calculated taking into account any payment of dividends by the company.
In line with our reporting to shareholders, NAVps is denominated in US dollars.
The targets are equivalent to those that applied in 2012. www.

Investment in underwriting Traditionally, Lloyds underwriters contributed their personal capital to syndicates in which they worked.
With the move to corporate provision of capital, individual membership of Lloyds has declined significantly.
The committee feels that having personal capital at risk in the syndicate is an important part of the remuneration policy and provides a healthy counterbalance to incentivisation through bonuses and long term incentive awards.
The company has operated the Beazley Staff Underwriting Plan for this purpose since 2004 and executive directors and other selected staff are invited to participate through bonus deferral with an element of their cash incentives at risk as capital commitments.
These capital commitments can be lost in full if underwriting performance is poor.
The group funds the capital for the plan.
The individual capital commitment is then funded through individual bonus deferral.
The aim is for individuals to fund their capital within three years.
To date over 200 employees of the group have committed to put at risk 9.6m of bonuses to the underwriting results of syndicate 623.
Of the total at risk, 8.4m has already been deferred from the bonuses awarded.

Malus and clawback For incentives in respect of 2015 new clawback provisions will operate.
Under these provisions the committee has the discretion to require clawback in certain circumstances for a defined period following payment or vesting.
Annual bonus and LTIP awards may be subject to clawback in the event of: material misstatement of results: gross misconduct: and factual error in calculating vesting or award.
Annual bonus awards may be subject to clawback for a period of three years following payment of the cash bonus.
These clawback provisions will also extend to any deferred shares delivered before the end of the three year period and to the notional investment where the bonus is voluntarily deferred as notional capital into the investment in underwriting plan excluding any returns on the investment which will not be subject to clawback.
LTIP awards may be subject to clawback for a period of two years following vesting.
Malus provisions have applied to the LTIP and deferred share plan for a number of years.
The committee has the discretion to reduce or withhold an award in circumstances of: conduct which justifies summary dismissal: an exceptional development which has a material adverse impact on the company, including but not limited to reputational damage, material failure of risk management, a material misstatement or any significant sanction from a government agency or regulatory authority: or where the committee considers it is necessary to comply with a law or regulatory requirement.
Pensions The pension benefits for directors and staff are provided by way of a defined contribution scheme arranged through Fidelity, which is non-contributory.
The company contributes 15% of salary for directors.
Following changes to pension tax legislation that came into force from April 2011, an equivalent cash alternative may be offered if an individual exceeds the lifetime or annual allowance.
Prior to 31 March 2006 the company provided pension entitlements to directors that are defined benefit in nature, based on its legacy policy under the Beazley Furlonge Limited Final Salary Pension Scheme.
Future service accruals ceased on 31 March 2006.
Only base salary is pensionable, subject to an earnings cap.
The normal retirement age for pension calculation purposes is 60 years.
A spouses pension is the equivalent of two-thirds of the members pension before any commutation payable on the members death after retirement.

Payments for loss of office No loss of office payments have been made in the year.
External appointments Andrew Horton has been appointed as a non-executive director of Man Group plc, with effect from 3 August 2013, and he retains the fees in respect of this appointment.
Non-executive directors fees The fees of non-executive directors are determined by the board.
When setting fee levels consideration is given to levels in comparable companies for comparable services in addition to the time commitment and responsibilities of the individual director.
No non-executive director is involved in the determination of their fees.
The board reviews fees annually.
Non-executive directors are appointed for fixed terms, normally for three years, and may be reappointed for future terms.
Non-executive directors are typically appointed through a selection process that assesses whether the candidate brings the desired competencies and skills to the group.
The board has identified several key competencies for non-executive directors to complement the existing skill-set of the executive directors.
These competencies may include: insurance sector expertise: asset management skills: public company and corporate governance experience: risk management skills: finance skills: and IT and operations skills.
Beazley operates across Lloyds and the US markets through a variety of legal entities and structures.
Non-executive directors, in addition to the plc board, typically sit on either one of our key subsidiary boards, i. e. BFL, our managing agency at Lloyds, or Beazley Re Limited, our reinsurance company.
As a result of developments in regulation, the degree of autonomy in the operation of each board has increased in recent years, with a consequent increase in time commitment and scope of the role.
Approach to remuneration for employees other than directors The committee also has oversight of remuneration arrangements elsewhere in the group.

com 102 Beazley Annual report 2014 Directors remuneration report continued Underwriter bonus plan profit related pay plan Underwriters participate in a profit related pay plan based upon the profitability of their underwriting account.
Executive directors do not participate in this plan.
The objective of the plan is to align the interests of the group and the individual through aligning an underwriters reward to the long term profitability of their portfolio.
Underwriters who have significant influence over a portfolio may be offered awards under the plan.
There is no automatic eligibility.
Profit related pay is awarded irrespective of the results of the group.
This bonus is awarded as cash and is based upon a fixed proportion of profit achieved on the relevant underwriting account as measured at three years and later.
Any movements in prior years are reflected in future year payments as the accounts develop after three years.
For long-tail accounts the class is still relatively immature at the three-year stage and therefore payments will be modest.
Underwriters may receive further payouts in years four, five and six and even later as the account matures.
Therefore each year they could be receiving payouts in relation to multiple underwriting years.
If the account deteriorates as it develops any payouts are clawed back through reductions in future profit related pay bonuses.
From 2012 onwards any new profit related pay plans may be at risk of forfeiture or reduction if, in the opinion of the remuneration committee, there has been a serious regulatory breach by the underwriter concerned, including the groups policy on conduct risk.
The fixed proportion is calculated based upon profit targets which are set through the business planning process and reviewed by a committee formed of executive committee members and functional specialists including the group actuary.
Underwriting risk is taken into account when setting profit targets.
In addition to profit related pay, underwriters are also eligible to receive a discretionary bonus, based upon performance, from the enterprise bonus pool.
A proportion of this bonus may be paid in deferred shares, which vest after three years subject to continued employment.
Support bonus plan Employees who are not members of the executive and who do not participate in the underwriters profit related pay plan participate in a discretionary bonus pool.
This pool provides the employees with a discretionary award of an annual performance bonus that reflects overall individual performance including meeting annual objectives.
A proportion of this award may also be dependent on the groups return on equity and therefore allocated from the enterprise bonus pool.
SAYE The company operates an HMRC-approved SAYE scheme for the benefit of UK-based employees.
The scheme offers a three-year savings contract period with options being offered at a 20% discount to the share price on grant.
Monthly contributions are made through payroll deduction on behalf of participating employees.
US SAYE The Beazley plc savings-related share option plan for US employees permits all eligible US-based employees to purchase shares of Beazley plc at a discount of up to 15% to the shares fair market value.
Participants may exercise options after a two-year period.
The plan is compliant with the terms of Section 423 of the US Internal Revenue Code and is similar to the SAYE scheme operated for UK-based Beazley employees.
Retention shares The retention plan may be used for recruitment or retention purposes.
Any awards vest at 25% per annum over years three to six.
Policy going forward is that existing executive directors do not participate in this plan and no executive directors have subsisting legacy awards outstanding.

The committee met six times during the year.
The committee considers the individual remuneration packages of the chief executive, executive directors and executive committee members.
It also has oversight of the salary and bonus awards of individuals outside the executive committee who either directly report to executive committee members or who have basic salaries over 200,000, as well as the overall bonus pool and total incentives paid by the group.
The terms of reference of the committee are available on the companys website.
During the year the committee was advised by remuneration consultants from Deloitte LLP.
Total fees in relation to executive remuneration consulting were 122,600.
