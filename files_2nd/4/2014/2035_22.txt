These may include, but are not limited to, revenue and profit generation.
Each metric will reflect how well the Group is growing the business.
Measure Link to strategy The use of revenue aligns with our strategic objectives of widening the range of products and services that REVENUE we offer, attracting new customers, increasing the activity of existing customers, and building our market share in all regions in which we operate.
The use of a profit based measure, such as EBITDA, alongside revenue helps ensure a balance between PROFIT growth and profitability.
EBITDA measures the underlying profits generated by the business and whether management is converting growth into profits effectively.
Individual objectives measure whether management is delivering against stated key business and personal PERSONAL targets which are linked to the corporate strategy.
In setting financial parameters, the Committee takes into account the Companys internal budgets and, where applicable, investors expectations.
The targets applying to financial measures are based on a sliding scale.
LTIP For the Companys long-term plans, awards vest subject to delivering against measures which are aligned with the long-term levels ofreturn targeted by the Company which may include relative TSR, EPS and Group Revenue.
Measure Link to strategy TSR provides a clear alignment between the value created for shareholders and the reward earned TOTAL SHAREHOLDER by Executives.
RETURN EPS captures the long-term growth in earnings, which is most closely aligned to the overall financial EARNINGS PER SHARE performance expected by shareholders.
Revenue targets ensure top line growth is being generated from new markets and through the widening GROUP REVENUE of our product offering.
Additional measures which are linked to the business strategy at the time may also be used.
Targets are set based on a sliding scale that takes account of internal planning and external market expectations for the Company.
How Executive pay compares to other employees The Committee receives an overview of the reward structure and quantum applying to the whole employee population on a periodic basis from the HR Director.
The information presented is taken into consideration when setting the pay levels of Executive Directors andother senior executives.
At other levels of the Group, employees will receive a remuneration package that is reflective of their role and responsibilities, set by reference to internal relativities and external market data where applicable.
Employees at the Executive level will typically have a greater emphasis on performance-related and long-term pay compared to those below this level.
Annual incentives may be payable based on performance measures which are suitable to the nature and responsibility of the role.

A description of the Companys performance is included in the Financial Review on pages 21 to 24.
With regard to the CEO, his personal objectives included, but were not limited to, growing business profitability, focusing on customer acquisition and developing a high performance culture.
The CFOs objectives included, but were not limited to, strengthening internal controls and financial processes, and focusing on our investors.
Performance against the objectives is assessed by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year with input from the Chairman and CEO as appropriate.
In light of performance against the objectives set, the Remuneration Committee awarded bonuses as outlined in the table above.

Long Term Incentive Plan awards vesting in the year audited The current Executive Directors have no LTIP awards with performance periods ending in the year to 30 April 2014.
The performance period for the 2011 LTIP scheme ended on 30 April 2014.
There are 21 participants with interests in the 2011 LTIP, of whom one, Stephen Morana, was a former Executive Director until 3 December 2012 but remained an employee until 31 March 2013.
As disclosed in last years report, Stephen Morana was treated as a good leaver and his interests in the 2011 LTIP are disclosed below.
The 2011 awards were subject to performance measures, with 50% based on EPS and 50% on Revenue targets for FY14.
In line with the plan documentation, the Committee, at its discretion, has the ability to adjust the targets that were originally set to reflect any material changes in, for example, regulatory outcomes relative to the scenario envisaged when setting the targets and reporting definitions or accounting policies.
In respect of the targets applying to the 2011 awards, the Committee has used its discretion to adjust the EPS and Revenue targets that were originally set to reflect: the decision to exit from Greece due to unacceptable levels of legal risk and to withdraw the Exchange from Germany due to the introduction of a turnover tax: the withdrawal of Betfairs Exchange from Spain following new regulations introduced in June 2012: changes to the regulatory timetable regarding the introduction of exchanges in Italy: and in respect of EPS only, a change to accounting definitions which now deducts IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment charges from profit.
The Committee is satisfied that the adjustments are a result of external factors that were unforeseen, outside the control of management and result in targets that are no less or more challenging than the targets that were originally set.
The revised targets and performance against them are set out below: FY14 Revenue FY14 EPS % of relevant part of the award that vests Original Revised Original Revised 567.5m 512.4m 67.9p 50.6p Maximum 100% 540.5m 488.7m 56.6p 40.0p Target 66.7% 470.2m 426.7m 51.7p 36.8p Threshold 6.7% For performance between the Threshold, Target and Maximum a curved vesting schedule applied as below: 100% 100% 75% 75% 50% 50% 25% 25% 0% 0% 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 420 440 460 480 500 520 FY14 EPS pence FY14 Revenue m Based on FY14 Revenue of 393.6m and EPS of 49.0p, 48.33% of Stephen Moranas awards will vest.
