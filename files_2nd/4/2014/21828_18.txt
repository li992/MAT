Governance Directors Remuneration Report We are seeking to improve the remuneration systems and how we reward the right behaviours among our people to ensure alignment Paul Wilson to the corporate strategy.
Non-Executive Director Remuneration Committee Chairmans overview As recently appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the report on the work of the Committee during the 2013 14 financial year.
We view the remuneration strategy and approach of Brewin Dolphin as an important part of our successful commercial strategy as a firm.
As we constantly seek to improve our marketplace performance and improve the service we provide to clients, so we are seeking to improve the remuneration systems and how we reward the right behaviours among our people.
The Committee made important changes to the Executive Directors Remuneration Policy last year including the introduction of a Long-term Incentive Plan with performance targets linked to profitability and operating margin, accompanied by a reduction in the maximum annual bonus payable to Executive Directors.
These changes were designed to ensure that incentive arrangements had clear and stretching targets which were aligned to the Groups strategy and the long-term interests of shareholders.
The Group has delivered strongly on its profitability and efficiency targets for the year however there were also challenges and this has been reflected in the annual variable remuneration awarded to the Executive Directors.
More details of these targets and the Committees assessment oftheExecutive Directors performance are set out on page 58 of this report.
Building on the work done last year to align executives Remuneration Policy with Group strategy, the Committee has been focused this year on reviewing similarly our wider remuneration strategy.
Through a dedicated remuneration strategy session, the Committee explored all aspects of the Groups remuneration policies, including talent and performance management programmes, remuneration package components, regulation and the role of the Committee.
This review highlighted areas of the firms people and remuneration strategy that need development and these changes will be our focus for the coming year.
There will be a particular focus on strengthening the link between performance and reward throughout the firm taking into account a broad range of factors that contribute to overall performance, such as client service.
Our regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority FCA, have strong views on the remuneration policy of financial services firms.
In particular, they believe our policies should ensure that variable remuneration awards are conditional, discretionary and contingent upon achieving sustainable and risk-adjusted performance.
The FCA has issued guidance on the application of malus and clawback to variable remuneration and changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code include the requirement that variable remuneration schemes include provisions that would enable the Company to recover sums paid or withhold the payment of any sum in certain circumstances.
It is clear that the pressure on companies to effectively address this issue is increasing and this is something that we have addressed by revising our share incentive plan rules to ensure that malus provisions are incorporated consistently and the policy for applying them is clear.
We have more to do, however.
There is also increasing focus from the FCA on how a firms remuneration policies affect conduct risk and this is something that the Committee will also work on in the coming year.
The Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and is unchanged.
It has been included for information.
The remainder of this report explains this policy and how the policy has been applied by the Committee during the year.
52 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Overview 2 Strategic Report 6 Governance 34 Financial Statements 76 Additional Information 125 Directors Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM This section of the Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with Part 4 of The Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
It sets out the Directors Remuneration Policy for the Group.
The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, executive remuneration guidelines produced by shareholder organisations, and the remuneration principles of the FCAs Remuneration Code so far as they apply to the Group.
Overview The Committee has full delegated responsibility for determining individual total remuneration for the Board Chairman, Executive Directors, members of the Executive Committee and any other employees designated as Code Staff under the Remuneration Code, with the exception of the Non-Executive Directors.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Groups website.
In determining the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee takes into account the following objectives: To attract, retain and motivate talented Directors and senior management of the calibre required to manage the business successfully, whilst seeking to avoid paying more than is necessary to meet this objective.
To motivate and reward good performance.
To meet relevant regulatory requirements, including the requirements of the FCA Remuneration Code so far as these apply tothe Group.
The main principles of the policy are to: Ensure that total remuneration is set at a level that is market competitive by benchmarking against relevant external comparators, taking account of size, complexity, and sector, and to ensure that the overall package takes account of market practice.
Maintain appropriate proportions of fixed and performance related pay, to help to drive performance over the short and longer term, maintain a flexible cost base, and avoid creating incentives for excessive risk taking.
Align incentive plans with the business strategy, prudent risk management, and shareholder interests.
Achieve consistency with the general remuneration philosophy applied to the Groups employees as a whole.
Details of the remuneration components are provided in Figure 1 the Remuneration Policy table for Executive Directors.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account The Committee will regularly compare the Groups Directors Remuneration Policy with shareholder guidelines and takes account oftheresults of shareholder votes on remuneration.
If any material changes to the remuneration policy are contemplated, the Committee Chairman will consult with major shareholders about these in advance.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years Remuneration Report are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration section of the Directors Remuneration Report.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Group applies a consistent remuneration philosophy for employees at all levels and the Committee takes account of the aggregate rate of base salary increase for all employees when determining increases in fixed pay for Directors.
All employees are eligible for performance-related annual bonus and the principle of bonus deferral applies to annual bonuses foremployees whose bonuses exceed certain thresholds established by the Committee.
The Group does not operate formal employee consultation on remuneration.
However, employees are able to provide direct feedback on the Groups remuneration policies to their managers or the Human Resources department.
The Committee monitors the effectiveness of the Groups remuneration policies in recruiting, retaining, and motivating employees, and receives reports on how the Groups remuneration policies are viewed by employees and whether they are meeting business needs.
The Committee does not seek to apply fixed ratios between the total remuneration levels of different roles in the Group, as this would prevent it from recruiting and retaining the necessary talent in a highly competitive employment market.
Benchmarking The Committee takes account of market benchmark data when setting total remuneration packages for Executive Directors.
Comparisons are made with other FTSE listed companies of similar size and business profile to the Group.
Practices in the private client investment management sector, and other related sectors, are also considered.
Benchmark data are used by the Committee as a reference point, alongside other factors such as the individuals role and experience, and company and personal performance, rather than as a direct determinant of pay levels.

1 Michael Williams is an Executive Director but, as an Investment Manager, is remunerated based on the performance of his team.
His base pay is set substantially lower than other Executive Directors and his annual bonus is dependent on the profits of his Investment Management team and is not subject to a cap.
One-third of the portion of his bonus above 50k is deferred into Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC shares or nil-cost options over shares which vest in one tranche, normally after three years.
54 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Overview 2 Strategic Report 6 Governance 34 Financial Statements 76 Additional Information 125 Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees The approach to remuneration for the Executive Directors is generally consistent with that for employees across the Group as a whole.
However, there are some differences which the Committee believes are necessary to reflect the different responsibilities of employees across the Group, and the need to recruit, retain and motivate employees in a variety of roles.
For example, below Executive Director level, the portion of annual variable pay that is deferred is structured differently and is capped at one-third rather than the two-thirds deferral that applies to Executive Directors.
Awards of market purchased shares are made to selected individuals from time to time, excluding Executive Directors, which vest subject to continued service, to recognise individuals value to the Group and to create further alignment with shareholders.
External Non-Executive Director positions Executive Directors are permitted to serve as Non-Executive Directors of other companies, on the grounds that this can help to broaden the skills and experience of the Director, provided there is no competition with the Groups business activities and where these duties do not interfere with the individuals ability to perform his duties for the Group.
Where an outside appointment is accepted in furtherance of the Groups business, any fees received are remitted to the Group.
If theappointment is not connected to the Groups business, the Executive Director is entitled to retain any fees received.
Approach to remuneration for new Executive Director appointments The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms and maximum levels of the Groups approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.
The Committee may also offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders, for the purpose of replacing awards or potential foreseeable earnings which are forgone by the individual on becoming an Executive Director.
This includes the use of awards made under 9.4.
In considering any such payments the Committee would take account of the amount of remuneration foregone and the nature, vesting dates and any performance requirements attached to the remuneration foregone.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments and the rationale for these.
For an internal appointment, any deferred pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior toappointment may be permitted to continue where this is considered to be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders.
For external and internal appointments, the Group may meet certain relocation expenses as appropriate.
Service contracts and loss of office payments Service contracts normally continue until the Executive Directors agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree.
The service contracts contain provision for early termination.
Notice periods are limited to six months by either party.
If the Group terminates the employment of an Executive Director without giving the period of notice required under the contract, the Executive Director would be entitled to claim recompense for up to six months Total Fixed Pay.
In cases of good leavers the Committee may consider a discretionary award of annual variable pay, subject to performance, in respect of the portion of any financial year that the individual has been working with the Group, although not for the period of any payment in lieu of notice or garden leave.
In the event of a change of control of the Group there is no enhancement to these terms.
In summary, the contractual provisions are as follows: Figure 2: Provision Detailed terms Notice period Six months Termination payment in the event of Total Fixed Pay in respect of the unexpired period of contractual notice.
In certain cases, termination by the Company without the Committee may also consider a discretionary award of annual variable pay, subject due notice to performance, in respect of the portion of any financial year that the individual has been working with the Group, although not for the period of any payment in lieu of notice or garden leave.
Change of control Same terms as above on termination.
Any outstanding share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Groups LTIP or other share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, disability, redundancy, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee taking into account the individuals performance and the reasons for their departure, good leaver status can be applied.
In such cases, the normal practice, unless there are exceptional circumstances, is for any LTIP awards held to be pro-rated for the period of the performance period that has expired, and the performance conditions would continue to apply.
Share awards under the Deferred Profit Share Plan DPSP will vest in full on the original vesting schedule.
An Executive Directors service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.
Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 55 Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, the Directors Remuneration Policy includes authority for the Group to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous Remuneration Reports.

The bonus award for Michael Williams, as an Investment Manager, is primarily assessed in relation to the profitability of his Investment Management team which was lower in 2014 relative to the previous year.
Figure 6.1 below shows the KPIs that were considered by the Committee, their weightings and the Committees assessment of performance for the year.

The Committee also took into consideration events over the year such as the write-off of a software intangible asset resulting from the decision to not roll out a new technology system for the Group.
Figure 6.2: 2014 Executive Directors bonus awards Based on this assessment of performance, the Committee has awarded the following annual bonuses to Executive Directors, with the split between cash and deferred shares as indicated in the table below: Deferred Name Role Cash Shares Total % of fixed pay David Nicol Chief Executive 273,333 146,667 420,000 120 Stephen Ford Head of Investment Management 236,667 123,333 360,000 120 Andrew Westenberger Finance Director 236,667 123,333 360,000 120 Michael Williams Investment Manager 235,777 92,889 328,666 212 With the exception of Michael Williams, the maximum annual bonus for each individual Executive Director is 150 per cent of total fixed pay.
Annual bonus awards are delivered part in cash and part in deferred shares that vest after three years.
The table below shows how the split is calculated: Figure 6.3: 2014 Executive Directors deferral rates for 2014 bonus award Portion of variable pay Fraction deferred Up to 50,000 None Between 50,000 and 1 x fixed remuneration One-third Above 1 x fixed remuneration Two-thirds In Michael Williams case, as he is an Investment Manager with significantly lower base pay, the first 50,000 is in cash, and the balance above 50,000 is two-thirds cash one-third shares.
The Committee has the discretion to adjust the final outcome upwards or downwards in the event that an exceptional event outside of the Executive Directors control occurs which, in the Committees opinion, materially affected the bonus out-turn.
There were no such events during 2014.
Both the cash and share element of the bonus is subject to clawback.

These options are subject to service conditions and vest in one tranche three years from thedate of grant.
Share Incentive Plan SIP The Group has a Share Incentive Plan.
Employees may use funds from their gross salary up to a maximum of 10% of their gross salary in regular monthly payments being not less than 10 and not greater than 125 to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company Partnership Shares.
Partnership Shares are acquired monthly.
For every Partnership Share purchased, the employee receives one matching share up to a total value of 20.
All shares to date awarded under this scheme have been purchased in the market monthly: itis the intention of the Directors to continue this policy in the year to September 2015.
Share schemes under which no awards were made in 2014 2004 Approved Share Option Plan ASOP Awards under the ASOP have been historically granted to Directors and other employees.
These awards have been subject to a condition that the year-on-year growth in annual fee income charged on portfolios shall not be less than 10%p.

The performance criteria are set by the Remuneration Committee and selected to recognise that income growth is a key driver of shareholder value.
The options are exercisable from five to ten years from grant.
These options were only granted once an employee has been with the Group for two years.
Awards have not been made under the ASOP since 2011.
The Board does not intend to issue any options or shares under this scheme in 2015.
2002 Senior Employee Matching Purchase Share Scheme SEMP Awards have not been made under this scheme since 2009.

This includes 0.76% issued under the SEMP and 0.32% under the all-employee plans discontinued SAYE scheme.
Directors shareholding and share interests To align the interests of the Executive Directors with shareholders, Executive Directors are required to build up shareholdings through the retention of shares vesting under the Groups share plans.
The Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding equivalent to 100% of total fixed pay over a period of five years, excluding awards that have not yet vested or have vested but not yet been exercised.
Andrew Westenberger and David Nicol have not yet met this requirement following their appointment to the Board in 2013.

Figure 10 shows the movement in the salary and annual bonus for the Chief Executive between the current and previous financial year compared to that for the average UK employee.
As the Chief Executive was appointed during 2013, the comparator figure has been annualised to permit a like-for-like comparison.
Rather than having separate base salary, pension and benefit components, Executive Directors and other senior staff receive a total fixed pay sum which they can receive part as a defined pension contribution and or benefits such as car benefit, private medical insurance or long-term illness disability insurance.
More junior staff receive a base salary and pension contributions additionally.
As such, an analysis of the movement in benefits for the Chief Executive and the average employee was not considered to be practical or meaningful and has not been included in Figure 10.
