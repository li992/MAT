Remuneration report Annual Statement from the Remuneration Committee Chairman Dear shareholder On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Committees report on remuneration for 2014.
I hope you nd the report helpful and informative.
Company strategy and remuneration philosophy In recent years, CSRs goal has been to deliver growing shareholder returns by generating revenue growth and increasing profitability.
CSR has undertaken this by focusing investment on markets that are growing and where CSR can deliver differentiated platforms with leading market positions.
CSR has pursued a strategy designed to build its portfolio of technologies and has focused on five strategic end markets: Voice & Music, Automotive Infotainment, Document Imaging, Bluetooth Smart and the nascent market of Indoor Location.
This strategy has diversied the products, market presence and customer base of CSR, whilst improving our relative market share.
Please see page 8 for further information on the strategy.
The Committees remuneration philosophy supports this strategy by providing for a substantial proportion of remuneration earned by executive directors to be performance related.
The xed parts of the directors remuneration salary, benets and pension are generally set at median level and the variable elements, such as bonus paid under the Executive Incentive Plan and share options, deliver significant value only where this is justied by performance.
The link between the performance conditions for the variable elements of remuneration and the Companys KPIs is shown in the At a glance summary on page 69.
The philosophy also seeks to ensure consistency of approach to remuneration at all levels, for example, by taking account of pay increases throughout the Group when reviewing the directors salaries.
The Committee has oversight of the remuneration for employees throughout the Group to ensure that the philosophy is being applied in practice and that its decisions on executive pay are made in the appropriate context.
Our remuneration philosophy is reected in the Directors Remuneration Policy Policy described in our 2013 Remuneration Report incorporating the statement on our website in relation to the use of discretion and we were pleased that 93.71% of votes cast at the AGM on 21 May 2014 were in favour of the Policy.
As our Chairman has noted, on 15 October 2014, we announced that the Board had reached agreement with Qualcomm, regarding the terms of a recommended cash offer for CSR.
The offer from Qualcomm of 900 pence per Ordinary Share values CSR at 1,560 million and, as we stated at the time of announcing the terms of the offer, your Board believes that the offer from Qualcomm provides CSR shareholders with an immediate and certain value which is highly attractive.
UK Corporate Governance Code remuneration changes The Committee has considered the recent changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to malus and clawback and minimum holding periods for shares which take effect for companies with a reporting year commencing on or after 1 October 2014.
Since 2011 CSR has operated the Executive Incentive Plan.
This arrangement contains performance based forfeiture provisions which the Committee considers are much stronger than market practice malus provisions.
The Committee therefore believes that it is not appropriate or necessary to introduce additional malus and clawback provisions at this point, particularly given the likelihood that CSR will not be a listed entity by the end of its 2015 financial year.
If for any reason CSR continues as a listed company, the Committee may reconsider its position.
The Committee is also satisfied that there are sufficient minimum shareholding requirements and holding periods for the executive directors.
It is the Committees opinion that the satisfaction of the substantial shareholding requirements set by the Committee of 400% of salary for the CEO, 200% of salary for the CFO and 100% of salary for the Operations Director, make it unnecessary to impose further holding requirements on shares acquired from any of the incentive arrangements.
Outcomes and operation of the remuneration policy For ease of reference, I have summarised the Policy, the outcomes for 2014 and how the Policy will be operated in 2015 in the following At a glance summary.
The Committee is mindful of the potential reputational damage that inappropriate pay can cause a company.
In assessing the total remuneration and reward, the Committee has satisfied itself that the payments and outcomes for 2014 are justied by the performance of the business and are equitable to all stakeholders in the Company.
The Committee works to ensure transparent reporting and open dialogue with the Companys shareholders on remuneration.
Please do not hesitate to contact me through the Company Secretary if you have any questions on the Policy or its implementation.
