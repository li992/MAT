The performance conditions that apply to the bonus are set on an individual basis and are closely linked to the Companys corporate, financial and strategic priorities.
This enables the Committee to reward both annual financial performance delivered for shareholders, and performance against specific financial, operational or strategic objectives set for each Director, which are closely linked to the strategic priorities of the business.
When considering performance outcomes the Committee looks beyond formulaic results to ensure the outcomes align with overall business performance.

The remainder of the bonus 40% was based upon the Committees assessment of the contribution the executive has made to the overall strategy through the delivery of specific targets.
Both Executive Directors had a number of common objectives aligned to our strategic priorities and particularly relating to international expansion and repositioning of our digital channels.
During the year, particular achievements, in addition to the delivery of the stretching business plan, related to the rebalancing of the business by reducing our dependence on UK advertising and driving new revenue streams.
This was achieved particularly in our Online, Pay & Interactive business where revenue was up 30%.
We invested in three digital content businesses and launched two new channels, ITVBe and our first pay channel, ITV Encore.
We continued to grow our international production business both organically and by acquisition, with 24% growth in international production revenue and the completion of three acquisitions including Leftfield, our biggest to date.
Adam Crozier was also assessed against the success of the relationship between ITV Studios and ITV Broadcast and there was an increase in ITV Studios share of ITV output to 60%.
Ian Griffiths was also assessed against the outcome of a comprehensive review of the London property portfolio to ensure that it remains fit for purpose over the coming decade and, in particular, the establishment of the London Television Centre pension funding partnership in March 2014.
The Strategic Report sets out more detail of our achievements in the year.
The Committee ensured that the maximum bonus opportunity could only be achieved for significant out performance of all corporate, financial and individual targets, with on-target performance achieving a 60% payout of the maximum bonus opportunity.

The proposed performance measures and targets for awards to be made in 2015 are detailed below.
Under the LTIP rules, the maximum annual award that can be granted in any financial year is 350% of salary.
This is to allow the Committee flexibility when recruiting Executives and to ensure the longevity of the plan.
There is currently no intention to grant awards at this level.
Awards in 2015 will be made to the Executive Directors with a value of 225% of salary, at the same level as awarded in 2014 and in line with the operational maximum set out in our Remuneration Policy.
In order to ensure that Executive Directors are only rewarded if value is delivered to shareholders, awards will be subject to an initial cumulative adjusted EPS performance gateway equal to that required for threshold performance 45.7p.
If this gateway is achieved, performance will then be assessed by reference to the conditions set out below.

Vesting between threshold and maximum 100% is on a straight-line basis.
Threshold for Family SOV is maintaining 2014 actual with 2% growth required for maximum payout.
When assessing performance against this target, the Committee will also have regard to the health of the main ITV channel.
Holding periods for any shares that vest are being phased in so that for awards made in 2015, 50% will be subject to a oneyear holding period, and 50% to a two year holding period.
Increased share retention requirements under the shareholding guidelines were introduced in 2013 and further information can be found on page 93.
Malus and Clawback In order to take account of current best practice and the guidance in the Code, the Committee has decided to update the provisions on malus and clawback so that: it applies to the cash as well as the deferred element of the annual bonus: and a clear time horizon is in place over which the provisions will operate.
Malus and clawback provisions may be operated at the discretion of the Committee in respect of any cash and deferred share elements of the bonus and awards made under LTIPs that were granted following the introduction amendment of these clauses.
Under malus, unvested share awards including any LTIP shares subject to a post vesting holding period can be reduced down to zero if considered appropriate or be made subject to additional conditions.
Clawback allows for repayment of bonuses previously paid and or shares previously received following vesting.
Malus clawback can be operated up to four years following the start of the relevant bonus year for bonuses, and up to six years from the relevant date of grant for LTIP awards.
The circumstances in which the operation of these provisions may be considered include material misstatement of results, gross misconduct or fraud.
