KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2013 14 49 000s DIRECTORS REPORT Remuneration report continued Recruitment policy This table sets out the Companys policy on recruitment of new permanent Executive Directors for each element of .
Remuneration element Policy on recruitment Base salary The Remuneration Committee will typically offer salaries around the median market level for comparative roles, but salaries above or below this level may be set to recognise the experience of the individual, the wider economic climate and pay andconditions throughout the Group.
Where it is appropriate to set a lower salary initially, a series of increases above the level awarded to the wider workforce may be given over the proceeding few years until the desired positioning is achieved, subject to individual performance.
This may apply to those promoted internally in the Group as well as to those recruited from outside.
Benefits The Remuneration Committee will offer a benefits package that will be set in line with its policy forexisting Executive Directors.
In addition to the benefits currently available to existing Executive Directors, the Committee may alsooffer an allowance to cover relocation expenses as appropriate.
Retirement benefits The maximum pension contribution will be set in line with the Companys policy for existing Executive Directors at 20 per cent of base salary.
Annual bonus The Remuneration Committee will offer an annual bonus in line with its policy for existing Executive Directors of up to 100 per cent of salary.
Different performance measures may be set initially depending on the point in the financial year at which the individual joined.
The opportunity for an annual bonus will bepro-rated for the period of employment.
Long-term incentives On an ongoing basis awards will be made in line with the policy for other Directors.
In the year of recruitment a higher award may be made within the approved limits of the plan 200 per cent of salary in exceptional circumstances, suchas recruitment.
Buy-outs The Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of shareholders and the Company.
Any such payments would be based solely on remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would reflect as far as possible the nature and time horizons attaching to that remuneration and the impact of any performance conditions.
The Remuneration Committees policy on the buying-out of existing incentives granted by the Executives previous employer will depend on the circumstances of recruitment and will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.
There will not be a presumption in favour of buy-out but it will be considered ifnecessary to attract the right candidate.
In total the maximum variable pay level in the year of appointment excluding the value of any buy-out awards will be 300 per cent ofsalary.
For an internal executive appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment would continue.
Non-Executive Directors On the appointment of a new Non-Executive Chairman or Non-Executive Director, fees will be set to take account of the calibre and experience of the individual, prevailing market rates in companies of a similar size and the expected time commitment associated withtherole.
KCOM Group PLC 50 Annual report and accounts 2013 14 Directors report Service contracts and letters of appointment policy Service contracts It is the policy of the Group that the notice period for Executive Directors is set at six months for either party.
Prior to 2008, the notice period for Executive Directors was set at 12 months.
The decision has been taken not to retrospectively alter the notice period for those Directors appointed with a 12 month notice period.
Letter of appointment Non-Executive Directors are appointed by letters of appointment rather than service contracts and the notice period in all letters of appointment is set at six months for either party.
Copies of the Directors service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection during office hours at our head office at 37 Carr Lane, Hull, HU1 3RE.
There are no obligations on the Group in any of the service contracts or letters of appointment to make payments beyond those disclosed in this report.
Payments for loss of office This table sets out the policy on exit payments in relation to each remuneration element for Executive Directors.
The Committee is clear that there will be a consistent approach to exit payments and no reward for poor performance.
No amount is payable if an Executive Director is dismissed for serious breach of contract, serious misconduct or under-performance or acts that bring the Executive Director or Group into serious disrepute.
The Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment do not include any compensation for loss of office.
Remuneration element Treatment on exit Base salary Salary will be paid over the contractual notice period.
In all cases the Company will seek to mitigate any payments due and the Executive Directors have a contractual duty to use reasonable endeavours to obtain alternative income, which can then be used to reduce the salary if being paid by instalments.
However, the Company has discretion tomake a lump sum payment on termination in lieu of notice.
Benefits and retirement benefits Benefits and retirement benefits will normally continue to be provided over the notice period.
In all cases the Company will seek to mitigate any payments due.
However, the Company has discretion to make a lump sum payment on termination equal to the value of the benefits payable during the notice period.
Annual bonus Whether an annual bonus payment is made is entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and would be pro-rated to the time of active service in the year of cessation.
The decision of the Committee would take into consideration the performance of the individual, the circumstances of the departure and the financial performance of the Group.
LTIP Normally awards will lapse on cessation of employment, unless the Company determines and the Remuneration Committee agrees that the Executive is a good leaver.
Good leaver status is usually conferred for one of the following reasons: death, ill-health, injury ordisability, retirement, redundancy, or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee.
Good leavers will be treated in accordance with the rules of the LTIP, as approved by shareholders.
In these circumstances a participants awards vest on atimepro-rata basis subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria overthe original period, with the balance of the awards lapsing.
The Committee retains discretionto decide not to pro-rate, to alter the basis of time pro-rating, and to alter thedate on which performance is calculated if it feels such decisions are appropriate inparticular circumstances.
Payments on a change of control, where a Directors employment is adversely changed, will be as on termination.
There will be no enhanced provisions on a change of control.
Policy on outside appointments We believe that where Board members hold directorships in other companies the Group can benefit from their experience.
As a result, and subject to the Boards prior approval, Executive Directors may take on more than one external non-executive directorship and retain the fees earned.
KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2013 14 51 DIRECTORS REPORT Remuneration report continued Annual report on remuneration This part of the Directors Remuneration report sets out the amounts paid to Directors for the year ended 31 March 2014 and describes how policy will be implemented in 2014 15.
The Annual report on remuneration, along with the statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, will be put to an advisory vote at the AGM on 29 July 2014.
Implementation of policy for 2014 15 The table below sets out how the Remuneration policy will be implemented for the 2014 15 financial year: Executive Directors Bill Halbert Paul Simpson Kevin Walsh From 1 July 2014 Bills base salary has From 1 July 2014 Pauls base salary Kevins base salary will remain the Base salary been increased to 396,872.

These include private medical insurance for the Executive Benefits and his immediate family, income protection, life assurance, a car allowance of 16,000 per annum for Bill and14,000 per annum for Paul and Kevin or an equivalent company car, a fully-expensed fuel card, medical screening and the opportunity to participate in the all-employee Share Incentive Plan.
TheExecutive Directors are also able to purchase additional flexible benefits which are available to all employees.
Thebenefits for Kevin in 2014 15 will be pro-rated to his date of retirement.
Each Executive Director is entitled to an employer pension contribution of 20 per cent of base salary.
Retirement benefits The performance measures for the annual bonus scheme are growth in EBITDA Kevin will not be entitled to a bonus Annual bonus and growth in revenue, measured for the 2014 15 financial year.
Both Bill and for the 2014 15 financial year, given Paul have a target annual bonus entitlement of 50 per cent of base salary.
Up to his indication of his intention to retire 20 per cent of the target entitlement, equivalent to 10 per cent of base salary, is in the summer of 2014. triggered upon exceeding a specific targeted level of EBITDA.
If the EBITDA achieved in the year is greater than that required to trigger the full 20 per cent payment then further bonus payments begin to accrue, however payment of any bonus beyond the 20 per cent is dependent on an underpin of revenue growth in the year.
Even more stretching financial targets are in place for a bonus of between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of base salary.
The exact targets set are commercially sensitive and therefore cannot be disclosed here.
It is proposed to award LTIP awards to Bill and Paul in July 2014 under the Kevin will not be eligible for an LTIP Long-term current scheme, which will be equivalent to 100 per cent of their base salary award in July 2014, given his intention incentives atthe date of grant.
These awards will have a three year performance period to retire in the summer of 2014. and therefore will be due to vest in July 2017.
Base salary increases The base salaries of the Executive Directors have not increased since 1 July 2011.
On 1 July 2012 all employees, excluding Executive Directors and senior managers, were awarded a two per cent increase.
From 1 July 2014 an average pay rise of 1.66 per cent will be awarded to employees across the Group based on individual performance and the market rate for their role.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the performance of the Group, the individual performance of the Executive Directors and the payawards made elsewhere in the Group since the last increase for Executive Directors in 2011 and has proposed a 2.75 per cent increase for BillHalbert and Paul Simpson effective from 1 July 2014.
Following this increase we can confirm that the salaries for Bill and Paul are consistent withmedian market rates.
