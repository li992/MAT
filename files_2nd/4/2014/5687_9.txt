These KPIs are integral to the setting of incentives for senior managers and others across the group.

23612.04 - 17 December 2014 12:23 PM - Proof 8 Governance Directors Remuneration Report Annual Report and Accounts 2014 49 Detailed remuneration arrangements of executive directors In formulating its directors remuneration policy, the group has considered employee pay and benefits available across the group and did not consider it necessary to consult with its employees though it has consulted its largest shareholder.

com Directors Remuneration Report continued Remuneration policy report continued Profit shares Purpose and link to Profit share links the pay of directors directly to the growth in profits of their businesses.
It encourages each director to strategy grow their profits, to invest in new products, to search for acquisitions, and to manage costs and risks tightly: Profit shares are designed to maximise sustainable profits with no guaranteed floor and no ceiling: Profit shares are expected to make up much of a directors total pay and encourage long-term retention.
Operation Profit shares are paid in full in the financial year following the year in which they are earned.
In exceptional circumstances profit shares may be paid in part during the year in which they are earned but only to the extent that profits have already been generated: There is no deferral of profit share: There is no guaranteed floor or ceiling on profit shares earned: Profit shares are calculated after charging the cost of funding acquisitions at the groups actual cost of funds: Each directors profit share is subject to audit and to remuneration committee approval, and can be revised at any time if the directors responsibilities are changed: Gains or losses on the disposal of capital assets, including subsidiaries and investments, are not included in profit shares: The profit share of PR Ensor is based on the adjusted pre-tax post non-controlling interests profit of the group, thereby matching his profit share with the pre-tax return the group generates for its shareholders.
The profit share is calculated by applying a multiplier to the adjusted pre-tax profits.
The multiplier is adjusted for changes in the companys share capital: CHC Fordham and CR Jones receive a profit share linked to the adjusted pre-tax EPS of the group: All other executive directors receive profit shares linked to the operating profits of the businesses they manage at fixed rates on profits above various thresholds.
Relationship to Incentives, including profit shares, are an important part of the group culture.
The directors believe they directly reward employee incentive good and exceptional performance.
Most employees across the group have some incentive scheme in place.

They encourage directors to deliver long-term, sustainable profit growth.
Operation 2014 Capital Appreciation Plan CAP 2014 At the companys AGM in January 2014 the directors received approval for a new long-term incentive scheme following the achievement of the performance conditions of CAP 2010, see page 46.
Awards under CAP 2014 are granted to senior employees who have direct and significant responsibility for the profits of the group.
Each CAP 2014 award will comprise a nil-paid option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25 pence each in the company and a right to receive a cash payment.
No individual may receive an award over more than 5% of the award pool.
In accordance with the terms of CAP 2014, no consideration will be payable for the grant of these awards.
The primary performance test under CAP 2014 requires the company to achieve an adjusted profit before tax before CAP costs of 173.6 million by financial year 2017 increased to 178.4 million for the acquisition of Mining Indaba.
This is equivalent to an average profit growth rate of at least 10% a year from a base in 2013 which the committee decided was a sufficiently challenging target.
Subject to the performance test being satisfied, rewards under CAP 2014 are expected to vest in three tranches in February 2018, 2019 and 2020.
The profit target under CAP 2014 will be adjusted in the event that any significant acquisitions or disposals are made during the performance period.
Awards are granted under CAP 2014 to senior employees of acquired entities who have direct and significant responsibility for the profits of the group.
2014 Company Share Option Plan CSOP 2014 At the companys AGM, the directors also received approval for a new CSOP.
The CSOP 2014 will be a delivery mechanism for part of the CAP 2014 award.
Awards are granted under the CSOP 2014 to senior employees who have direct and significant responsibility for the profits of the group.
Each CSOP 2014 option will enable each UK based participant to purchase up to 30,000 of shares in the company with reference to the market price of the companys shares at the date of grant.
No consideration will be payable for the grant of these awards.
The options will vest and become exercisable at the same time as the corresponding share award under the CAP 2014 providing the CSOP option is in the money at that time.
The Canadian version of the CSOP 2014 will enable a Canada-based participant to purchase up to $100,000 of shares in the company with reference to the market price of the companys shares at the date of grant.

The pension cash accrual represents the sum which would be available on retirement based on service to September 30 2014 to secure retirement benefits, ignoring any increase for future inflation.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Retirement Benefit Transfer Values GN11 published by the Board for Actuarial Standards.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement include the pension cash accrual and represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent a sum paid or payable to individual directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The pension cash accrual has been included in the increase in transfer value net of directors contributions.
Members of the scheme have the option of paying additional voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
The normal retirement age for the pension cash accrual element of the scheme is 65.

It is compared with the change in remuneration of the average employee across the group at constant currency.
The directors feel that this group of people is the most appropriate as a comparator because employee pay is determined annually by the remuneration committee at the same time as that of the managing director and under the same economic circumstances.
The directors believe this demonstrates the best link between the increases in average remuneration compared to the managing director.

These are deemed by the directors to be the significant distributions made during the year and will assist stakeholders in understanding the relative importance of spend on pay.

Implementation of the remuneration policy For the year ending September 30 2015 the group intends to apply the remuneration policy as follows: Directors salaries from October 1 2014 are as set out on page 54.
These salaries will be reviewed and may be increased in April 2015.
Benefits will also be reviewed during the year although it is not anticipated that any significant changes will be made other than possibly the provision of a UK or group-wide life insurance scheme.
The profit share arrangement for each director will be as described on page 50.
Profit share thresholds are subject to review during the year.
Changes to thresholds are made only where considered appropriate by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the businesses that the respective director is responsible for, acquisitions and disposals, and the other factors stated in the groups policy.
The thresholds for the year ending September 30 2015 will be disclosed in the 2015 report and accounts.
Directors will continue to be able to participate in the pension schemes operated in the country in which they reside.
