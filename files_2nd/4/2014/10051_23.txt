STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 55 Directors remuneration report Chairmans introduction and annual statement It is my pleasure to present the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Pay philosophy Executive remuneration packages at Meggitt are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of a high calibre, to recognise the international nature of the Groups business and to reward the directors for delivering value to shareholders.
The package targets fixed pay at market competitive levels to companies of a similar size and with similar operating characteristics, supplemented by performance-related annual bonuses and an equity-based long term incentive plan designed to reward and incentivise growth, and provide a strong link to Group and individual performance.
2014 activity In 2014, we finalised the review of the remuneration package which commenced last year and was extensively reported on in our 2013 report and submitted the Directors remuneration report and remuneration policy Policy to shareholders for approval at our AGM.
98.95% of those shareholders who voted at the AGM approved our Policy and 99.79% voted for the Directors remuneration report.
We also finalised the effectiveness review of the Committee and Kepler Associates Kepler, our advisers, which was carried out using questionnaires and Committee discussion.
Overall the ratings for the Committee and Kepler were satisfactory: there was a valuable discussion about effectiveness but no significant areas highlighted for improvement.
Since May, we have approved awards under the new shareholder-approved Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, updated our terms of reference to reflect the new remuneration reporting and policy regime and confirmed the Equity Participation Plan EPP vesting outcome see page 67.
We also discussed performance targets for 2015 and agreed the fees for Sir Nigel Rudd, who will become Chairman at the conclusion of the AGM on 23 April 2015.
The intended remuneration arrangements for 2015, outlined in this report, are in line with the Policy approved by shareholders at our 2014 AGM.
2014 performance Civil original equipment revenue enjoyed another year of strong growth, and the civil aftermarket gained momentum through the year resulting in full year organic growth in civil aerospace of 6%.
However, this was offset by declines in military and energy resulting in flat organic Group revenue for the year.
Underlying organic profit before tax declined by 11% reflecting adverse product mix and increased investment in new product introduction costs, with a 14% decline in underlying EPS reflecting also adverse movements in foreign exchange and the disposal of non-core businesses.
This has resulted in the earnings per share EPS and cash elements of the awards granted in 2012 under the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and EPP failing to meet their performance conditions the total shareholder return outcome on the EPP will be confirmed at the vesting date.
Under our Short Term Incentive Plan STIP, we did not hit our financial targets which account for two thirds of the award, but the targets for personal performance objectives were met and vesting outcomes for 2014 are as a result of this personal performance element.
With growing order intake and building aftermarket momentum, we anticipate a return to organic growth in 2015.
This Directors remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
The report meets the requirements of the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
In this report we describe how the principles relating to directors remuneration, as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 the Code, are applied in practice.
The FRC published a revised UK Corporate Governance Code on 17 September 2014, applicable to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2014 the 2014 Code, although the Board has adopted some of the new provisions in the 2014 Code earlier than required.

indd 55 04 03 2015 17:06 56 MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Directors remuneration report continued The Policy report This section of the report sets out the Policy for the directors, which shareholders approved at the 2014 AGM and is effective for a period of three years from the date of the 2014 AGM.
The only amendments to the Policy from the version approved by shareholders are to update the data used in the pay-for-performance scenario analysis from 2014 to 2015 and to remove references to future approval of the Long Term Incentive Plan which was approved at the AGM in 2014.
Executive Director Remuneration Policy Table Base salary Function To attract and retain talent by ensuring base salaries are competitive in the relevant talent market.
Operation Salary will be reviewed by the Committee annually, in February, with changes effective from 1 April of that year.
Salaries for the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
In deciding salary levels, the Committee considers personal performance including how the individual has helped to support the strategic objectives of the Group.
The Committee will also consider employment conditions and salary levels across the Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Salaries are paid to existing directors in GBP: however the Committee reserves the right to pay future and existing directors in any other currency converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed.
Opportunity It is not anticipated that percentage salary increases for executive directors will exceed those of the wider workforce over the period this Policy will apply.
Where increases are awarded in excess of the wider employee population, for example if there is a material change in the responsibility, size or complexity of the role, the Committee will provide the rationale in the relevant years annual report on remuneration.
Performance None explicitly, but salaries are independently benchmarked periodically against FTSE companies in similar metrics industries and those with similar market capitalisation.
Personal performance is also taken into account when considering salary increases.
Pension Function To provide post-retirement benefits for executive directors in a cost-efficient manner.
Operation The pension plans operated by the Group which executive directors are, or could be, members of are: Meggitt Pension Plan defined benefit pension plan, closed to new members.
Meggitt Workplace Savings Plan defined contribution personal pension scheme, open to new members.
Salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for directors.
Opportunity From 2013, it has been our Policy that new executive director external appointments are eligible for a pension allowance of 25% of salary, payable either as pension contribution up to any limit set in current regulations or, above such limits, in cash.
Where agreements have been made prior to the approval of this Policy which entitle an executive to receive a pension allowance higher than 25% of salary, pension allowances up to a maximum of 50% of salary, will be paid: Mr Young and Mr Green had agreements prior to the approval of this Policy which entitle them to receive a pension allowance of 50% of salary and this arrangement will continue for these directors.
indd 56 04 03 2015 17:06 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 57 Benefits Function To provide non-cash benefits which are competitive in the market in which the executive director is employed.
Operation The Group may provide benefits including, but not limited to, a company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, life assurance, a fuel allowance, a mobile phone, relocation costs and any other future benefits made available either to all employees globally or all employees in the region in which the executive director is employed.
Opportunity Benefits vary by role and individual circumstances: eligibility and cost is reviewed periodically.
Benefits in respect of the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
It is not anticipated that the costs of benefits provided will increase significantly in the financial years over which this Policy will apply, although the Committee retains discretion to approve a higher cost in exceptional circumstances e. g. to facilitate recruitment, relocation, expatriation etc or in circumstances where factors outside the Groups control have changed materially e. g. market increases in insurance costs.
metrics Annual bonus Short Term Incentive PlanSTIP Function To incentivise executive directors on delivering annual financial and personal targets.
Operation Performance measures, targets and weightings are set at the start of the year.
The performance period of the STIP is a financial year.
After the end of the financial year, to the extent that the performance criteria have been met, 75% of the STIP award is paid in cash to the director.
The remaining 25% of the award will be deferred into shares and released with no further performance conditions attached, and no matching shares provided after a further period of two years.
Under the STIP 2014 rules as approved by the Committee, the Committee may decide to apply malus and or clawback to STIP awards and deferred STIP awards to reduce the vesting of awards and or require repayment of awards in the event of a review of the conduct, capability or performance of the director where there has been misconduct by the director or material misstatement of the Companys or a Group members financial results for any period.
Deferred STIP awards may lapse in certain leaver circumstances see page 62.
Opportunity The STIP provides for a maximum award opportunity of up to 150% of salary in normal circumstances with an on-target opportunity of 100% of salary and an opportunity of 50% of salary at threshold.
The Committee has discretion to make a STIP award of up to 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances e. g. a substantial contract win which has a significant positive financial impact in the long term but which has no, or negative, short term financial impact.
Dividends accrue on unvested deferred STIP awards over the vesting period and are released on the vesting date.
Performance STIP awards are based on the achievement of financial and personal performance targets.
For the executive metrics directors, two-thirds of the STIP will be weighted to financial performance, with the remainder subject to personal performance.
The relative weightings of the financial and personal elements for any STIP period, and the measures used to assess financial and non-financial performance, will be set by the Committee in its absolute discretion to align with the Groups operating and strategic priorities for that year.
The award for performance under each element of the STIP will be calculated independently.
The Committee will have discretion to review the consistency of the pay-out of the financial and personal elements and adjust the total up or down within the levels specified above if it does not consider this to be a fair reflection of the underlying performance of the Group or the individual.
The personal performance element will typically be based on three to five objectives relevant to the executives role.
Details of the measures, weightings and targets applicable to the STIP for each year, including a description of how they were chosen and whether they were met, will be disclosed retrospectively in the annual report on remuneration for the following year subject to commercial sensitivity.
indd 57 04 03 2015 17:06 58 MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Directors remuneration report continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Function To align the interests of executive directors with shareholders in growing the value of the Group over the long term.
Operation The LTIP replaced the ESOS and EPP in 2014.
Under the LTIP, executive directors are eligible to receive annual awards over Meggitt shares vesting after three years, subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets.
Whilst it is the current intention that LTIP awards will be in the form of nil cost options, the LTIP provides, at the absolute discretion of the Committee, for awards over conditional shares, market value share options and phantom awards.
Under the LTIP 2014 rules as approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2014, the Committee may decide to apply malus and or clawback to awards to reduce the vesting of awards and or require repayment of awards in the event of a review of the conduct, capability or performance of the director where there has been misconduct by the director or material misstatement of the Companys or a Group members financial results for any period.
Opportunity Executive directors will normally be eligible for annual LTIP awards of 220% of salary.
Awards up to a maximum of 300% of salary may be granted in exceptional circumstances e. g. to support the recruitment of a key executive or to recognise exceptional individual performance.
30% of an award will vest if performance against each performance condition is at threshold and 100% if it is at maximum, with straight line vesting in between.
Dividends accrue on unvested LTIP awards over the vesting period and are released, to the extent the LTIP award vests, on the vesting exercise date.
Performance Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to continued employment and performance against three measures, which are metrics intended to be as follows: Earnings per Share EPS : Return on Trading Assets ROTA, which is underlying operating profit after tax divided by net trading assets, measured at constant currency.
Net trading assets are adjusted to exclude goodwill and other intangible assets arising on the acquisition of a business, derivative financial instruments, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax and net debt: and Strategic goals typically to be based on three strategic priorities around execution, growth and innovation.
The way these measures link to our KPIs can be seen on pages 27 to 30.
It is the current intention that the weighting of the measures will be equal i. e. one third each but that the Committee will consider, and adjust if deemed appropriate, the weighting at the start of each LTIP cycle.
Any  information on measures, targets and performance will be disclosed retrospectively.
Awards made under the LTIP will have a performance period of three financial years, starting from 1 January of the year in which the award is made and ending on 31 December of the third year.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of the relevant performance period, awards will lapse.
Vesting of the strategic element will also be subject to a discretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent to which achievement of the strategic objectives is consistent with the underlying financial performance over the three-year period.
The measures and targets in operation for grants made under the LTIP in the current year, and which are not deemed commercially sensitive are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan SIP Function To align the interests of employees and shareholders by encouraging all employees to own Meggitt shares.
Operation Sharesave SchemeAll employee scheme under which all UK employees including executive directors may save up to the maximum monthly savings limit as determined by legislation over a period of three or five years.
Options under the Sharesave Scheme are granted at a discount of up to 20% to the market value of shares at the date of grant.
SIPAll employee scheme under which i all UK employees including executive directors may contribute up to the monthly maximum as determined by legislation to purchase shares monthly from pre-tax pay: and ii all UK employees including executive directors may receive free shares up to the annual maximum value as determined by legislation.
Opportunity Savings, contributions and free shares are capped at the prevailing legislative limit at the time UK employees are invited to participate.
indd 58 04 03 2015 17:06 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 59 Notes to the Policy table The Committee is satisfied that the above Policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-taking.
The Committee retains discretion to make minor, non-significant changes to the Policy without reverting to shareholders.
Payments from outstanding awards Outstanding awards are currently held by the directors under the EPP and the ESOS, the Groups long term incentives operated prior to the introduction of the LTIP in 2014.
These awards will continue to vest subject to performance conditions being met and be capable of exercise during the period over which this Policy applies.
The tables on pages 74 to 75 highlight outstanding and vested awards.
Approach to target setting and performance measure selection Targets applying to the STIP and LTIP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points, including the Groups strategic plan, analyst forecasts for Meggitt and its sector comparators, historical growth achieved by Meggitt and its sector comparators and external expectations for growth in Meggitts markets.
STIP The performance measures used under the STIP reflect financial targets for the year and non-financial performance objectives.
The Policy provides the Committee with flexibility to select appropriate measures on an annual basis.
STIP performance targets are set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular personal performance objectives and the economic environment in a given year.
For financial measures, target is based around the annual budget approved by the Board.
Prior to the start of the financial year, the Committee sets an appropriate performance range around target, which it considers provides an appropriate degree of stretch challenge and an incentive to outperform.
LTIP The vesting of LTIP awards is linked to EPS, ROTA and the achievement of long-term strategic goals.
EPS is considered by the Board to be the most important measure of Meggitts financial performance.
It is highly visible internally, is regularly monitored and reported, and is strongly motivational for participants.
EPS targets will continue to be set on a nominal cumulative pence basis to incentivise consistent performance and reflect the fact that Meggitts profits are generated to a large degree outside the UK and not significantly influenced by UK retail price inflation.
ROTA helps to balance the achievement of growth and returns.
The Committee believes ROTA is a good internal proxy for total shareholder return TSR which focuses executives on managing the balance sheet and Meggitts operational performance, whilst also being less remote for participants below Board level.
The definition of net trading assets for ROTA excludes goodwill and other intangible assets arising when a business is acquired, to reflect that acquisitions are not within the control of the majority of participants.
In order to safeguard against poor acquisitions, the Committee has overall discretion to reduce the outcome under the ROTA element if in its opinion the outcome does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The performance of acquisitions against Board approved targets is also monitored separately.
The Committee believes that the strategic goals component will help reinforce the realisation of Group strategy and the achievement of key non-financial and strategic goals over long product cycles which drive long-term value at Meggitt.
The element will typically comprise a scorecard of three-year targets across a maximum of three core strategic areas for the Group.
The Committee believes that this approach will enable it to reflect the Groups long-term nature and shifting strategic priorities in the LTIP to ensure executives interests remain closely aligned with those of our shareholders over time.
Specific measures and targets for each area will be developed and clearly defined at the start of each three-year cycle to balance leading and lagging indicators of performance.
Vesting of this element is subject to a discretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent to which achievement of the strategic objectives is consistent with Meggitts underlying financial performance over the performance period.
Remuneration policy for other employees The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as that for executive directors.
Annual salary reviews take into account Group performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in comparable companies.
Some employees below executive level are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes: opportunities and performance measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individuals role.
Senior executives are eligible for LTIP on similar terms as the executive directors, although award opportunities are lower and vary by organisational level.
All UK employees are eligible to participate in the Sharesave Scheme and SIP on identical terms.
Share ownership guidelines In 2013, the Committee increased the minimum shareholding guidelines for executive directors from 100% to 300% of base salary for the Chief Executive and from 100% to 200% of base salary for each of the other executive directors.
There is no set time frame within which directors have to meet the guideline, however until they meet the guideline they are not permitted to sell more than 50% of the after-tax value of a vested share award.
The shareholding requirement ceases when a director leaves the Group.
Further information on the shareholding requirement is in the annual remuneration report see page 73.

Note that the LTIP awards granted in a year will not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value excludes the impact of share price movement or dividend accrual.
The Maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration salary and benefits and pension, plus maximum payout under all incentives 150% of salary under the STIP, and full vesting of LTIP awards.
The On-target scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target STIP based on two-thirds of maximum opportunity and LTIP threshold vesting 30% vesting.
The Minimum scenario reflects fixed remuneration only, being the only elements of the executive directors remuneration package not linked to performance.
Non-Executive  Policy Table Non-Executive Directors are submitted for re-election annually, do not have a contract of service and are not eligible to join the Groups pension or share schemes.
Details of the Policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below: Fees Function To attract and retain non-executive directors of the highest calibre with broad commercial and other experience relevant to the Group.
Operation Fee levels are reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 1 April each year.
The fees paid to the Chairman of the Board are determined by the Committee, while the fees for all other non-executive directors are reviewed by a committee of the Board formed of executive directors.
Fees for the year under review and for the current year are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Additional fees are paid to the chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committee and to the Senior Independent Director, to reflect the additional time commitment of these roles.
In deciding fee increases, the committees consider employment conditions and salary increases across the Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Currently, all fees are paid in GBP, however the committees reserve the right to pay future and existing nonexecutive directors in any other currency converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed.
Opportunity Fee increases will be applied taking into account the outcome of the annual review.
The maximum aggregate annual fee for all non-executive directors including the Chairman as provided in the Companys Articles of Association is 1,000,000.

300% in exceptional circumstances In determining the appropriate remuneration structure and levels, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of Meggitt and its shareholders.
The Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, i. e. over and above the approach outlined in the table above.
Any such compensatory awards will be made under existing share schemes, where appropriate, and will be subject to the normal performance conditions of those schemes.
The Committee may also consider it appropriate to structure buy-out awards differently to the structure described in the Policy table, exercising the discretion available under UKLA Listing Rule 9.4.
2 R where necessary to make a one-off award to an executive director in the context of recruitment.
In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
The value of any such buy-out will be fully disclosed.
Internal promotion Where a new executive director is appointed by way of internal promotion, the Policy will be consistent with that for external appointees, as detailed above.
Any commitments made prior to an individuals promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the Policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Group may, where appropriate, seek to revise an individuals existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors and prevailing market best practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director, including details of any exceptional payments, will be disclosed in the RIS notification made at the time of appointment and in the annual report on remuneration for the year in which the recruitment occurred.
Non-executive directors In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Committee will use the Policy as set out in the table on page 60.
indd 61 04 03 2015 17:06 62 MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Directors remuneration report continued Service contracts and exit payment policy Executive director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to manage the Group.
The Committees Policy is that executive directors service contracts should be terminable on no more than 12 months notice.
The Committees approach to payments in the event of termination of employment of an executive director is to take account of the particular circumstances, including the reasons for termination, individual performance, contractual obligations and the rules of the Groups applicable incentive plans which apply to share awards held by the executive directors: Compensation for loss of office in service contracts Except as set out in the table on page 63, under the terms of their service contracts, the executive directors may be required to work during their notice period or may, if the Group decides, be paid in lieu of notice if not required to work the full notice period.
Payment in lieu of notice will be equal to base salary plus the cost to the Group of providing the contractual benefits pensions allowance, health insurance and company car or car allowance that would otherwise have been paid or provided during the notice period.
Payments will be in equal monthly instalments and will be subject to mitigation such that payments will either reduce, or stop completely, if the executive director obtains alternative employment.
An executive directors employment can be terminated by the Company without notice or payment in lieu of notice in specific circumstances including summary dismissal, bankruptcy or resignation.
Treatment of STIP Executive directors have no automatic entitlement to any bonus on termination of employment under the STIP, but the Committee may use its discretion to award a bonus normally pro-rated.
Where any bonus is deferred into shares, the award will normally lapse if an executive directors employment terminates unless the executive director leaves for specified good leaver reasons.
The good leaver reasons are death, redundancy, retirement, injury, disability, the business or company which employs the executive director ceasing to be part of the Group, any other circumstances in which the Committee exercises discretion to treat the executive director as a good leaver or on a change of control.
If the executive director is a good leaver their award will vest on the normal vesting date, or earlier on a change of control, and would not be subject to pro-rating.
Treatment of long term incentive plan awards The treatment of awards under the ESOS, EPP and LTIP is governed by the rules of the plans which have been approved by shareholders and is described below.
Awards will normally lapse if an executive directors employment terminates unless the executive director leaves for specified good leaver reasons.
The good leaver reasons are the same as described above.
If the executive director is a good leaver, awards will vest to the extent that the attached performance conditions are met, but on a time pro-rated basis, with Committee discretion to allow early vesting.
Under the EPP and ESOS, awards vest as soon as practicable after an employee has left.
Under the LTIP, awards vest on the normal vesting date.

As dated 26 February such, remuneration or payments for loss of office that are 2001 required to be made under Mr Greens service contract are not required to be consistent with the Policy.
Payments to Mr Green under his service contract differ from the Policy in the following respects: On termination of employment, Mr Green is entitled to a liquidated damages payment equal to his salary and the value of his contractual benefits bonus, pension allowance, insurance and company car or car allowance at the date of termination, pro-rated to the remaining notice period less an amount equal to 5% of the aggregate sum and the Committee shall exercise its discretion under the Groups share plans to treat Mr Green as a good leaver.
On change of control, Mr Green may give notice to terminate his employment within six months of the event and upon such termination he shall become entitled to the liquidated damages payment summarised above.
External appointments held by executive directors The Board believes that the Group can benefit from experience gained when executive directors hold external non-executive directorships.
Executive directors are allowed to hold external appointments and to receive payment provided such appointments are agreed by the Board or Committee in advance, there are no conflicts of interests and the appointment does not lead to deterioration in the individuals performance.
Details of external appointments and the associated fees received are included in the annual report on remuneration on page 72.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company The Committee does not consult with employees specifically on executive remuneration policy and framework but does seek to promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodiesincluding trade unions and works councilsas part of its broader employee engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Salary increases made elsewhere in the Group are amongst the data that the Committee considers in determining salaries for executive directors.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee considers shareholder views received during the year and at the AGM each year, as well as guidance from shareholder representative bodies more broadly.
The majority of shareholders continue to express support of remuneration arrangements at Meggitt.

Further details of the 2014 STIP, including performance measures, actual performance and bonus payouts, can be found on page 66.
4 EPP is calculated as the number of shares vesting based on performance measures substantially completed during the year, valued at the market value of the shares.
For 2014, the figure represents the actual vesting outcome of the EPS and cash elements of the 2012 award the performance period ended on 31 December 2014 and an estimate of the outcome of the TSR element of the 2012 award the performance period of which will end in August 2015 based on performance to 31 December 2014.
The market value of vested shares is based on the average share price over the last quarter of 2014 of 474.07 pence.
The valuation of the 2012 award will be amended for the actual vesting outcome of the TSR element in August 2015 and the share price on the date of vesting 22 August 2015 in next years annual report on remuneration.
For 2013, the figure represents the actual vesting outcome of the 2011 award, which has been trued up, compared to that reported last year, to reflect the final vesting outcome of the TSR element Nil% and the share price on the date of vesting 467.80p.
Further details on performance criteria, achievement and resulting vesting levels can be found on page 67.
5 ESOS is calculated as the number of shares vesting based on performance measures substantially completed during the year, valued at the difference between the market value of the shares and the exercise price of the award.
For 2014, the figure represents the actual vesting outcome of the 2012 award.
The market value of vested shares is based on the average share price over the last quarter of 2014 of 474.07 pence and an exercise price of 397.20p.
For 2013, the figure represents the actual vesting outcome of the 2011 award, trued up, compared to that reported last year, to reflect the embedded gain based on the actual share price at vesting 504.00p.

2 Individual personal performance is measured on a scale of 1 to 5.
The average of all ratings drives the STIP outcome, where 2 indicates expectations are partially met, 3 is fully met and 4 exceeds expectations.
Details of the personal performance measures are provided below.
It is the view of the Committee that notwithstanding that 2014 has been a challenging year and that the STIP financial targets have not been met, the personal performance objectives of the executive directors have been satisfied to the extent shown above, and STIP awards should vest on this basis.
A full listing of personal performance objectives has not been provided owing to commercial sensitivity, however, the following is a summary of the conditions applying to each executive director.
Mr Youngs personal performance objectives related to transforming execution capability e. g. through successful implementation of the Meggitt Production System, shaping the business for competitive advantage, positioning for future growth e. g. progressing technology projects and ensuring best practice governance e. g. health and safety improvements at sites.
Mr Webbs personal objectives related to assessing the Groups strategic financial planning and capital allocation priorities, delivering sustainable cost improvements, implementing a mid-life ERP effectiveness programme, delivering a cyber-security risk reduction programme and shaping the business for competitive advantage.
Mr Greens personal objectives related to continued enhancement of the risk management programme, continued improvement of health, safety and environment standards, implementation of the US Department of States Consent Agreement and enhancing the import compliance and ethics programmes.

The remaining 25% of the award was dependent on the Groups TSR performance compared to a group of 17 international aerospace and defence companies over the three-year period to 17 August 2014.
TSR for all comparator companies is measured on a common currency basis.

Under the MPP, Mr Young and Mr Green accrued defined benefits at 3% of salary per annum up to the Scheme Cap and were entitled to a cash supplement equivalent to 50% of salary above the Scheme Cap.
Since reaching the governments Lifetime Allowance in April 2012, Mr Young and Mr Green ceased accruing further benefit under the MPP and received a 50% pension allowance on their full salary.
Mr Young and Mr Greens dependants remain eligible for dependants pensions and the payment of a lump sum on death in service.
Mr Webb receives a pension allowance of 25% of base salary, but is not a member of any defined benefit or defined contribution pension scheme operated by the Group.
The pension allowance payments made in 2014 are included in the single total figure of remuneration table.

He has not drawn his pension.
Percentage change in CEO cash remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in remuneration for all executive employees.
We have selected our executive population around 300 people for this comparison because it is considered to be the most relevant, due to the structure of total remuneration: most of our senior executives receive benefits under the same STIP and LTIP structure as our CEO.
For 2013, the figures comprise elements paid to Mr T Twigger before his retirement from the Board in May 2013 and payments made to Mr S G Young from his appointment as CEO since May 2013.
2 The base salary for executive employees is calculated using the increase in the earnings of full-time executive employees using a consistent set of employees.
3 For benefits, this information is not collected for the executive employee population and is therefore estimated from a sample of executive employees, using a consistent set of employees.
4 For STIP, the increase is estimated as at 13 February 2015 as the validation processes for personal performance ratings for executive employees below the level of the Board and Executive Operations Boards is not yet complete.
To the extent there is a significant variation between the actual outcome and the estimate, this will be declared in the 2015 Directors remuneration report.

A fide minimis of 10,000 applies to all disclosures under this note.
Review of past performance The remuneration package is structured to help ensure alignment with shareholders.
There is no direct correlation between share price movement and the change in the value of the pay package in any one year as the remuneration package comprises several components, some fixed, and others based on non-financial measures.
The graph and table below show how the CEOs pay has been sensitive to the share price over the last six years.
This graph illustrates the Groups performance compared to the FTSE100 Index, which is considered the most appropriate broad equity market index against which the Groups performance should be measured.
Performance, as required by legislation, is measured by TSR over the six-year period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2014: 450 Meggitt 400 FTSE 100 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 Year 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 The table below details the CEOs single total figure of remuneration over the same period: 2 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Mr S G Young Single total figure of remuneration 000 1,296 1,232 1 STIP outcome % of maximum 39% 33% 1 EPP vesting % of maximum 38% 0% 1 ESOS vesting % of maximum 76% 0% Mr T Twigger Single total figure of remuneration 000 1,758 2,947 4,252 3,812 1,845 1 STIP outcome % of maximum 86% 86% 100% 80% 35% 1 EPP vesting % of maximum 0% 50% 69% 88% 56% 1 ESOS vesting % of maximum 100% 100% 100% 100% 98% 1 The outcomes are for those awards which are included in the single figure of remuneration for that year.

Base salaries were reviewed in early 2015 and, effective 1 April 2015, will be as follows for the executive directors: 2015 2014 000 % change 000 Mr S G Young 677 2.0 664 Mr D R Webb 449 2.0 440 Mr P E Green 361 5.0 344 For context, salary adjustments across the Group vary from region to region according to local salary inflation: in the UK and the US the average salary adjustment will be 2%.
Mr Green assumes additional responsibilities in 2015, including for the commercial contracts function.
The Committee therefore agreed to increase his salary by 5% in recognition of this change in role and in view of his salary continuing to be below competitive levels.
Pension and benefits There were no changes in pension contribution rates or benefit provision.
2015 STIP measures STIP measures for 2015 are based on underlying operating profit one third, free cash flow one third and personal performance one third.
The definition of profit for the purposes of this target has been changed for 2015 from underlying profit before tax to underlying operating profit because it is considered by the Committee to be more aligned to the metrics used to monitor our business units and therefore more relevant to STIP participants.
The STIP targets for 2015, together with details of whether they have been met, will be disclosed subject to commercial sensitivity in the 2015 Directors remuneration report.
The opportunity is in line with the Policy disclosed on page 57.
2015 LTIP measures The executive directors will be granted awards under the LTIP in 2015, the vesting of which will be subject to the measures and targets set out in the table below.
A number of the strategic measures have agreed annual schedules and, to ensure that the LTIP targets for these measures remain relevant and stretching over the entire three-year performance period, targets for these measures will be set as three sets of annual targets i. e. at the start of each year and measured over a 12-month period.
Therefore, the quality and delivery targets shown below are effective for year 1 of the 2015 LTIP award, and also for year 2 of the 2014 LTIP award.
In determining the final vesting outcome at the end of each LTIP cycle, the Committee will consider performance over the three-year performance period for each strategic measure.
Vesting of the LTIP awards will be subject to the following measures and targets: Weighting Measure Threshold Mid-point Stretch 33.3% Underlying EPS pence three-year aggregate equivalent to CAGR range of 5.5 to 10% 108.3 113.6 119.1 33.3% ROTA average over three years 23.4% 25.4% 27.4% 2 Quality % sites on target 57.0% 71.0% 86.0% 2 Delivery % sites on target 36.0% 50.0% 65.0% Execution Meggitt Production Average status 2.0 3.0 4.0 System per schedule 1 Strategic measures 33.3% Organic revenue % organic revenue 5.0% 6.5% 8.0% average over three years growth growth CAGR over 3 years Growth Programme Average status 2.0 3.0 4.0 management per reviews Innovation Schedule Average status 2.0 3.0 4.0 per schedule 1 Performance aga inst each strategic measure will be assessed at the end of the three-year period against a scale of: 1.0 threshold objective not met 2.0threshold met 3.0on target 4.0stretch objective met 5.0stretch objective exceeded 2 The targets set out above on quality and delivery apply to year 1 of the 2015 LTIP award and year 2 of the 2014 LTIP award.

As part of the selection process, the Chairmans fee was reviewed and it was agreed that it would be appropriate to review the fee against a benchmark based on Chairman fees at other FTSE 100 companies, and for the fee to reflect Sir Nigel Rudds extensive experience at Board level across multiple industries.
With his prior role as a non-executive director of BAE Systems, and current exposure to the industry at BBA Aviation, Sir Nigel has exceptional knowledge of the aerospace sector.
His experience across a wide range of businesses and expertise will be of significant benefit to the Group and make him ideally positioned to be the next Chairman.
It was also agreed that Sir Nigel Rudd will receive additional benefits of 20,000 per annum for secretarial and car services needed for business purposes.
