Board report on remuneration Introduction As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee the Committee and on behalf of the Board of Directors I am pleased to present our Board report on remuneration, based on the policy and disclosure requirements on directors remuneration, as required by the Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 the Regulations.
Last year saw significant change to the public disclosure of remuneration for executive directors.
At the 2014 AGM, Bodycote put forward its Remuneration Policy for a binding shareholder vote and received overwhelming support, with 96% of shareholders voting in favour of our policy.
Consistent with last year, this report consists of two sections.
The first part Section A summarises the policy of the Board with regard to the remuneration of the directors and is a re-statement of the Remuneration Policy that was approved at the 2014 AGM.
The second part Section B describes how the policy was implemented in 2014 and how it will be implemented in 2015.
Section B will be subject to an advisory vote.
It is intended that Section A will be put forward to shareholders again at the 2017 AGM and Section B will continue to be put to the AGM each year on an advisory basis.
2014 performance and remuneration outcomes 2014 has been another successful financial year for Bodycote.
While Group revenue decreased by 1.7%, there was an increase of 4.0% at constant exchange rates.
Headline operating profit grew by 3.4% and headline earnings per share increased by 6.3% in 2014, compared to an indicative increase of 3.9% in the FTSE 250 as a whole.
2014 base salary increases for the Executive Directors in the year were 3.0% for the Group Chief Executive and 3.0% for the Group Finance Director.
These increases compare to average 2014 salary increases across the Group of 2.9%.
Annual bonuses for the Executive Directors, which are based on a mix of Group headline operating profit, Group headline operating cash flow and personal strategic objectives, paid out at 94.3% and 71.1% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director respectively equivalent to 72.5% and 71.1% of maximum opportunity.
Awards under the Co-investment Plan CIP made in May 2011 vested in May 2014 at 100% of maximum based on absolute Total Shareholder Return TSR growth in the three financial years ending April 2014.
Awards under the Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP made in February 2012 are due to vest in March 2015 at 44.3% of maximum based on a combination of return on capital employed ROCE and headline earnings per share EPS growth for the three financial years ended December 2014.
Changes to remuneration arrangements Following a contractual review of pension provision during 2013, the Committee decided that the level of salary supplement in lieu of pension for Stephen Harris should be adjusted to 25% of salary.
For David Landless, the salary supplement in lieu of pension was adjusted to 25% of basic salary, up to the defined benefit pension scheme cap.
The amount paid above that cap remained at 16% of basic salary.
The changes came into effect on 1 April 2014.
Our Chairman, Alan Thomson, elected to forgo an inflationary increase in fees in 2013.
Therefore, Mr Thomsons fees have remained unchanged at 150,000 for the past two years.
It was decided that with effect from 1 January 2014, the Chairmans fee would be increased to 160,000.
This decision was taken so that Mr Thomsons fees reflect the full scope of his role and responsibilities.
During the year, the Committee considered the revisions made to the UK Corporate Governance Code produced by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2014.
At this time, the Committee is satisfied that Bodycotes existing Remuneration Policy continues to comply with the Code.
The Committee will continue to review ongoing developments in UK corporate governance and how these might impact Bodycotes Remuneration Policy.
As the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors was approved at the 2014 AGM, no changes have been made to the remuneration framework and policy this year.
The decisions that we have taken this year have been within the framework of our existing Remuneration Policy, as approved by our shareholders.

Where relevant, we have updated how the policy will apply in 2015.
We have also updated the scenario charts, taking into account 2014 base salaries.
Remuneration Policy The objective of Bodycotes Executive Remuneration Policy is to provide remuneration that will reward and thereby retain talented people in the business and enable the recruitment of appropriately skilled and experienced newcomers.
Therefore, the Executive Remuneration Policy is to set levels that attract and retain the talent responsible for executing strategy while ensuring the Group pays no more than is necessary.
Executive Remuneration Policy The table below presents the Executive Director Remuneration Policy that was approved by Shareholders on 29 April 2014.
It is anticipated that this Remuneration Policy will apply for the period until the 2017 AGM.

Information on measures and weights that applied for 2013 and 2014 are shown on pages 61 and 62 of the Annual report on remuneration.
The Committee considers the performance conditions selected for the annual bonus to appropriately support the Groups strategic objectives and provide a balance between generating profit and cash to enable the Group to pay a dividend, reward its employees and make future investments: and achieve other strategic goals to drive long-term sustainable return.

In BIP determining the performance targets applicable to awards, the continued Committee takes into account the current and forecast performance for the business and its sector, along with broker consensus, to ensure stretch targets are set.
Targets for each award are set out in the relevant Annual report on remuneration.
Targets that apply to awards made in 2014 are shown on page 62 of the Annual report on remuneration.
The Committee considers the performance conditions selected for the BIP to appropriately underpin the Groups strategic objectives.
Due to the nature of the Groups activities, the Committee consider ROCE to provide shareholders with an appropriate measure of how well the Group is performing and is being managed, while headline EPS provides a measure of the level of value created for shareholders.
ROCE and headline EPS are our top two KPIs as shown on page 62 of the Annual Report.
The Committee retains the discretion in exceptional circumstances to adjust the vesting outcome or the targets for awards as long as the adjusted targets are no less stretching.
In such an event the Committee will consult with major shareholders and will clearly explain the rationale for the changes in the Annual report on remuneration.
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect of the shares which vest.

Targets for the cycle vesting in respect of the year are disclosed in the Annual report on remuneration.
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect of the matching shares which vest.
The Committee considers it appropriate to use an absolute TSR performance measure for awards made under the CIP so that participants are incentivised towards and rewarded for providing absolute returns for shareholders.
CIP awards are subject to the Committees Malus Policy as outlined on page 55.

which Executive Directors are expected, within five years from To provide alignment appointment, to build up a shareholding in the Company.
The between Executive expectation is to hold at least 100% of basic salary.
For the purposes Directors and shareholders of this requirement, only beneficially-owned shares will be counted.
The Malus Policy provides the Committee with discretionary powers To provide the Committee to use malus performance-based remuneration, should exceptional flexibility to adjust circumstances occur.
This Malus Policy is in respect of annual remuneration levels in bonuses and long-term incentive awards.
Exceptional circumstances exceptional circumstances necessitating malus would include: Fraud: Misconduct: Significant misstatement of financial results: or Miscalculation of performance conditions.
Should the Committee, in its opinion, consider such circumstances to have occurred during a performance period from 2013 onwards then the Malus Policy will provide the Committee discretion to determine that any amounts paid or awards vested by reference to the relevant period shall be subject to malus.
Malus applies to awards made from 2013.
The Committee expects the mechanism to use malus for any such amounts will be to reduce future annual bonus payments, reduce the value of subsisting awards that have, at the relevant time, not yet vested or by reducing the level of award to be made at the following grant date.
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office, notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out on page 57, where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company.
For these purposes payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment being agreed at the time the award is granted.
Executive Directors remuneration is reviewed annually and takes into account a number of factors.
The Group adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the Group to pay any more than is necessary.
Senior and high performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, which are similar to those offered to the Executive Directors to ensure reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.

For the Group Finance Director: base salary of 318,591 and maximum potential benefits of 84,835.
Base salary reflects the base salary as at 1 January 2015.
Benefits reflect benefits received in 2014.
For on-target performance, an assumption of 60% of annual bonus is applied and vesting of 25% of the maximum for the BIP and 0.5:1 match for the CIP.
The value of the BIP and the CIP is based on the percentage of salary prior to the year of grant.
The actual value on vesting will depend on the share price on the vesting date, which is likely to be different from the date of grant.
The CIP assumes maximum contribution from the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
No share price increase has been assumed.
56 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2014 23846.02 9 March 2015 12:35 PM Proof 2 Recruitment policy When recruiting new executive directors, the Groups policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and experience appropriate to the role to be filled, taking into account remuneration across the Group, including other senior executives, and that offered by other FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar size and complexity.
New executive directors will generally be appointed on remuneration packages with the same structure and pay elements as described in the Remuneration Policy table on page 52.
Each element of remuneration to be included in the package offered to a new director would be considered separately and collectively in this context.
On appointment to the Board or for a non-executive director taking an executive role: Base salary levels will be set in consideration of the new recruits existing salary, location, skills and experience and expected contribution to the new role, the current salaries of other executive directors in the Group and current market levels for the role.
Pension will be considered in light of the retirement arrangements which are in place for the other executive director s, with a contribution level considered by the Committee to be appropriate in light of the new recruits package as a whole, market practice at the time and on a broadly equivalent basis to existing provisions for the other executive director s. Other benefits will be considered in light of the provision in place for the other executive director s. If it is in the best interests of the Group and shareholders, the Committee may consider providing additional benefits, potentially including relocation costs, tax equalisation or advisers fees.
The initial notice period may be longer than the Groups one year policy up to a maximum of two years.
However, this will reduce by one month for every month served, until the Groups policy position is reached.
For annual bonus, the Group would consider whether it was appropriate for the new recruit to participate in the same annual incentive plan applicable to the current executive directors.
If this was considered appropriate, the same financial measures, weighting, payout scale and target as well as maximum bonus opportunity as a percentage of salary which apply to the existing director s would generally apply to the new recruit.
The Committee will determine when long-term incentive awards will be granted during the year.
The Group is required to set out the maximum amount of variable pay which could be paid to a new director in respect of his recruitment.
In order to provide the Group with sufficient flexibility in a recruitment scenario, the Committee has set this figure as 450% of base salary.
This covers the maximum annual bonus and the maximum face value of any long-term incentive awards.
This level of variable pay would only be available in exceptional circumstances, and in order to achieve such a level of variable pay, stretching targets would need to be met.
For the avoidance of doubt, this 450% variable pay limit excludes the value of any buy-out payments or awards associated with forfeited awards.
For an external appointment, although there are no plans to offer additional cash and or share-based payments on recruitment, the Committee reserves the right to do so when it considers this to be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders.
Such payments may take into account remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attached to that remuneration.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buy-out awards which will be forfeited on leaving the previous employer.
Our approach to this is to carry out a detailed review of the awards which the individual will lose and calculate the estimated value of them.
In doing so, we will consider the vesting period, the option exercise period if applicable, whether the awards are cash or share-based, performance-related or not, the Groups recent performance and payout levels and any other factors we consider appropriate.
If a buy-out award is to be made, the structure and level will be carefully designed and will generally reflect and replicate the previous awards as accurately as possible.
We will make the award subject to appropriate malus provisions in the event that the individual resigns or is summarily terminated within a certain timeframe.
An explanation will be provided at the time of recruitment of why a buy-out award has been granted.
Shareholders will be informed of any director appointment and the individuals remuneration arrangements as soon as practicable following the appointment via an announcement to the regulatory news services.
Fee levels for a new Chairman or new non-executive directors will be determined in accordance with the policy set on page 52.
Termination Remuneration Policy It is the Groups policy that executive directors have service contracts with a one-year notice period and terminable by one years notice by the employer at any time, and by payment of one years basic salary and other fixed benefits in lieu of notice by the employer.
All future appointments to the Board will comply with this requirement.
Currently, under the terms of the executive directors contracts, the Group may at its choice, in lieu of giving notice, terminate an executive directors service contract by making a payment equivalent to: One years annual base salary, 25% of base salary in respect of all other remuneration and benefits other than annual bonus and incentives, and annual bonus equal to the average bonus paid up to three years prior to the date of notice.
com 23846.02 9 March 2015 12:35 PM Proof 2 Additional information Financial statements Governance Strategic report Board report on remuneration continued Our policy is not to have a change of control clause in executive directors service contracts.
S. C. Harris does not have a change of control clause.
D. F. Landless service contract was agreed in accordance with what was considered best practice at the time of its execution in 2001 and provides for one years remuneration if his employment is terminated on a change of control.
This provision has been preserved.
To the extent that executive contracts are renewed, or new appointments made, the Committee will continue to adopt a policy of not having change of control clauses in service contracts.
In any case, legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic salary, annual incentives and benefits, which may arise on the termination of employment of any executive director, other than payments made on a change of control or for payments in lieu of notice.
In the event that an executive director leaves the Group, the Committees policy for exit payments is to consider the reasons for cessation and consequently whether any exit payments, other than those contractually required, are warranted.
On cessation of employment, awards under the BIP and CIP will lapse in full, unless the Committee in its absolute discretion determines otherwise.
In instances where the Committee determines that awards should not lapse in full, the Committee will consider the performance conditions applying to any unvested awards and the performance period which has elapsed.
Awards will usually be subject to some form of time pro-rating reduction to reflect the unexpired portion of the performance or deferral period concerned.
Awards that are subject to performance conditions will usually only vest to the extent that these conditions are satisfied.
Awards which do not lapse on cessation of employment may either vest at that time or on their originally anticipated vesting date.
On termination, the accumulated funds invested in the Bodycote Investment Incentive Plan further information on this long-term savings vehicle is available on page 61 will normally be released to the participant, subject to Committee discretion.
On change of control the awards will generally vest subject to performance and time apportionment as determined by the Committee and in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan.
Service contracts All directors service contracts are available for inspection at the Companys registered office.

It is the Boards policy that the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors fees are reviewed on an annual basis.
The fees for the Chairman are reviewed by the Board in the absence of the Chairman.
The fees for the Non-Executive Directors are reviewed by the Chairman and Executive Directors.
When reviewing fees, the primary source for comparative market data is FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar size and complexity, as appropriate.
The Committee seeks to recruit Non-Executive Directors with the experience and balance of personal skills that will make a major contribution to the Board and its committee structures, and, consequently, ensures that fees are set at a level that will attract such individuals.
The Groups policy is that the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive a fixed fee for their services as members of the Board and its Committees.
The fee structure may also include additional fees for chairing a Board Committee and or for further responsibilities for example, Senior Independent Directorship.
Fee levels take into account the level of time commitment, duties and responsibilities involved.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any incentive scheme.
In line with the Articles of Association, accumulative Non-Executive Director fees are capped at 500,000 per annum.

D. F. Landless was appointed a Non-Executive Director of Luxfer Holdings plc with effect from 1 March 2013 and retained fees for the year of 46,955.
In addition D. F. Landless was given 3,772 of Luxfer American Depositary Receipts valued at $70,084 at the date of grant on 30 May 2014.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Group adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the Group to pay any more than is necessary.
Senior and high performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, similar to the Executive Directors, to ensure reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when formulating Executive Director pay policy.
However, it does take into account information provided by the Human Resources function and feedback from employee satisfaction surveys.
In formulating Executive Director pay policy, the Committee receives information on all employee pay conditions throughout the Group.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views The Committee always welcomes the views of shareholders in respect of pay policy, in addition to those views expressed on behalf of shareholders by their respective proxy advisers.
The Committee documents all remuneration related comments made at the Groups AGM and feedback received during consultation with shareholders throughout the year.
Any feedback received is fully considered by the Committee and, where appropriate, amendments are made to the Remuneration Policy.

The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the advice provided on executive remuneration is objective and independent, and that no conflict of interest arises as a result of these services.
The Committee also received assistance from the Group Chief Executive and Group Company Secretary, although they do not participate in discussions relating to the setting of their own remuneration.
The Committee in particular consulted with the Group Chief Executive and received recommendations from him in respect of his direct reports.

Base salary The base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed on an annual basis.
As described in Section A: Directors Remuneration Policy, a number of factors are taken into account when salaries are reviewed, principally market level salaries payable in FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar size and complexity, and the individuals role, experience and performance.
The 2014 base salary increases and comparative figures can be found in the Remuneration Committee Chairmans letter.
Base salaries are reviewed in January every year.

D. F. Landless no longer participates in the Groups UK contributory defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes due to him prospectively reaching the lifetime limit.
Instead Mr Landless receives a salary supplement of 25% of basic salary up to the defined benefit scheme cap and 16% of basic salary above the cap, of which 63,287 was waived during the year.
Taxable benefits The Group provides other cash benefits and benefits in kind to directors as well as sick pay and life insurance.
These include the provision of company car or allowance and family level private medical insurance.

The plan is entirely cashbased to provide an alternative long-term savings vehicle for senior executives.
The Committee considers the plan an essential tool to aid retention while recognising the need for executives to have flexibility in long-term financial planning.
Group contributions are discretionary, vary year-on-year and are made in lieu of other elements of pay and therefore are cost neutral to the Group.
Any risk in relation to the value of investments made in the plan is borne entirely by participants.
Annual performance-related bonus Retrospective disclosure of 2013 annual bonus targets In last years Annual report on remuneration, the Committee communicated its intention to retrospectively disclose information in respect of the 2013 annual bonus targets.
The table below provides details of the annual bonus awards received in respect of the Group and individual performances in the 2013 financial year.
The financial performance of the Group was strong in 2013.
Our reported revenues increased by 5.4% 3.0% at constant exchange rates and headline operating profit grew by 10.2%.
The actual payout, as a percentage of the total award, in respect of Group headline operating profit and Group headline operating cash flow, was 26.8% and 10.0% respectively.
The targets for Group headline operating profit and Group headline operating cash flow were 107.8m and 93.8m respectively.
The Committee also assessed the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Directors performance against their personal objectives, which included targets relating to safety, customer service and implementation of major projects.
The Committee concluded that personal strategic objectives were achieved on target at a level of 13.8% and 12.0% for the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director respectively.

These performance conditions and their respective weightings reflected the Committees belief that any incentive compensation should be linked both to the overall performance of the Group and to those areas of the business that the relevant individual can directly influence.
The performance of the Group during the year included headline operating profit of 111.1m a 3.4% increase on the previous year, 9.2% at constant exchange rates and headline operating cash flow of 100.0m an 8.2% decrease on last year.
In light of the above performance, the Committee concluded that 72.5% of maximum bonus is payable to the Group Chief Executive and 71.1% of maximum bonus is payable to the Group Finance Director.
As described in Section A: Directors Remuneration Policy, 100% of annual bonus is payable in cash.
Similar to the approach taken last year, it is the Committees intention to disclose information relating to the performance targets for 2014 annual bonus awards in next years Annual report on remuneration, unless disclosure of the targets would provide competitors with commercially sensitive information.
Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP Awards with performance periods ending in the year BIP awards made in 2012 had a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2014, with 50% of the award subject to satisfaction of a ROCE target and 50% subject to a headline EPS target.
The threshold and maximum targets along with the vesting schedule are set out in the tables below.

Over the period, ROCE was 20.7% and the headline EPS figure for the year of 43.8p represented growth of 6.3%.
This performance resulted in the ROCE and headline EPS targets being achieved at a level of 67.2% and 21.4% respectively.
This resulted in an overall vesting level of 44.3%.
The number and value of shares which vested to each of the Executive Directors is set out on page 65 of this report.
Awards made in the year BIP awards with a face value of 175% of salary were granted to both Executive Directors in April 2014 and will vest in March 2017, subject to the achievement of ROCE and headline EPS growth performance targets.
The performance period will end on 31 December 2016.
The vesting of these awards will be based on ROCE and headline EPS targets summarised in the table below.
The Committee has reviewed the performance targets and these have been altered accordingly to ensure that they remain stretching targets which underpin the Groups objectives.

The Committee has decided that the ROCE figure of 23% is a good aspiration for the Group and is cognisant of the fact that overdriving incentives on capital employed can lead to unintended consequences in terms of short-term capital under investment for the business.
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect of those shares that vest.
The number and value of shares that were awarded to the Executive Directors during the year is set out on page 65.
Co-investment Plan CIP Awards with performance periods ending in the year As described in Section A: Directors Remuneration Policy, CIP awards are subject to an absolute TSR target.
The CIP awards made in 2011 had a three-year performance period ending on 30 April 2014.
The absolute TSR performance targets applicable to this award are set out below.
Absolute TSR performance target Vesting level 4% CAGR CPI 50% 0.5:1 match 10% CAGR CPI 100% 1:1 match Over the three-year period, the Group achieved absolute TSR growth of 36.3%.

Implementation of policy in 2015 Base salary is reviewed on an annual basis.
The 2015 base salary increases from 1 January 2015 were 3.0% for the Group Chief Executive and 3.0% for the Group Finance Director.
As 2015 base salary increases for the Group are applied after the publication of this report, the comparative figure for 2015 can only be provided in next years report.
The comparative figure for 2014 is disclosed in the Remuneration Committee Chairmans letter on page 51.
The Committee does not intend to change the benefit arrangements for the Executive Directors in 2015.
For 2015 the Committee has determined that the annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors and senior executives will again be contingent on meeting targets relating to operating profit, cash management and personal objectives.
The Committee has reviewed targets for the year to ensure they remain appropriately stretching and relevant for the Groups business strategy.
The Committee will review the performance measures for awards under the CIP and the BIP in 2015 to ensure they remain appropriately stretching in light of the Groups expectations in relation to performance.
