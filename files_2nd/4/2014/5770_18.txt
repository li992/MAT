Governance Report on directors remuneration 79 Directors remuneration policy Remuneration philosophy and principles Experians remuneration philosophy for executive directors is that we should use reward to drive long-term, sustainable business performance.
The Committee therefore aims to have remuneration principles that are consistent with Experians business objectives and are designed to: drive accountability and transparency, and align remuneration with shareholders interests: provide a balanced portfolio of incentives, which align both short-term one-year and longer-term three-year performance, to deliver sustainable growth and value for our shareholders: apply demanding performance conditions to deliver sustained profitable growth across the Group, while setting these conditions with due regard to actual and expected market conditions: pay base salaries that are market-competitive and appropriate, given an individuals performance and experience, as well as the remuneration arrangements throughout the Group: deliver competitive benefits, to complement the other components of the remuneration package: provide competitive performance-related compensation, which influences performance and helps to attract and retain executives, by allowing them to earn commensurate rewards for outstanding performance that leads to long-term shareholder value creation: and strengthen the alignment with shareholders through share ownership guidelines that apply to both executive and non-executive directors.
These principles have underpinned Experians remuneration policy since it became an independent company in 2006.
The Committee considers that the policy has stood the test of time and is evidenced by Experians superior performance.
The Committee remains confident that the policy will continue to serve the interests of all of our stakeholders, through the strong performance and reward culture that we promote throughout our workforce.
In line with these principles, the Committee compares our remuneration arrangements with those of other relevant organisations and companies of similar size and scope.
The Committee also reviews our remuneration arrangements in light of market conditions, which have once again been challenging and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.
Performance-related incentives are targeted at upper-quartile levels, for achieving stretching objectives.
Long-term incentives are measured over a three-year performance period which the Committee considers is appropriate for the business and its strategic time horizons.
Our shareholding guidelines are set at high levels 300% for the Chief Executive Officer and 200% for the other executive directors to maintain the alignment of interests with shareholders over the longer term.
While the Committees primary focus is the executive directors remuneration, it also approves the remuneration structure for other senior executives and works closely with the Human Resources team to ensure a consistent approach.
When setting the remuneration policy for the executive directors, the Committee takes into account the pay, employment conditions and remuneration trends across the Group, especially when determining annual salary increases, although no specific remuneration ratios are used.
Although the Committee does not consult employees on executive directors pay or expressly include employees views in its deliberations, it is mindful of the results of our periodic global people survey which focuses, in part, on remuneration, reward and performance.
80 Governance Report on directors remuneration Directors remuneration policy continued Policy table The following table sets out the remuneration policy that will apply, subject to shareholder support, from the date of the 2014 AGM until the 2017 AGM at the latest.
The current long-term incentive plans expire in 2016 and hence we may need to amend the policy when we seek renewal of the plans.
The Committee will honour any commitments to make remuneration payments and payments for loss of office where the payment terms were agreed before the policy came into effect or when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the Committees opinion, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director.
For these purposes, payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
All contractual commitments or awards made which are consistent with the remuneration policy in force at the time the commitments were made will be honoured even if they would not be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitments are fulfilled.

similar size, international reach and complexity.
Notes The remuneration policy for executive directors, and indeed for around 600 members of our senior management, is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees.
This makes the greater part of their remuneration conditional on successfully delivering our business strategy and, in turn, high levels of corporate performance and shareholder returns.
This underpins the link between creating value for shareholders and the pay of our most senior leaders.
The performance measures used in the annual bonus and the long-term incentive plans are all financial or share-based.
The  process, which we use throughout Experian, assesses executives against both financial and nonfinancial objectives.
Performance against these individual objectives ultimately supports our financial performance, so the Committee believes it is appropriate that financial metrics remain the key measures.
These seek to ensure the underlying financial performance of the business, while clearly aligning shareholders and executive directors.
For all elements of variable pay, the growth targets are based on benchmarks that reflect stretching internal and external expectations.
These benchmarks include brokers earnings estimates, competitors earnings estimates, straight-line profit growth consistent with median or upper-quartile shareholder returns, latest projections for the current year, budget and strategic plan.
Targets are structured as a sliding scale with maximum rewards only payable for the achievement of significant levels of performance.
We use external consultants to calculate the extent to which the performance conditions have been met.
Governance Report on directors remuneration 83 Illustrations of the application of remuneration policy Set out below is the total remuneration for Brian Cassin that could result from applying our remuneration policy under three different performance scenarios.
Brian Cassin 000 100% 958 Fixed pay 30% 28% 42% 3,083 Target 12% 22% 66% 7,758 Maximum 0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 Fixed Annual bonus Long-term incentives The illustration above was produced for Brian Cassin as he is the only executive director who served during the year ended 31 March 2014 who will also be an executive director from 16 July 2014 when the remuneration policy takes effect.
Notes: The scenarios in the graph above are defined as follows: Fixed pay is base salary for the year ending 31 March 2015 plus the value of pension and benefits, as disclosed in the single total figure of remuneration for 2014.
Target performance is the level of performance required to deliver 50% of the maximum annual bonus, and 25% and 50% of the maximum PSP and CIP awards respectively, with the CIP matching award being based on 100% deferral of a target annual bonus.
Maximum performance would result in the maximum annual bonus payment and full vesting of the CIP and PSP awards, with the CIP matching award being based on 100% deferral of a maximum annual bonus.
All scenarios ignore share price growth and dividend equivalents.
Approach to recruitment remuneration Experian is a global organisation, competing for market share and executive talent in nearly 40 countries.
We are a leader in the information industry, where demand for talented leaders often outstrips supply.
Therefore, from time to time it is necessary to appoint high-calibre executives to the Board, either by recruiting externally or by promoting from within the Group.
The Committee does not believe in over-paying.
In developing a remuneration package for a newly appointed executive director, the Committee will look to set a base salary which takes into account factors such as the individuals skills and experience, the role the individual will be taking up, internal relativities, the marketplace in which the executive will operate and the individuals current remuneration package.
The incentive arrangements and benefits offered, including any relocation arrangements, would typically be in line with the remuneration policy set out in this report.
The Committee would also take into account the likely vesting and resulting value of any equity or other incentives that the new hire would be giving up.
In the case of an internal promotion to the Board, any existing variable pay element or benefit may be allowed to continue on the same terms.
The Committee has set the normal maximum level of variable remuneration on recruitment at 800% of base salary.
This is in line with the normal levels currently available under our variable remuneration structure, and covers the maximum annual bonus, the maximum face value of a matching award under the CIP and the normal maximum face value of an award under the PSP.
As detailed in the policy table in the Directors remuneration policy report, the rules of the incentive plans provide for award limits as set out in the following table: Award level Normal maximum Exceptional maximum Annual bonus 200% 200% CIP 400% 400% PSP 200% 400% SOP 400% When recruiting an executive director, the Committee would always seek to apply the normal maximum limits but may, in exceptional circumstances, make awards up to the higher limits if it felt it was necessary to do so in order to secure the appointment of a particular individual.
84 Governance Report on directors remuneration Directors remuneration policy continued In the case of an external appointment to the Board, the Committee may offer further one-off cash and or share-based remuneration, when an individual would be forfeiting remuneration awarded to them by their former employer.
In establishing the value and conditions attached to such remuneration, the Committee would seek to provide equivalence in value by taking into account the likelihood of vesting, and the timeframe in which such vesting was scheduled to occur.
Such awards may be granted under the terms of UK Listing Rule 9.4.
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office The policy for new hires is that service contracts will generally be limited to 12 months notice of termination of employment and will follow the UK Corporate Governance Code guidelines.
The Committee believes this policy is in line with best practice, remains market competitive and allows Experian to recruit key individuals who we identify as critical to our future performance.
The Committees policy for the treatment of executive directors leaving the Group subject to the current contractual commitments described below is set out in the table below.
For executive directors who leave the Group in other circumstances, the treatment will normally fall between the two treatments described.
In any event, the overall treatment will be subject to the Committees judgment.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments to discharge an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a directors office or employment.
Voluntary resignation or termination Other circumstances such as death, ill health, retirement, disability or redundancy or for misconduct or poor performance any other reason as defined by the Committee Base salary, pension Paid up to the date of termination and for Paid up to the date of death or leaving and for any untaken holidays as at that date.

Governance Report on directors remuneration 85 Current contractual arrangements Don Robert has a service agreement with Experian Services Corporation ESC dated 7 August 2006.
This agreement, which will terminate on his appointment as Chairman on 16 July 2014, provides that if ESC terminates his employment without cause, he is entitled to the following severance payments: continued payment of monthly salary for 12 months from the termination date: 12 months participation in welfare benefit plans in which he participated during his employment: and an annual bonus based on 100% achievement of objectives, payable in equal monthly instalments for 12 months.
The same amounts are payable by ESC if he terminates the contract: i following material breach by ESC: or ii for Good Reason following a change of control of ESC.
Good Reason means, during the six months following a change of control, a material and substantially adverse reduction or change in his position.
These terms are in line with US employment practice.
Don Roberts service agreement also provides for the following payments to be made if the agreement terminates in the event of his death in addition to payments due but unpaid before death : a pro rata annual bonus for the bonus year to the termination date, based on the Groups performance in that bonus year: and a lump sum equal to 12 months base salary, to be paid no later than 90 days after the date of death.
If the employment is terminated due to his disability, he is entitled to the bonus as described immediately above in addition to payments due but unpaid before the termination.
Any deferred compensation obligations will be governed in accordance with the relevant plan rules.
This is consistent with US employment practice.
Chris Callero has a service agreement with ESC, dated 11 June 2009, which is terminable by 12 months notice from either ESC or Chris.
There is no payment in lieu clause in his service agreement.
Brian Cassin has a service agreement with Experian Limited, dated 29 February 2012, and a new agreement that takes effect from 16 July 2014 on becoming Chief Executive Officer.
These agreements are terminable by 12 months notice from Experian Limited or six months notice from Brian.
The agreement provides for payment in lieu of notice base salary only.
Other than as described above, the service contract of each of the executive directors does not provide for any benefits on the termination of employment.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts but each has a letter of appointment with no provision for any termination payment.
Each appointment is for a renewable three-year term, subject to election re-election by shareholders, but may be terminated by either party on one months written notice six months notice in the case of the Chairman.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views In advance of the AGM, the Chairman of the Committee writes to our largest shareholders typically the 25 with the most significant shareholdings and investor representative bodies, such as the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds, to provide information on any changes to our remuneration structure.
Where requested by these shareholders, or bodies, the Committee engages in further discussion and clarification, to help them make an informed voting decision.
If any major concerns are raised, these are discussed with the Committee Chairman in the first instance, and the rest of the Committee as appropriate.
At its first meeting following the AGM each year, the Committee considers all shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM.
This feedback, and any additional feedback received during any meetings or from any correspondence, is then considered as part of the Committees annual review of remuneration policy, which normally takes place at meetings in November and January.
86 Governance Report on directors remuneration Annual report on remuneration The information set out in this section has been subject to audit except where specified.
Single total figure of remuneration Executive directors The following table shows a single total figure of remuneration for the executive directors, in respect of the year ended 31 March 2014.
Brian Cassins annual salary was 450,000 for the year ended 31 March 2013 but as he joined Experian on 30 April 2012, the salary shown in the above table is that paid in respect of that year.
2 Benefits Taxable benefits comprise the provision of life insurance, private healthcare, company car and participation in the US deferred compensation plan where applicable.
Don Robert also received an accommodation allowance of 250,000 in 2013 and 2014.
Brian Cassin received a cash supplement of 53,130 and 65,675 in lieu of part of his pension contribution in 2013 and 2014 respectively.
3 Annual bonus Awarded for the years ended 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2014.
Don Robert and Brian Cassin have made the maximum deferral, invested in Experian shares, under the CIP in both years.
Chris Callero made the maximum deferral in 2013 but is not deferring his 2014 annual bonus.
These invested shares are matched with an additional award of shares matching shares with the maximum match being calculated on the basis of two matching shares for each invested share.
The release of invested shares and matching shares is deferred for three years and the release of the matching shares is subject to performance conditions which are measured P89 over that period.
The performance conditions attached to the awards granted in June 2013 are set out in the section entitled Plan interests awarded during the year.
4 Share-based incentives The value earned through shares vesting under the CIP and the PSP.
For 2013 these awards were granted on 3 June 2010 and for 2014 they were granted on 15 June 2011.
The value of the share awards realised by Don Robert and Chris Callero in 2013 was calculated with reference to the prevailing share price on the date of vesting.
The share price was 12.04 at that date, which represented an increase of 89% from the date of grant.
As a result, US$8.3m of the single total figure for Don Robert and US$5.4m of the single total figure for Chris Callero was due to share price appreciation over the period from the date of grant.
The figure for Brian Cassin in 2013 related to the recruitment award of 158,261 shares granted to him on his joining Experian in April 2012.
While the shares vest in five annual tranches, between January 2013 and January 2017, their face value was recognised in full in the financial year in which they were granted, in accordance with the methodology for calculating the single total figure of remuneration.
For the share awards that will vest in June 2014, the value is calculated using the average share price from 1 January 2014 to 31 March 2014.
This was 10.83, representing a 38% increase from the date of grant.
As a result, US$3.2m of the single total figure for Don Robert and US$2.1m of the single total figure for Chris Callero was due to share price appreciation over the period from the date of grant.
Dividend equivalents that are paid on vested shares are also included in the above figures.
Further details of these are given below.
5 Pension Don Robert is currently provided with a defined benefit arrangement, the value of which is determined using the UK HMRC valuation.
Chris Callero and Brian Cassin participate in defined contribution plans and the company contribution to these is the figure shown.
Governance Report on directors remuneration 87 Additional requirements in respect of the single total figure of remuneration Performance against annual bonus targets The Committee set targets for the annual bonus based on profit growth in respect of the year ended 31 March 2014, which required stretching levels of performance to earn the maximum bonus.
The Committee considered a profit growth metric to be appropriate as it reflects one of Experians key performance indicators EBIT.
The Benchmark PBT growth, for bonus purposes, of 8%, was at the target level of the performance range.
Accordingly, a bonus equivalent to 100% of salary as against a maximum of 200% is payable to the executive directors.
The Committee considers that this level of bonus payment is appropriate in the context of the underlying performance of the Group.
The Committee has not disclosed the annual bonus target calibration for the year ended 31 March 2014 as this continues to be considered commercially sensitive.
Whilst we acknowledge that shareholders would like targets to be disclosed, the Committee believes that this is not in shareholders longer-term interests given that it would be damaging to the Company and useful to our competitors.
If the Committee decides that targets have ceased to be commercially sensitive, they will be disclosed in the next available remuneration report.
Don Robert and Brian Cassin have elected to defer 100% of their annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2014 into the CIP.
Chris Callero is retiring as a director of the Company with effect from 16 July 2014.
Vesting of share-based incentives The amount included in the 2014 single total figure of remuneration is the combined value of the CIP and PSP awards granted in 2011.
Vesting for both of these awards depended on performance over the three years ended 31 March 2014 and continued service until 15 June 2014.
The performance achieved against the performance targets is shown in the following tables.
CIP awards Vesting Percentage Performance measure Weighting No match 1:1 match 2:1 match Actual vesting Benchmark PBT annual growth 50% Below 7% 7% 14% 13.1% 46.8% Below Cumulative operating cash flow 50% US$3.0bn US$3.0bn US$3.4bn US$3.6bn 50.0% Total 96.8% Straight-line vesting between the points shown.

As these awards had not vested at the date this report was finalised, the value of the awards is based on the average share price of the last three months of the financial year, which was 10.83.
The value of the awards, as included in the single total figure of remuneration, is as follows.

These represent the value of the dividends that would have been paid to the owner of one Company share between the date of grant and the date of vesting.
Don Robert and Chris Callero will therefore receive dividend equivalent cash sums of US$616,707 and US$395,267 respectively, on the vesting of the shares on 15 June 2014.
Chairman and non-executive directors The following table shows a single total figure of remuneration for the Chairman and non-executive directors in respect of the year ended 31 March 2014.
Deirdre Mahlan and George Rose joined the Board on 1 September 2012 and the amounts shown in the above table for 2013 are their fees earned from that date.
David Tyler retired from the Board on 31 December 2012 and the amount shown in the above table for 2013 is his fees earned to that date.
Total pension entitlements As CEO, Don Robert was provided with benefits through a Supplementary Executive Retirement Plan SERP which is a defined benefit arrangement in the US.
The SERP pension is payable unreduced from Dons Normal Retirement Age which is age 60.
The benefit will be reduced for early payment on a basis determined by the Company which the scheme actuary has confirmed to be reasonable.
The table below shows Dons defined benefit pension entitlements in respect of benefits from registered schemes and nonregistered arrangements.

Column 3 is the increase in pension entitlement built up during the period using the HMRC calculation method with a valuation factor of 20.
The calculation allows for inflation over the period in line with September 2013 CPI and the amount shown is net of the directors contributions.
The pension input amount net of directors contributions for the prior four years was as follows: 2013 : US$807, 000 2012 : US$869,000 201 1 : US$952,000 2010 : US$726,000 Four former directors of Experian Finance plc formerly GUS plc receive unfunded pensions from the Group.
Three of the former directors are now paid under the Secured Unfunded Retirement Benefit Scheme, which provides security for the unfunded pensions of executives affected by the UK HMRC earnings cap.
The total unfunded pensions paid to the former directors was 390,000 in the year ended 31 March 2014.
Governance Report on directors remuneration 89 Plan interests awarded during the year On 6 June 2013 awards were granted to the executive directors under the CIP and the PSP.
The face value of awards to Don Robert and Chris Callero are given in US dollars, using the average exchange rate for the three days prior to grant of 1:US$1.53, and the face value of Brian Cassins award is in pounds sterling.
In line with the rules of the Experian Co-investment Plan, invested shares for Brian Cassin were purchased with his bonus net of tax.
In line with the rules of the Experian North America Co-investment Plan, invested shares for Don Robert and Chris Callero were calculated with reference to their gross bonus.
The matching awards are based on the gross value of the bonus deferred.

All outstanding share awards have a clawback feature whereby the vesting of awards is subject to the Committee being satisfied that the vesting is not based on financial results which have been materially misstated.
In addition, the Committee has the discretion to vary the level of vesting, if it considers that the level of vesting determined by measuring performance is inconsistent with the Groups actual underlying financial and operational performance.
90 Governance Report on directors remuneration Annual report on remuneration continued Payments to former directors There were no payments to former directors in the year ended 31 March 2014.
Payments for loss of office There were no payments for loss of office in the year ended 31 March 2014.
Statement of directors shareholding and share interests The Committee believes it is important that executives build up a significant holding in Experian shares, to align their interests with those of shareholders.
Therefore, the Committee has established guidelines under which the Chief Executive Officer should hold the equivalent of three times his base salary in Experian shares and other executive directors should hold two times their base salary including invested shares held under the CIP.
Until the shareholding guideline is met an executive director is expected to retain at least 50% of any shares vesting net of tax under a share award.
Unvested shares are not taken into account in determining whether the guideline has been met.
Don Robert and Chris Callero significantly exceed these guidelines.
Brian Cassin is building his shareholding up to the level required by the guidelines.
Experian also has guidelines for its non-executive directors to build up a holding in the Companys shares equal to their annual fee.
Each financial year the first quarters net fee is used to purchase Experian shares until they reach this holding.
The interests of the directors and their connected persons in the Companys ordinary shares are shown below.
Shares are valued for these purposes at the closing share price on 31 March 2014 which was 10.81.

4 Shareholding guidelines have been calculated using the closing exchange rates at 31 March 2014 of 1:US$1.66 and 1:1.21.
5 The number of Experian shares held by Don Robert and Chris Callero at 31 March 2014 includes 559,510 and 358,229 shares respectively awarded to them under the Experian North America Co-investment Plan in lieu of annual bonus, in addition to their personal beneficial shareholding.
Don Robert and Chris Callero have an unconditional right to receive these Experian shares at the end of the relevant three-year deferral period.
These shares do not carry dividend or voting rights prior to receipt.
6 Don Robert was granted 132,091 options with an exercise price of 4.83 on 31 March 2005 and which are exercisable between 31 May 2008 and 30 May 2015 when they lapse.
On 2 June 2006, he was granted 133,184 options with an exercise price of 5.21, which are exercisable between 2 June 2009 and 1 June 2016 when they lapse.
7 The number of Experian shares held by Brian Cassin at 31 March 2014 includes 29,947 invested shares in the Co-investment Plan.
8 As a result of the increase in NED fees during the year, the value of Deirdre Mahlans shareholding at 31 March 2014 is slightly under the shareholding guideline.
This will be reviewed again at the time of payment of the fee in June 2014 and this will be used to purchase further shares, if necessary, at that time.
Executive directors non-executive directorships Don Robert served as a non-executive director of Compass Group plc during the period under review, for which he received a fee of 81,000 2013: 81,000.
Performance graph and table not audited The chart below shows Experians five-year annual TSR performance against the FTSE 100 Index.
The FTSE 100 Index is the most appropriate index against which TSR should be measured, as it is widely used and understood and is an index of which Experian is a constituent.
Value of 100 invested in Experian and the FTSE 100 on 31 March 2009 300 250 200 150 100 March 09 March 10 March 11 March 12 March 13 March 14 Experian FTSE 100 Index 92 Governance Report on directors remuneration Annual report on remuneration continued CEOs remuneration in last five years Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 CEOs total single figure US$000 6,729 5,714 23,206 22,974 16,846 Bonus % of maximum achieved 100% 98% 100% 75% 50% PSP and CIP matching awards % of maximum vesting 70% 100% 100% 94% On the demerger from GUS plc in 2006, outstanding awards were automatically rolled over into awards over Experian shares.
In order to provide a lock-in mechanism at that time, Don Roberts awards were structured to vest in 2010 and 2011 although their performance periods ended in 2009.
In calculating the single figures above, the prescribed methodology requires that the value of any awards is included in the financial year in which the relevant performance period ends.
The value of the awards described above, therefore, would be included in the single figure for 2009 and not in 2010 or 2011 when the awards vested.
For this reason, the above figures for 2010 and 2011 are lower.
In the single figure for 2012, 75% of the value was realised through the vesting of long-term equity incentives.
Over the relevant performance period for those awards, the Companys TSR was 148%.
In 2013, the proportion of value realised through long-term equity incentives was 78% and the Companys TSR over the performance period of those awards was 91%.
The breakdown and explanation of the 2014 total single figure is given earlier and 71% of the value was realised as a result of the vesting of long-term equity incentives.
The Companys TSR over the performance period of those awards was 49%.
Percentage change in CEOs remuneration not audited The table below shows the percentage change in the CEOs salary, benefits and annual bonus between 2013 and 2014 and how this compares to the average percentage change for our UK and Ireland employees.
The figures for UK and Ireland employees reflect average salaries and average employee numbers each year.
The annual bonus figure includes sales incentive plans.
The Committee has selected employees in the UK and Ireland to illustrate the comparison because Experian is a UK-listed company and it avoids the impact of foreign exchange rates, the widely varying approaches to pay across the different regions and the complexities involved in collating remuneration data across different geographical populations.
Base salary Taxable benefits Annual bonus Total CEO 2.9% 3.0% 31.4% 15.5% UK and Ireland employees 2.0% 3.1% 13.7% 6.0% The UK and Ireland budgeted annual salary increase for the year ended 31 March 2014 was 3.0%.
However, the impact of reduced headcount on average salary has reduced the overall growth to 2.0%.
Similarly, this has had an impact on the taxable benefits figure.
Relative importance of spend on pay not audited The table below illustrates the relative importance of remuneration spend for all employees compared to the financial distributions to shareholders, through dividends and earnings-enhancing share repurchases, over the same period.
2014 2013 USD$m USD$m % change Employee remuneration costs 1,830 1,835 0.3% Dividends paid on ordinary shares 349 322 8.4% Estimated value of earnings-enhancing share repurchases 191 14 1,264.3% Over the year ended 31 March 2014 the number of full time equivalent employees fell by 1.7%.
Whilst overall remuneration costs fell, as shown in the table, the average cost per employee rose by 1.6%.
Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in the following financial year not audited The remuneration policy will take effect from the AGM on 16 July 2014 and will be in line with the policy we implemented during the year ended 31 March 2014.
For clarity, the same policy which applied for the year ended 31 March 2014 will apply for the period between 1 April 2014 and the AGM.
Salary and fees The salaries that apply from the start of the year ending 31 March 2015 are set out in the following table: Salary to 31 March 2014 Salary from 1 April 2014 Don Robert US$1,595,000 US$1,595,000 Chris Callero US$1,015,000 US$1,015,000 Brian Cassin 462,500 462,500 Governance Report on directors remuneration 93 Don Roberts appointment as Chairman is effective on 16 July 2014, at which point he transitions to a standard non-executive Chairman package under the policy with annual fees of 600,000.
No salary increase was made from 1 April 2014, given his change in role three months later.
This fee will be reviewed in April 2016.
Brian Cassin will be appointed as Chief Executive Officer on 16 July 2014.
At that point his salary will be increased to 850,000, to reflect his new role and responsibilities.
While this is a significant increase in salary, it is set at a level below that paid to Don Robert and reflects the fact that the primary market comparator for Brian Cassin, on appointment, reflected a heavier weighting towards UKlisted companies whereas the market for Don Robert was orientated more towards US and global companies.
In September 2013, the Board reviewed the fees of the non-executive directors, as it normally does every two years.
Based on supporting market data, the following fee increases were approved and were implemented from 1 October 2013.
The next review will be in September 2015.
Previous fee level Increase New fee level Base fee 125,000 7,500 132,500 Audit Committee Chairman fee 35,000 5,000 40,000 Remuneration Committee Chairman fee 27,000 5,000 32,000 Deputy Chairman SID fee 80,000 80,000 Non-executive directors required to undertake intercontinental travel to attend Board meetings receive a supplementary payment of 6,000 per trip, in addition to any travel expenses.
This amount is unchanged since October 2009.
Annual bonus Annual bonuses will be awarded for achieving profit growth targets which are measured on a sliding scale, whereby maximum bonuses will only be paid for achieving exceptional results.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose the performance targets for the forthcoming year in advance as these are considered to be commercially sensitive.
Whilst we acknowledge that shareholders prefer the public disclosure of such targets, the Committee believes that this is not in shareholders longer-term interests given that it would be damaging to the Company and useful to our competitors.
If the Committee decides that these targets are no longer commercially sensitive, they will be disclosed in the next available remuneration report.
CIP Don Robert and Brian Cassin have elected to defer 100% of their bonus into the CIP.
Matching shares, equivalent to 200% of the invested bonus, are expected to be granted in the first quarter of the year ending 31 March 2015.
These will vest subject to the satisfaction of the following performance conditions, which will be measured over a three-year performance period: Vesting Performance measure Weighting No match 1 :1 match 2:1 match Benchmark PBT annual growth 50% Below 7% 7% 14% Cumulative operating cash flow 50% Below US$4.0bn US$4.0bn US$4.4bn Straight-line vesting between the points shown.
These awards will be subject to a clawback feature, whereby the vesting of awards is subject to the Committee being satisfied that the vesting is not based on financial results which have been materially misstated.
PSP Awards equivalent to 200% of salary are expected to be granted in the first quarter of the year ending 31 March 2015.
These will vest subject to the satisfaction of the following performance conditions, which will be measured over a three-year performance period: Vesting Performance measure Weighting 0% 25% 100% Benchmark PBT annual growth 75% Below 7% 7% 14% TSR of Experian vs. TSR of FTSE 100 Index 25% Below Index Equal to Index 25% above Index Straight-line vesting between the points shown.
Vesting of these awards will be subject to the Committee agreeing that ROCE performance is satisfactory and, through a clawback feature, being satisfied that vesting is not based on financial results which have been materially misstated.

Chief Financial Officer CFO As announced on 29 April 2014, Lloyd Pitchford will join Experian, as CFO.
The Committee has agreed an annual salary of 525,000 on appointment and this will next be subject to review in April 2015.
His ongoing remuneration package will be structured in line P79 with the remuneration policy set out in the Directors remuneration policy report.
On leaving his current employer, Mr Pitchford will forfeit a number of long-term incentive awards and an element of annual bonus.
The Committees approach to compensating Mr Pitchford for his forfeited incentives was in line with its belief in not over-paying on recruitment and that any replacement share incentives buyout awards would take into account the likely vesting and resulting value of the share incentives that was being given up.
In agreeing the structure of the arrangements for Mr Pitchford, the Committees starting position was to replicate as closely as possible, in terms of structure and vesting dates, the share awards that were being forfeit.
However, the Committee was mindful of shareholders views that vesting periods should be a minimum of 12 months and that performance conditions should be applied to awards.
As a result, vesting of all of the awards being made to Mr Pitchford is subject to performance conditions and the vesting periods have been extended, in some cases significantly, beyond those of Mr Pitchfords existing awards.
Further information on how the buyout awards will be structured is set out below.
In the structure of buyout awards agreed, the Committee believes it has reached an appropriate balance between the views and concerns of shareholders and the commercial reality of hiring senior executive talent.
Full details of the actual awards made will be disclosed in next years Annual report on remuneration.
Recruitment awards to Lloyd Pitchford Lloyd Pitchfords historic share awards were as follows: awards vesting in March 2015, March 2016 and March 2017 with no performance conditions: and awards vesting in March 2015, March 2016 and March 2017 subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions based on earnings per share and TSR.
The share awards, to be granted when Mr Pitchford joins Experian, will be structured as follows: for the awards with no performance conditions, these will be replaced with grants of Experian share awards with a similar face value and, with the exception of the award due to vest in 2015, will vest on the normal vesting dates in March 2016 and March 2017.
The replacement award, for the original award vesting in March 2015, will vest 12 months from the date Mr Pitchford joins Experian.
The vesting of these replacement awards will be subject to satisfactory financial and business performance over the vesting period and the achievement of Mr Pitchfords personal objectives.
for the awards with performance conditions, these will be replaced with an award under the PSP in 2014.
This will be subject to the same performance conditions as other PSP awards made in 2014 and will vest at the end of the three-year performance period.
In establishing the magnitude of the replacement awards, an independent consultant was used to estimate the fair value of the outstanding awards such that this value could be replicated after taking into account the fair value of the Experian awards.
For the avoidance of doubt, no further awards will be made to Mr Pitchford under the Experian share plans until 2015.
Governance Report on directors remuneration 95 Annual bonus The Committee has agreed to compensate Mr Pitchford for the annual bonus he will be forfeiting by increasing any annual bonus payment due to him in respect of the Experian annual bonus plan, by an amount equivalent to a target bonus payment under his previous plan, on a time pro-rated basis.
For the avoidance of doubt, bonus payable under the Experian annual bonus plan will be subject to the same performance conditions as for the other executive directors and will be pro-rated to reflect Mr Pitchfords time in employment over the financial year.
Chief Operating Officer COO Kerry Williams will succeed Chris Callero as COO on 16 July 2014.
The Committee has agreed that he will remain on his current salary of US$900,000 and this will next be subject to review in April 2015.
His ongoing remuneration package will be structured in line with the remuneration policy set out in the Directors remuneration policy report.
Consideration by the directors of matters relating to directors remuneration In making its decisions, the Committee consults with the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Group HR Director.
Other members of the Global Reward team are also invited to attend Committee meetings as appropriate.
The Chief Financial Officer is also normally consulted in respect of performance conditions applying to short-term and long-term incentive arrangements.
No executives are present when their own remuneration arrangements are being discussed.
The Committee has access to independent consultants to ensure it receives objective advice.
Following a review and competitive tendering process in October 2013, the Committee appointed Towers Watson as external advisers, replacing Deloitte LLP who had advised the Committee since 2007.
Towers Watson provides other services to Experian globally which comprises advice on pensions, benefits, employee engagement and market data.
Deloitte LLP continued to provide unrelated advisory and tax services to the Group during the year.
In addition, Kepler Associates Kepler provided incentive plan award valuations and remuneration data in addition to supporting data for the target calibration process.
Kepler does not provide any other services to the Group.
Towers Watson, Kepler and Deloitte LLP are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such voluntarily operate under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
Accordingly the Committee was satisfied that their advice was objective and independent.
The fees paid to the current advisers for advice and services to the Committee in the year ended 31 March 2014 are set out in the following table.
Fees are based on hours spent: Adviser Fees paid in 2014 Towers Watson 40,510 Kepler Associates 24,750 Statement of voting at general meeting The voting to approve last years Report on directors remuneration at the AGM on 17 July 2013 is set out in the following table: Votes for including Total number Number of discretionary votes % of votes cast Votes against % of votes cast of votes cast votes withheld 592.2m 89.8% 67.5m 10.2% 659.7m 22.1m P85 As discussed in the section titled Statement of consideration of shareholder views, the Committee wrote to shareholders in advance of the AGM explaining changes to the remuneration structure and engaged with them, where appropriate, to discuss any concerns or to clarify their understanding.
After the AGM, a number of other shareholders who withheld their support were contacted in order to understand the reasons for their vote.
