The Committee will consider the Companys performance on environmental, social and governance issues when determining the overall reward for the Executive Directors, and has discretion to make adjustments as appropriate.
The Committee also retains discretion to make non-significant changes to the policy without reverting to Shareholders.
NOTES TO THE REMUNERATION POLICY TABLE Payments from existing awards Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment under any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the Remuneration Policy including under the existing LTIP.
LTIP awards Awards under the new LTIP may be structured in a manner which delivers tax advantages to the Executive Directors but the value delivered will be no greater than as set out in the table on page 75.
Selection of performance metrics The performance metrics used under the annual performance bonus are selected annually to reflect the Groups main strategic objectives for the year and reflect both financial and non-financial priorities.
The Committee continues to believe that ROCE reinforces the focus on capital efficiency and delivery of strong returns for our Shareholders, thereby further strengthening the alignment of managements incentives with SIGs strategy.
The Committee also continues to believe that underlying EPS is a key driver of long-term Shareholder value for SIG.
Performance targets are set to be stretching and achievable, taking into account the Groups strategic priorities and the economic environment in which the Company operates.
Targets are set taking into account a range of reference points including the Groups strategic plan and broker forecasts for both SIG and its peers.
The Committee believes that the performance targets set are very challenging and that the maximum outcomes are only available for truly outstanding performance.
Remuneration Policy for other employees Our approach to salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the level of responsibility, experience, individual performance, salary levels in comparable companies and the Companys ability to pay.
Remuneration surveys are referenced, where appropriate, to establish market rates.
Senior Managers participate in an annual bonus plan which has similar performance targets to those of the Executive Directors.
A limited number of Senior Managers also receive LTIP awards.
Performance conditions are consistent for all participants, while award sizes vary by organisational level.
All UK employees are eligible to participate in the SIP on the same terms.
Pension and benefits arrangements are tailored to local market conditions, and so various arrangements are in place for different populations within SIG.
Executive Directors participate in the same pension scheme as other senior managers.
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION The Committees policy is to set pay for new Executive Directors within the existing Remuneration Policy in order to provide internal consistency.
The Committee aims to ensure that the Company pays no more than is necessary to appoint individuals of an appropriate calibre.
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES To ensure alignment between Executive Director interests and those of Shareholders, the Company has established the principle of requiring Executive Directors to build up and maintain a beneficial holding of shares in the Company equivalent to a minimum of 200% of base salary.
Under normal circumstances it is expected that this should be achieved within five years of appointment.
It is anticipated that the satisfaction of this target will be mainly achieved by the vesting of shares through the Companys share plans.
com Stock code: SHI 76 23628.02 9 April 2015 12:21 AM Proof 6 External appointments In the case of appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing components of remuneration, as follows: Maximum annual grant Component Approach value Base salary The base salary will be determined by reference to the scope and responsibility of the position as well as internal n a relativities and current remuneration.
Where a new appointee has an initial base salary set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period of years, subject to the Executive Directors development in the role, which may result in above-average salary increases during this period Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may include but are not limited to a company car, n a medical and permanent health insurance Pension New appointees will be eligible to participate in the Companys defined contribution pension scheme or receive a n a cash equivalent payment SIP New appointees will be eligible to participate in the SIP n a Annual bonus The plan as described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant maximum being pro-rated 100% of salary to reflect the proportion of the year employed.
Targets for the personal element will be tailored to the role of the appointee LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other Executives, as described in the 200% of salary policy table The Committee may also make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer and may exercise the discretion available under the relevant Listing Rule to facilitate this, i. e. in the event that a different structure would be required.
In doing so, the Committee will ensure that buyout awards would have a fair value no higher than that of the awards forfeited and would consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, and the remaining vesting period of these awards.
Where, in the Committees opinion, awards forfeited are still subject at date of appointment to substantive performance conditions, any awards made in compensation will have SIG-specific performance conditions attached.
Internal appointments Remuneration for new Executive Directors appointed by way of internal promotion will similarly be determined in line with the policy for external appointees, as detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the Board, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements.
Incentive opportunities for below Board employees are typically no higher than for Executive Directors, but incentive measures may vary to provide better line of sight.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SERVICE CONTRACTS AND LEAVER CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISIONS AND POLICY FOR LOSS OF OFFICE The Committee sets notice periods for the Executive Directors including future Executive Directors at twelve months.
Subject to the considerations set out overleaf, the Companys policy is to limit termination payments to pre-established contractual arrangements.
In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
If employment is terminated by the Company, the departing Executive Director may have a legal entitlement under statute or otherwise to additional amounts, which would need to be met.
In addition, the Committee retains discretion to settle any claims by or on behalf of the Executive Director in return for making an appropriate payment and contributing to the legal fees incurred by the Executive Director in connection with the termination of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement as provided for overleaf and the individual must seek independent legal advice.
There is no provision in the Executive Directors contracts for compensation to be payable on termination of their contract over and above sums due in respect of notice and accrued but untaken holiday, and as outlined overleaf regarding bonus and LTIP.
Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.

80% of bonus was based on financial performance and 20% on the achievement of personal or strategic objectives.
For the financial performance element, 65% of bonus was linked to underlying PBT and the remaining 15% of bonus to working capital improvement, as measured through cash generation.
Further details of the bonuses paid, including Group and individual targets set and performance against each of the metrics, are provided in the tables below: Financial element outcomes Performance targets Weighting Actual Payout Measure % of salary Threshold Target Stretch performance % of salary Underlying PBT 65% 97.5m 102.5m 107.5m 98.1m 22.7% Year to 30 Jun 14 5% 10.0% 9.5% n a 9.2% 5.0% Working capital to sales % Year to 31 Dec 14 10% 9.7% 9.2% n a 8.1% 10.0% Total 80% 37.7% Personal element outcomes Executive Director Personal objectives for the year Payout % of salary S.

This was awarded in the context of their exceptional personal performance during the year and significant progress made across a range of strategic initiatives, particularly in relation to health and safety.

In the Committees view, the level of bonus paid to Executive Directors appropriately reflects the individuals and Groups performance in an exceptionally difficult environment.
Long-Term Incentive Plan: 2012 Awards On 26 April 2012, Mr. D. G. Robertson received an award of 299,145 nil-cost options under the 2004 LTIP.
Vesting of the award was dependent on three year average ROCE, defined as underlying operating profit after tax divided by average net assets plus average net debt representing two-thirds of the award, and three year cumulative underlying EPS performance representing the remaining one-third of the award.
There was no re-testing of performance.
The performance targets are illustrated overleaf: SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 83 23628.02 9 April 2015 12:21 AM Proof 6 GOVERNANCE Directors Remuneration Report ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED INCENTIVE OUTCOMES FOR 2014 CONTINUED ROCE element of the award 2 3rd EPS element of the award 1 3rd 100% 100% 0% 0% 9% 13% 30p 40p Average ROCE 2012-2014 Cumulative underlying EPS 2012-2014 For the ROCE element, if three year average ROCE over the three financial years ending 31 December 2014 is less than or equal to 9%, no shares will vest.
Awards vest in full for ROCE of 13% or higher and vesting is on a straight line basis between these two points.

Awards vest in full for cumulative EPS of 40p or higher and vesting is on a straight line basis between these two points.
Actual average ROCE was 9.23% and cumulative underlying EPS was 32.0p, which resulted in the vesting of c. 3.8% and c. 6.7% of the maximum award respectively.
10.5% of the total award will therefore vest on 25 April 2015.
Performance measure Actual performance Vesting outcome % of maximum Three year average ROCE 9.23% 3.8% Three year cumulative underlying EPS 32.0p 6.7% As disclosed in the Remuneration Policy, the Company has established the principle of requiring Executive Directors to build up and maintain a beneficial holding of shares in the Company equivalent to a minimum of 200% of base salary.
Executive Directors current holdings as measured against the guideline is disclosed on page 88.
Long-Term Incentive Plan: 2014 Awards On 18 September 2014, Mr. S. R. Mitchell and Mr. D. G. Robertson were granted awards under the LTIP of 466,628 and 280,817 shares respectively: details are provided in the table below.
The three year period over which performance will be measured will be 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016.
The award is eligible to vest in its entirety on the third anniversary of the date of grant i. e. 17 September 2017, subject to ROCE and EPS performance.

As in previous years, the ROCE and EPS targets have been calibrated with reference to analysis based on internal and external data and the Committees view of what it believes will provide an appropriate level of stretch.
In order to ensure targets remain commensurately stretching with what was intended at the outset, and also to ensure a fair outcome for both participants and Shareholders, the Committee has discretion to adjust the targets as appropriate, e. g. to reflect changes in capital, merger and acquisition activity, and any other reason the Committee determines at its absolute discretion.
Further, if such discretion is exercised, the Committee undertakes to disclose the rationale for its decision in the Annual Report on Directors Remuneration the following year.

IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2015 Base salary The Committee approved the following salary increases from 1 January 2015.
The average salary increase across each territory business for 2015 is between 1.5% and 2.0%.
2015 salary 2014 salary Executive Director % change S. R. Mitchell 558,250 550,000 1.5% D. G. Robertson 335,955 330,990 1.5% Pension and benefits The Executive Directors will continue to receive pension contributions of 15% of base salary and receive benefits in line with the policy.
Annual bonus The maximum annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors in 2015 will remain unchanged from the opportunity in 2014 of 100% of salary.
Following a review of the bonus plan, the Committee made an evolutionary change to the mix of performance measures to better support the Company ethos of Stronger Together.
Therefore, in 2015 the bonus will be linked 55% to Group underlying PBT, 20% to ROCE, 10% to HS&E, and 15% to personal objectives linked to Group Strategic Initiatives.
As was the case last year, the Committee has determined that performance targets will not be disclosed on a prospective basis for reasons of commercial sensitivity, but will be disclosed on a retrospective basis in due course when they are no longer considered commercially sensitive.
The Committee has further determined that, for 2015, financial performance in respect of the bonus will be measured based on budgeted exchange rates.
This approach is in line with prevailing market practice and will be consistently applied in 2015 and future years.
Financial performance in respect of 2014 was based on actual exchange rates during the year, in line with the previous approach.
Financial performance in respect of the LTIP will continue to be based on actual exchange rates, in line with market practice.

The Committee intends to make LTIP awards in September 2015, and will determine the appropriate measures and targets closer to the time and disclose them in the 2015 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Malus and clawback As mentioned in the Chairmans Letter, the Committee notes the requirement for malus and clawback in incentives in the updated UK Corporate Governance Code, and is taking steps to implement the changes.
The Company currently operates malus provisions and is additionally introducing clawback from the performance year ending 31 December 2015 i. e. payments from 1 January 2016 in respect of the annual bonus, and from awards due to be made in Autumn 2015 in respect of the LTIP.
Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees With effect from 1 May 2014, the fee payable to the Chairman of the Board is 165,000 p. a. and the basic fee payable to each Non-Executive Director is 47,484 p. a.
The fees payable for chairing the Audit and Remuneration Committees are 10,000 and 8,000 p. a. respectively.
The additional fee paid for being Senior Independent Director is 2,000 p. a. Non-Executive Director fees are reviewed in May each year.
PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN CHIEF EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION The table below shows the percentage change in the Chief Executives remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in remuneration for all other employees being the Senior Leadership team SLT.
To provide a meaningful comparison, the analysis includes only salaried employees and is based on a consistent set of employees, i. e. the same individuals appear in the 2014 and 2013 populations.
Given that the Company operates across a number of diverse economies with pay levels and structures reflecting local market conditions, the Committee believes that using the SLT as a subset for purposes of comparing Chief Executive pay against wider employee pay provides a more meaningful comparison than using pay data for all employees.
Based on the sum of remuneration paid to Mr. C. J. Davies up to and including 28 February 2013 and to Mr. S. R. Mitchell from 1 March 2013.
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SPEND ON PAY The table below shows the percentage change in total employee pay expenditure and Shareholder distributions i. e. dividends and share buybacks from the financial year ended 31 December 2013 to the financial year ended 31 December 2014.
