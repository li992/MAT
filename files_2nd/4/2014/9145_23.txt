In considering the revised remuneration arrangements for Haydn, the Committee took into account his experience, the complexity of the role, market comparators and the fair value of his overall remuneration.
Having taken into account these factors, the Committee considered it appropriate to appoint Haydn on the same terms as the outgoing chief executive and that it was not necessary to require him to serve a probationary period.
The Committee believes Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 67 Directors remuneration report continued that his overall remuneration is competitive, but is also Conclusion slightly below market median: I hope that you will find this new style of report helpful.

The Committee also decided not to Amanda Mellor pay the discretionary element of the bonus because of these safety issues: and Chair of the Remuneration Committee LTIP awards granted in 2011 were measured during the three-year period ended 30 June 2014 against challenging EPS and TSR targets.
As a result of performance against these targets, the executive directors will receive 32.7% of the award when it vests in November 2014.
Remuneration arrangements for the current financial year To ensure that the remuneration arrangements remain aligned with the Companys strategic priorities and stakeholders views, the Committee proposes minor amendments to the executive remuneration arrangements for the current financial year.
These are: Following discussions with shareholders, and having reviewed the LTIP performance measures to ensure that they remain appropriate, the Committee has decided to revert to the measures used since 2010 for future LTIP awards, namely EPS and TSR.
The performance period for the LTIP awards granted in October 2013 ends on 30 June 2016, which is also the end of the period in which the full annual run rate of synergies is expected to have been delivered from the acquisition of May Gurney.
As a result, the Committee considered that the May Gurney ROCE element would no longer be a relevant performance measure for future LTIP awards: and The focus on performance has been further emphasised by the introduction of a malus provision for LTIP awards granted from 2014, providing the Committee with discretion to reduce or cancel unvested awards in circumstances which it considers to be appropriate, including, for example, a material mis-statement of the Groups audited results.
The Committee decided that the awards under the annual bonus plan will remain at 100% of base salary, with one-third of any award being deferred into shares for three years.

Award sizes vary according to summary dismissal.
The Committee has the right to apply the malus provision to an individual or on a collective basis.
Executive director shareholding guidelines The Committee encourages executive directors to accumulate a shareholding in the Company of at least two years base salary over a period of up to five years.
Executive directors are encouraged to retain any shares allocated to them as part of the annual bonus arrangements and 50% of the shares allocated to them upon the vesting of LTIP awards net of tax until they reach this level of shareholding.
Selection of performance measures and approach to setting targets The measures used for the annual bonus are determined annually to reflect KPIs which are considered important and relevant to the Group.
The Committee believes that using a number of measures provides a balanced incentive.
The measures themselves are aligned to, and are designed to support the delivery of, the Groups strategy.
In relation to the LTIP awards, the Committee believes that the combination of EPS and TSR clearly aligns performance to shareholders interests and the Groups long-term strategy.
EPS is a key measure of long-term underlying performance of the Group.
TSR is intended to measure managements contribution to the creation of value for shareholders.
A revenue-weighted index based on the FTSE ASX Construction and FTSE ASX Support Services indices reflects the Groups mix of business.
In future years, the Committee may decide to select other performance measures.

The on-target remuneration stated assumes an annual bonus payment of 50% of the maximum opportunity and a threshold LTIP vesting 25% of the maximum opportunity.
The maximum remuneration stated assumes maximum performance is achieved and therefore awards under the annual bonus and the LTIP pay out or vest at their normal maximum level of 100% and 150% of salary, respectively.
No share price appreciation is assumed for LTIP awards.
Performance measures for the annual bonus and the LTIP awards relate to one financial year and three financial years, respectively.
Approach to remuneration on recruitment External appointment When recruiting a new executive director from outside the Group, the Committee may make use of all the existing components of remuneration.
In addition, the Committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under an alternative scheme or arrangement in order to facilitate recruitment of an individual, subject to the policy set out below: Component Approach Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and the appointees current base salary.
Where a new appointee has an initial base salary set below the market median, any subsequent adjustment will be managed by the Committee, using where appropriate phased increases and subject to the individuals development in the role.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with the remuneration policy, which may also include but are not limited to any necessary expenses relating to expatriation or relocation on recruitment.
SAYE Scheme New appointees will be eligible to participate on the same terms as all other employees.
AESOP New appointees will be eligible to participate on the same terms as all other employees.
Pension New appointees will receive pension contributions of up to 20% of pensionable salary into a defined contribution pension arrangement or an equivalent taxable cash supplement or a combination of both.
Annual bonus The annual bonus structure described in the remuneration policy will apply to new appointees including the maximum opportunity, pro rated in the year of joining to reflect the proportion of that year employed.
One-third of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares.
LTIP New appointees may be granted awards under LTIP of up to 200% of salary, as contemplated by the remuneration policy.
Buy-out awards The Committee may consider it appropriate to grant a buy-out award with respect to either a bonus or a share-based incentive scheme under an alternative scheme or arrangement in order to facilitate the recruitment of an individual.
When doing so, the Committee may, to the extent required, exercise the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.
Any such buy-out award would have a fair value of no higher than that of the award forfeited.
In granting any such award, the Committee will consider relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to the forfeited awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
When considering any performance conditions, the Committee will, where appropriate, take into account those used in the Companys own incentive arrangements.
Where appropriate, the Committee will also consider whether it is necessary to introduce further retention measures for an individual for example, extended deferral periods.
In determining an appropriate remuneration package, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that the arrangements are in the best interests of the Companys shareholders.
Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 73 Directors remuneration report continued The remuneration of the new finance director, Beverley Dew, will be within the terms of the policy on external recruitment and disclosed in next years annual report on remuneration.
Internal promotion When recruiting a new executive director through internal promotion, the Committee will set remuneration in a manner consistent with the policy for external appointments set out above other than with respect to buy-out awards.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to executive director level, the Company will continue to honour these commitments.
The remuneration of individuals below the Board is typically not greater than for executive directors.
Service contracts A summary of the key elements of the executive directors service agreements insofar as they relate to remuneration is as follows: Term of contract Summary of provisions Notice period 12 months notice both to and from the executive director.
Payment in lieu of Employment can be terminated with immediate effect by undertaking to make a payment in lieu of notice PILON notice PILON comprising base salary, accrued but untaken holiday pay, pension contributions or allowance, car allowance and private medical insurance.
The Company is entitled to make the PILON on a phased basis, so that any outstanding payment s would be reduced or stopped if alternative employment is obtained.
Change of control There are no payments due upon a change of control, although deferred bonus will be released.
Entitlements on There is no contractual entitlement to notice or any other payments in respect of the period after cessation of termination employment in circumstances in which the individual is summarily dismissed.
In such circumstances, deferred bonus shares will be forfeited and LTIP awards will lapse.
If the individual is not a bad leaver and any malus provision is not applied, deferred bonus shares will be released upon cessation of employment and the position with respect to LTIP awards is as set out under Payments for loss of office below.
If not required to take any remaining holiday entitlement during his notice period, the executive director will receive a payment for any accrued but untaken holiday entitlement.
It is expected that these terms will apply to any service agreements entered into with executive directors during the period in which this remuneration policy will apply.
Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 74 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Payments for loss of office The Companys policy on payments for loss of office is as follows: Component Approach Annual bonus Individuals who are considered to be good leavers may be considered for a bonus in relation to the year in which their active employment ceases.
Any payment will normally be pro rated for length of service and performance during the year.
However, the Committee retains the discretion to review the performance of the individual and the Group in general and, having done so, determine that a different level of bonus payment would be appropriate.
Deferred bonus shares will, typically, be released to the individual upon cessation of office, unless the malus provision applies.
LTIP If an executive directors employment ceases for reasons of death, ill-health, injury, disability, retirement with the agreement of the Company or his employing company ceasing to be a member of the Group or such other circumstances approved by the Committee, outstanding awards are retained.
The Committee may also at its discretion permit unvested LTIP awards to vest on an accelerated basis or alternatively be retained until the vesting date.
Unvested LTIP awards will, subject to Committee discretion, normally be pro rated for length of service during the performance period and will, subject to performance, normally vest at the same time as all other awards in the LTIP award cycle.
A malus provision also applies to all LTIP awards granted from 2014.
For all other leavers, outstanding LTIP awards automatically lapse, unless the Committee exercises its discretion otherwise taking into account the factors detailed immediately following this table.
AESOP and SAYE The executive directors are subject to the same leaver provisions as all other participants, as prescribed by the rules Scheme of the relevant scheme or plan.
Other If the Company terminates an executive directors employment by reason of redundancy, the Company will make a redundancy payment to the executive director in line with his service agreement, any applicable collective bargaining agreement and applicable law and regulation.
The Company may make a contribution towards an executive directors legal fees for advice relating to a compromise or settlement agreement and may also make other payments connected to the departure for example, for outplacement services.
With respect to any such payments, the Committee will authorise what it considers to be reasonable in the circumstances.
Change of control Deferred bonus shares will be released, any outstanding LTIP awards may vest early subject to the Committees discretion, having taken into account current and forecast progress against the performance condition s, the proportion of the vesting period which has elapsed and any other factors considered by the Committee to be relevant and the rules of the AESOP and the SAYE Scheme will apply.
No payments are due under the executive directors service agreements upon a change of control.
Where appropriate, the Committee will oblige the individual to Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere mitigate his her losses and either offset any alternative remuneration in the Group received by the individual against any payments made by the Employees are not formally consulted on the executive directors Company for loss of office or reduce any payments to be made by remuneration and were not consulted during the preparation of the the Company for loss of office to take account of any failure to remuneration policy set out above.

Any use of Committee discretion will be disclosed in the relevant annual report on remuneration.
Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 75 Directors remuneration report continued Consideration of shareholder views The views of shareholders, and guidance from shareholder representative bodies, are important to the Committee and provide the context for setting the remuneration of the executive directors.
The chair of the Committee and the chairman of the Company have met with a number of the significant shareholders during the year and their views have been taken into account when preparing the remuneration policy.
The Committee will keep the remuneration policy under regular review so as to ensure that it continues to relate to the Companys long-term strategy and aligns the interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders.
In addition, the Committee will continue to monitor trends and developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the structure of executive remuneration remains appropriate.
Non-executive director remuneration policy General The non-executive directors remuneration including that of the chairman reflects the anticipated time commitment to fulfil their duties.
Non-executive directors do not receive bonuses, long-term incentive awards, a pension or compensation on termination of their appointments.
The policy on non-executive directors fees is as follows: Element and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance measures Fees Fee levels are reviewed annually Fees may be increased in line Continued strong performance.
To attract and retain nonwith reference to individual with the outcome of the annual executive directors of the experience, the external market review and will not normally calibre required and with and the expected time exceed the increase awarded to appropriate skills and commitment required of the the wider employee population.
Higher increases may be awarded should there be Additional fees are payable to a material change to the committee chairs and to the requirements of the role, such as senior independent director.
Any changes to fees will be disclosed in the annual report on remuneration for the relevant year.
Recruiting non-executive directors When recruiting a new non-executive director, the Committee will follow the policy set out in the table above.
Non-executive director letters of appointment The non-executive directors do not have service contracts but have entered into letters of appointment with the Company.
The letters of appointment do not include any provisions for the payment of pre-determined compensation upon termination of appointment.
The effective dates of the letters of appointment of the non-executive directors at 30 June 2014 and the applicable notice periods are as follows: Director Effective date Notice period Richard Bailey 1 October 2010 1 month Amanda Mellor 1 December 2011 1 month 1 Phil White 1 July 2006 1 month Nick Winser 1 March 2009 1 month 1 Phil White assumed the role of chairman with effect from 2 January 2008.
Kirsty Bashforth became a director with effect from 1 September 2014.
Her letter of appointment contains a one month notice period.
No term is included in the non-executive directors letters of appointment.
Notice may be served by either party to the letter of appointment.
Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 76 Strategic report Governance Financial statements The annual report on remuneration This section of the report sets out the annual report on remuneration for the year ended 30 June 2014.
2 The award granted on 17 November 2011 will vest as to 32.7% on 17 November 2014.
Calculated by multiplying the number of shares receivable by the relevant director before deduction for income tax and national insurance contributions by the average middle market quotation of a share in the capital of the Company for the three months ended 30 June 2014 of 17.00.
3 The award granted in November 2010 vested as to 31.2% on 14 November 2013, as detailed on page 61 of last years annual report.
Calculated by multiplying the number of shares receivable by the relevant director before deduction for income tax and national insurance contributions by the middle market quotation of a share in the capital of the Company on 14 November 2013 of 17.19.
The value of these awards referred to in last years annual report was based on the three-month average share price for the period ended 30 June 2013.

5 Comprises the payment of employer pension contributions and or a cash allowance.
6 Chris Geoghegan retired from the Board with effect from 21 February 2014.
Annual bonus During the year ended 30 June 2014, the executive directors were eligible to receive a bonus of up to 100% of base salary.
Of this, a maximum of 55% was payable if the Group achieved certain profit performance targets and a maximum of 25% was payable if the Group also achieved certain cash performance targets.
Of the remaining 20%, 10% was payable if health and safety performance targets divided as to 50% for Kier performance and 50% for May Gurney performance, which are considered to be key non-financial performance measures for the Group, were achieved.
The remaining 10% was payable at the discretion of the Committee subject to an assessment of the executive directors performance.
One-third of any annual bonus awarded to the executive directors was satisfied in Kier Group plc shares and is subject to forfeiture in the circumstances set out in the policy table.
A similar approach is applied to the annual bonus arrangements for certain members of the senior management team.

Payments to past directors There were no payments made for the year ended 30 June 2014 to any person who was not a director of the Company at the time the payment was made but who had been a director before that time, other than the LTIP award granted to Ian Lawson which will vest on 17 November 2014, as described on page 78.
The values of the LTIP awards granted to Ian Lawson who ceased to be a director on 21 June 2013 and Richard Simkin who ceased to be a director on 30 June 2011 which vested on 14 November 2013, as disclosed in last years annual report, were based on a three-month average middle market quotation of a share in the capital of the Company for the period ended 30 June 2013.
Using the share price from 14 November 2013 of 17.19, Ian Lawsons award which vested in November 2013 is valued at 156,859 and Richard Simkins award is valued at 45,949.
Payments for loss of office As reported in last years report and accounts, Ian Lawson resigned from the Board on 21 June 2013, although he was employed by the Group until 21 September 2013 to assist with the integration of May Gurney.
Ian was entitled to 510,510 by way of a payment in lieu of his 12-month notice which began on 21 September 2013, payable in six monthly instalments until March 2014 and the balance in a lump sum in April 2014.
The payment comprised salary, pension contributions and pay in relation to accrued but untaken holiday.
It was agreed that all amounts payable would be reduced to the extent that, during the notice period, remuneration was obtained from alternative employment.
Ian obtained alternative employment with Severfield plc and, as a result, the total amount payable by Kier to Ian with respect to his notice period was significantly reduced to 136,010.
A statutory redundancy payment of 8,100 was paid to Ian, who also received a taxable benefit of 13,911 as a result of buying his car from the Company at written down book value.
The Committee decided that, in light of Ians long service with the Group in total, approximately 20 years, it would be appropriate for Ian to be paid his bonus for the year ended 30 June 2013 and to allow his LTIP award granted in 2010 to vest in November 2013 with his LTIP awards granted in November 2011 and September 2012 being pro rated for active service during the respective performance periods.
On 18 February 2014, it was announced that Paul Sheffield would stand down as chief executive with effect from 30 June 2014.
Under his service agreement, Paul was entitled to 12 months notice and it was therefore agreed that Pauls employment would terminate on the later of 30 June 2015 and the date, if any, on which he submitted a notice of resignation.
Pending such termination, Paul would remain on garden leave.
The Committee agreed that, up to and including 30 June 2015, Paul would be entitled to his salary and cash pension supplement, payable in monthly instalments, but that he would take all reasonable steps to obtain work outside the Group, so as to reduce the amounts payable by the Company during his notice period.
In July 2014, it was announced that Paul had obtained alternative employment with Laing ORourke, with effect from October 2014.
As a result, the monthly payments from Kier will cease in October 2014.
All payments made to Paul with respect to the year ending 30 June 2015 will be disclosed in next years annual report on remuneration.
In light of his long service with the Group, it was agreed that Paul would receive his bonus for the year ended 30 June 2014 and that his 2011 LTIP award granted would be permitted to vest.
However, no bonus will be payable to Paul in relation to the financial year ending 30 June 2015 and, although his LTIP awards granted in 2012 and 2013 will remain in place, they are subject to pro rating for active service during the performance periods.
Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 80 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Directors shareholdings and share interests The Committee encourages executive directors to build up a shareholding in the Company.

Following this feedback, a number of revisions were made to the original proposals, including: Phasing the salary increases for the finance director and the chief operating officer over two years: Making no change to the annual bonus opportunity which remained at 100% of salary : and Increasing the executive director shareholding guidelines to 200% of salary.
