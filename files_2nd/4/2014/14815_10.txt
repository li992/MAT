On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the Considered and agreed to start consultation with major shareholders on Directors remuneration report for the year ended 30 April 2014 prepared in matters of remuneration policy including proposals to introduce a compliance with the new UK reporting regulations.
The report comprises second condition based on targets for growth in earnings per share for three sections including the Directors Remuneration Policy in section 9.4, the long term incentive plan, and increasing the target shareholding and the Annual Report on Remuneration in section 9.5 following this guideline for Executive Directors.
Remuneration for 2013 14 Our approach to remuneration is to ensure that the key components are As regards the results for the year and payouts under the annual bonus plan, I consistent and easily understood, overall remuneration is not excessive and am pleased to say that the Group made good progress against its financial that the share based incentives and other elements of variable remuneration and strategic objectives.

9.3 Remuneration Committee The Committees principal function is to determine Stagecoach Groups policy on executive remuneration and to approve specific remuneration packages for its executive directors, and such senior members of the executive management as it is asked by the Board to consider, including their service contracts with the Company.
The Committee also has responsibility for making a recommendation to the Board in respect of the remuneration of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman.

pdf 9.4 Directors Remuneration Policy Report This section sets out the remuneration policy for executive directors and non-executive directors, which is subject to a binding vote of shareholders and will, if approved, formally take effect from 29 August 2014 the date of the 2014 Annual General Meeting.
The stated policy does, however, reflect our current practice, including changes applied from 1 May 2014.
1 Key principles of the remuneration policy In determining appropriate levels of remuneration for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee aims to provide overall packages of terms and conditions that are competitive in the UK and will attract, retain and motivate high quality executives capable of achieving the Groups objectives and to ensure that they are fairly rewarded for their individual responsibilities and contributions to the Groups overall performance.
The Remuneration Committee believes that packages for the Executive Directors should contain meaningful performance-related elements and that these performance-related elements should be designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors and other senior managers with the interests of shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee is able to consider all relevant factors when setting the Executive Directors remuneration, including environmental, social and governance matters.
Performance targets are established to achieve consistency with the interests of shareholders, with an appropriate balance between short-term and long-term targets.
Performance targets include financial measures as well as non-financial targets, such as environmental and safety objectives.
The incentive arrangements for the Executive Directors are structured so as not to unduly increase environmental, social and governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews the existing remuneration of the Executive Directors, making comparisons with peer companies of similar size and complexity and with other companies in the public transport industry.
Proposals for the forthcoming year are then discussed in the light of the prospects for the Group as a whole.
The Remuneration Committee is also kept informed of the salary levels of other senior executives employed by the Group.
The approach is consistent with that applied for the workforce in that we look to pay competitively with reference to the market rate for a job.
With regard to pensions, the Remuneration Committee has access to reports from pension scheme trustees and scheme actuaries regarding the cost of pension obligations.
We also consult our major shareholders in developing policy - see section 9.4.
2 Summary of remuneration policy for the Executive Directors This section of our report sets out in tabular form a description of each of the components of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors.
Other than the changes in the last column noted as being applicable from 1 May 2014, the components reflect the policy that applied in the year ended 30 April 2014.

condition will be applied, with one half of annual awards being made based on relative total shareholder return, and the other half based on targets set for a measure of earnings per share EPS over the three year period.
In setting stretching targets for the EPS based performance condition the Committee will take into account factors such as: The long-term expectations for the Group: Analysts consensus expectations: Market norms and the approach of peer group companies: The level of expected underlying inflation, such that any growth target should be positive and exceed inflation.
"For the Incentive Units awarded that are subject to the TSR condition, vesting will be as follows: If the TSR does not exceed the median of the comparator group, then none of the relevant Incentive Units awarded will vest and they will all lapse: If the TSR exceeds the median of the comparator group which is the ""threshold"" performance level, then one-quarter 25% of the available Incentive Units will vest and the remainder will lapse: If the TSR is in the top quartile of the comparator group then all of the available Incentive Units will vest: If the TSR is higher than the median but less than the top quartile of the comparator group then the proportion of the Incentive Units that will vest would be between 25% and 100% of the available Incentive Units depending on the actual ranking against the comparator group."
"For the Incentive Units awarded that are subject to the EPS condition, vesting will be as follows: If the EPS is below the target set by the Remuneration Committee, then none of the relevant available Incentive Units will vest and they will all lapse: If the EPS equals the target for threshold vesting set by the Remuneration Committee which is the ""threshold"" performance level, then one-quarter 25% of the available Incentive Units will vest and the remainder will lapse: If the EPS equals or exceeds the target for maximum vesting set by the Remuneration Committee then all of the available Incentive Units will vest: If the EPS is higher than the threshold vesting target but less than the maximum vesting target then the proportion of the Incentive Units that will vest would be between 25% and 100% of the available Incentive Units, adjusted on a straight basis depending on the EPS achieved."
The performance conditions will be tested over a three-year period, being the three years commencing on the 1 May or 1 November immediately preceding the date of the relevant award.
The Committee is satisfied that the above remuneration policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-taking.
As part of the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee reserves the right to make minor amendments to the policies set out above for regulatory, exchange control, administrative or tax purposes.

3 Malus Malus may apply where stated in the policy table shown above.
Under the malus provisions the Remuneration Committee can reduce to nil if appropriate awards that have not yet vested.
The circumstances in which the malus provisions may apply are set out below: if any of the financial statements or results for the Group or any Group Company are materially restated: if a participant has deliberately misled the management of the Group, the market or the Company's shareholders regarding the financial performance of any Group Company or the participant's business unit: if a participant's actions or inactions have caused either the Group, any Group Company or the participant's business unit reputational damage: if a participant's actions or inactions amount to serious misconduct or conduct which causes significant financial loss for the Group, any Group Company or the participant's business unit: if a participant's actions or inactions have caused a serious failure of risk management by the Group, any Group Company or the participant's business unit: or such other circumstances, where the Committee determines that the malus provisions should apply.
No other element of remuneration is subject to malus.
4 Payments from outstanding awards The Executive Directors would remain eligible to receive payment under any contractual arrangement agreed prior to the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy, i. e. before 29 August 2014.
This includes the vesting of awards granted prior to the remuneration policy taking effect.
5.1 Annual bonus targets 70% of the annual bonus potential is subject to financial performance measures.
There are three financial measures used under the Annual Bonus Plan which reflect the Companys key financial objectives for the year.
Of the annual bonus potential, 35% is attributable to consolidated profit before interest and taxation, and was selected by the Committee as profitability is central to the Companys overall strategy.
The Committee considers that EPS is an accepted and well established measure of the Companys performance and so 17.5% of the annual bonus is attributable to meeting this target.
The remaining 17.5% is attributable to meeting the target on consolidated net debt as this rewards the effective management of cash and debt.
Targets for the Annual Bonus Plan are set with due regard to external forecasts.
Performance targets are set to be stretching but achievable and take into account the economic environment in a given year.
The Committee retains the discretion to amend the weightings and components of the financial and non-financial elements of the bonus from year to year and for each executive as appropriate.
The Committee is of the view that the amounts of the performance targets for the financial element under the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose these before the end of the financial year.
The performance targets of the financial element will therefore be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration in the following year.
30% of the annual bonus potential is subject to personal performance measures.
The personal performance measures used under the Annual Bonus Plan include achievement of personal and strategic goals.
Personal performance measures and targets are proposed by the Chairman for the Chief Executive and by the Chief Executive for other Executive Directors.
The Committee discusses and sets the targets for executive directors and their review is linked to an annual appraisal process.
The Committee is of the view that the performance targets for the personal element are commercially sensitive as they relate to internal management projects, strategic objectives and personal goals and it is not intended that these will be disclosed in advance.
The Committees intention is that a summary of these objectives will be disclosed when they are no longer considered commercially sensitive.
5.2 LTIP performance targets The vesting of any LTIP award granted prior to 1 May 2014 will be subject to a stretching performance condition related to total shareholder return TSR over a three-year assessment period.
TSR is calculated as the movement in share value after taking account of re-invested dividends.
TSR is measured relative to a comparator group of the list of FTSE 250 companies.
The amount of available Incentive Units which are released will range from the threshold payout level of 16.67% for exceeding the median of the comparator group, and up to 100% of the available Incentive Units for achieving top decile ranking.
LTIP awards granted from 1 May 2014 will be split with one half based on TSR performance against a comparator group of the list of FTSE 250 companies and the other half based on performance against targets for a measure of earnings per share.
For the TSR based awards, the TSR must exceed the median of the comparator group before a payout is available.
The amount of Incentive Units released will range from 25% to 100% of each award depending on the actual ranking.
A top quartile ranking is required to achieve 100% release of units.
Demanding targets for the growth in earnings per share will be set for the other half of the awards based on a range of relevant market factors and expectations for the Group as at the date of award.
The maximum level of awards granted for an individual in any financial year is limited to Incentive Units with an aggregate face value at the time of award not exceeding 150% of basic salary.
6 Summary of remuneration policy for the Non-Executive Directors The table below summarises our policy on the remuneration paid to our Non-Executive Directors.
The policy is consistent with the policy that applied in 2013 14.

Account is taken of fees for similar roles in comparable companies.
The Board also considers the published data for FTSE 250 companies.
Non-executive directors do not participate in pensions or incentive benefits, or receive other remuneration in addition to their fees.
Business related travel and accommodation expenses will be met or reimbursed including for partners to corporate events or management conferences, and in the case of the Chairman, home telephone costs may be met or reimbursed.
7 Approach to the remuneration of newly appointed directors The Groups approach to remuneration for newly appointed directors is the same as that for existing directors.
As a matter of practicality, it is recognised that it may be necessary to pay within the market top quartile salaries in order to attract candidates of the quality the business needs.
Equally, a new recruit may be appointed on a lower than market rate salary with phased increases to bring it to the market level.
New executive directors will be invited to participate in incentive plans on the same basis as existing executive directors.
Where appropriate, the Company will offer to pay reasonable relocation and expatriate expenses for new executive directors in line with the Companys policies described above.
It is not the Companys policy to offer golden hellos or sign-on payments, but where the Remuneration Committee considers it is necessary to do so in order to recruit a particular individual, it may offer compensation for amounts of variable remuneration under previous employment being forfeited.
Any such compensation for variable remuneration forfeited would be subject to a maximum of the value of the unvested awards taking account of the time to vesting, delivery vehicle e. g. cash, shares, or share options, any performance conditions attached to the awards and the likelihood of the conditions being met.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the discretion to put in place a plan under Listing Rule 9.4.
2R without seeking shareholders approval in order to facilitate such an arrangement.
The maximum compensation for variable remuneration forfeited as set out above will be applied even where Listing Rule 9.4.
2R would permit higher amounts to be paid.
Where the Company is considering the promotion of senior management to the Board, the Remuneration Committee may, at its discretion, agree that any commitments including in respect of loss of office payments made before promotion will continue to be honoured whether or not otherwise consistent with the policy prevailing at the time the commitment is fulfilled.
In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Remuneration Committee will use the policy as set out in the table in section 9.4.
8 Pay for performance: scenario analysis A key element of the Companys remuneration policy is to provide a significant part of potential reward through performance based incentive plans.
The graphs below provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Minimum, Target and Maximum.

For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for 2014 15 and are on the basis that any bonus award would be satisfied 50% in cash and 50% in Deferred Shares under the EPP valued using the share price at the date of grant.
It should be noted that the LTIP awards granted in a year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant.
In illustrating potential reward opportunities the following assumptions are made: Annual Bonus LTIP Pension Minimum No annual bonus payable Threshold not achieved 33% of basic salary Target Maximum annual bonus Threshold performance warranting 25% vesting 33% of basic salary Maximum Maximum annual bonus Performance warrants 100% vesting 33% of basic salary For the purpose of the charts in this section 9.4.
8, pension amounts are calculated at an estimated accrual rate net of employee contribution of 33% of basic salary.
This differs from how the pension amounts shown in Table 1 in section 9.5.
It should be noted that the value of EPP and LTIP awards can increase due to increases in the Companys share price and or payments of dividends by the Company, and accordingly, there is no absolute maximum in the value of such awards.
9 Employment conditions across the Group The Committee is kept regularly updated on pay and conditions across the Group, although when setting the Directors remuneration policy, the wider employee group is not consulted.
In determining the adjustments to the Executive Directors and Group executive salaries, the Committee considers the increases to pay levels across the broader employee population.
10 Details of directors service contracts The Executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment.
It is the Groups policy that Executive Directors should have 12-month rolling service contracts providing for a maximum of one years notice.
Due to the nature of the Groups businesses, the service contracts contain restrictive covenants.
The principal terms of the Executive Directors service contracts which have no fixed term effective during the year were as follows: Executive Directors service contracts Name of director Date of contract Notice period 22 February 2013 12 months Martin Griffiths Ross Paterson 11 February 2013 12 months The contracts for the Chairman and Deputy Chairman effective of 1 May 2013 provide for six and three months notice periods respectively.
Other NonExecutive Directors are appointed by a letter, which provide for one months notice.
The letters of appointment do not contain any contractual entitlement to a termination payment and the directors can be removed in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
All notice periods apply to both the director and the Company.
11 Loss of office payment policy It is the Groups policy to provide for 12 months notice for termination of employment for executive directors, to be given by either party, and to make severance payments on termination in line with any pre-established contractual arrangements.
Service contracts provide that an executive director shall give and shall receive 12 months notice on termination and contain standard garden leave provisions which the Group can enforce in order to protect the Groups interests during a period of notice.
An executive director would continue to be paid his basic salary and contractual benefits during any period of garden leave in the usual way save that he will not be entitled to receive awards under the EPP or the LTIP or similar.
Any bonus in respect of any period of garden leave would be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee considering the specific circumstances but would not exceed the total of the annual maximum bonus currently at one times basic salary.
This is the effect of legacy contractual positions and will not be incorporated into new contracts for new appointments.
In any event, the Remuneration Committee can decide that no such bonus will be payable if and to the extent it reasonably considers that the payment of a bonus could be perceived as a reward for failure.
There are no arrangements to require the enhancement or acceleration of pension benefits on termination or early retirement.
In the case of gross misconduct by an executive director, a provision is included in the executives contract for immediate dismissal with no compensation payable.
In other cases where an executive directors employment is terminated with immediate effect, the Committees policy would be that any compensating payments would not exceed any amounts due under the contractual arrangements as summarised above.
In the event an executive director leaves for reasons of death, ill-health, injury, redundancy, retirement with the agreement of the Group, or his employing company ceasing to be a member of the Group or other such event as the Remuneration Committee determines, then LTIP awards will be pro-rated for time and will vest based on performance over the performance period as determined by the rules of the LTIP.
For all other leavers, outstanding LTIP awards will lapse.
In the event an executive director leaves for reasons of death, ill-health, injury, redundancy, or his employing company ceasing to be a member of the Group, then awards of EPP Deferred Shares will vest at the date of leaving for the benefit of the director.
If an executive director retires with the agreement of the Company, retirement is not a vesting event for the EPP and so the awards will vest on their original vesting date.
For all other leavers, outstanding EPP awards will lapse.
In the event an executive director leaves for reasons of death, ill-health, injury, redundancy, retirement, or his employing company ceasing to be a member of the Group, then shares held under any BAYE awards will vest in accordance with the HMRC approved rules of the Scheme.
For all other leavers, outstanding BAYE matching share awards will lapse.
Payments for loss of office may only be made to directors or former directors if such payments are consistent with the approved remuneration policy or are otherwise approved by an ordinary resolution of the members of the Company.
12 Change of control The following apply where there is a change in control of the Group: The Executive Directors are entitled to normal termination benefits as outlined above, except where the director is offered and has refused employment on terms and conditions that were no less favourable to those in place prior to the change of control, in which case the Executive Directors will have no claim against the Group in respect of termination of employment: under the EPP, Deferred Shares would automatically vest on a change of control: under the LTIP, Incentive Units would vest on a pro-rata basis taking account of the proportion of the vesting period that had expired and the applicable performance conditions: and under the BAYE, awards will vest in full or, alternatively, the acquiring company may offer to roll-over the awards into awards over shares in the acquiring company.
13 Consideration of shareholder views The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the Annual General Meeting each year at its first meeting following the Annual General Meeting.
This feedback, as well as any additional feedback received during other meetings with shareholders and representative bodies, is then considered when reviewing remuneration policy.
When any material changes are proposed by the Group to the remuneration policy, the Committee chairman will inform major shareholders in advance and will offer a meeting to discuss these.
14 External appointments It is the Boards policy to allow the Executive Directors to accept directorships of other quoted companies as this will broaden and enrich the business skills of the directors so long as the time commitments do not have any detrimental impact on the ability of the director to fulfil his duties.
Any such directorships must be formally approved by the Board.
Martin Griffiths is a non-executive director of AG Barr plc, and was permitted to retain the 46,500 fees received from this position in the year ended 30 April 2014 2013: 42,847.
He was previously a non-executive director at Robert Walters plc, and stepped down from this role on 31 July 2013.
He was permitted to retain the 15,600 fees received from that position in the year ended 30 April 2014 2013: 62,400.
9.5 Annual Remuneration Report Implementation This section of the remuneration report provides details of how the remuneration policy was implemented during the year ended 30 April 2014.
1 Committee members The Remuneration Committee is currently composed of four independent non-executive directors.
The Committee met three times during the year.
The Group Director of Tax and Employee Benefits is Secretary to the Committee.
Attendance at meetings by individual members is detailed in section 5.11.
No director was involved in decisions as to their own remuneration.
The members of the Committee during the year ended 30 April 2014 and at the date of this report were: Phil White Chairman Garry Watts Gregor Alexander from 1 September 2013 Will Whitehorn The remuneration of executive directors was not considered by any other Committee or group of directors during the year.
2 Advisers The Committee retained Addleshaw Goddard LLP as its remuneration consultant to provide access to independent research and advice.
It has no other connection to the Group.
Addleshaw Goddard LLP received 28,250 2013: 12,380 in respect of work it carried out in the year ended 30 April 2014.
The fees payable were determined by Addleshaw Goddard LLP with reference to time spent and applicable hourly rates.
We do not consider the level of fees paid or the nature of the work performed would prejudice the objectivity or independence of Addleshaw Goddard LLP.
3 Remuneration of the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors audited The remuneration of the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors may comprise a number of elements, as described in section 9.4.
Directors remuneration and the single figure total for the year ended 30 April 2014 are shown in Table 1 below.
Each of the elements of remuneration is discussed further below.

Basic Salary fees The basic salary fees in Table 1 correspond to the amounts payable in respect of the relevant financial year ended 30 April.
Salary is paid monthly and all salaries shown above were effective from 1 May at the start of the relevant financial year.
Both Executive Directors participated in pension salary sacrifice arrangements during the year and the basic salary amounts are shown gross before any salary sacrifice arrangements.
Benefits in kind and other allowances The benefits in kind and other allowances shown in Table 1 are made up as follows: Reimbursement Employer TABLE 2 BENEFITS IN KIND Cash allowance in lieu Healthcare Total of home BAYE of company car benefits telephone expenses 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 Martin Griffiths 22,000 22,000 982 1,212 445 459 197 211 23,624 23,882 Ross Paterson 22,000 982 197 23,179 Sir Brian Souter 22,000 577 381 577 22,381 During the year both Executive Directors participated in the Buy As You Earn BAYE Plan.
We believe that the BAYE plan aligns the interests of employees and shareholders by allowing all UK employees of the Group to purchase shares out of salary.
It is designed to aid staff motivation and retention.
The maximum employee purchase is governed by HMRC limits and for all monthly employee purchases in 2013 14 was 125 per month.
The Group provides two matching shares for every share purchased on the first 10 of each employees monthly investment.
The amounts shown in Table 2 are the values of such matching shares allocated to directors as at the dates of allocation.
Additional shares are allocated in respect of dividends payable during the relevant period.
Details of the shares held under the BAYE plan are shown in Table 10. iii.
Performance related bonus Around the start of each financial year, the Committee agrees specific objectives for each executive director.
Following the end of each financial year, the Committee determines the annual bonus for each executive director for the year just ended.
This is based on the directors performance in achieving the set objectives.
These comprise both financial objectives for the Group and individual business related objectives for each director.
For each executive director, the Group financial objectives for the year ended 30 April 2014 were to meet financial targets with respect to measures of profit before interest and taxation, earnings per share, and net debt.
For the year ended 30 April 2014, Martin Griffiths and Ross Paterson each had a maximum potential bonus of up to 100% of basic salary, with 70% allocated over a range of demanding key financial objectives and 30% for meeting individual business related objectives.
Details of the financial objectives applicable for 2013 14 are shown below.
TABLE 3 DIRECTORS OBJECTIVES Target Achieved Potential Bonus Bonus Awarded % of basic salary % of basic salary Consolidated profit before interest and taxation PBIT from Group companies 213.7m 214.3m 35.0% 35.0% Consolidated adjusted earnings per share EPS 25.4p 26.0p 17.5% 17.5% Consolidated net debt Net Debt 509.9m 457.3m 17.5% 17.5% Element of bonus related to Group financial objectives 70.0% 70.0% The PBIT and EPS measures shown above are determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards but adjusted to exclude intangible asset expenses and exceptional items.
The PBIT measure also excludes any share of profit or loss from joint ventures.
The Net Debt measure shown above is determined in accordance with the definition of net debt given in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
The actual values achieved in respect of each of the three measures are adjusted to exclude the impact of any acquisitions and disposals of businesses that were not included in determining the target values.
The detailed individual business related targets are considered to be commercially sensitive and it is the Committees intention that a summary of these objectives will be disclosed when they are no longer considered commercially sensitive.
In making its judgement of performance for the last financial year, the Remuneration Committee had particular regard to the results as recorded elsewhere in the Annual Report, and relative total return to shareholders over the year, as well as other strategic developments and operating performance.
Performance related bonuses awarded to the Executive Directors in respect of the year ended 30 April 2014 are shown below.

LTIP The amounts shown in Table 1 in respect of the LTIP for the year ended 30 April 2014 represents the actual market value of the vesting of the December 2010 award in December 2013, plus an estimate of the market value of the June 2011 award due to vest in June 2014 as at the year end 30 April 2014.
The December 2010 award vested achieving a ranking of 79 out of the FTSE250 comparator group, resulting in a pay-out vesting percentage of 55.0% of the relevant Incentive Units.
The value for the awards due to vest in June 2014 is based on a projection using the information available as at 30 April 2014 for the awards granted in June 2011 with an estimated ranking of 72 out of the FTSE 250 comparator group, resulting in a projected pay-out vesting percentage of 60.8% and using an estimated value based on the average share price over the last quarter of 2013 2014 of 380.25p.

Pension related benefits The pension amounts shown in Table 1 for each director represents 20 times the increase excluding inflation in the accrued annual pension entitlement plus the increase excluding inflation in the accrued cash lump sum entitlement, less contributions paid by the director.
4 Pensions audited Under the terms of their service agreements, the Executive Directors are entitled to become members of one of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes or, if preferred, to receive payment of a proportion of salary for personal pension arrangements.
Defined benefit pensions may be accrued under the HMRC approved pension scheme and or the Groups funded pension arrangements.
For pension purposes, the Executive Directors have a normal retirement age of 60 and in accordance with HMRC rules accrued defined benefits may not be drawn before age 55.
Martin Griffiths accrued benefits in the year ended 30 April 2014 under the Group funded pension arrangements.
Other than adjustments for inflation no further benefits accrued under a HMRC approved Group defined benefit scheme during the year.
Ross Paterson accrued benefits in the year ended 30 April 2014 under a combination of a HMRC approved Group defined benefit pension scheme and the Group funded pension arrangements.
Life assurance of four times basic annual salary is provided under the arrangements for pension benefits.
Table 6 below provides the pensions information required by Schedule 8 of the Large & Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 and gives details of benefits accruing during the year under the Groups pension arrangements.

The maximum and expected total values shown above ignore non-market vesting conditions and do not include any assumed share price appreciation or dividends paid.
The actual number of Incentive Units if any which vest will depend on the performance conditions being achieved.
The performance conditions for both awards are that the TSR over the performance period must exceed the median of the comparator group, which is the list of FTSE 250 companies.
The amount of units awarded which are released will range from 16.67% to 100% depending on the actual ranking achieved.
A challenging performance target of top decile ranking is required to achieve a 100% release of units.
No units will vest for below-threshold performance.

The maximum and total expected values shown above ignore non-market vesting conditions and do not include any assumed share price appreciation or dividends paid.
There are no specific performance conditions attaching to the release of these Deferred Shares because the annual bonus is already subject to performance conditions.
6 Payments to past directors There have been no payments in excess of the fide minimis threshold to former directors during the year ended 30 April 2014 in respect of their former roles as directors.
The Company has set a fide minimis threshold of 10,000 under which it would not report such payments.
7 Payments for loss of office There have been no payments for loss of office to directors during the year ended 30 April 2014 2013: 113,333.
8 Statement of directors shareholdings and share interests audited The Executive Directors and certain other senior executives are expected to accumulate significant shareholdings in the Company.
In the case of the Executive Directors, they are each expected to accumulate an effective interest in shares in the Company with a value of at least 200% of basic salary.
A target of 100% was first introduced in 2005 and has been amended to 200% from June 2014 following feedback from shareholders.
The Executive Directors are allowed five years from the date of appointment to accumulate the appropriate level of shares.
For these purposes, EPP Deferred Shares are included on a pre-tax basis, but as from 1 May 2014, EPP Deferred Shares will be counted on a post-tax basis only and all interests in shares will be counted at current value.
At 30 April 2014 under these revised definitions Martin Griffiths had an interest in shares equivalent to 327% of his basic salary and Ross Paterson had an interest in shares equivalent to 230% of his basic salary.
Both directors therefore met the shareholding guideline.
The effective interests of the Directors including those of connected persons as at 30 April 2014 were: Scheme interests vested and TABLE 9 DIRECTORS INTERESTS IN SHARES OF THE GROUP Interests as at exercised during year ended AS AT 30 APRIL 2014 30 April 2014 30 April 2014 LTIP incentive EPP Shares BAYE Shares LTIP incentive EPP Shares units subject not subject not subject units subject not subject Shares held to performance to performance to performance to performance to performance outright conditions conditions conditions conditions conditions Martin Griffiths 395,685 762,661 221,932 1,406 149,517 365,472 Ross Paterson 197,329 416,471 78,531 1,406 71,233 119,575 Non Executive Directors Gregor Alexander 10,406 Sir Ewan Brown see note below Ann Gloag 62,501,721 Helen Mahy 8,834 Sir Brian Souter 86,900,445 109,019 52,936 Garry Watts 16,000 Phil White 4,070 Will Whitehorn 72,288 Sir Ewan Brown has an indirect interest in the share capital of the Company.
He and his connected parties own approximately 18% 2013: 22% of the ordinary shares of Noble Grossart Holdings Limited, which in turn through its subsidiary, Noble Grossart Investments Limited, held 3,267,999 ordinary shares in the Company at 30 April 2014 2013: 3,267,999.
Although Sir Brian Souter retired as an executive director of the Company on 30 April 2013, retirement is not a vesting event for the EPP and so he retains awards of EPP Deferred Shares that are expected to vest on their original planned vesting dates.

9 Performance graph The graph below charts the performance of the total shareholder return TSR share value movement plus reinvested dividends from the Companys ordinary shares over the five years to 30 April 2014 compared with that of the FTSE Travel and Leisure All-Share Index, and the FTSE 250 Index.
The FTSE 250 Index has been selected for this comparison because it is the index used by the Company for the TSR based performance criterion for the LTIP Scheme, while the FTSE Travel and Leisure All-Share Index is shown as the Company and a number of its peers make up a significant element of that index.

Therefore the bonus percentages shown in Table 11 above reflect the amounts awarded to Sir Brian net of the waivers.
For information, the full bonus percentage entitlements based on performance and before the waivers are shown in Table 12 below.

10 Percentage change in Chief Executive Remuneration audited The change in the Chief Executives remuneration from 2012 13 to 2013 14 in comparison to a comparator group of employees is shown in the Table 13 below and should be considered in the context of the change in Chief Executive on 1 May 2014.
TABLE 13 PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION FOR THE ROLE OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE Percentage change of Chief Executive Percentage change per capita of employees in the comparator group throughout both years Salary 0% 3.5% Benefits 9% 0% Bonus 57% 4.9 % On the appointment of Martin Griffiths as Chief Executive, the Committee considered it was appropriate to retain the basic salary for this position at the same level as paid to the predecessor.
The increase in the Chief Executives bonus percentage shown in Table 13 reflects a waiver of bonus amounting to 26.2% of basic salary by Sir Brian Souter, and otherwise he would have been entitled to a bonus of 90% of basic salary for 2012 13 compared to an award of 100% for the Chief Executive for 2013 14.
The comparator group used comprises over 300 employees including the corporate head office employees, the management teams of each of the Groups divisions and their administrative support staff.
This comparator group was used because the Committee believes it provides a sufficiently large and relative comparator group to give a reasonable understanding of underlying increases, based on similar annual bonus performance measures utilised by Group management and support functions.
The Group seeks to ensure that the basis for pay increases for these functions are generally consistent with the pay rises at UK Bus and Rail operations.
11 Relative Importance of spend on pay audited The table below shows the expenditure of the Group on employee remuneration costs in the year ended 30 April 2014 and the year ended 30 April 2013.
In addition, it details the disbursements from profit made by way of dividend payments during the same periods.

A withheld vote is not a vote in law and is not counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes cast for and against a resolution.
13 Implementation of remuneration policy in the financial year ending 30 April 2015 In the year ending 30 April 2015, the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors remuneration policies will be implemented as follows.
13.1 Implementation of Executive Directors remuneration policy 9.5.
1 Fixed elements basic salary The Committee made the following 2014 15 basic salary decisions which are in line with the disclosed policy in section 9.4.
TABLE 16 INCREASES IN BASIC SALARY 2014 15 2013 14 salary salary Percentage m m change Martin Griffiths 614,400 600,000 2.4% Ross Paterson 409,600 400,000 2.4% Salaries are effective from 1 May each year.
The Committee has considered the broader employee context in determining salaries.. 9.5.
2 Other elements The implementation of policy in relation to other elements of remuneration is in line with the disclosed policy in section 9.4 of this report, and there are no changes in the maximum bonus or LTIP potential amounts as a percentage of basic salary.
Short term incentives Annual Bonus The implementation of policy in relation to annual bonus is in line with the disclosed policy in section 9.4 of this report.
Targets are approved by the Remuneration Committee around the beginning of the year.
Each executive director has a maximum potential bonus of up to 100% of basic salary, with 70% allocated over a range of demanding key financial objectives and 30% for meeting individual business related objectives.
The Committee is of the view that the performance targets for the financial element under the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose these before the end of the financial year.
The targets and achievements will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration in the following year.
The Committes intention is that a summary of these objectives will be disclosed when they are no longer considered commercially sensitive.
50% of any actual bonus earned in the year will be deferred as shares under the EPP.
Long term incentives LTIP awards The Committee intends to grant awards in line with the disclosed policy and changes set out in section 9.4 of this report.
Awards vest after three years subject to performance conditions.
A summary of the intended awards and nature of the performance conditions are provided in Table 17 below.
TABLE 17 INTENDED LTIP AWARDS Face value of award Percentage of award Length of Award Performance at maximum vesting vesting for threshold Performance Type metric % of 2014 15 salary achievement period Martin Griffiths Incentive Units TSR relative against 75% 25% 3 years FTSE 250 Incentive Units EPS growth objectives 75% 25% 3 years Ross Paterson Incentive Units TSR relative against 75% 25% 3 years FTSE 250 Incentive Units EPS growth objectives 75% 25% 3 years In all cases, awards will only vest subject to the achievement of the performance conditions and if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the vesting of awards.
Awards are generally made twice a year following the announcement of the Annual Results in June, and in December following the issue of the results for the half-year.
The 2014 15 awards will be split one half based on TSR performance against a comparator group of the list of FTSE 250 companies at the date of award, and the other half based on a measure of earnings per share.
For the TSR based awards, the TSR must exceed the median of the comparator group and the amount of Incentive Units awarded which are released will range from 25% to 100% of the available Incentive Units depending on the actual ranking.
