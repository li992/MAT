Directors remuneration report Statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee On behalf of the Board of Directors I am pleased to present the shareholders with our first Directors Remuneration Report, for the year ended 30June 2014.
The report is comprised of three parts: 1.
This annual statement which summarises the key decisions made by the Committee during the year and forms part of the Annual Report on Remuneration: 2.
The Directors Remuneration Policy on pages 55 to 61 which describes the key principles of our approach and which will be subject to a binding shareholder vote at the AGM on 25 November 2014: and 3.
The Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 62 to 67 which sets out the details of key payments to Executive and Non-executive Directors inrespect of the 2013 14 year, and which will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM.
The strategic context This has been a challenging year for Just Retirement.
The Company listed on the Stock Exchange in November 2013 and a detailed review ofremuneration for Executive and Non-executive Directors took place prior to that, to reflect the size and scale of a FTSE 250 listed company.
Theremuneration terms established for those Directors were outlined in the Companys listing prospectus dated 12 November 2013.
In March 2014 the annual Budget announcement proposing greater pension freedom and a period of consultation until April 2015 has had aconsiderable impact on the business, and performance was affected in Q4.
New business annuity volumes reduced by approximately 50%.
Inresponse the Group has undertaken a number of self-help measures including reducing costs by 14m.
Key pay outcomes during the 2013 14 year The remuneration arrangements for executives were reviewed at the time of IPO and consist of: Salaries set at a broadly mid-market level against comparable life insurers: A benefit allowance to ensure competitive and cost-effective pension and benefits provision: A Short-Term Incentive Plan with bonus deferral in shares for three years subject to malus and clawback: A Long-Term Incentive Plan: and The opportunity to participate in all-employee share plans.
The first awards under the LTIP were granted on 15 November 2013 with a face value of 200% of salary for the CEO and 150% of salary for theother Executive Directors.
Vesting of these awards is subject to achievement of IFRS Operating Profit 50% of the award and Relative TSR 50% of the award performance conditions, measured at the end of the 2015 16 financial year.
Bonuses of between 85% and 95% of salary were awarded to the Executive Directors for the 2013 14 financial year.
This reflected performance against the corporate performance indicators Value of New Business and Post-Tax Operating Profit that was above plan and individual performance indicators.
In particular, financial performance for the nine months prior to the Budget was above plan and while the Budget affected performance in the final quarter, performance against the corporate performance indicators remained strong.
An overview of objectives, performance indicators and the resultant bonuses paid to the Executive Directors can be found on page 63.
Remuneration policy for 2014 15 The Groups cost reduction plans for expenses in the year 2014 15 meant that over 90 roles were lost and the planned salary review for all employees, including Executive Directors, did not take place from July 2014.
Those employees remaining whose Company pension contributions were 10% approximately 75% of the workforce saw a one-year 5% reduction in August 2014.
Executive Directors and senior managements benefit allowances were also temporarily reduced by 10% of base salary and the Non-executive Directors fees were reduced by 10%, both with effect from 1 July 2014.
No structural changes to the policy outlined on pages 55 to 61 are proposed for the coming year.
Conclusion This has been a year of considerable change for the Group which is likely to continue well into 2014 15.
We are committed to ensuring that remuneration practices attract and retain the best people, and reward performance that is aligned with outcomes for shareholders.
Kate Avery Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 54 Just Retirement Group plc Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials What is in the Directors remuneration report?
This report describes the details of the remuneration policy for our Executive Directors and Non-executive Directors, sets out how this policy has been used and, accordingly, the amounts paid relating to the year ended 30 June 2014.
The report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008, as amended.
The report has also been prepared in line with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICy This part of the Remuneration Report sets out the Groups remuneration policy for its Executive and Non-executive Directors.
The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, guidelines from major investors and guidance from the PRA and FCA on best practice.
The Directors Remuneration Policy will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the AGM on 25 November 2014 and, subject to shareholder approval, will take formal effect from that date.
What is the role of the Remuneration Committee?
The Remuneration Committee the Committee has responsibility for determining the overall pay policy for the Group.
In particular, the Committee is responsible for: Approving the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chief Executive, the Chairman of the Group, the Executive Directors, and other senior management: Approving their remuneration packages and service contracts: Reviewing the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy: Approving the design of, and determining targets for, all performance-related pay schemes operated by the Group and approving the total annual payments made under such schemes: and Reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders.
For any such plans, the Committee determines each year whether awards will be made and, if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual awards to Executive Directors and other senior management, and the performance targets to be used.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Groups website or are available in hard copy on request from the Company Secretary.
What is the Committees remuneration policy?
When setting the policy for Directors remuneration, the Committee takes into account the overall business strategy and risk tolerance, considering the long-term interests of the Group with a view to adequately attracting, retaining and rewarding skilled individuals and delivering rewards to shareholders.
Consistent with these principles, the Committee has agreed a remuneration policy for senior management, including Executive Directors, whereby: Both salaries and total pay potential will be set at competitive levels compared to insurance peers and other companies of equivalent size andcomplexity: Performance-related pay, based on stretching targets, will form a significant part of remuneration packages: and There will be an appropriate balance between short and longer-term performance targets linked to delivery of the Groups business plan.
Key considerations therefore are to: Align Directors remuneration with the interests of shareholders, customers and other external stakeholders: Operate remuneration practices in order to attract, motivate, reward and retain appropriately qualified and experienced individuals of the highest calibre: Link pay to long-term performance: Ensure disclosures provide transparency and accountability: Encourage a high performing culture: and Ensure remuneration and incentives support good risk management practice.
In line with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction on the Committee that prevents it from taking into account corporate governance on ESG matters.
In addition, the Committee regularly reviews the remuneration packages for the Groups Executive Directors and senior management, via liaison with the Risk and Compliance Committee and the Groups Risk function, to ensure that they do not encourage inappropriate risk-taking.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 55 Directors remuneration report continued What does the Committee take into account when setting remuneration?
From time to time, a review of remuneration is undertaken to ensure reward levels are competitive with the external market, taking account of the duties and responsibilities of the roles.
In line with Just Retirements broader remuneration framework that is intended to ensure consistency and common practice across the Group, and in determining the overall levels of remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Committee also pays due regard to pay and conditions elsewhere in the organisation.
The Committee seeks to ensure that the underlying principles which form the basis for decisions on Executive Directors pay are consistent with those on which pay decisions for the rest of the workforce are taken.
For example, the Committee takes into account the general salary increase for the broader employee population when conducting the salary review for the Executive Directors.
However, there are some structural differences in the Executive Directors Remuneration Policy as set out below compared to that for the broader employee base, which the Committee believes are necessary to reflect the differing levels of seniority and responsibility.
A greater weight is placed on performance-based pay through the quantum and participation levels in incentive schemes.
This ensures the remuneration of the Executive Directors is aligned with the performance of the Group and therefore the interests of shareholders.
Are the views of shareholders taken into account?
The Group values and is committed to dialogue with its shareholders.
The Committee will consider investor feedback and the voting results received in relation to relevant AGM resolutions each year.
In addition, the Committee will engage proactively with shareholders, and will ensure that shareholders are consulted in advance, where any material changes to the Directors Remuneration Policy are proposed.

What discretions do the Committee retain in operating the incentive plans?
The Committee operates the Groups various incentive plans according to their respective rules.
To ensure the efficient operation and administration of these plans, the Committee retains discretion in relation to a number of areas.
Consistent with market practice, these include but are not limited to the following: Selecting the participants: The timing of grant and or payment: The size of grants and or payments within the limits set out in the policy table above : The extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance: Determination of a good leaver and where relevant the extent of vesting in the case of the share-based plans: Treatment in exceptional circumstances such as a change of control, in which the Committee would act in the best interests of the Group andits shareholders: Making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events, variation of capital and special dividends : Cash settling awards: and The annual review of performance measures, weightings and setting targets for the discretionary incentive plans from year to year.
Any performance conditions may be amended or substituted if one or more events occur which cause the Committee to reasonably consider that the performance conditions would not without alteration achieve their original purpose.
Any varied performance condition would not be materially less difficult to satisfy in the circumstances.
How does the Committee choose performance measures and set targets?
The STIP is based on performance against a stretching combination of financial and non-financial performance measures.
The measures are set taking account of the Groups key operational objectives and include metrics for corporate financial performance.
In addition, Executive Directors and members of the senior management team are assessed on personal objectives as agreed by the Committee at the beginning of the year.
TheCommittee reviews the focus each year and varies them as appropriate to reflect the priorities for the business in the year ahead.
Corporate financial performance measures account for at least two-thirds of the STIP opportunity.
A sliding scale of targets is set for each financial KPI to encourage continuous improvement and challenge the delivery of stretch performance.
The LTIP is based on a financial growth measure and TSR performance.
Relative TSR has been selected as it reflects comparative performance against a broad index of companies that are similar in size to the Group.
It also aligns the rewards received by executives with the returns received by shareholders.
For the 2013 and 2014 LTIP award, growth in IFRS operating profit has been used as a performance measure as it rewards improvement in the Groups underlying financial performance and is a measure of the Groups overall financial success.
A sliding scale of challenging performance targets is set for both of these measures and further details of the targets to be applied are set out inthe Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Committee will review the choice of performance measures and the appropriateness of the performance targets and TSR peer group prior toeach LTIP grant.
However, the Committee will consult inadvance with major shareholders prior to any significant changes being made.
In approving this Directors Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Group to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors that pre-date the approval of the policy.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report onRemuneration as they arise.
58 Just Retirement Group plc Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials What would a new Executive Director be paid?
Can their pay package on appointment differ to the policy?
The ongoing remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Groups shareholder-approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment and the maximum limits set out therein.
Salaries may be set at a below market level initially with a view to increasing them to the market rate subject to individual performance and developing into the role by making phased above inflation increases.
What then is the maximum opportunity under the incentive plans they can receive on appointment?
Currently, for an Executive Director, STIP payments will not exceed 150% of base salary and LTIP payments will not normally exceed 200% of base salary not including any arrangements to replace forfeited entitlements.
Where necessary, specific STIP and LTIP targets may be introduced for an individual for the first year of appointment if it is appropriate to do so to reflect the individuals responsibilities and the point in the year in which they joined the Board.
What payments could an Executive Director receive beyond the policy?
The Committee retains flexibility to offer additional cash and or share-based awards on appointment to take account of remuneration or benefit arrangements forfeited by an Executive on leaving a previous employer.
If shares are used, such awards may be made under the terms of the LTIP or as permitted under the Listing Rules.
Such payments would take into account the nature of awards forfeited and would reflect as far as possible performance conditions, attributed expected value and the time over which they would have vested or been paid.
The Committee may agree that the Group will meet certain relocation, legal, tax equalisation and any other incidental expenses as appropriate soas to enable the recruitment of the best people including those who need to relocate.
What about an internal appointment?
In the case of an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms, and adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
What are the Executive Directors terms of employment?
What are their notice periods?
The Executive Directors have entered into service agreements with an indefinite term that may be terminated by either party on six months written notice.
Contracts for new appointments will be terminable by either party on a maximum of 12 months written notice.
An Executive Directors service contract may be terminated summarily without notice and without any further payment or compensation, exceptfor sums accrued up to the date of termination, if they are deemed to be guilty of gross misconduct or for any other material breach oftheobligations under their employment contract.
The Group may suspend the Executive Directors or put them on a period of garden leave during which they will be entitled to salary, benefits andpension.
What payments will an Executive Director receive when they leave the Group?
If the employment of an Executive Director is terminated in other circumstances, compensation is limited to base salary due for any unexpired notice period and any amount assessed by the Committee as representing the value of other contractual benefits which would have been received during the period.
The Group may choose to continue providing some benefits instead of paying a cash sum representing their cost.
Any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination including, at the discretion of the Committee, reimbursement for legal advice and provision of outplacement services would be paid as necessary.
There will be no automatic entitlement to a bonus if an Executive Director has ceased employment or is under notice on the last day of the financial year.
However, the Committee may in its discretion pay a pro-rated bonus in respect of the proportion of the financial year worked.
Suchpayment would be payable in cash and not subject to deferral.
Executive Directors service contracts are available for inspection at the Groups registered office during normal business hours and will be available for inspection at the AGM.
How are outstanding share awards treated when an Executive Director leaves the Group?
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Groups share plans will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules.
Usually, any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement with the consent of the Committee, the sale of the entity that employs him her out of the Group, or any other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, good leaver status may be applied.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 59 Directors remuneration report continued For good leavers under the LTIP, outstanding awards will vest at the original vesting date to the extent that the performance condition has been satisfied, and be reduced on a pro rata basis to reflect the period of time which has elapsed between the grant date and the date on which the participant ceases to be employed by the Group.
The Committee retains the discretion to vest awards and measure performance accordingly on cessation and disapply time pro-rating, however, it is envisaged that this would only be applied in exceptional circumstances.
For good leavers under the DSBP, unvested awards will usually vest in full upon cessation.
In determining whether a departing Executive Director should be treated as a good leaver, the Committee will take into account the performance of the individual and the reasons for their departure.
What happens to their outstanding share awards if there is a takeover or other corporate event?
The treatment of outstanding awards on a takeover or other corporate event such as a demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event which, in the opinion of the Committee, may affect the current or future value of shares mirrors that set out above in relation to a good leaver albeit with the vesting period automatically ending on the date of the relevant event.
Alternatively, the Committee may permit or, in the case of an internal reorganisation or if the Board so determines, require both LTIP and DSBP awards to be exchanged for equivalent awards which relate to shares in a different company.
Are the Executive Directors allowed to hold external appointments?
Executive Directors are permitted to accept one external appointment with the prior approval of the Chairman and where there is no impact on their role with the Group.
The Board will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the Executive Directors will be permitted to retain any fees arising from such appointments, details of which will be provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
How much could an Executive Director earn under the remuneration policy?
Under the Directors Remuneration Policy, a significant proportion of total remuneration is linked to Group performance.
The following charts illustrate how the Executive Directors total pay package varies under three different performance scenarios: fixed pay only, on-target and at maximum.
These charts are indicative as share price movement and dividend accrual have been excluded.

The Executive Directors can participate in all-employee share schemes on the same basis as other employees.
The value that may be received under these schemes is subject to tax approved limits.
For simplicity, the value that may be received from participating in these schemes has been excluded from the above charts.

If our IFRS operating profit for the financial year ending 30 June 2017 exceeds operating profit for the financial year ending 30 June 2015 by 18.8% equivalent to 9% p. a. cumulative growth, 25% of the award will vest.
