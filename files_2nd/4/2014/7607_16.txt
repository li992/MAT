Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY 64 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED Relevance to Employee Pay The Policy described above provides an overview of the structure that also operates and applies to the most senior executives in the Group.
While bonus and pensions arrangements are in place for most of the Groups employees, lower aggregate remuneration operates at below the executive Director and senior manager level with total remuneration driven by market comparatives and the individual responsibilities of each role.
The oil and gas industry operates in an increasingly competitive labour market globally and, to reflect this, the Groups average employee costs, including salary, benefits and bonuses, in the year increased 10%.
Average salaries, including overtime, across the Group increased 8% compared to 2013.
Choice of Performance Metrics The corporate strategy includes promoting the long-term success of the Group by investing in its existing product and services portfolio through capital investment or by acquisition and growing the business in a way that is aligned to the evolving global energy industry.
The performance of the executive Directors in executing this strategy is evaluated by the following key performance indicators KPIs, which drive the variable components of the executive Directors emoluments.
Element of KPI remuneration Reason for use Underlying Profit Annual Bonus PBT is a management KPI used to measure the underlying performance of the Group.
before Taxation PBT reflects the achievements of the Group in a given financial year and recognises sustained profitability measured against an agreed Annual Budget.
Underlying Return on Annual Bonus ROCE is a management KPI used to measure the underlying performance of the Group.
Capital Employed Hunting PSP ROCE reflects the value created on funds invested in the short and medium term.
Total Shareholder PSP Hunting To achieve sustained levels of shareholder return over the long term.
Return PSP Underlying Earnings Hunting PSP To achieve sustained levels of earnings growth over the long term.
Per Share Taken together, the Committee believe that the executive Directors are appropriately incentivised to deliver both short and long-term performance based on these metrics.
Single Figure Remuneration Definition For the purposes of the Policy and Annual Report on Remuneration, the single figure remuneration presented comprises base salary, benefits including healthcare insurance and car benefits, tax equalisation, pension contributions incorporating where relevant the prescribed HMRC multiplier, annual cash bonus and vested PSP and LTIP awards during the financial year or where the performance period has substantially completed.
The single figure remuneration equates to Total Remuneration as shown on page 70 of the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Detailed Policy Base Salaries and Fees Base salaries and fees are reviewed annually.
In considering appropriate salary levels for the executive Directors, the Committee takes into account their experience and personal performance, the remuneration paid by comparable companies in terms of asset size, revenues, profits, number of employees, market capitalisation and the complexity and international spread of Group operations, as well as Group wide salary increases and applicable rates of inflation.
Other relocation and taxation agreements are also in place for key executives.
As part of the consultation process with major shareholders in 2013 and 2014, the base salary of the Finance Director was reviewed.
The Committee concluded that in line with Policy, his base salary should be increased towards the market mid-point.
As a consequence of this adjustment, the proposed long-term incentive awards to the Finance Director were reduced to ensure his total emoluments, including base salary, annual bonus and long-term incentives, remained at the market mid-point.
Base fee increases for the non-executive Directors are based on benchmarked market data for fees paid by comparable companies.
Benefits Other benefits provided to the executive Directors as part of their remuneration package include the provision of appropriate health cover, life and disability insurance, car and fuel benefits.
Pension The Group contributes to the pension arrangements of both the Chief Executive and Finance Director.
Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY 65 Being a US based citizen, Dennis Proctor participates in the Groups US 401K tax deferred savings plan, with the Group making matching annual contributions to the plan up to 2% of base salary up to a maximum of $15,600 at the current compensation limit.
In addition, the Group contributed a figure equivalent to 17% of his 2014 base salary to a deferred compensation scheme.
In practice this scheme is operated on a money purchase basis.
Richard Hunting and Peter Rose are members of the Hunting Pension Scheme the Scheme, which is a defined benefit pension scheme.
The normal retirement age for the Directors under the Scheme is 60 and they are entitled to, subject to certain limits, a pension of up to two thirds of final salary.
Pensionable salary is the annual salary less an amount equal to the State Lower Earnings Limit.
Richard Hunting contributed 8.5% of his pensionable salary up until his Scheme retirement date of 31 July 2006.
Peter Rose contributes a similar proportion of his salary to the Scheme.
The Scheme provides all members with a lump sum death in service benefit of four times base salary and a spouses pension of two thirds of the members pension on the members death.
Bonuses and benefits do not qualify as pensionable salary.
Mr Rose is able to draw his pension on an unreduced basis from age 57 with the consent of the Company.
Annual Performance-Linked Cash Bonus An annual performance-linked cash bonus plan is in place for the executive Directors.
The plan, which is not pensionable, is designed to provide an incentive reward for performance and reflects the competitive markets in which the Group conducts its business.
In 2014 the bonus plan was amended to allow the Committee to incorporate a personal performance adjustor to the bonus, ranging from 0 to 1.25 times the award value.
The Committee is committed to publishing the personal targets set for the executive Directors and, where the personal performance adjustor is applied, will provide detailed disclosures to investors.
This amendment allows the Committee to reduce the formula-driven bonus to zero or increase the bonus up to 1.25 times the award value but not greater than the maximum payable under the plan rules.
Long-term Performance Related Incentives The Group operated four long-term incentive plans during the year all of which align the incentive packages of executives with the long-term interests of shareholders.
The Hunting PSP has replaced awards under the PSP and LTIP plans, details of which are set out below.
Performance Share Plan The PSP operated between 2009 and 2013 and has now been replaced by the Hunting PSP.
Awards under the PSP were granted annually and only vest if demanding performance conditions based on returns to shareholders are met.
Awards granted under the PSP, which are subject to a three year performance period, are based on the Groups TSR performance relative to the constituent members of the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and Services and the DJ STOXX TM Oil Equipment and Services sector indices and if the Committee determines the Groups financial performance to be satisfactory.
These indices were considered by the Committee to be appropriate as they compare the Groups performance against other companies in the oil and gas services sector.
Awards vest subject to the schedule outlined below: Groups TSR against the TSR of the members of the Comparator Group % of the award that vests Upper quartile 100% Between upper quartile and median On a straight-line basis between 40% and 100% Median 40% Below median 0% 2.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The LTIP, which operated between 2004 and 2013 has been replaced by the Hunting PSP.
The LTIP is a performance-linked plan with an incentive pool, which is calculated using the sum of the Groups after tax operating income after deducting a 7% charge on average shareholders funds for the after tax cost of capital.
Determination of the incentive pool incorporates two components, the first being 2% of the absolute value added, and the second being 5% of the incremental value added.
These performance conditions align the interests of the executives with those of the Group and its shareholders and will only produce value to the participants if value is created for the Group.
Awards are determined for each participant at the beginning of a three year performance cycle and are settled at the end of each cycle either in shares or in cash.
The award for each participant is calculated as a percentage of the incentive pool resulting from the performance of the business over the performance cycle, as determined by the Committee.
Executive Share Option Plan ESOP The Group operated an ESOP between 2001 and 2008 to provide long-term incentives for executive Directors and senior executives of the Group.
No further grants will be made under the ESOP.
Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY 66 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED 4.
Hunting PSP The Hunting PSP was approved by shareholders in April 2014 and replaces the PSP and LTIP incentive schemes.
Certain key shareholders were consulted on the new plans implementation during 2013 and 2014.
Shares awarded to the executive Directors under the Hunting PSP are divided equally into three tranches.
Each tranche is subject to a three year vesting period, and is also subject to a performance condition.
The three performance conditions are listed below: Relative TSR.
More detail on the performance conditions is provided in the following table: Proportion of Performance award condition Detail 33% TSR The Groups TSR will be measured over a three year period against a bespoke peer group selected from the same global market sector as Hunting.
25% of the award will vest if a median performance against the peer group is achieved, increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% if a top quartile performance against the peer group is achieved.
33% Underlying EPS The Groups growth in EPS will be measured across the three year vesting period.
25% of the award will vest if earnings growth achieves a minimum growth target set by the Committee increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% if a stretch growth target set by the Committee is achieved.
33% Underlying ROCE The Groups ROCE will be measured across the three year vesting period.
25% of the award will vest if ROCE achieves a minimum target set by the Committee increasing on a straightline basis to 100% if a stretch target set by the Committee is achieved.
The respective performance conditions will be measured at the end of the three year vesting period and awards to the executive Directors will be proportional to the total vesting level achieved.
The face value of the grant to the Chief Executive is 450% of base salary and 210% of base salary for the Finance Director.
Dividends declared by the Company during the vesting period are added to the awards once the final vesting levels have been determined.
Executive Director Service Contracts All existing executive Directors Service Contracts are rolling one year agreements and contain standard provisions allowing the Company to terminate summarily for cause, such as gross misconduct.
The Chief Executive entered into an Employment Agreement with Hunting Energy Services Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, on 7 February 2001.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, US.
Under the terms of the Agreement both Hunting Energy Services Inc. and the Chief Executive are required to give one years notice of termination.
The Agreement contains a pay in lieu of notice clause, which provides for payment of base salary, up to a maximum of one year, a performance bonus if earned and vacation pay based on an annual entitlement of five weeks.
There are special provisions on a change of control.
These provide for payment of an amount equal to the total of the base salary for one year and the average Performance Bonus over the immediately preceding two year period.
In addition, the Chief Executive would be entitled to continue to participate in the Group insurance programmes for 18 months following the change of control, and, unless otherwise provided in the relevant agreement, all share-based awards granted to him shall immediately accelerate and become exercisable as of the date of change of control.
The Finance Director entered into a Service Agreement with the Company on 23 April 2008.
Under the terms of the Service Agreement both the Company and the Director are required to give one years notice of termination.
The Company reserves the right to pay the Finance Director in lieu of notice whether given by the Company or by him which provides for payment of base salary up to a maximum of one year and bonus, which he would have been entitled to receive under his contract between the date of termination and the earliest date the appointment could otherwise be lawfully terminated, less income tax and National Insurance Contributions.
The Company also has the option to put the Finance Director on paid leave of absence following payment of a sum equivalent to salary and bonus based on the previous twelve month period, subject to him complying with the terms of his Service Agreement.
These conditions also apply on termination following a change of control and, in addition, the Finance Director would be entitled to an acceleration of all share-based awards which would immediately vest at the date of the change of control.
The Company has authorised the executive Directors to undertake non-executive directorships outside of the Group provided these do not interfere with their primary duties.
During the year neither executive Director held any external positions.
Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY 67 Non-executive Director Letters of Appointment On appointment each non-executive Director is provided with a letter of appointment which sets out the responsibilities and time commitments for the role.
Additional duties, as requested by the Nomination Committee, including chairing a Board subcommittee, are also incorporated into the letters of appointment and fees paid.
Non-executive Director appointments are usually for a fixed three year term, which can be terminated by either party at any time.
Payment for Loss of Office The Committee has considered the Companys policy on remuneration for executive Directors leaving the Company and is committed to applying a consistent approach to ensure that the Company pays no more than is necessary.
The loss of office payment policy subject to existing Service Contract agreements is generally aligned with market practice and depends on whether the departing executive Director is, or is deemed to be treated as, a good leaver or bad leaver.
A good leaver is defined as an employee who has ceased to be employed by the Group due to death, ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, the employees company ceasing to be a Group member or for any other reason, if the Committee so decides.
In the case of a good leaver the policy normally allows: payment in lieu of notice equal to twelve months base salary, pension contributions and contractual benefits: payment of a bonus for the period worked subject to the achievement of the relevant performance conditions: and any unvested long-term incentives to vest subject to the achievement of the performance conditions and pro-rated based on the period of service.
If an employee departs the Group for any other reason than those specified in the good leaver definition above then he she is treated as a bad leaver and unvested long-term incentives lapse immediately on cessation of employment.
The Committee retains discretion to satisfy bonus payments to those executive Directors deemed to be bad leavers.
New Director Policies As the Board of Hunting is refreshed, with new executive and non-executive Director appointments, the policy for remuneration for the new Board members, will align to those detailed above.
Hunting needs to be able to attract and retain the best executive and non-executive Directors in the market place.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the framework now in place will enable the Company to achieve its recruitment aims.
For executive Director appointments the fixed component of the total emoluments made will target the market mid-point, subject to geographic considerations of the candidate and the specific labour market conditions.
The Service Contracts will be rolling one year agreements with standard provisions.
The fixed components of emoluments will comprise base salary including any appropriate relocation or tax equalisation agreements, benefits including healthcare insurance, pension contributions, car benefits and any other components deemed necessary to secure an appointment.
The variable components to the emoluments will be implemented in line with the policies above, subject to any future amendments to these arrangements being approved by shareholders.
Annual Performance-Linked Cash Bonus arrangements will include awards up to 150% and 200% of base salary for the new Finance Director and Chief Executive respectively.
The maximum awards under the Hunting PSP will be up to 450% and 550% of base salary for the new Finance Director and Chief Executive respectively.
The Committee anticipates market standard change of control provisions within new Service Contracts.
In addition, for new appointees the Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and therefore shareholders.
Any such payments would take account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
For non-executive Director appointments, benchmarked fees to companies of similar size and profile to Hunting will be applied.
Consideration of Employment Conditions Elsewhere in the Group The Committee considers the general basic salary increases for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary increases for the executive Directors.
Employees have not been consulted in respect of the design of the Companys senior executive remuneration policy.
Shareholder Consultation and Feedback The Committee engaged in a shareholder consultation on the Policy and the Hunting PSP in the final quarter of 2013 and early 2014, with shareholders approving the new arrangements at the Companys AGM in April 2014.

Executive Directors salaries were increased in March 2014 by 2.8%.
Following shareholder approval at the Companys AGM the base salary of the Finance Director was set at 298,000 for 2014.
In 2014 the fees of the non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, were not increased in Sterling terms.
The movement in the $ exchange rate in the year has the effect of showing a year-on-year increase for all Board members, except that of Dennis Proctor whose base salary is determined and paid in US dollars.
Benefits include the provision of healthcare insurance, a company car and fuel benefits.
Dennis Proctors single figure pension remuneration represents the total Company contributions paid to his US pension arrangements.
Peter Rose is a member of a defined benefit pension scheme and the single figure pension remuneration has been calculated in a consistent way in accordance with the regulations and represents 20 times the increase in his accrued pension over 2014 and 2013 after allowing for CPI inflation and deducting his own pension contributions.
The principal reason for the increase in Mr Roses pension remuneration in 2014 is due to the increase in his base salary with effect from 1 January 2014.
The bonus is comprised 70% on a Profit Before Tax PBT target and 30% on a Return on Capital Employed ROCE target and is subject to the application of a personal performance adjustor.
In 2014, the PBT and ROCE targets exceeded the Annual Budget by 2.4% and 3.1% respectively, leading to a bonus allocation equating to 113% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 85% of base salary for the Finance Director.
Following review of the personal performance objectives set by the Committee in March 2014, a bonus adjustor of 1.0 times was applied to the formula driven allocation for each executive, resulting in no adjustment to the formula-driven annual bonus.
The bonus is comprised 70% on a PBT target and 30% on a ROCE target.
In 2013, the PBT and ROCE targets achieved were 98% and 94% of those Annual Budget items respectively, leading to bonus payments equating to 85% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 64% of base salary for the Finance Director.
The 2012 awards under the PSP have a three year performance period to 16 April 2015.
The awards were measured on 24 February 2015 against the performance conditions specified on page 65, which indicated that the 2012 awards were unlikely to vest.
On this basis, no payments are likely to be paid to executive Directors.
The 2011 awards under the PSP had a three year performance period to 24 February 2014.
The awards were measured on 24 February 2014 and were subject to the performance conditions specified on page 65, which resulted in a zero vesting.
No payments were therefore made to the executive Directors.
In accordance with the rules under the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the three year cycle ending 31 December 2014, the accumulated incentive pool totalled $9.8m, resulting in an entitlement of $2.8m to Dennis Proctor and an entitlement of $0.9m to Peter Rose.
Under the rules of the LTIP, Dennis Proctor is entitled to 35% of the accumulated incentive pool while Peter Rose is entitled to 15% of the incentive pool.
The maximum levels of award to Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose are capped at 350% and 175% of base salary respectively.
In accordance with the rules under the 2004 LTIP and the three year cycle ending 31 December 2013, the accumulated incentive pool totalled $12.2m, resulting in an entitlement of $2.7m to Dennis Proctor and an entitlement of $0.7m to Peter Rose.
Other remuneration represents additional UK tax payable under a tax equalisation agreement.
John Hofmeister received additional fees during 2014 following his appointment as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Andrew Szescila retired from the Board on 15 September 2014.

Salary and Fees In December 2013, the executive Directors reviewed the non-executive Directors fees, following receipt of benchmarked data from New Bridge Street.
The review resulted in no changes to the fees payable in 2014.
In March 2014, the Committee increased the 2014 base salary of the Chief Executive and Finance Director by 2.8% compared to 2013, following receipt of benchmarked data from New Bridge Street and Pearl Meyer.
Following approval by shareholders in April 2014, the base salary of the Finance Director was increased to $491,074 298,000 to bring his benchmarked salary in line with the approved Policy of targeting the market mid-point.
Pensions audited Dennis Proctor is a member of a deferred compensation scheme in the US, which is anticipated to provide a cash lump sum on his retirement.
In practice, this scheme is administered and operated on a money purchase basis.
In 2014, the Group contributed $131,496 2013 $177,908 to that arrangement.
There are no additional benefits provided on early retirement from this arrangement.
The Group also contributed $15,600 in 2014 2013 $15,300 to his US 401K tax deferred savings plan.
Peter Rose is a member of the defined benefit section of the Hunting pension scheme.
His accrued pension as at 31 December 2014 amounted to $186,000 p. a.
2013 $144,000 p. a. which includes a temporary pension of $nil p. a.
He is able to retire on 24 October 2018 age 60, his normal retirement age in that scheme, without any reduction on his main scheme benefits although there is a small part of his pension that is payable only from age 62 without reduction.
With Company consent Peter Rose is able to retire from age 57 without any actuarial reduction for early retirement applied to his accrued pension.
It is anticipated that Mr Roses pension remuneration in future years will be more in line with the 2013 pension remuneration figure, subject to inflationary movements and future increases to base salary.
Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION 72 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED Annual Performance-Linked Cash Bonus Plan The annual performance-linked cash bonus plan entitles the executive Directors to cash bonus payments when the actual financial results of the Group achieve preset financial targets based on the Groups Annual Budget.
The bonus has the potential to be adjusted to reflect the delivery of personal performance targets.
The 2014 actual results exceeded budgeted PBT and ROCE by 2.4% and 3.1% respectively, leading to a cash bonus allocation of $889,299 for Dennis Proctor and $416,922 253,002 for Peter Rose.
These amounts reflect 113% and 85% of the base salaries for Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose respectively.
Budgeted PBT and ROCE were $207.4m and 12.7% respectively.
In March 2014, the Committee set personal performance targets for each executive Director.
The targets and outcome, including the personal performance adjustor applied to the bonus, of each executive Director are summarised below: Description of Target Assessment Outcome Complete a strategic review The Chief Executive and Finance Director were The personal performance adjustor applied to Chief Executive only scored by the Committee in March 2015 on the the above bonus allocation was as follows: Improve organisational effectiveness basis of the targets set in 2014.
Chief Executive 1.00 out of 1.25 Plan senior management succession Factors taken into consideration included Finance Director 1.00 out of 1.25 Strengthen financial management completion of a strategic review, identification and Finance Director only adoption of improvements to operational effectiveness and actions taken to strengthen financial management.
Following application of the personal performance adjustor, the annual bonuses for 2014 payable to the Chief Executive and Finance Director are therefore $889,299 and $416,922 respectively.
The 2013 actual results were 98% of budgeted PBT and 94% of ROCE leading to a cash bonus payment of $647,285 for Dennis Proctor and $238,684 152,533 for Peter Rose.
The amounts paid reflect 85% and 64% of the base salaries for Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose respectively.
2012 PSP Vesting audited The 2012 awards granted under the PSP with a three year performance period to 16 April 2015 were measured by New Bridge Street on 24 February 2015 given that a substantial portion of the performance period had been completed.
This measurement indicated that the awards were unlikely to vest.
The Committee therefore advised that the 2012 share grants to the Chief Executive and Finance Director were likely to lapse resulting in no shares vesting to either executive Director.
This result will be confirmed in the 2015 Annual Report on Remuneration, or should there be a vesting, announced to investors on receipt of the final measurement of the performance conditions.
2011 PSP Vesting audited The 2011 awards granted under the PSP were measured by New Bridge Street on 24 February 2014 and resulted in a zero vesting.
The 2011 share grants to the Chief Executive and Finance Director duly lapsed with no shares vesting to either executive Director.
2012 LTIP Vesting audited On 31 December 2014, the 2012 award under the LTIP for the three year period commencing 1 January 2012 was measured in accordance with the plan rules and resulted in an accumulated incentive pool of $9.8m.
