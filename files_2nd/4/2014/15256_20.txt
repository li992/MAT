Governance Remuneration Committee report Dear Shareholder, On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our Remuneration report for 2014, which sets out the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors of the Group and the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 30 March 2014.
New regulations have come into effect, which have an impact on the presentation and disclosure of Directors remuneration, and the layout of this report reects those new regulations.
This report is, therefore, presented in two sections: the Directors Remuneration Policy Report and the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Directors Remuneration Policy Report sets out the forward-looking remuneration policy that will be subject to a binding vote at the AGM on 23 July 2014.
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details of the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 30 March 2014 and how the Directors Remuneration Policy will be operated for the year commencing 31 March 2014, and will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM.
The Committee believes that a significant proportion of senior executives remuneration should be made up of performance-related incentives so that overall reward is closely aligned to the creation of long-term shareholder value.
This years remuneration again reects the delivery of strong performance in challenging economic circumstances.
Incentive out-turns The Groups performance during the year is reported in detail throughout the Annual Report and, in the view of the Committee, justifies the payments to Executive Directors under the annual bonus plan as set out on page 64.
Executive Directors are encouraged to invest an amount up to the value of their annual bonus in shares in the Group in return for an opportunity to earn a matching share award under the Co-invest element of the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The matching share award granted in 2011 will vest on a one-to-one basis in July 2014 based on achievement of compound annual growth in adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS of 12.08% over the three-year performance period to 30 March 2014.
The long term incentive options granted in 2010 vested at 72.4% in July 2013 based on achievement of compound annual growth in adjusted EPS of 15.8% to 31 March 2013 and second quartile Total Shareholder Return TSR performance over the three-year period to 14 June 2013.
Long term incentive options granted in 2011 are expected to vest at 36.2% in July 2014 based on achievement of compound annual growth in adjusted EPS of 12.08% to 30 March 2014 and an expected second quartile TSR performance to 27 June 2014.
54 Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 2014 decisions On 25 July 2013, it was announced that Dr Richard Steeves, Group Chief Executive officer, would succeed Sir Duncan Nichol as Non-Executive Chairman of the Group upon his retirement on 31 March 2014 and that Dr Adrian Coward would take over from Dr Richard Steeves as Group Chief Executive officer.
As a result of the expanding opportunity for the growth in outsourced hospital sterilisation services in the US, the Board has decided that Dr Richard Steeves should defer his move from Group Chief Executive officer to Chairman and Sir Duncan Nichol has similarly delayed his retirement.
Dr Adrian Coward, who was regional Chief Executive officer for the UK & Ireland, took on a broader role as Group Chief Operating officer for the Group as a whole, and joined the Board with effect from 31 March 2014.
For the financial year that commenced 31 March 2014 the base salaries for the Executive Directors have been increased to 480,000 for Dr Richard Steeves and 290,000 for Gavin Hill, and the base salary for Adrian Coward has been set at 290,000 reecting his promotion to Group Chief Operating officer.
On 2 June 2014, Richard Steeves entered into a new contract to reect his return to the sole role as Group Chief Executive officer.
We have continued to monitor our executive remuneration policy to take account of evolving market practice whilst also seeking to ensure that a fair and stable framework is maintained and avoiding making unnecessary and frequent changes to the structure of pay.
Accordingly, the existing remuneration policy and fundamental structure of the package remains largely unchanged and the overall quantum of the incentives has not changed.
We believe this ensures a continued alignment to business strategy and encourages the creation of shareholder value.
The rules of the Groups LTIP expire in 2015.
Therefore, the grant of awards in respect of the year ending 29 March 2015 is likely to be the final grant of awards under the LTIP.
During the year ending 29 March 2015, the Committee will review the LTIP and the overall Executive Directors remuneration package, with a view to seeking shareholder approval at the 2015 AGM for a new LTIP, aligned with the Companys ongoing strategy.
For LTIP awards to be granted in respect of the year ending 29 March 2015, the Committee has introduced a malus provision, enabling the Committee to reduce or cancel unvested awards in certain circumstances, as referred to on page 56.
Governance We remain committed to a responsible approach in respect of executive pay.
The Committee will continue to engage actively with and seek to incorporate the views of its shareholders in any major changes to the Executive Directors remuneration policy.
Constance Baroudel Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 4 June 2014 Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 55 Governance Remuneration Committee report continued Remuneration Committee members Constance Baroudel Chairman Sir Duncan Nichol Jeff Harris Liz Hewitt Introduction The Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2013 and meets the relevant requirements of the FCA Listing Rules.
Policy report This part of the report sets out the Directors Remuneration Policy, which, subject to shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM, shall take binding effect from the date of that meeting.
The Policy has been determined by the Committee.
Information on how the Committee intends to implement the policy for the current financial year is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 64 to 69.
Key elements of pay An overview of the main elements of the Executive Directors remuneration is set out below: Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Base salary Core element of xed remuneration reecting the individuals Base salaries are normally reviewed once a year.

of personal objectives relevant to the Groups strategy.
The Committee has the discretion to amend the bonus pay-out should any formulaic outputs not produce a fair result for either the Executive Director or the Company, taking into account overall business performance.
Executive Directors have the opportunity to invest an amount up to the value of their annual bonus in shares in the Company in return for an opportunity to earn a matching share award under the Co-invest element of the LTIP as described below.

as at 30 March 2014 are shown on page 64.
Salary increases are reviewed in the context of the wider workforce increases and the Committee considers any increase out of line with this carefully.
Higher increases may be awarded in circumstances such as: Increase in scope and responsibility: Promotional increase to Executive Director: and A salary falling below market positioning.
Whilst the Committee has not set an absolute maximum on the levels of Not applicable.
benefit Executive Directors receive, the value of benets is set at a level which the Committee considers appropriate and provides sufficient level of benefit based on individual circumstances.
Participation limits are those set by the UK tax authorities from time to time.
No performance conditions are attached to awards in line with HMRC practice.
Contribution rates are up to 15% of base salary.
Maximum bonus opportunity is 100% of base salary.
Stretching targets are set each year reecting business priorities, which underpin the Groups strategy and align with financial key performance indicators.
Targets, whilst stretching, do not encourage inappropriate business risks to be taken.
At least 60% of total bonus opportunity is based on financial performance set by the Committee and the remainder based on non-financial strategic measures and or individual performance reviewed and approved by the Committee at the start of the financial year and clearly aligned to the strategic objectives of the Group.
Vesting will apply on a scale between 0% and 100% based on the Committees assessment of the extent to which a performance metric has been met.
Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 57 Governance Remuneration Committee report continued Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation LTIP Incentivise executive performance over the longer term.
Awards under the LTIP comprise two elements: Supports retention and promote share ownership.
LTIP Option: annual awards of nominal cost options with vesting dependent on the achievement of performance over a three-year period.
Supports creation of shareholder value.
LTIP Co-invest: Executive Directors are encouraged to invest their annual bonus in shares in the Company in return for an opportunity to earn a matching share award granted in the form of a nominal cost option.
The vesting of the matching shares is dependent on the achievement of performance over a three-year measurement period and the retention of the investment shares throughout this measurement period.
The Committee will regularly review the performance conditions and targets for awards to ensure they are aligned with the Groups business strategy and remain challenging.
Any LTIP Options and LTIP Co-invest awards granted in 2014 will be subject to a malus provision such that, at the discretion of the Committee, unvested awards may be reduced or cancelled in certain circumstances such as misstatement of results, material failure of risk management by a Group company, or information coming to light which, had it been known at the relevant time, would have affected a vesting decision or reputational damage to the Company.
Explanation of chosen performance measures and how targets are set Performance measures have been selected that reect the key performance indicators for the Company and are aligned to the Companys strategy.
Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual incentive and long term incentive awards.
In setting these stretching performance targets the Committee will take into account a number of different reference points which may include the Companys business plans and strategy.
The annual bonus is assessed against both financial and individual strategic targets as determined by the Committee.
This incentivises Executive Directors to focus on delivering the key financial goals of the Group as well as specic strategic objectives for each Director which are aligned to the delivery of the overall business strategy.
Long term incentive performance conditions are chosen by the Committee to provide a robust and transparent basis on which to measure the Groups performance over a longer term timeframe.
The Committee considers that EPS is closely aligned to the Companys key performance metrics and, in conjunction with the annual bonus performance metrics, provides a balanced measurement of performance that encourages sustainable growth.
TSR aligns managements objectives to those of shareholders and rewards for the delivery of year-on-year growth and delivery of value to shareholders.
For the relative TSR performance condition there will be no vesting for performance below median compared with the comparator group.
In addition, no part of the long term incentive will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that vesting is justied by the underlying financial performance of the Group over the measurement period.
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust the performance targets and measures where it considers it appropriate to do so for example, to reect changes in the structure of the business and to assess performance on a fair and consistent basis from year to year.
Awards may be adjusted in the event of a variation of capital in accordance with the scheme rules.
58 Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Opportunity Performance measures The maximum opportunities for the LTIP Option and LTIP Co-invest are set out In addition to the performance conditions detailed below, the vesting of any separately below.
LTIP award is also subject to an additional test based on the Committees assessment of and satisfaction that vesting is justied by the underlying financial performance of the Group over the measurement period.
LTIP Option awards are typically up to 150% of base salary.
50% of the LTIP Option is based on the achievement of stretching annual growth in EPS targets.
25% of this element vests for threshold performance, 50% for target performance and 100% for maximum performance.
Vesting is on a straight-line basis between these points.
50% of the LTIP Option is based on relative TSR of the Company.
25% of this element vests for minimum performance and 100% for maximum with straight-line vesting between these points.
Under the LTIP Co-invest element, an amount up to 100% of the bonus Vesting of the LTIP Co-invest is based on the achievement of stretching earned may be invested in shares in the Company and matched, up to a annual growth in EPS.
For maximum EPS growth or above, two shares vest two-for-one basis.
For EPS growth between minimum and maximum performance, one share vests for every share invested.
Non-Executive Directors Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Non-Executive Director fees Sole element of Non-Executive Director Fees are reviewed periodically.

Actual fee levels are disclosed in the The Non-Executive Directors do not Annual Report on Remuneration on participate in any of share incentive page 64. plans nor do they receive any pension contributions.
Non-Executive Directors may be eligible to benets such as the use of secretarial support, travel costs or other benets as appropriate.
Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 59 Governance Remuneration Committee report continued Remuneration policy for new hires When hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee will typically seek to use the policy detailed in the Policy table above to determine the Executive Directors ongoing remuneration package.
However, subject to the principles and limits set out below, to facilitate the hiring of candidates of the appropriate calibre required to implement the Groups strategy, the Committee retains the discretion to make remuneration decisions which are outside the Policy.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, the nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction the candidate was recruited from to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both the Group and its shareholders.
This may, for example, include but is not limited to the following circumstances: An interim appointment being made to ll an Executive Director role on a short-term basis: Exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a Non-Executive Director takes on an executive function on a short-term basis: An Executive Director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or long term incentive award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance.
The quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may be transferred to the subsequent year so that reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis: or The Executive Director received benets at his previous employer which the Remuneration Committee considers it appropriate to offer.
Appropriate costs and support will be covered if the recruitment requires the relocation of the individual.
The Committee will ensure that awards within the maximum variable remuneration limit set out below are linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance measures.
The Committee does not intend to use this discretion to make a  incentive payment for example a golden hello.
The Committee may also alter the performance measures, performance period and vesting period of the annual bonus or long term incentive, subject to the rules of the scheme, if the Remuneration Committee determines that the circumstances of the recruitment merit such alteration.
The rationale will be clearly explained.
The Committee may make an award or payment to buy-out incentive remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors regarding the forfeited arrangements which may include the form of any forfeited awards e. g. cash or shares, any performance conditions attached to these awards and the likelihood of meeting those conditions and the time over which they would have vested.
It will generally seek to structure buy-out awards and payments on a comparable basis to remuneration arrangements forfeited.
The Committee would seek to incorporate buy-out awards to be in line with the Companys remuneration framework as far as is practical.
These awards or payments are excluded from the maximum level of variable pay referred to below: however, the Committees intention is that the value awarded or paid would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements.
All recruitment awards, buy-out awards and payments will normally be liable to forfeiture or clawback on early departure i. e. within one year.
The maximum level of variable pay which may be awarded to new Executive Directors, excluding buy-out arrangements, would normally be in line with the maximum level of variable pay that may be awarded under the annual bonus plan and LTIP, but in any event the Committee would not make an award of annual variable pay above 450% of salary.
The Committee will ensure that such awards will be forfeited if performance or continued employment conditions are not met.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under the Companys existing share plans.
If necessary, and subject to the limits referred to above, in order to facilitate the awards mentioned above, the Committee may rely on exemption 9.4.
2. of the Listing Rules which allows for the grant of awards to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, the recruitment of a Director.
Where a position is lled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue according to the original terms.
Fees payable to a newly-appointed Chairman or Non-Executive Director will be in line with the fee policy in place at the time of appointment.
Pay policy for other employees The remuneration policy applied to the most senior executives in the Group is similar to the policy for the Executive Directors in that a significant element of remuneration is dependent on Group and individual performance.
The key principles of the remuneration philosophy are applied consistently across the Group below this level, taking account of seniority and local market practice.
In addition, a UK all-employee share scheme is offered to all UK employees encouraging share ownership throughout the Group.

Service contracts The contract details for the current Executive Directors are as follows: Effective date Expiry Notice period by Group Notice period by Executive Director Dr Richard Steeves 02.06.2014 One year rolling 12 months 12 months Gavin Hill 26.04.2010 One year rolling 12 months 12 months Dr Adrian Coward 31.03.2014 One year rolling 12 months 12 months The Committee believes that this arrangement provides a measure of stability in that it provides an opportunity for the recruitment of replacement executives and an orderly handover of duties.
As disclosed last year, following the acquisition of SRI and reecting the importance of the Americas region to the Group, Dr Richard Steeves spent a substantial amount of time working in the US.
The Company formalised Dr Richard Steeves role as Chief Executive officer of the Americas region and his role as Group Chief Executive officer under two separate contracts effective 3 November 2012.
The contract in the UK for the Group Chief Executive officer role replaced the original agreement in the UK dated 1 November 1999.
With effect from 2 June 2014, Dr Richard Steeves entered into a new contract with the Group to reect his return full time to his role as Group Chief Executive officer, replacing the two previous contracts which were effective from 3 November 2012.
No changes have been made to the notice period in his new contract, or to the policy set out below relating to termination of an Executive Directors service contract.
Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 61 Governance Remuneration Committee report continued The policy below is applied in the event of termination of an Executive Directors service contract: Policy General principles The service contracts of all the Executive Directors contain a provision, exercisable at the option of the Group, to pay an amount on early termination of employment.
The Committees policy is that payments to Executive Directors on termination should reect the circumstances that prevail at that time, also taking account of, if applicable and appropriate, the Directors duty to mitigate.
Other than the maximum limits set out below, no predetermined compensation is payable.
Payment in lieu of notice Payments in lieu of notice are equivalent to one years base salary and pension contributions.
Consideration will also be given to the inclusion of benets.
The Group will use the pay in lieu of notice provisions when the speed, certainty and protection of restrictive covenants afforded by such clauses are thought to be in the best interests of the Group and the circumstances surrounding the departure of the relevant Director justify their use.
Annual bonus The Committee has the discretion to determine appropriate bonus amounts taking into consideration the circumstances in which the Executive Director leaves.
Typically good leavers bonus amounts will be determined by reference to the applicable performance targets, pro-rated for time in service to termination and paid at the usual time.
The Committee may decide to pay a good leavers bonus earlier than the usual time in appropriate circumstances.
Typically for good leavers, bonus amounts as estimated by the Committee will be pro-rated for time in service to termination and will be, subject to performance, paid at the usual time.
Good leavers typically include leavers due to death, illness, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement with the consent of the Company or any other reason as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
LTIP The extent to which any award under the LTIP will vest would be determined based on the leaver provisions contained within the LTIP rules.
If the participant leaves before the end of the measurement period applying to an awards performance condition other than as a result of his death, that award will lapse 30 days after cessation unless the Committee determines otherwise.
If the Committee determines otherwise, the award shall be exercisable in such period as the Committee determines and to the extent the Committee shall determine, taking into account such factors as it considers relevant, including the increase in the value of a share over the measurement period, the underlying financial performance of the Company and the length of time for which the participant was an employee.
If the participant leaves due to death, the Committee shall determine the extent to which the award may be exercised.
If the participant ceases employment for any reason after the end of the measurement period relating to an award, the participant may exercise that award to the extent vested in the period of six months after the date of cessation.
Change of control Awards under the LTIP will vest to the extent determined by the Committee in the event of a change of control of the Company.
The Committee will determine the level of vesting taking account of performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, pro-rating for time, where applicable.
Alternatively, participants may be allowed or required to exchange their awards for awards over shares in the acquiring company.
Awards under the Sharesave scheme will vest on a change of control.
Mitigation The Executive Directors service contracts do not provide for any reduction in payments for mitigation or for early payment.
Other payments In appropriate circumstances, payments may also be made in respect of accrued holiday, outplacement and legal fees.
Awards under the Sharesave scheme will vest if a participant ceases employment due to death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or the transfer of his employer out of the Group.
Where a buy-out award is made under the listing rules then the leaver provisions would be determined at the time of the award.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Directors ofce or employment.
In doing so, the Committee will recognise and balance the interests of shareholders and the departing Executive Director, as well as the interests of the remaining Directors.
Where the Committee retains discretion it will be used to provide exibility in certain situations, taking into account the particular circumstances of the Executive Directors departure and performance.
62 Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Non-Executive Directors terms of appointment All Non-Executive Directors are engaged on letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities and confirm their remuneration.

Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company Salary, benets and performance-related reward provided to employees is taken into account when setting Policy for Executive Directors remuneration although employees are not formally consulted in relation to the setting of the Policy.
This includes consideration of: Salary increases for the general employee population: Company-wide benefit including pension offerings: Overall spend and participation levels in the annual bonus and LTIP: and The Remuneration Committee taking into account relevant ad hoc information.
Existing contractual arrangements The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of ofce notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out below where the terms of the payment were agreed: i Before the Policy came into effect including the vesting and exercise of long term incentive awards in line with the LTIP rules under which these awards were made : or ii At a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Group and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
The Committee may make minor changes to this Policy, which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid in its operation or implementation without seeking shareholder approval but taking into account the interests of shareholders.
Statement of consideration of shareholders views The Group is committed to ongoing dialogue and seeks shareholder views ahead of making significant changes to its remuneration policies.

Summary of remuneration policy The main objectives of the Groups remuneration policy are: Key principles Remuneration policy Paying competitively In setting executive salaries, the Committee takes into account a number of factors, including market conditions, salaries in comparable companies in similar industries and affordability, in order to attract and retain competent executives.
The Committee also considers general pay and employment conditions of all employees within the Group and is sensitive to them, to prevailing market conditions and to governance trends when assessing the level of salaries and the remuneration packages of Executive Directors.
Pay for performance A substantial proportion of Executive Director remuneration is variable, linked to the Groups performance, in particular to the delivery of sustained profitable growth as well as individual performance.
The Committee does not consider that the targets that are included in the remuneration package are incompatible with the Executive Directors responsibility for environmental, social and governance matters.
Whilst the Committees terms of reference do not require specic targets on these matters, the Committee is obliged to ensure that, when setting remuneration policy, appropriate incentives are provided to encourage enhanced performance in a fair and reasonable manner.
Alignment with interests A substantial proportion of the package is delivered in shares in the Company to ensure that the interests of executives are of shareholders aligned with those of shareholders.
The Co-invest element to the annual bonus also encourages prolonged share ownership.
Directors remuneration audited The remuneration of the Directors for the period to 30 March 2014 was as follows: Long term Total Salary fees Benets Bonus incentive Pension remuneration 000 000 000 000 000 000 1 Dr Richard Steeves 466 53 357 1,066 70 2,012 Gavin Hill 280 18 214 243 28 783 Sir Duncan Nichol 80 80 2 Jeff Harris 29 29 Constance Baroudel 45 45 Liz Hewitt 45 45 Notes: 1 The amounts shown in the table above have been aggregated and converted into Sterling at an exchange rate of $1.6131:1.00 in respect of salary.
