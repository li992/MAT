Remuneration policy and report Policy, framework and implementation The Group has again performed strongly in the context of an improvement across the listed housebuilding sector, and continues to clearly outperform its construction sector peers.
The revised 2018 strategy announced in February 2014, Group performance, and the future direction of the Group, give the Committee renewed confidence that its Remuneration Policy is aligned with both corporate strategyand delivery by the executive team.
We were therefore happy to approve the reward packages received by the chief executive and his executive team during the financial year, and in particular the variable elements of pay.
Further details regarding the specific variable elements of pay received by the executive directors, to recognise their outstanding annual performance delivered for shareholders, including profit in excess of plan and success on a number of strategic fronts, such as accelerated land acquisition, can be found in the Directors Remuneration Reporton pages 58to63.
All variable elements of pay were specifically approved in line with the Remuneration Policy.
The Committee continues to monitor and review pay and conditions across the Group, and in particular the wider executive population immediately beneath the senior team.
Pay increases above inflation were awarded to all staff on review in July 2014, withdiscretionary Introduction: Amanda Burton merit-based increases for those performing exceptionally.
