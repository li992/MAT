B3 Directors remuneration report This report covers the activities of the Remuneration Committee for the year ended 30 September 2014 and sets out the remuneration policy and remuneration details for the executive and non-executive directors of the Company.
It has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2008, as amended in August 2013, and the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The report is split into three main areas: the Statement by the Chairman of the Committee B3.1, the Annual Report on Remuneration B3.2 and the Policy Report B3.3.
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details on remuneration in the period and some other information required by the Regulations.
It will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting.
The Policy Report which sets out the directors remuneration policy was subject to a binding shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting held on 6 February 2014.
This policy will apply until the Annual General Meeting in 2017, unless revised by a vote of shareholders ahead of that time.
It is not proposed to amend the directors remuneration policy at the Annual General Meeting in 2015.
The Companies Act 2006 requires the auditors to report to the shareholders on certain parts of the report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations.
The parts of the Annual Report on Remuneration that are subject to audit are indicated in that report.
The Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the Policy Report are not subject to audit.
B3.1 STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The information provided in this part of the Directors Remuneration Report is not subject to audit.
Dear Shareholder The philosophy underpinning the Groups remuneration policy seeks to produce an outcome which is fair and appropriate to the Company, its shareholders, senior executives and staff.
Company performance is central, with the focus being on short and long term qualitative and quantitative objectives with an emphasis on strong risk management.
The Group has made excellent progress against the objectives set at the beginning of the financial year: underlying operating profit has increased by 18.1% to 122.2 million, 656.6 million of first mortgage loans were advanced, whilst maintaining high credit standards, 175.7 million was invested in loan portfolios, two public securitisations were completed on improving terms, warehouse funding facilities were increased and extended, and Paragon Bank was launched, marking the Groups return to consumer lending.
The Committee has reflected this positive performance in applying the remuneration policy.
Performance bonuses of 100% of maximum for Mr N S Terrington, 100% of maximum for Mr R J Woodman for the period from 1 October 2013 to 31 May 2014, when he became Group Finance Director and 85% of maximum for the remainder of the year, 75% of maximum for Mr J A Heron and 75% of maximum for Mr N Keen for the period up to 31 May 2014, the date of his retirement as a director, have been awarded.
In reaching this decision, the Committee has reviewed performance against a number of financial and risk based targets, taking into account individual performance, as discussed in more detail in section B3.2.
Long term incentives LTIs which were granted in December 2010 matured in December 2013.
These awards were subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition, measured against the FTSE-250 Index over the three year period from the date of grant.
The Companys performance over the period ranked in the upper quartile and it is the judgement of the Committee that these rewards to executives are a fair reflection of performance over the period, and therefore the awards vested in full.
During the year the Committee considered various aspects of its policy on executive director remuneration.
In particular the use of Earnings Per Share EPS performance conditions in the Groups LTIs and the levels at which these were set was rigorously examined by the Committee to ensure that they were both appropriate and sufficiently challenging.
The Committee concluded that the remuneration policy including the performance metrics used for awards of LTIs remained appropriate and would apply during the year and in future years.
The EPS metrics will be kept under annual review.
There have been no changes to remuneration policy during the year and none are currently proposed.
The other key decisions made by the Committee during the year are as follows: Salaries for the year ending 30 September 2015 have been increased by 2%, slightly below the general level of increases to other employees.

indd 52 16 12 2014 10:43 B Corporate governance Awards of performance shares with a market value of 200% of salary, vesting of half of which is subject to a relative TSR performance condition measured against the constituents of the FTSE-250 Index excluding investment trusts and vesting of half of which is subject to an EPS performance condition measured against a retail price index related target, will be awarded shortly.
Together with the Group Chairman, I consulted with major shareholders and a number of shareholder advisory bodies prior to the Committees finalisation of the decisions above and received broad support.
During the year ending 30 September 2015 the Committee will undertake a review of the new requirements in respect of executive remuneration introduced in the revised version of the UK Code on Corporate Governance applicable to financial years commencing on or after 1 October 2014.
It is not expected, at this stage, that any significant changes will be required to executive remuneration or the related incentive plans resulting from this review.
The Committee is mindful that proposed regulatory changes in the financial services sector may result in a need to rebalance the executive directors pay and as a result, the Committee retains discretion to adjust the proportions of fixed and variable pay within the current total remuneration package if new legislation were to impact the executive directors in due course.
Should this be the case, the Company would enter into appropriate dialogue with its major shareholders and, depending on the nature of any changes, may be required to seek shareholder approval for a revised remuneration policy.
The most important challenge for the Committee will be to continue to ensure that the remuneration policy remains appropriately structured to retain and motivate executive directors, whilst providing alignment with shareholders and, most importantly, directly linking to the achievement of the Companys strategy.
I commend this report to shareholders and ask you to support the resolution to approve the Companys Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ended 30 September 2014 at the Annual General Meeting in 2015.
AlAN k FlETCHER Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 25 November 2014 B3.2 ANNUAl REPORT ON REMUNERATION B3.2.
1 Application of policy The information provided in this part of the Directors Remuneration Report is not subject to audit.
Consideration by directors of matters relating to directors remuneration Remuneration Committee During the year, the Committee consisted of Alan Fletcher who chaired the Committee, Fiona Clutterbuck, Peter Hartill and Edward Tilly, all of whom were independent non-executive directors, and the Chairman of the Company, Robert Dench.
None of the non-executive directors who sit on the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder, conflict of interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Chairman of the Company does not participate in discussions on his own remuneration.
The Committee determines the Companys policy on executive remuneration and specific compensation packages for each of the executive directors and the Chairman.
No director contributes to any discussion about his own remuneration.
The Committee also reviews the level and structure of remuneration of senior management.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on request from the Company Secretary.

indd 53 16 12 2014 10:43 B Corporate governance B3.2 Annual report on remuneration continued In determining the directors remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted Mr N S Terrington Chief Executive about its proposals.
The Committee retained New Bridge Street NBS, a brand of Aon Hewitt Limited, as its independent advisor on remuneration matters and retained their services throughout the year.
NBS is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and has signed up to its Code of Conduct.
NBS also advised the Company on various sundry remuneration matters during the year, which did not conflict with its advice to the Committee.
In evaluating the independence of NBS the Committee considered the following: other services provided to the Company and the fees paid by it to the advisors wider group, Aon Hewitt: fees paid to NBS as a percentage of its wider groups total revenues in the year: the policy of NBS to prevent conflicts of interest: whether there were any relationships between NBS and any member of the Committee: whether there were any shares in the Company owned by NBS or its wider group: and any business or personal relationships between NBS or its wider group and any senior executive of the Company.
Aon Hewitt provided administration services to the corporate Trustee of the Groups retirement benefits plan during the year but given the independence of the Trustee this was not considered to be advice to the Board.
Aon Hewitt also acted as the administrators of the Groups stakeholder defined contribution pension plan during the year.
It provided no advice to the Board in this capacity.
NBS has written to the Committee Chairman to confirm its position on these matters.
Its total fees for the year ended 30 September 2014 were 73,000 2013: 109,000, which were charged on the basis of the work carried out by it.
During the year the Committee reviewed and considered the impact of the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authoritys Remuneration Code Remuneration Code which governs the compensation of senior personnel in the banking sector, referred to as Remuneration Code Staff.
The Remuneration Code applies to Paragon Bank and as part of its governance arrangements a remuneration committee has been established, reporting to the banks board of directors, which has identified those bank employees who are Remuneration Code Staff and ensures that Paragon Bank complies with the Remuneration Code on an ongoing basis in respect of those staff.
The Committee reviews the work undertaken by the banks remuneration committee through regular reports submitted to it.
However, the Remuneration Code states that in certain circumstances it must also be applied at Group level.
The Committee has reviewed and discussed the requirements in this complex area and, after due consideration, has concluded that, at present, the Remuneration Code does not apply to employees outside Paragon Bank.
This conclusion will be kept under review to take account of developments both within Paragon Group and in the regulatory framework.

indd 54 16 12 2014 10:43 B Corporate governance Application of remuneration policy for the year ending 30 September 2015 Salary The Chairmans fees and executive directors salaries are determined by the Committee immediately prior to the start of each financial year.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers remuneration levels within the Group as a whole, individual and business performance during the year and in the past has also utilised periodic objective research which gives up-to-date information on comparable FTSE-250 companies.
The current salaries of the Chairman and the executive directors with effect from 1 October 2014 are as follows: Salary with effect from Position Director 1 October 2014 1 October 2013 Chairman R G Dench 211,250 207,000 Chief Executive N S Terrington 452,500 443,450 Group Finance Director R J Woodman 285,000 - N Keen - 332,000 Director Mortgages J A Heron 241,250 236,400 Director Corporate Development R J Woodman - 236,400 In view of the progress made by the Group during the year, the Committee agreed that the Chairmans fee and the salaries of Mr N S Terrington and Mr J A Heron would be increased by 2.0% from 1 October 2014.
This is below the level of increases for the Groups wider workforce.
Mr R J Woodmans salary was reviewed during the year and increased to 285,000 with effect from 1 June 2014 to reflect his new role as Group Finance Director: the next review of his salary will take effect from October 2015.
The non-executive directors fees have been reviewed during the year and from 1 October 2014 are as follows: Base fee 50,000 2014: 45,000 Additional fee for Senior Independent Director 20,000 2014: 15,000 Additional fee for chairmen of committees 20,000 2014: 15,000 The additional fee for chairmen of committees is currently payable to the Chairmen of the Remuneration, Audit and Risk and Compliance Committees, but would be payable for the chairmanship of such additional Committees as should be authorised by the Board.
The Companys Articles of Association include a limit on the total aggregate fees that can be paid to non-executive directors.
At the 2014 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved a resolution to increase this limit to 400,000, as it was deemed that the previous limit might not have proved adequate to meet the Companys future needs.
In addition to fees earned as a non-executive director, Mr A K Fletcher serves as a director of the corporate trustee of the Paragon Pension Plan the Plan and receives 10,000 per annum in respect of that appointment from Paragon Finance PLC, the sponsoring company of the Plan and a subsidiary of the Company.
The Plan is a trust which is independent of the Company and, as a director of its corporate trustee, Mr Fletcher has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the trust and the Plans beneficiaries.
Pension contributions The executive directors are members of the Plan, to which the Company contributes at the same rate as for all members.
Dependants of executive directors who are members of the Plan are eligible for a dependants pension and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
The pension arrangements provide for a pension of 1 37.5 of basic annual salary to a maximum of 2 3 for every year of eligible service.
Where pension contributions are capped, additional payments are made to enable further provision.
As described below the executive directors have each ceased pension accrual in return for a cash supplement calculated to equate to the cost of the Companys contributions towards future service benefits had each individual stayed within the Plan for his future service accrual.
There are no unfunded promises or similar arrangements for directors.

indd 55 16 12 2014 10:43 B Corporate governance B3.2 Annual report on remuneration continued Benefits The Chairman and executives are entitled to family cover private medical health cover, life insurance cover of up to seven times their salary and a car allowance of up to 12,000 per annum.
Performance bonuses The purpose of the bonus is to provide a meaningful cash incentive focused on improving the performance of the Company through the achievement of a number of predetermined objectives.
The annual bonus is non-pensionable.
The bonus payable to executive directors under the bonus scheme is capped at 200% of salary.
A target level of 100% of salary is awarded for delivery of the base business plan and agreed objectives, with achievement of the planned profit level forming a major element.
For the year ending 30 September 2015, the annual bonus will be based on performance against the following performance measures: 1 operational profit, 2 future value of new business and 3 risk, each with equal weightings together with each directors performance against strategic and personal objectives, which will determine the level of a scale factor of between 0.5 and 1.5 times.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these are felt to be commercially sensitive.
Retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be set out in next years Annual Report on Remuneration except to the extent that any measure target remains commercially sensitive.
25% of amounts awarded in excess of 50,000 are deferred, to be payable in shares together with the aggregate amount of accrued dividend thereon, after three years, net of any clawback applied see below.
The Committee may require higher levels of deferment.
Clawback provisions apply to awards granted under the deferred bonus scheme.
The provisions give the Committee scope to reduce awards that have been granted, but have not vested if appropriate, to zero in the event of a material misstatement of the Groups accounts or if the number of shares granted was based on any other kind of error that resulted in more shares being awarded than there should have been.
The provisions also enable the Committee to claw back amounts that have vested under the plan, in the event of a material misstatement, miscalculation as a result of an error or in the event of misconduct.
Clawback can be implemented at any time prior to the second anniversary of the vesting date.
Share awards Executive directors are eligible for awards under the Paragon Performance Share Plan PSP and are entitled to participate in the Paragon UK Sharesave Plan 2009, on the same terms as other employees.
The terms of the Sharesave Plan will be reviewed within the next twelve months in line with the Finance Act 2014.
Paragon Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP has an annual award limit to an individual of shares worth 200% of salary.
Awards over shares with a market value of 200% of salary will be granted to the current executive directors in the year ending 30 September 2015.
No awards will be made to former directors.
50% of awards are subject to the TSR test and 50% are subject to an EPS test.
The TSR test compares the rank of the Companys TSR against a comparator group of companies comprising the constituents of the FTSE-250 Index, excluding investment trusts, on the date of grant over the three years commencing on the date of grant.
25% of awards vest for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
The FTSE-250 has been chosen because it is a broad-based index and because of the lack of comparable listed financial services organisations at the current time.
The Committee believes that TSR usefully aligns the long-term performance conditions with the best interests of the shareholders.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 56 GRP8641 - Annual report and accounts 2014 FINAL.
indd 56 16 12 2014 10:43 B Corporate governance The EPS test provides that 25% of EPS tested awards will vest where EPS growth is equal to the increase in the retail price index plus 3%, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for EPS growth equal to the increase in the retail price index plus 7% or more.
In addition, prior to any awards vesting, the Committee must be satisfied that the requirements of a financial underpin test have been met.
Clawback provisions apply to awards granted under the PSP.
The provisions also enable the Committee to clawback amounts that have vested under the plan, in the event of a material misstatement, miscalculation as a result of an error or in the event of misconduct.
Paragon Matching Share Plan MSP The Committee does not intend to grant any awards in the year ending 30 September 2015.
The MSP expires in February 2016 and it is unlikely that this plan will be utilised prior to expiry.

Single total figure of remuneration for each director The following tables have been prepared using the measures prescribed by The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
In accordance with the Regulations, the amounts shown in respect of pension accrual have been calculated by applying a factor of 20 to the increase in accrued pension, after adjusting for inflation, whilst the values shown for share awards vesting in the year have been calculated on the basis of the share price at the vesting date, which may not necessarily equate to the price at which the awards have been or may be exercised.
He received no additional remuneration on cessation of office.
On retirement the Remuneration Committee determined that Mr Keen should be considered a good leaver for the purposes of the PSP and Deferred Bonus Plans.
His unvested awards under the PSP will be exercisable at the normal vesting date, subject to the vesting conditions being met and will be scaled back to reflect the part of the vesting period falling before his retirement date.
Outstanding awards will be exercisable for a period of twelve months commencing on his date of retirement or the vesting date, whichever is the later.
His unvested awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan will be exercisable at the normal vesting date.
Following his retirement Mr Keen was appointed as part-time Chairman of Idem Capital.
His remuneration for this new separate appointment is not required to be shown in the table above.

The company car allowance paid to executive directors 10,000 - 12,000 is also included in allowances and benefits.
Dividend is the accrued dividend paid on deferred bonuses which vested during the year.
Remuneration in respect of share awards is calculated by multiplying the number of shares vesting during the year by the mid-market closing price of the shares on the vesting date.
The link between pay and performance - Annual bonus for the year ended 30 September 2014 The annual bonus for the year under review was based on performance against financial and risk measures: performance against each of these measures is then subject to individual scale factors according to performance against personal strategic objectives.

Cash generation from both the originated and acquired portfolios was also strong.
Tight control was maintained over costs, with the cost:income ratio improving in the year.
The costs associated with the establishment and initial operations of Paragon Bank were favourable to those originally forecast.
Future value Buy-to-let volumes, at 656.6 million 656.1 million in Paragon Mortgages and 0.5 million in Paragon Bank, were in excess of the original target of 601.0 million, with margins broadly in line with target.
In addition to volumes completed during the year, the buy-to-let business ended the financial year with a pipeline of 414.8 million to support future growth in originations.
Acquisitions by Idem Capital, the Groups debt purchase division, were also above target at 175.7 million.
Cash flow from purchases continues to exceed the value at the point of underwriting, supporting the growth in the profit contribution by the division in 2014.
The establishment of Paragon Bank was achieved in line with expectation.
The scale of the initial savings flow exceeded the original target and the business accelerated its lending plans to offer car finance, personal loans and buy-to-let lending by the year end.
The diversification of the Groups funding sources provides the foundation for future sustainable growth.
risk The Group has operated within the risk tolerance levels approved by the Board in respect of capital ratios, liquidity positions, the risk appetite for new business, the management of operational and regulatory risk and the development of plans to mitigate longer-term strategic risk.
During the year, complaint levels have been minimal, arrears levels remain below industry averages, funding sources have been further diversified, liquidity has been strong and comfortably in excess of policy limits, and capital ratios remain highly prudent.
Target figures are not disclosed for the year ahead because the Committee believes that the disclosure of targeted margins, arrears levels, volumes, cash plans and financing assumptions is commercially sensitive.
The final level of each executive directors bonus is adjusted to reflect personal performance against strategic objectives related to each of the elements.
These individual performance scale factors are between 0.5 and 1.5 times, according to performance.
The objectives for the year ended 30 September 2014 were as follows: N S Terrington To deliver strategic leadership working within the parameters of the Groups risk appetite, to deliver the planned financial performance for the year, whilst ensuring fair outcomes for customers, developing future profit streams and positioning the Group to meet its longer term strategic goals.
Ensuring the business as a whole operates in such a manner to meet its developing risk, compliance and regulatory requirements.

indd 63 16 12 2014 10:43 B Corporate governance B3.2 Annual report on remuneration continued Details of share-based awards Awards granted in December 2010 under the Groups PSP which vested during the year were subject to performance conditions measured over three financial years, comparing the Groups relative TSR performance against a comparator group of companies comprising the constituents of the FTSE-250 on the date of grant over the three years commencing on the date of grant.
The vesting percentage was then reviewed by the Committee against a financial underpin.
The Company was ranked above the upper quartile position, giving a 100% vesting percentage and the Committee determined that such level of vesting was consistent with the Companys financial performance.
Paragon Performance Share Plan Awards under this plan comprise a right to acquire shares in the Company for nil or nominal payment and will vest on the third anniversary of their grant to the extent that the applicable performance criteria have been satisfied.
The awards granted during the year were calculated so as to have a face value of 200% of salary, using the average closing mid-market price of the Companys shares on each of the five dealing days up to and including the day before the grant date.
Therefore the face value of the awards granted during the year being the number of shares in each case multiplied by 3.4098, that being the average of the closing prices of the Companys shares at the end of each of the five dealing days ending on the day before the grant date were 889,000 for Mr Terrington, 474,000 for each of Mr Woodman and Mr Heron and 666,000 for Mr Keen.

25% of the awards will vest for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
50% of these awards are subject to the TSR test, as above, and 50% are subject to an EPS test.
The EPS test provides that 25% of EPS tested awards will vest where EPS growth is equal to the increase in the retail price index plus 3%, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for EPS growth equal to the increase in the retail price index plus 7% or more.
The share prices at the exercise dates were 3.595 on 4 February 2014, 4.0032 on 27 February 2014 and 4.0823 on 7 March 2014.
The awards maturing during the year, granted on 17 December 2010, achieved 100% vesting after the application of the performance criteria.
Awards are exercisable from the date on which the Remuneration Committee determines the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied to the day before the tenth anniversary of the grant date.
The Deferred Bonus Shares awarded during 2013 and thereafter can be exercised from the third anniversary of the award date until the day before the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
The face value of the awards granted during the year being the number of shares in each case multiplied by 3.115, that being the average of the closing prices of the Companys shares at the end of each of the final five dealing days in September 2013 were 172,000 for Mr Terrington, 115,000 for Mr Woodman, 76,000 for Mr Heron and 126,000 for Mr Keen.
The share prices at the exercise dates were 4.0032 on 27 February 2014, 4.0823 on 7 March 2014 and 4.1786 on 16 June 2014.
Rights to further shares under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan are due to be granted in respect of the compulsory deferral of performance bonuses for the year ended 30 September 2014, shown in the single total figure of remuneration table above.
The number of shares to be awarded will be determined based on the average market price of the Companys shares on the five dealing days before the awards are granted.
The shares, less any clawback, which can be applied by the Remuneration Committee in certain circumstances, will be exercisable by the recipients from the third anniversary of the grant date, subject, in normal circumstances, to the recipient being employed by the Company at that time.
