ADMIRAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 61 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Directors Remuneration Policy continued Notes to the remuneration policy table Payments from existing awards Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the Remuneration Policy.
This includes all outstanding awards under the DFSS, made prior to the approval of the 2015 DFSS, and awards of DFSS shares that vest 50% on performance and 50% on continued employment made to the new CFO prior to his appointment to the Board.
Selection of performance measures EPS vs. LIBOR has been selected as a performance measure for awards under both the existing and 2015 DFSS as the Committee feels it is a strong indicator of both long term shareholder return and the underlying financial performance of the business.
It is transparent and visible and provides good line-of-sight to executives.
For awards to be made in 2015, two further measures will be added.
The first additional measure is TSR vs. the FTSE 350 excluding investment companies, selected to reflect value creation for Admirals shareholders as compared with the general market.
The second additional measure is ROE, selected as the Committee believes that ROE reinforces the focus on capital efficiency and delivery of strong returns for our shareholders, thereby further strengthening the alignment of managements incentives with Admirals strategy.
The specific performance measures and their respective weightings in respect of each DFSS award may vary to reflect the strategic priorities at the time of the award.
Performance targets are set to be stretching and achievable, taking into account the Companys strategic priorities and the economic environment in which the Company operates.
The financial targets are set taking into account a range of reference points including the Groups strategic plan and broker forecasts for both Admiral and its insurance peers.
The Committee believes that the performance targets set are stretching, provide motivation, and that maximum outcomes are only available for outstanding performance.
Remuneration policy for other employees The Companys approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the role size, experience required, individual performance and pay levels in comparable companies.
In general, the Remuneration Policy which applies to other senior executives is consistent with that for Executive Directors.
Remuneration is typically linked to Company and individual performance in a way that reinforces shareholder value creation.
Approximately 2,300 employees from across the Group, as well as the CFO, participate in the DFSS.
The Committee recommends for approval by the Board awards to all participants under the DFSS.
For the CFO and around 20 senior managers, all share awards are subject to the performance conditions detailed in the policy table.
For employees at lower organisational levels, awards are split: 50% of the award is subject to the same performance conditions and the other 50% has no performance conditions attached other than the requirement that the recipient remains an employee of the Group at the date of vesting.
Award sizes vary by organisational level.
All holders of DFSS awards receive the DFSS bonus.
Overseas employees receive an equivalent award to the UK SIP awards under the DFSS.
These awards have no performance measures attached.
All employees are eligible to participate in the SIP on the same terms.
Remuneration arrangements for founding Directors Two of the three Executive Directors Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens are founding Directors.
They and the Committee continue to hold the view that the significant shareholdings held by them provide a sufficient alignment of their interest in the performance of the Group with the interests of other shareholders.
In light of this, their remuneration packages consist only of a below market rate salary and benefits such as private medical cover, permanent health insurance and death in service cover.
During the year David Stevens joined the Groups Personal Pension Plan and from October 2014 the Group matched his contributions under the Plan.
The Group does not contribute to any pension arrangements on behalf of Henry Engelhardt.
Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens have not participated, nor is it intended that they participate, in any Group share schemes.
Service contracts and leaver change of control provisions The Companys policy is to limit termination payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements.
In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
Under normal circumstances, Executive Directors are entitled to receive termination payments in lieu of notice based on base salary and compensation for loss of benefits.
The Company has the ability to pay such sums in instalments, requiring the Executive Director to mitigate loss over the relevant period.
The notice period for all Executive Directors is one year.
There is no provision in the Executive Directors contracts for compensation to be payable on early termination of their contract over and above the notice period element.
Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.

ADMIRAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 63 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Directors Remuneration Policy continued Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis The following charts provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the potential split between the different elements of pay under three different performance scenarios: Minimum, On-target and Maximum.
As described on page 61, Admirals DFSS bonus is directly aligned with dividends received by shareholders.
As such, there is no threshold or target performance defined for this element of pay.
The figures shown in the chart below for the CFOs DFSS bonus include the value of the actual DFSS bonus paid in 2014.
Under all scenarios, potential reward opportunities are based on expected awards for 2015 in accordance with Admirals Remuneration Policy, applied to salaries as at 31 December 2014.
The On-target column includes a 20% vesting for DFSS awards which would occur for achieving threshold performance targets.

Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the Board, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements.
Incentive opportunities for below Board employees are typically no higher than for Executive Directors, but measures may vary if necessary.
NED recruitment In recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on page 63.
A base fee would be payable for Board membership, with additional fees payable for acting as Senior Independent Director or as Chair or member of a Board Committee as appropriate.
Other directorships Executive Directors are permitted to, although none currently do, accept appointments as Non-Executive Directors of companies with prior approval of the Group Chairman.
Approval will only be given where the appointment does not present a conflict of interest with the Groups activities and the wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the development of the individual.
Considerations of conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when determining remuneration for Executive Directors.
Whilst the Committee does not currently consult specifically with employees on the Executive Remuneration Policy, it consults with and receives updates on employee pay arrangements from the Head of People Services and takes this into consideration when reviewing Executive remuneration.
Considerations of shareholder views When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into account best practice guidelines issued by institutional shareholder bodies.
The Committee is open to feedback from shareholders on Remuneration Policy and will continue to monitor trends and developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the structure of the Executive remuneration remains appropriate.
Further detail on the votes received on the Directors Remuneration Policy and Annual Report on Remuneration are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

The Committee will determine the levels of future increases taking into account both his individual and Company performance, and with reference to market pay levels.
Geraints current salary of 200,000 is significantly below the median level for companies of a similar size.
Geraint Jones will continue to participate in the Group Personal Pension Plan, where employee contributions are matched up to a maximum 6% of base salary with maximum employer contribution of 9,000.
David Stevens will also continue to participate in the plan, on the same basis as in 2014.

All Executive Directors will continue to receive benefits in line with the policy.
DFSS The Company held a comprehensive review of the DFSS in 2014, taking into account the changes to the business in both size and geography since the last review in 2004, and recent trends in FTSE incentive design and pay levels.
As a result of the review, a number of changes to the DFSS have been proposed in order to ensure that senior managers remain motivated: are appropriately rewarded: and that the Group continues to be an attractive employer that talented individuals want to join whilst at the same time providing appropriate incentives, and rewards, for the 2,300 employees that participate in the DFSS across the Group.
The key changes that have been made to the DFSS include: @ Increased maximum DFSS opportunity of 2 million.
Awards above 1 million are subject to a 600% of salary limit.
@ Inclusion of 100% performance related awards for approximately 20 of the Groups most senior managers.
