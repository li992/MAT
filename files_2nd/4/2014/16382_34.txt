ULTIMATE REMEDY MALUS Grants under the GSIP and MCIP are subject to ultimate remedy.
Upon vesting of an award, the Committee shall have the discretionary power to adjust the value of the award if the award, in the Committees opinion taking all circumstances into account, produces an unfair result.
In exercising this discretion, the Committee may take into account Unilevers performance against non-financial measures.
The Committee will only adjust the value of a vesting GSIP and MCIP award upwards after obtaining shareholder consent.
With effect from the 2015 GSIP and MCIP awards, the Committee may apply malus to reduce an award or determine that it will not vest or only vest in part in the event of a significant downward restatement of the financial results of Unilever, gross misconduct or gross negligence, material breach of Unilevers Code of Business Principles or any of the Unilever Code Policies or conduct by the individual that results in significant losses or serious reputational damage to Unilever.
With effect from the 2015 annual bonus based on 2014 performance, the annual bonus will also be subject to malus on the same grounds as apply for GSIP and MCIP awards.
CLAW-BACK The Committee has discretion to reclaim or claw-back some or all of the value of awards of performance-related payments to Executive Directors in the event of a significant downward restatement of the financial results of Unilever.
This includes the annual bonus together with any awards that have been made and or vested shares under the Share Matching Plan, the GSIP and the MCIP.
This claw-back may be effected up to two years from vesting by reducing outstanding awards or requiring the return of the net value of vested awards to Unilever.
In 2014, the Committee did not reclaim or claw-back any of the value of awards of performance-related payments to Executive Directors.
