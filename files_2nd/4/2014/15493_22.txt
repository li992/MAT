In addition, executive Directors may participate in save as you earn all-employee share schemes up to savings levels of 500 per month or any higher amount under applicable legislation.
Further details, including in relation to performance testing, and the Companys former long-term incentive arrangements, under which awards continue to subsist, are given on page 76.

1 The Companys Comparator Group is the 30 companies above and 30 companies below the Company in the FTSE in terms of market capitalisation as measured at a particular time determined by the Remuneration Committee.
2 The Group aims to maintain excellent commercial relationships with its key business partners, customers and key suppliers.
In this regard the Group regularly utilises corporate hospitality at sporting and other entertainment events to build contacts and relationships.
The Committee does not consider attendance at such events by either a Director or his or her immediate family to constitute a taxable benefit of their employment with the Group.
If such attendance were determined to be a taxable benefit, the Company would cover the cost of attendance and be responsible for any tax thereon.
3 Under the policy approved by shareholders in April 2014, a maximum grant level equivalent to 250% of salary applied, made up of a maximum of 100% of salary for basic awards and 150% of salary for enhanced awards.
Following a review, the Committee concluded that a grant level in the range 150% - 200% was appropriate.
Such awards will be subject to performance conditions set at the time of grant and considered by the Committee to be appropriate.
The Committee also concluded that it was no longer appropriate to have a separate category of enhanced awards.
Variable Fixed Overview Strategy and performance Governance review Financial statements Investor information Telecity Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 75 Policy of the components of the remuneration of executive Directors continued The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including through the exercise of any discretions available to it where such terms were agreed before the policy took effect or before such individual joined the Board.
Under the deferred bonus and LTIP arrangements, awards may be increased to reflect the value of dividends that would have been paid in respect of any dates of grant and vesting of the awards or delivery of the shares in the case of awards before 2015.
Such increases are in addition to the stated caps.
The Committee has received advice that the new legislation requires the inclusion of caps for each element of remuneration.
In some cases, the caps have been set significantly higher than the current levels.
This is simply to include adequate flexibility and does not represent an aspiration.
No new elements of remuneration have been introduced since the prior year.
Pay conditions elsewhere in the Company are commented on page 80.

Base salary Eric Hageman commenced with the Group as CFO on 1 September 2014 with the salary of 385,000.
The Committee considered this salary level appropriate to secure recruitment of an individual of the high calibre of Eric Hageman.
No increase is planned to this salary in 2015.
In addition to his fee as Chairman of 200,000, John Hughes is being paid remuneration in relation to the additional duties that effectively relate to the temporary performance of the Chief Executive role.
This additional remuneration is currently being paid at the rate of 379,125 per annum.
Pension Company contributions to executive pension schemes or salary supplements paid in lieu are being maintained at 20% of base salary for Eric Hageman.
Benefits Other benefits including a car allowance of 16,000 and medical cover for Eric Hageman will remain unchanged for 2014.
These are in line with practice in comparable companies.
Mr Hageman will also continue to be entitled to the travel, accommodation and other benefits included under his employment agreement as set out on page 77.
Annual bonus scheme The maximum annual bonus potential for Eric Hageman will remain at 150% of salary with the continuation of the new stretch revenue target included.
The payment for on-target performance remains, as in 2013, at 80% of salary.
The performance targets, and the proportions of the total potential payable for their achievement and overachievement are shown in the charts on page 75.
The proportion of the annual bonus to be satisfied in deferred shares is to remain at one-half of the total generally only vesting after two years.
Long-term incentives Subject to shareholder approval of the amended remuneration policy and LTIP rules, it is intended that Eric Hageman will be granted an LTIP award equivalent to 150% of salary, subject to the same TSR performance condition as in prior years.
Non-executive Directors Fee structure for non-executive Directors in both 2014 and 2015 The fees of the non-executive Directors were reviewed by the other members of the Board the Chairman and Chief Financial Officer as at 1 January 2015.
This was the first review since 1 January 2013.
After reviewing comparative data, and taking account of the particularly significant time commitments for the Company by the non-executive Directors, the updated structure and fees as set out below were decided upon.
This involves the introduction of fees for membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees to recognise the work involved in these outside of the usual calendar of Board meetings.
It is intended that arrangements will be made that each non-executive Director will purchase shares in the Company on a quarterly basis equivalent in value to 15,000 per annum and 20,000 per annum for the Chairman to take effect from the date of the increase in the fees for his non-executive role less the appropriate payroll deductions.

Mr Hughes remuneration in relation to his executive duties is included under Executive Directors above.
