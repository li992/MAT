Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 4 March 2015 The Remuneration Committee does not consider base salary benchmarks in isolation.
The proposed changes to Richard Howsons base salary have been considered in the context of Carillions Remuneration Policy, his experience and the contribution he has made to the business over the past three years, the performance of the business and prevailing market conditions.
The risks posed by uncompetitive executive remuneration packages were also considered, recognising the importance of ensuring that salaries reflect individual performance, skills, experience and the scope of the executives responsibilities in recruiting and retaining the talent necessary to deliver our business strategy.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 53 Remuneration report continued Annual Report on Remuneration Remuneration philosophy and linking executive remuneration with strategy Carillions Remuneration Policy is to provide the Executive Directors with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance in a manner consistent with the Groups strategy and to reward them in a fair and responsible manner for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
The remuneration package has been based on the following key principles.
Key focus Remuneration Policy and link to strategy To invest in our Our Remuneration Policy is designed to reward all employees fairly according to their role, experience and performance and with due people and capabilities regard to actual and expected market conditions and the financial performance of the Group.
Alignment with interests A substantial proportion of the package for the Executive Directors is paid in the Companys shares to ensure that the interests of of shareholders Executives are aligned with shareholders.
This is further supported by shareholding guidelines.
To create alignment with shareholders by ensuring that a meaningful portion of each Executive Directors personal wealth is linked to share price performance, each Executive Director is required to hold the net number of shares acquired through the LEAP and the deferred bonus plan until the value of their total shareholding is equal to their annual salary.
Pay for performance Our strategic focus is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth.
and delivery of our business vision A substantial proportion of Executive Director remuneration is variable and linked to the Groups performance, in particular, to the delivery of our business vision and our strategy see the Strategic report on pages 6 to 26 and to the performance of the individual.
To encourage behaviours which facilitate profitable growth and the future development of the business, our short-term performance is assessed against both earnings per share performance and the delivery of specific individual strategic, financial and non-financial objectives.
Our long-term performance is measured by assessing the growth in earnings per share, cash flow conversion and key strategic objectives.
Together, these metrics are a key measure of success in delivering shareholder value.
Be a recognised leader To ensure that remuneration arrangements support our sustainability agenda, the quality of the Groups performance in terms of business in Health & Safety results and leadership is considered, including achieving high standards in respect of Carillions Health & Safety, environmental and social and sustainability performance targets.
This is further supported by the inclusion of strategic objectives in the LEAP since 2014, which include specific and quantifiable sustainability metrics.

For the year ended 31 December 2014, LEAP awards in respect of the performance period commencing 1 January 2012 and ending 31 December 2014, lapsed in full.
LEAP awards granted to Executive Directors from 2012 were based on growth in earnings per share and average annual cash flow conversion targets as discussed on pages 57 to 59. e Pension The pension figure represents the cash value of pension contributions received by the Executive Directors.
This includes the Companys contributions to the defined contribution pension plan and any salary supplement in lieu of a Company pension contribution and the allowance paid for salary in excess of the internal cap on pensionable salary.
Individual elements of remuneration Base salary and fees Base salaries for individual Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are set with reference to individual performance, experience and responsibilities within the Group as well as with reference to similar roles in comparable companies.
As reported in the Companys previous Directors Remuneration report, there were no salary increases for Executive Directors in 2014.
In line with best practice, the Directors Remuneration Policy, approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, is that increases in salary for Executive Directors will not normally exceed the range of increases awarded to other employees in the Group with the exception of the specific circumstances listed in the binding policy.
The exceptions include situations where an Executive Director has been promoted and the increase takes account of the individuals development or performance in role e. g. the salary of a newly appointed Executive Director is increased to align it with the market competitive range over time.
In recognition of this policy and as explained in detail in the Chairmans letter, the Remuneration Committee has decided to increase Richard Howsons base salary by 9 per cent to 610,400 with effect from 1 January 2015 to reflect his contribution to the business and his experience in his current role.
Richard Adam will receive an increase of 2 per cent effective from 1 April 2015, which is in line with the range of increases awarded to other employees in the Group.
The base salaries for 2014 and 2015 are as set out below: 2014 2015 base salary base salary Increase 1 Richard Adam 450,000 460,000 2% Richard Howson 560,000 610,400 9% 1 The increase in Richard Adams base salary is payable from 1 April 2015.
Subject to the continued strong performance of the business and Richard Howsons personal performance over the period to December 2015, it is intended that a further increase of 8 per cent taking his salary to 660,000 will apply from 1 January 2016.
The decision to implement the second increase will be contingent on the continued improvement in corporate performance and of Richard Howson personally.
Richard Adam retained the fees of 12,249 and 30,885 paid in 2014 as a Non-Executive Director of Wincanton plc and Countrywide PLC respectively.
Mr Adam stood down as a Director of Wincanton plc in September 2014.

Performance against targets Financial performance Target EPS of 35.5 pence was not achieved and therefore no bonus was awarded for financial performance.

Annual bonus payments to Executive Directors also have the following additional restrictions applied.
50 per cent of any bonus earned is deferred into shares in the Company for a period of three years under the deferred bonus plan.
A malus provision is operated that gives the Remuneration Committee the right to reduce any deferred bonus awards which have not yet vested in relation to circumstances of corporate failure, which may have occurred at any time before malus is operated.
Each Executive Director is required to hold the net number of shares acquired through the deferred bonus plan and LEAP until the value of their total shareholding is equal to their annual salary.
For 2014, the values of each Executive Directors annual bonus paid in cash and deferred into shares were as follows: Total annual bonus shown in column c of total remuneration Cash payment Deferred into shares table on page 54 in respect of 2014 Richard Adam 101,250 101,250 202,500 Richard Howson 123,200 123,200 246,400 Summary of 2015 bonus operation The Remuneration Committee is not making any changes to the annual bonus policy and structure for 2015.
The bonus arrangements for 2015 will mirror those of the 2014 scheme and the maximum annual bonus opportunity remains at 100 per cent of base salary.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the actual annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive as they provide our competitors with insight into our business plans, expectations and our strategic actions and should therefore remain confidential to the Company.
However, the Remuneration Committee will continue to disclose how bonuses paid relate to performance against targets on a retrospective basis.
Value earned from longterm incentive awards The Leadership Equity Award Plan LEAP For the LEAP awards granted to Executive Directors in 2012 and 2013, 100 per cent of salary was based on growth in earnings per share and 50 per cent of salary was based on average annual cash flow conversion targets as shown below.
50% of salary based Vesting % of maximum 100% of salary based on annual average for Executive Directors on EPS growth cash flow conversion Threshold 17% 6% pa 95% Target 50% 9% pa 100% Maximum 100% 12% pa 110% Growth in EPS is measured based on underlying basic earnings per share as disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts.
This is calculated before intangible amortisation, non-recurring operating items, non-operating items, and fair value movements in derivative financial instruments and post any impairment of goodwill or intangibles.
The average annual cash flow conversion is calculated as the underlying cash flow from operations divided by the underlying profit from operations as reported in the Annual Report and Accounts.
Annual cash flow conversion over the three-year performance period is averaged to provide a focus on the sustainable delivery of cash-backed profits.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 57 Remuneration report continued Performance against targets Performance achieved in three-year performance % of 2012 award due period to 31 December 2014 to vest in April 2015 EPS growth 7% nil% of salary Annual average cash flow conversion 79% nil% of salary Total vesting nil% of salary Longterm incentives awarded during the financial year The design of the LEAP approved at the AGM in 2014 includes financial and quantifiable stretching strategic objectives.
The table below outlines awards made under the LEAP to Executive Directors in 2014.
Award Number Face value Vesting Performance basis of shares of the award at threshold period 25% of 1 January 2014 to 7 May 2014 Richard Adam 150% of base salary 185,644 675,001 base salary 31 December 2016 25% of 1 January 2014 to 7 May 2014 Richard Howson 150% of base salary 231,023 840,001 base salary 31 December 2016 The face value is based on the issue price at the date of grant of 3.636 The performance conditions for these LEAP awards are as follows: Two-thirds of the 2014 LEAP award is subject to EPS and cash flow conversion targets, as set out in the table below: 50% of salary based Vesting % of maximum 50% of salary based on on annual average for Executive Directors EPS growth cash flow conversion Threshold 17% 6% pa 95% Target 50% 9% pa 100% Maximum 100% 12% pa 110% One-third of the 2014 LEAP award is subject to strategic performance metrics that are aligned to the Companys sustainability agenda and drive shareholder value.
For 2014, this is based on three quantifiable and stretching strategic measures that apply equally: delivery of sustainability through measurable cost-saving and efficiencies that will provide contributions to the Companys profit of 25 million, 30 million and 32 million in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively: delivery of employee engagement in sustainability measured through a target of 25 per cent of Carillions employees undertaking community work in Company time by the end of 2016: and strategic growth measured through the achievement of secured and probable, profitable new orders over the performance period with a bookto-bill ratio of more than one.
Vesting under each strategic element will be based on an audited assessment of performance that will be provided to the Remuneration Committee.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the vesting reflects the underlying performance of Carillion and retains the flexibility to adjust the vesting amount to ensure it remains appropriate.
It is often not possible to assess this formulaically and any adjustment will depend on the nature, timing and materiality of any contributory factors.
In order to maintain transparency, the Remuneration Committee will disclose how the Company has performed against each of the strategic metrics at the end of the performance period and will disclose any adjustments made to ensure that vesting appropriately reflects the underlying performance of the business.
A malus provision is operated that gives the Remuneration Committee the right to reduce any LEAP awards that have not yet vested in relation to circumstances of corporate failure, which may have occurred at any time before malus is operated.
Longterm incentive awards for 2015 The LEAP design for 2015 is unchanged, other than the introduction of an additional holding period for our Executive Directors which will require them to hold onto their shares for a further period of two years after the end of the three year performance period.
No changes are proposed to the maximum LEAP opportunity for 2015 and this will therefore remain at 150 per cent of salary annually and the proportion of the award vesting for threshold performance remains at 25 per cent of salary.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 58 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Two-thirds of the LEAP award up to 100 per cent of salary for Executive Directors will continue to be subject to EPS and cash flow conversion performance targets, as set out above, and one-third up to 50 per cent of salary for Executive Directors will be based on two quantifiable and stretching strategic measures that will apply equally: delivery of sustainability through measurable cost-saving and efficiencies that will provide contributions to the Companys profit of 96 million over the performance period: and strategic growth measured through the achievement of secured and probable, profitable new orders over the performance period with a book-tobill ratio of more than one.
Total pension entitlements including defined benefit schemes Pensionable salary is limited by an internal cap.
The Carillion cap commenced at the level of 110,000 for the tax year 2006-07 and rose in line with the published increases in HMRCs Life Time Allowance to the current level of 132,700 which has applied since 2010-11.
Future increases are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Salary supplements are paid in respect of salary over the internal cap.
Executive Directors receive pension contributions and supplements up to 40 per cent of salary.
Executive Directors who participate in the Companys defined contribution plan are required to pay 10 per cent of the earnings cap.
Richard Howson is also a deferred member of a defined benefit scheme.
The defined benefit scheme was closed to future accrual in April 2009 and Executive Directors who were members of this scheme became deferred pensioners.
Their deferred benefits are based on pensionable salary and service at the date of closure.
Richard Howson is a deferred member of this scheme and details of the pension accrued to him are included below.

T he pension data set out above is based on CPI rather than RPI to revalue deferred benefits from 1 January 2011 in line with advice received from the legal advisers to the trustee of the scheme.
T he accrued pension allows for inflation from the members date of cessation to future accrual to the current date, consistent with the approach taken in prior years.
The benefit the member will receive on retirement will be based on statutory revaluations which may differ.
Figures are calculated in line with the requirements effective from 1 October 2013.
Prior year figures are shown in brackets.
As the defined benefit scheme is closed, early retirement benefits not on the grounds of ill health are available from age 55 reduced for early payment.
In the event of ill health early retirement the accrued benefits may be paid at any age with or without a reduction for early payment at the discretion of the pension scheme trustees.
Death-in-service benefits are provided as part of membership of these plans.
Payments to past Directors There were no payments made to past Directors during the period in respect to services provided to the Company as a Director.
Payments for loss of office There were no payments for loss of office during the period.
Shareholding guidelines and total shareholdings of Directors To provide alignment with shareholders interests and to promote share ownership, each Executive Director is required to hold the net number of shares acquired through the LEAP and, with effect from 1 January 2014, the deferred bonus plan until the value of their total shareholding is equal to their annual salary.
The extent to which each Executive Director has met the shareholding guideline is shown in the table below.
