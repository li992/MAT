ANNUAL REPORT 2014 COUNTRYWIDE PLC 61 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Directors remuneration report continued Annual report on remuneration continued 2014 annual bonus award audited Executive directors had the potential to receive an annual bonus of up to 120% of base salary.
The primary driver of any award is based on Group EBITDA performance relative to targets set at the start of the financial year.
In assessing the final award, the required Group EBITDA isadjusted up or down dependent upon the actual market size relative to the plan.
The market size is measured based on the independent Land Registry data as at the end of October 2014 plus full year indicative estimates after considering all relevant information on the size of the market, including Bank of England mortgage approval levels, in the final two months of the year.
Group EBITDA is also adjusted for any significant benefit and costs associated with major unplanned initiatives such as acquisitions.
To receive an award, an executive director must also have performed at an individual level.
In determining the 2014 annual bonus award, the Committee considered: Group EBITDA of 121.1 million, which represents outperformance of the target Group EBITDA of 118.9 million in the plan: an estimated market size considerably larger, 11%, than anticipated: and the strong personal performance of each executive director.
Whilst performance against the original plan would have triggered a bonus of 105% of base salary, the larger than expected market size resulted in a flexing downwards of the annual bonus award to 80% of base salary i. e. 67% of the maximum.
The following table illustrates the performance measures and Group targets, their significance in terms of value and the respective outcomes: Performance required Measure Weighting Threshold On-target Maximum Actual Payout Flexed Group EBITDA 100% 103.2m 129.1m 138.1m 121.1m 67% of maximum In line with deferral policy, one-third of any bonus payable will be deferred into Company shares for a period of three years.
Vesting of scheme interests in respect of the year ended 31 December 2014 audited Awards made under the IPO option plan in March 2013, which was designed to roll over the management incentive plan awards granted pre-IPO and which would have ordinarily crystallised at IPO, are due to vest in 50% March 2015 and 50% March 2016 based upon the EBITDA performance for the year ended 31 December 2014 as follows: 1 1 Threshold target Maximum target 0% vesting at or 100% vesting at 2 below or above Actual EBITDA Vesting % EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2014 83.1m 129.1m 121.1m 83% 1 T he EBITDA threshold and maximum targets were originally set at 74 million and 120 million respectively although as disclosed in the Prospectus, the Remuneration Committee retained the discretion to toughen the targets in light of material acquisitions during the performance period i. e. to ensure that management could not simply acquire businesses to achieve the targets.
As such, following a review of material acquisitions made during the performance period, the Committee considered it appropriate and in the interests of shareholders to increase the threshold and maximum EBITDA targets by 9.1 million based on the aggregate planned 2014 EBITDA for the following acquisitions: LSH, Tucker Gardner, Preston Bennett and APW.
2 Percentage based on pro-rata vesting between the threshold and maximum targets.
Based on the above, the outstanding IPO options held by Directors are expected to vest as follows: Estimated Estimated Number of shares Number of shares value of shares at Value of dividend total value of 1 2 3 2 vesting lapsing vesting equivalents awards at vesting Executive Award granted 83% 17% 000 000 000 Grenville Turner 1,828,045 1,517,277 310,768 6,782 334 7,116 Jim Clarke 1,096,827 910,366 186,461 4,069 200 4,269 1 50% of the above awards will vest on 18 March 2015, with a further 50% held to vest on 18 March 2016.
2 The estimated values above are based on the average share price in the three months ended 31 December 2014 being 447 pence.
3 Dividend equivalents will be cash settled in line with the default treatment in the IPO option plan rules.
