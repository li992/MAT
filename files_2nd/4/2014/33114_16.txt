62 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED EXIT PAYMENT POLICY Payments in lieu of notice are limited to the Directors basic salary for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
The Committee will aim to minimise the level of payments to that Director, having regard to all circumstances, including the Companys contractual obligations to the Director, the reason for departure, and the Companys policy on mitigation.
In the event of termination of any Director, the Company reserves the right to make phased payments which are paid in monthly instalments and subject to mitigation.
Where a Director may be entitled to pursue a claim against the Company in respect of his her statutory employment rights or any other claim arising from the employment or its termination, the Committee will be entitled to negotiate settlement terms with the Director that the Committee considers to be reasonable in the circumstances and is in the best interests of the Company, and to enter into a settlement agreement with the Director.
The Committee has discretion to pay a Directors legal fees in relation to any settlement agreement.

Incentive Plan Treatment of awards LTIP Under the LTIP, unvested LTIP shares Performance and Matching normally lapse unless the individual is 1 considered a good leaver, in which case awards are normally tested for performance over the full performance period and pro-rated for time based on the proportion of the vesting period served, with Committee discretion to treat otherwise.
Vested LTIP awards which are subject to an additional holding period will typically be retained and released at the end of the holding period, although the Committee has the discretion to allow earlier release.
In the event of a change of control, LTIP awards would normally be pro-rated for time and performance to the effective date of change of control, in line with best practice.
Deferred Bonus Plan Under the deferred bonus plan, unvested deferred bonus shares will normally lapse on leaving unless the 1 individual is considered a good leaver, in which case awards normally continue and are released at the usual time, although the Committee has the discretion to allow earlier release.
Annual Bonus Plan Under the annual bonus plan, leavers during the plan year normally lose any entitlement to bonus unless the 1 individual is considered a good leaver.
Good leavers are eligible for an award to the extent that performance conditions have been satisfied and pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year served, with Committee discretion to treat otherwise.
A good leaver is defined as an employee who ceases to hold Employment during the plan year by reason of: injury, ill-health or disability proved to the satisfaction of the Committee: redundancy: retirement with the agreement of the Group Company by which he is employed: the Participants Employing Company ceasing to be a Group Company: the business or part of the business to which the Participants Employment relates being transferred to a person who is not a Group Company: or any other reason which the Committee in its absolute discretion so permits.

LTIP AWARDS AUDITED LTIP awards are granted as performance shares of 100% of salary and matching share awards of up to 2 for 1 on investments in Workspace of up to 50% of net salary.
The maximum matching share award that may be granted to the Executive Directors was 100% of their annual basic salary.
The Company awards matching shares in respect of an amount equivalent to two times the grossed up for income tax and National Insurance amount invested by the participant in Invested Shares.
Vesting of performance shares and matching shares is based 1 3, 1 3, 1 3 on three-year relative NAV growth, relative TSR and absolute TSR.
Relative performance is measured against the constituents of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index.
In addition, for any shares to vest on TSR, the Committee must satisfy itself that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying business performance of Workspace.
Net vested LTIP shares are required to be held for a one-year holding period before the shares can be sold.
Clawback provisions apply during the holding period in the event of a material misstatement of the Companys financial statements for any financial year during the Performance Period or a participants gross misconduct.
A summary of performance measures, weightings and targets for awards granted during the year is provided below: One-third One-third One-third 1 Performance Growth in Net Asset Value TSR share price growth plus Absolute TSR condition relative to companies in the reinvested dividends relative FTSE 350 Real Estate Index to companies in the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index Level of Companys % of award Companys % of award Companys % of award 2 2 2 performance percentile rank vesting percentile rank vesting performance vesting Threshold 51st percentile 20% 51st percentile 20% 8% p. a.

There is straight-line vesting between the Threshold and Maximum performance levels.
The following awards were granted during the year under the LTIP.
Matching share awards of up to 100% of salary.
Actual awards to the Executive Directors reflected their investments.
The share price for calculating the levels of awards was 4.0497, the average mid-market closing price over the three dealing days to 14 June 2013.

Over the three years from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2014, Workspaces three-year NAV growth of 21.7% p. a. was 100th percentile against the FTSE 350 Real Estate which warranted 100% of this element vesting equivalent to 33.3% of LTIP shares awarded.
Workspaces three-year TSR outperformed the median TSR of the FTSE 350 Real Estate by 17.2% p. a. which warranted 100% of this element vesting equivalent to 33.3% of LTIP shares awarded.
Workspaces three-year absolute TSR of 36.7% p. a. warranted 100% of the absolute TSR element vesting equivalent to 33.3% of LTIP shares awarded.
The Committee considered this together with the underlying business performance of Workspace, and concluded that 100% of the 2011 LTIP shares awarded to Executives would vest.
These awards are due to vest on 3 August 2014.

These awards will be reported in the 2015 Remuneration Report based on the share price on date of vesting.
SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN SIP The Company implemented a SIP in 2013 and, in March 2013, the Company granted one-off share awards under the SIP although the SIP rules are flexible enough to accommodate subsequent offers of up to 1,000 of free shares per employee.
51,800 ordinary shares were purchased by the Company on the market to grant the free shares and these are held in a UK resident trust.
The free shares are to be held in the Trust for a minimum period of three years before they can be withdrawn by the employees.
JOINTLY HELD LTIP AWARDS In 2009 the Company offered participants the opportunity to restructure their 2009 LTIP awards and future awards so that they acquired shares jointly with the Companys Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT, with the effect that the growth in value of the shares creates a capital gain.
Individuals were required to pay appropriate income tax and National Insurance as part of their upfront acquisition.
This restructuring has generated ongoing savings for the Company and participants.
For the 2009 and 2010 awards Graham Clemett accepted the joint ownership awards as part of his total awards, taking half of his awards as joint ownership awards, with the remainder in the original conditional shares structure.
For the 2011, 2012 and 2013 awards the Executive Directors did not participate in joint ownership awards.
It is also intended that the Executive Directors will not participate in joint ownership awards for the 2014 LTIP awards.
