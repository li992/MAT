Directors remuneration report Remuneration policy Introduction The description that follows sets out the policy that is subject to the statutory binding vote at the 2015 AGM.
It is intended that, if approved, it will take effect from that date.
The main changes from the previously approved policy relating to the operation of annual bonus and LTIP are described in the chairmans introductory letter on page 59.
Some additional minor changes have been made to provide greater clarity on aspects of policy.
Remuneration policy table This table sets out the components of the directors remuneration package except on recruitments or promotions which are described on page 64.
It is also part of this policy that we will honour payments or awards crystallising after the effective date of this policy but arising from commitments entered into prior to the effective date of the new policy, or at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company.

Amec Foster Wheeler Annual report and accounts 2014 61 Additional information Financials Governance Strategic report Directors remuneration report continued Remuneration policy continued Component and how this supports strategy How this operates Maximum Annual bonus Calculated by reference to a mix of financial and other strategic objectives set by the remuneration The maximum opportunity Rewards the committee that vary from year to year and may vary between individuals to reflect the business is 150 per cent of annual achievement of annual priorities associated with each role.
Profit-based measures will have a weighting of not less salary for the Chief Executive financial and delivery than 50%.
The committee will determine for each year threshold and target levels of bonus that and 125 per cent for other of other strategic will be payable for meeting predefined performance levels against the objectives set for the year.
Target bonus will not exceed two-thirds of maximum.
Details of the actual measures and the levels of threshold and target bonus for the periods under review are included in the annual report on remuneration on page 69.
25% of any bonus earned is paid in the form of Amec Foster Wheeler shares deferred for three years during which it is subject to claw-back in the event that the accounts for the year for which the shares were earned are required to be restated for a correction of a prior period error or, at the committees discretion, for personal misconduct.
The balance of the bonus is normally paid as a cash allowance following the end of the year to which the payment relates.
However, to facilitate higher levels of executive share ownership, the bonus may, at the directors option and subject to the committees agreement, be in the form of nil-cost options over company shares of equivalent value instead of cash payment.
The vesting is deferred for three months during which it is forfeit if the individual is a bad leaver.
Such options have a six-month exercise window.
The committee has discretion to amend performance measures and targets or adjust bonus pay-outs to take account of exceptional items, unbudgeted acquisitions or disposals, and other aspects of performance which have not been specifically identified in the targets.

with long-term returns further provision to reduce leaver awards retrospectively on an individual basis as set out on page 65. to shareholders.
Awards are subject to EPS growth and relative TSR measured over a three-year period with equal weighting on each measure and any additional strategic measures that the committee may consider appropriate for any particular set of awards.
Additionally, awards are subject to a provision that allows the committee to reduce vesting in the event of a materially adverse misstatement of results for any year of the performance period, to correct errors or for personal misconduct.
The number of shares vesting from these awards is increased to take account of reinvested dividends.
The committee will determine the applicable EPS range for each set of awards, with 25% of the relevant portion of the awards vesting if the bottom of the range is achieved and 100% if the top is achieved, with straight line vesting between.
EPS is adjusted for certain defined items and calculated on a consistent basis between base and final years.
The committee will determine the TSR comparator group for each set of awards with 25% of the relevant portion of the awards vesting if Amec Foster Wheelers ranking is at median and 100% if it is at upper quartile, with straight line vesting between.
The committee, at its discretion, may reduce or eliminate the portion of the LTIP determined by reference to relative TSR if it is not satisfied with the underlying financial performance of the business during the performance period.
The committee may amend the performance conditions if an event happens which the committee considers to be of a genuine, exceptional nature so that amended performance condition s would be a fairer measure of performance and would be materially neither easier nor more difficult to satisfy.
In the event of a change of control and in the absence of an exchange of awards being agreed, awards will normally vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been met at that time.
The committee has discretion to measure performance based solely against one of the performance conditions.

Selection of performance targets Financial performance targets under the annual bonus plan are set so that the target level of bonus is paid normally for achieving the Companys short-range plan.
To achieve maximum bonus, higher targets have to be met.
In determining targets, the committee takes account of the general business circumstances including the perceived difficulty inherent in the short-range plan and the need to balance stretch against risk.
Profit is chosen as the most appropriate measure of the Companys short-term performance and the cash measures are chosen to reflect the conversion of profit to cash across the year.
Strategic targets are set to reflect other key business objectives during the year.
EPS targets under the Long-term Incentive Plan are set to reflect the Companys longer-term growth objectives at a level where the maximum represents genuine outperformance against expectations.
EPS is chosen as the most appropriate measure of absolute growth in line with the Companys strategy.
TSR is chosen to measure relative long-term performance against a peer group comprising UK and international companies against which Amec Foster Wheeler competes directly.
Other strategic targets may be set to reflect other key business objectives during the particular three year cycle.

Amec Foster Wheeler 64 Annual report and accounts 2014 Policy on notice and payment for loss of office Newly appointed executive directors will be employed on contracts that include the following provisions: X the individual will be required to give six months notice if they wish to leave and the Company will give up to 12 months notice of termination other than for gross misconduct or other circumstances where employment may be terminated without notice: X at the Companys discretion, the individual may be placed on garden leave for some or all of the period between the giving of notice and termination in which case the Company will continue to pay salary and benefits for the garden leave period but will not make new share or other incentive awards: and X at any time, at the Companys discretion, employment may be terminated before the end of the required notice period by making a payment in lieu of the balance and subject to mitigation as described more fully in the table below.
In the event of long-term incapacity, employment would not normally be terminated so long as the executive was entitled to payments under the Companys group income protection insurance arrangements but the executive would be required to stand down from their role and as a director.
Payment for loss of office will be determined according to the following principles set out below and, for the current executive directors, having regard to their existing contractual terms as described following the table.
Notice The executive will receive base salary, pension and other benefits for any part of the notice period worked and any period of garden leave.
On termination, the executive will be entitled to payment for any accrued but untaken holiday pay.
The Company may elect to pay a sum in lieu of notice for all or any part of the notice period, calculated by reference to the value of salary, pension and other contractual benefits excluding bonus.
In determining the payments to be made and the structure of such payments, the Company will have regard to the executives ability to mitigate their loss.
In respect of any defined benefit pension rights, an augmentation of benefits for the relevant part of the notice period may be made.
The committee has discretion to continue to provide certain benefits to the end of the notice period rather than including them in the payment in lieu.
Where the employment is being terminated by the Company for gross misconduct or other circumstances entitling the Company to treat the contract as at an immediate end termination will be immediate and no payment in lieu of notice will be made.
Annual No bonus will be paid in the event of termination for gross misconduct.
bonus In all other circumstances, the committee will consider whether it is appropriate to make a bonus payment for the year in question taking into account all relevant circumstances, including performance and conduct.
Payment will usually be determined and paid in cash at the normal time.
Deferred bonus In the event of termination due to misconduct by the individual, the Remuneration Committee may determine that some or all, from prior years at its discretion, of the deferred shares will be forfeit.
In the case of death the shares will be released in full to the estate as soon as practicable thereafter.
In other circumstances, they will continue to be subject to the deferral period and only released at the end of it providing no further claw-back applies.
Long-term All unvested awards will lapse on leaving in the event of termination for gross misconduct or other bad leaver circumstances.
incentive plan An example of a bad leaver would be an individual resigning in order to take up a position with a competitor.
Awards will immediately vest in full in the event of death.
In other cases, unvested awards will be pro-rated for service, which may include any period for which payment was made in lieu.
For pre-2015 awards, provided the associated investment shares remain lodged, matched awards will normally be retained in full unless the committee decide to pro-rate for service.
A further reduction may be made at the committees discretion to take account of relevant circumstances at the time of leaving.
The retained awards will vest in the normal way, taking account of the relevant performance conditions, and at the normal time subject to the committee being satisfied at that time that the individual remains a good leaver.
Other Redundancy pay in line with statutory provisions or those applying to employees generally in the country in which the director is based will be provided in the event of termination due to redundancy.
The cost of legal, tax or other advice incurred by the individual in connection with the termination and or support with seeking alternative employment may be met up to a maximum of 100,000.
Additional payments may be made where required to settle legal disputes or as consideration for new or amended post-employment restrictions.
Where an individual is in receipt of relocation or expatriation benefits, the costs of actual expenses incurred in relation to any arrangements that are subject to term contracts may continue to be reimbursed for up to six months or, at the Companys discretion, a one-off payment made to cover the costs of premature cancellation.
The cost of repatriation will also be covered where this was part of the original expatriation terms.
Sharesave options lapse unless the director leaves because of specified good leaver reasons in which case they can be exercised for a limited period, to the extent of savings made to the date of exercise.
Amec Foster Wheeler Annual report and accounts 2014 65 Additional information Financials Governance Strategic report Directors remuneration report continued Remuneration policy continued Samir Brikho and Ian McHoul are both employed under contracts dated April 2007 and September 2008 respectively with notice periods of twelve months from the Company and which require them to give six months notice of resignation.
The contracts permit for payment to be made in lieu of all or part of the required notice period at the Companys discretion but there is no prescribed methodology for calculating such payment in lieu or applying mitigation.
Should circumstances arise where notice is given and the executive is not required to work all or part of the notice period, the terms of the existing contracts would be honoured.
The individuals may be placed on garden leave for part of the notice period in which case the committee may determine that it is appropriate to pay an element of bonus for that garden leave period.
Existing directors service contracts The notice provisions for Samir Brikho and Ian McHoul are described above.
There are no specified change-of-control provisions.
The Chairmans engagement may be terminated on six months notice on either side.
The contracts of non-executive directors may be terminated by the individual at any time.
There are no specific provisions for compensation in the event of early termination by the Company.
Our practice is that all directors submit themselves for re-election on an annual basis, in line with the recommendations in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in company and shareholder views Our approach to the annual review of base salaries is to take account of personal performance, company performance, and pay levels more broadly within the Company.
External benchmarking is also taken into account, particularly for new appointments.
Any proposals to change remuneration policy are considered against the best practice guidelines produced by shareholder bodies and major shareholders are consulted directly when formulating any proposals for significant changes.
The committee did consider these guidelines as well as representations made by certain individual shareholders in formulating its policy as noted in the chairmans introductory letter on page 59.
There was no direct consultation with employees.
The Chairman of the Company and the chairman of the remuneration committee make themselves available at any time and also at each annual general meeting to discuss any issues raised.
Differences in policy for directors compared to other employees The structure of remuneration for executive directors is in line with other senior management.
The primary differences compared to other employees are the structure of variable pay, which for senior management is in the form of performance-related incentives and for other employees is largely in the form of overtime and allowances reflecting the different emphases of the roles, and in the level of accrual under defined benefit arrangements.
Illustrations of application of policy The total remuneration for each of the executive directors that could result from the proposed remuneration policy in 2015 under three different performance levels is shown below.

Long-term incentive awards to be made in 2015 Subject to shareholder approval at the AGM for the new long-term incentive plan, awards equivalent to 250% of base salary will be made.
Half of the award will be subject to a comparative TSR measure and the other half will be subject to an EPS performance measure.
TSR will be measured against a peer group comprising Amec Foster Wheeler and 20 UK and international companies against which Amec Foster Wheeler competes directly.
The EPS target range will be 5 percent compound annual growth for threshold vesting and 10 percent for maximum vesting measured from a pro forma 2014 base that includes a full-year contribution from the Foster Wheeler acquisition.
The measures will operate in the manner described in the policy set out in page 62 above.
Changes to Chairmans and non-executive directors fees The fee for the Chairman and non-executive directors are not being increased for 2015 other than that for the Audit committee chairman to reflect the increased time commitment arising from the ongoing US listing obligations.

Single total figure of remuneration for 2014 The following table shows a single total figure of remuneration in respect of qualifying services for the 2014 financial year for each director, together with comparative figures for 2013.
Stephanie Newbys fees include an amount paid in relation to her ongoing post-acquisition service as a director of Foster Wheeler AG from 13 November 2014 to 31 December 2014: this ceased from 19 January 2015.
The 2013 values have been updated from the estimates included in last years report as detailed on page 70.
Taxable benefits for the executive directors comprise disability and healthcare insurance, car travel allowance, working lunches and tax return preparation assistance.
The 2013 Sharesave figure for Ian McHoul is the gain made on exercising an option over 1,512 shares made under the Savingsrelated Share Option Scheme Sharesave at an option price of 6.00.
The closing share price on the date of exercise, 3 May 2013, was 10.25, resulting in a gain on exercise of 6,426.
Samir Brikho is a member of the advisory board of Stena AB and a non-executive director of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB: he received fees of CHF 60,000 during the year in relation to the first appointment and SEK 599,435 in relation to the second.
Ian McHoul is a director of Britvic plc and received fees of 45,385 during the year in relation to this appointment.
Such appointments are subject to prior approval of the board.
Directors are permitted to retain fees.
These amounts are not subject to audit and are not included in the single total figure table above.
Total pension entitlements The pension amount shown in the 2014 single total figure of remuneration above comprises the following: Accrued DB pension Value of Cash Total at 31 12 14 DB benefit allowance pension benefit 000 000 000 000 Samir Brikho 42 87 159 246 Ian McHoul 106 106 Samir Brikho has a normal retirement age of 60 in relation to the stated defined benefit DB pension.
There are no additional pension benefits that become payable for either director in the event of early retirement.
The cash allowance in the case of Mr Brikho represented 20% of salary above the pension scheme cap and in the case of Ian McHoul represented 20% of full salary.
Amec Foster Wheeler 68 Annual report and accounts 2014 Annual bonus The bonus payments in respect of 2014 that will be paid in 2015 to the executive directors expressed as a percentage of base salary earned during the year are shown below reflecting the indicated outcomes against the various performance elements: Samir Brikho Ian McHoul Percentage of Measure Target range Actual max achieved Max Actual Max Actual EBITA 335-370m 338 30% 70% 21.1% 55% 16.6% EBITA additional stretch 0% 25% 0% 25% 0% Cash conversion full year 80-90% 88% 59% 18.75% 11.1% 15% 8.9% Cash conversion half year 45-50% 45% 0% 6.25% 0% 5% 0% Other strategic objectives See note 30% 30% 25% 25% Totals 150% 62.2% 125% 50.5% For bonus purposes EBITA after exceptional items which may be disallowed for bonus purposes at the committees discretion is normalised for exchange rate movements and cost of share based payments: the target and actual figures shown above are before any such adjustments.
Other strategic objectives measures for the Chief Executive included actions to establish the acquisition implementation plan and strategy for the new combined business, develop the executive management team, deliver higher revenue in Growth Regions and safety leadership.
For the CFO they included establishing finance integration and cost synergy plans, implementation of shared services and IT systems, and delivering performance from the Investment Services activities.
The committee has discretion to take other factors into account and uses its judgement in determining the amount to be paid under this item.
For 2014, the committee considered performance against these objectives and resolved that it was appropriate to award maximum bonus for this element.
None of the bonus earned for 2014 is subject to compulsory deferral, as the EBITA additional stretch minimum target was not met.
The original EBITA targets were adjusted to remove a provision for contribution from small acquisitions, given the focus on completing the Foster Wheeler acquisition, and the actual results were adjusted to exclude the contribution in 2014 from the Foster Wheeler acquisition.
Performance Share Plan The LTIP amount shown in the 2014 single total figure of remuneration on page 68 is the award made under the Performance Share Plan in 2012.
Vesting is due to take place on 3 April 2015 and is subject to two performance conditions each measured over three-year periods: i earnings per share EPS growth between 2011 and 2014 and ii total shareholder return relative to a comparator group based on average share prices in the first 11 weeks of 2015 compared to those in the corresponding period in 2012 also subject to the committee being satisfied that there has been sustained financial growth of the Company.
The two performance conditions operate independently on different parts of the award: half of the basic award is dependent on EPS and the other half on TSR: the matched award depends solely on EPS.
EPS for this measure means the diluted earnings per share expressed to one decimal place of Amec Foster Wheeler plc before goodwill and intangible amortisation, the charge or credits associated with executive share awards and exceptional items.
Real growth means in excess of the change in the UK Retail Prices Index for December 2014 compared to December 2011.
The committee took account of the share buyback that took place during 2012 and 2013 in determining the outcome for the EPS element and also excluded the contribution in 2014 from the Foster Wheeler acquisition.
The performance achieved against the EPS target and the TSR outcome are as follows: 2011 awards performance measure Threshold 25% vesting Maximum 100% vesting Outcome Percentage of max achieved Real annual compound growth in EPS 5% 12% 5% 0% Total shareholder return ranking Median Upper quartile 17th out of 24 0% Accordingly no shares will vest from these awards.
