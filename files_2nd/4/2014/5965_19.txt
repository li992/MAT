Fidessa group plc 26 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Directors and corporate governance report continued Annual report on remuneration Membership, meetings and evaluation During the year the Committee comprised Ron Mackintosh Committee Chairman, Elizabeth Lake, Philip Hardaker until 31st July 2014, John Worby from 1st May 2014, Mark Foster until 18th June 2014 and Ken Archer from 25th November 2014.
All members of the Committee are independent non-executive directors.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder, to the extent disclosed in this report, conflict of interest arising from cross-directorships, or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Chairman and executive directors may attend Committee meetings by invitation.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The performance of the Committee was evaluated as part of the Board evaluation process during the year and the conclusion was that the Committee was functioning effectively.
Responsibilities The Committee operates within its terms of reference, which are reviewed and, if necessary, updated annually and are available at www.
The Committee is responsible for determining the policy and application for remuneration, other benefits and terms of employment, including performance-related bonus schemes and oversight of share plans, for executive directors, senior management and the Chairman.
Remuneration consultants During the year, the Committee took independent advice from New Bridge Street NBS, an Aon plc company.
NBS is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and has signed up to its Code of Conduct.
NBS provided advice on general remuneration matters.
NBS does not provide other services to Fidessa.
The Aon group provides other services to Fidessa, namely insurance broking and pensions provision, but the Committee continues to believe that this does not create a conflict of interest.
For the year under review, NBS received fees of 11,000 in connection with its work for the Committee.
Remuneration details In accordance with the Regulations, the tables below set out the remuneration for each director.
Executive directors Long-term Annual incentives 000 Salary Benefits bonus vested Other Total Chris Aspinwall 2014 480 1 441 0 1 923 2013 480 2 365 576 1 1,424 Andy Malpass 2014 302 1 160 0 1 464 2013 302 2 133 576 1 1,014 Fidessa group plc 27 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Fidessas approach to annual bonuses for 2014 was consistent with the remuneration policy approved by shareholders and the approach used in 2013.
The benefits received by the executive directors are life insurance, ill health income protection and private medical insurance.
The item in the column headed other comprises the matching shares awarded under the SIP.
The table below sets out the bonus thresholds and percentages for both directors.
Percentage Operating profit payable above Annual bonus 000 Operating profit threshold the threshold amount Chris Aspinwall 2014 38,147 18,100 2.2% 441 2013 36,598 20,000 2.2% 365 Andy Malpass 2014 38,147 18,100 0.8% 160 2013 36,598 20,000 0.8% 133 The executive directors annual bonus was a flat percentage above a threshold of the operating profit as presented to the Operating Board as disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, excluding items that the Committee considers to be exceptional or inappropriate.
When setting both the threshold and the flat line percentage the Committee took into account the directors on target earnings i. e. salary and bonus for the year, the projected operating profit for the year.
For 2014, the Committee felt it appropriate, bearing in mind the anticipated challenges facing the business, to set the operating profit threshold at a level lower than that set in 2013.
The figures chosen were considered no less demanding than those set in 2013, when market conditions, expected financial performance and intended investments for the year were taken into account.
The Committee believes that the strong performance demonstrated in the actual outturn has been properly rewarded through the bonus mechanism.
The 2009 EGRIP awards reached the end of their measurement period in September 2014 and failed to vest.
The performance targets are as set out in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements with the actual performance for the 2009 EGRIP award being: the absolute total shareholder return target was exceeded: the cumulative diluted earnings per share target was exceeded by 4%: and the overall outperformance of the techMARK All-Share Index comparative index TSR was not satisfied by 0.4%.
The 2010 EGRIP awards will reach the end of their measurement period in September 2015 and it is likely that they will fail to vest, therefore, of the five EGRIP awards, two have vested, two have failed to vest and one is unlikely to vest.

Directors shareholdings The executive directors shareholding guidelines have been structured to encourage executive directors to acquire and maintain a meaningful shareholding in Fidessa.
For both executive directors this is a minimum value equal to 100% of salary.
The value of both executive directors shareholdings have been substantially greater than the guideline throughout 2014 and several multiples of their respective salaries.
There is no shareholding guideline for the nonexecutive directors.

Fidessa group plc 31 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Performance graphs and comparator tables The Regulations require the presentation of a number of graphs and tables as follows: The performance graph of total shareholder return compared to a broad equity market index for the same period as the table setting out the total remuneration and amounts received by the Chief Executive.
The Board believes that the techMARK All-Share Index, of which Fidessa is a constituent, provides the best benchmark for comparison.

As a software business with a strategy focused on organic development, its primary costs are related to its employees.
The strategy also delivers a stable margin and strong cash flows.
The cash generation has allowed Fidessa to distribute the majority of profit after tax to shareholders in the form of annual and special dividends.
The profit and corporation tax figures have been included to provide greater context to staff remuneration and the total distributions to shareholders.

The Committee also takes into account sensitivities in relation to the salary increases across the wider workforce.
Salary increases may also include use of the DABP.
Any increase will be set out in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts.
Benefits The benefits received by the directors will remain substantially unchanged from 2014, being life insurance, ill health income protection and private medical insurance.
Annual An annual bonus will be paid to the executive directors in accordance with the directors remuneration bonus policy and the operation method followed in 2014.
The percentage payable on operating profit greater than the threshold will be set to provide a similar overall outcome for on target earnings and material adjustments to these parameters are unlikely.
An interim bonus payment will be made after the half year results are announced.
The performance measure for, and the operation of, the annual bonus for 2015 is not being disclosed in this report as that information is deemed to be a forecast and therefore commercially sensitive.
That information will be disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts.
Long-term It is proposed that the Committee may approve the granting of awards to the executive directors incentives under the PSP no greater than the maximum permitted under the approved Directors Remuneration Policy and the terms of the relevant share plan.
The performance targets for awards made under the PSP will be based on the satisfaction of an earnings per share growth performance condition, as described in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
Pension The current directors will continue to not participate in the pension scheme.
Other The directors will continue to be awarded matching shares as a result of their participation in the SIP.
In relation to the Chairman and non-executive directors, it is proposed that their fees will be reviewed to take into account fees paid by listed companies with a similar market capitalisation and also their time commitment and responsibilities.
Finally, upon a successor to Andy Malpass being appointed, Andy will continue to receive his salary and benefits for the period prior to his retirement as a director.
The Committee has also agreed that Andy will be entitled to receive a bonus pro-rated for that period.
Payments will be made on the normal payroll date, with any bonus payment being made on the normal bonus payment date.
Unvested share incentive awards under the EGRIP and SIP will be forfeited.
Further details of Andys remuneration will be disclosed at the time of his retirement.
