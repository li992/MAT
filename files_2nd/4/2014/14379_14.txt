The role of the Remuneration Committee is to design a remuneration strategy that drives performance aligned to the strategic priorities.
Yours sincerely, Our performance in 2014 reflected the choices we made to continue investing to transform Smith & Nephew and, as a result, the Group enters 2015 stronger, more efficient, and set for higher growth.
However, these choices did impact profit and cash performance in 2014 and consequently performance against the financial measures in Joseph Papa the Annual Incentive Plan and the resulting payouts under this plan are Chairman of the Remuneration Committee accordingly lower than in previous years.
The Remuneration Committee recognises that the Executive Directors made the right decisions for the long-term future of the Company and for the benefit of shareholders, and performed well against their business objectives.
In devising our remuneration arrangements, we aim to have a clear line of sight between the performance of the Company and how our Directors and senior executives are paid.
We do this by setting the fixed elements of pay, notably base salary and benefits, in line with what our Executive Directors would be paid at another company of a comparable size, complexity and geographical spread.
For the variable elements of pay, we select performance measures that are linked to one or more of our Strategic Priorities as detailed on page 13 of the Annual Report.
These performance measures are summarised on the following page.
