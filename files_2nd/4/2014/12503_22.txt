With this in mind, the Committee is proposing to set the Executives were limited to 2%, in line with the pay awards made across the return on sales performance range applying to awards in 2014 15 at the Group.

DSBP awards may be made by way of nil cost option, conditional award or forfeitable share award and may be satisfied with new issue shares, market purchase or treasury shares, at the Committees discretion.
DSBP awards are subject to the executive shareholding policy, requiring one half of shares vesting after tax and costs to be retained throughout employment until a holding of the requisite level is achieved and that level of holding maintained.
The Committee determines the percentage of salary to be achieved and other terms of the policy.

b Currently, both have two performance conditions measured over a minimum three-year period, starting not earlier than the beginning of the year in which the grant is made: growth in earnings per share EPS and adjusted return on sales RoS.
The Committee retains the discretion to determine the weightings of each measure and may select other measures, if it considers it appropriate to do so to ensure alignment with the Groups strategy.
The Committee sets the targets relevant to any grant and decides for each grant whether, and the extent to which, each performance condition has been met and the awards vest.
The Committee can amend performance condition s for a grant if an intervening event makes it appropriate to do so, provided the revised conditions are considered by the Committee to be no less challenging in allthe circumstances.
Awards under the ESOP may be made by way of option which for UK participants may be approved or unapproved and for US participants may be an incentive stock option or non qualifying option or share appreciation right SAR save in the case of approved options and may be satisfied with new issue shares, market purchase or treasury shares, at the Committees discretion.
SARs are market priced options that, on exercise, deliver only the gain in shares, rather than all of the shares comprised in the option, thus reducing the Companys share usage.
The Committee may also grant phantom awards or satisfy awards in cash with the Executives agreement and can settle options as SARs.
The maximum grant permissible under each plan and this policy is 100% of base salary, based on face value, save in exceptional circumstances when awards of up to 150% can be made under each plan.
For information, the Committees practice has been to make awards below the maximum permitted under the policy, as follows as a percentage of base salary : For the CEO 60% under the PSP and 100% under the ESOP: c For the CFO 60% under the PSP and 100% under the ESOP.
Awards are usually granted annually although awards may exceptionally be granted more frequently: for example, to a new appointee.
Awards under the LTI are subject to the Companys executive shareholding policy, requiring one half of shares vesting after tax and costs to be retained throughout employment until a holding of the requisite level is achieved and that level of holding maintained.
The terms of the policy, including the percentage of salary to be achieved, are set by the Committee.
Subject to claw-back or scale-back in the event of misstated performance or misconduct.
See page 67 for an illustration of the amounts potentially receivable by the Executives for minimum, on-target and maximum performance.
This shows that, at targeted performance, 17 and 19% and, at maximum performance, 22 and 24% of the Executives total remuneration is payable under the long term incentive plan, depending on role.
Notes: a Differences in policy compared with other employees: Generally, remuneration for the Executives is more heavily weighted to performance-related pay than that of less senior employees, so that the Executive Directors are personally motivated to deliver thestrategy successfully and to enhance the link between their interests and shareholders.
Fixed elements vary by role, grade and geography but are largely consistent in policy.
Base salary: No differences in policy.
The Groups overall salary budget and percentage increases made to other employees with similar levels of performance are taken into account in setting the Executives salaries.
Benets: No differences in policy: benets vary by grade and jurisdiction and with job role.
For example: cars or car allowances and health and life insurance are only available in the UK where, in the case of a car, there is a need based on role or to managers of above a certain grade.
Pension: The level of contribution made by the Company varies with jurisdiction and the age and grade of the employee.
Annual bonus: All employees of management grade are eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme, with maximum opportunity varying with grade and performance.
Financial objectives are primarily based on the profit centre to which the individual contributes and, in the event that the bonus is structured to take account of personal objectives, objectives relevant to the employees role would be set.
LTIP: Employees of management grade and nominated talented performers participate in the LTIP.
The Global Executive Team have awards subject to performance conditions.
Other managers andtalented performers receive awards under the ESOP without performance conditions.
Maximum available opportunity varies according to grade and individual performance.
b Performance conditions: Annual bonus: The performance conditions for the annual bonus may be entirely based on key aspects of the Companys financial performance, or may also be measured against strategic or operational targets relevant to the individuals role and designed to drive the Companys strategy, at the Committees discretion.
DSBP awards, once granted, have no performance conditions as theirgrant requires each Executive to have met the performance targets relevant to the annual bonus before any award can be granted to him or her.
LTIP: The EPS and RoS conditions apply equally to awards under the PSP and the ESOP, where both are granted.
EPS was chosen as an appropriate measure of the Companys strategy for profitable growth, expressed as a compound growth rate to assist in the clear communication of targets.
RoS is a key strategic financial target for Premier Farnell.
By measuring RoS performance, the Remuneration Committee seeks to promote the corporate goal of targeting sales growth and managing margin.
The combination of the two measures requires both return and growth for the awards to achieve value.
The Committee reserves the right to vary the weighting of the measures for any grant.
c Other share-based schemes: In common with all eligible employees of the Group, Executive Directors in the UK are entitled to participate in any HMRC approved, all-employee share plan.
These options are not subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition as such schemes are not restricted to Executive Directors and Senior Executives and are subject to maximum contribution limits set by HMRC.
The Committee sets the terms of each grant offered under such plan.

Who is on the Remuneration Committee?
Paul Withers chair, Dennis Millard and Andrew Dougal served on the Remuneration Committee throughout the year.
The Committee is responsible for determining the specic remuneration packages for Executive Directors and senior managers being the first layer of management below Board level, for setting the Chairman of the Boards fees, administering the Companys share plans and operating any performance-related pay or share plans for theExecutives and senior managers including setting targets and determining pay-outs and awards.

During the year, except when there has been a possible conict, the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive officer have attended all meetings of the Committee, to provide input and advice.
The Company Secretary serves as secretary to the Committee.
Meetings of the Committee are also attended by the Companys Chief People officer Sandra Campopiano until July 2013 and Andrea Dunstan from 2 September 2013 to advise on remuneration arrangements generally.
The Companys policy is that no individuals be present to provide input when their own remuneration or fees are decided.

"t ""XBSET NBUVSJOH Awards granted in July 2010 under the PSP and the ESOP were scheduled to vest in July 2013 and included the following awards made to LaurenceBain, subject to the following performance targets: Number of Performance target Performance Number of Performance Performance shares under for the PSP achieved shares under target for achieved the PSP pence in 2012 13 pence the ESOP the ESOP in 2012 13 Adjusted EPS of 15 RoS of 11.7% for threshold for threshold vesting and 20 vesting and 13% 1 Chief Executive 71,622 for full vesting EPS of 14.8 107,433 for full vesting RoS of 10.1% Note: 1."
Awarded to Laurence Bain in his former role as Chief Operating officer.
The awards made to Mark Whiteling in July 2010 lapsed when Mark left the Company in August 2011.
These awards therefore lapsed in full without vesting.
t Awards granted in 2013 14 The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance conditions that apply to long term incentives each year to ensure that they remain relevant and stretching.
All awards to Executives and senior management made in 2013 14 under the PSP and the ESOP are subject to the same two performance conditions in order to ensure a rounded view of performance, with one half of the award under each scheme subject to an EPS target expressed as a compound growth rate and the other half subject to an adjusted RoS performance measure.
The Committee considered that higher RoS performance conditions could lead to the business turning down profitable sales opportunities.
The adjusted RoS target was therefore lowered for 2013 14 to 10% for threshold vesting and 12% for full vesting.
This change was considered appropriate given the market sectors and mix of customers targeted by the Group and given that itremains challenging.
The targets for awards made in 2013 14 are: CAGR in EPS 2013 14 2015 16 EPS required in 2015 16 for vesting pence Vesting percentage 12% or more 20.8 or more 100% Between 5% and 12% 17.1 to 20.8 Between 20% and 100% on a straight-line basis Less than 5% Under 17.1 0% Adjusted return on sales in 2015 16 Vesting percentage 12% or more 100% Between 10% and 12% Between 20% and 100% on a straight-line basis Less than 10% 0% Details of the awards made to Laurence and Mark during the year are set out in the table on page 73.

In order to ensure that the targets set do not risk profitable growth by encouraging the sacrifice of profitable sales opportunities to preserve returns and that the awards remain achievable and motivational, the Committee is proposing to reduce the adjusted return on sales target applying to all awards in 2014 15 to between 9.5% and 11.5%.
The application of each measure to one half of each award under each plan, the CAGR in EPS target and maximum level of awards as a percentage of salary will remain as for 2013 14.
What pensions are the Directors entitled to?
Throughout the year, Laurence Bain elected to receive a cash supplement in place of the contributions which would otherwise have been made by the Company on his behalf to the Premier Farnell UK Pension Scheme the UK Scheme and a funded unapproved scheme previously in place.
This supplement is paid at the same rate as the Companys previous contributions to the UK Scheme and the funded unapproved scheme.
Mark Whiteling may elect to have dened contributions made to the UK Scheme or a registered personal pension scheme, to take a cash allowance or forsome combination of the two, up to the amount of the Companys contribution under his service contract.
Mark chose to have some of his contributions made to his personal pension plan, with a cash allowance in respect of the balance.
The pension benets of the Executives as at 2 February 2014 were audited : Company contribution or allowance as 1 Nature of benefit a percentage of salary Annual cost for 2013 14 2012 13 136,575 Laurence Bain Cash allowance 27% 2012 13: 124,825 Combination of cash allowance and contributions to Marks 103,984 2 Mark Whiteling personal pension plan 27% 2012 13: 23,766 Notes: 1.
As set out in the Executives service contract and subject to his making personal contributions of a minimum percentage amount.
The normal retirement age under the Executives service contracts is 65years of age.
From the date of Mark rejoining the Company.
No Executive Directors receive any final salary pension benets.
Non-Executive Directors do not receive any pension benets.
What long term incentive awards were made to the Directors during the financial year?
In 2013 14, awards were made to the Executives under the ESOP and PSP as follows audited : 1 Face value Percentage vesting 2 percentage of Exercise price at threshold Performance 3 4 Type of award No of shares Date of grant salary on grant pence performance period PSP 305,999 2013 14 to Laurence Bain Nil cost option 152,694 28 June 2013 60% 0 10% 2015 16 235,618 2013 14 to Mark Whiteling Nil cost option 117,574 28 June 2013 60% 0 10% 2015 16 ESOP Market value 510,000 2013 14 to Laurence Bain option 254,491 28 June 2013 100% 200.4 10% 2015 16 Market value 392,700 2013 14 to Mark Whiteling option 195,958 28 June 2013 100% 200.4 10% 2015 16 Notes: 1.
Face value is the maximum number of shares which will vest if all performance targets are achieved in full multiplied by the share price at grant being 200.4 pence per share for the PSP and ESOP.
Awards under the PSP and ESOP are made on the basis of the maximum percentage of salary specified.
This is the price to exercise the award.
This is different from the price at grant used to calculate face value for the PSP as this is a nil cost option.
Assuming that either the RoS or the EPS performance condition is met in respect of one half of an award and that the performance condition for the other half lapses.
Performance conditions for the PSP and ESOP awards are on page 72.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to receive share awards.
indd 73 24 04 2014 16:01 74 Premier Farnell Annual Report and Accounts 2013 14 Remuneration report What share awards did the Directors hold at the end of the financial year?
At the end of the year under review, the Executive Directors had share awards outstanding under the DSBP, ESOP, PSP and SAYE schemes as detailed below.

The range during the year was 191.0 pence to 238.4 pence.
Save in the case of SAYE awards, this is the market price on the day prior to grant, being the price used to determine the number of shares under award.
For SAYE awards, this is the market price usedto determine the discounted price at which the awards were offered to all employees.
Awards under the ESOP and the PSP have performance conditions.
Awards under the DSBP and SAYE are dependent on remaining employed by the Company for two and three years respectively from grant unless a good leaver and on the participant making the necessary contributions to the savings plan, in the case of the SAYE.

Do you have a policy or issue guidelines on Directors shareholdings?
The Companys executive shareholding policy requires Executive Directors and other senior executives to retain a number of the shares acquired as a result of the exercise of Company share plans or their own purchases until a shareholding with a value equal to a multiple of the individuals annual base salary is reached.
Only shares beneficially owned are taken into account for these purposes: vested but unexercised share awards are not included in calculating a holding.
Once achieved, the minimum level of shareholding is then to be maintained until the Executive leaves ofce.
Non-Executive Directors are not subject to the shareholding policy or other requirements to build up a holding of shares.

What is the Companys policy on satisfying share awards with new issue shares?
During 2013 14, the Committee reviewed the number of shares required to satisfy all awards issued under its share plans, including the PSP, ESOP, DSBP and SAYE, and determined that the majority of its awards would be satisfied using shares bought in the market although this would not be done for participants in countries where this is inadvisable as a result of local laws and regulation and on a net basis as a SAR in the case of marketpriced options.
On this basis, the number of awards outstanding under the share plans to be satisfied using new issue shares at 2 February 2014, when aggregated with: t the number of new shares issued or to be issued under all share option plans over the last ten years, including both executive and all-employee plans, totalled an amount equal to 4.74% of the Companys issued ordinary capital: t the number of new shares issued or to be issued under all executive share option plans over the last ten years totalled an amount equal to 4.12% ofthe Companys issued ordinary share capital.
These totals are well within the dilution limits of 10% and 5% respectively set by the Association of British Insurers and reected in the rules of the Companys share plans.
