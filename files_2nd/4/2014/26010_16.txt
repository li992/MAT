62 Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Dilution Our policy regarding dilution from employee share awards is to ensure that dilution will be no more than 10 per cent.
in any rolling 10 year period and no more than five per cent.
from employee share awards granted to executive Directors of the Company in any rolling 10 year period.
As at 31 December 2014, share awards granted under the DBP, LTIP and Sharesave in the four and a half years since Jupiters Listing were outstanding over 17m shares including 2.4m granted to executive Directors.
to executive Directors of the Companys issued share capital.
Our current intention is to settle all share awards outstanding as at 31 December 2014 with market purchased shares and our ongoing practice is to purchase shares in the market to settle obligations.
No new shares have been issued since Listing in 2010.
Therefore, we are currently operating within the relevant dilution targets by a comfortable margin.
Notwithstanding the target outlined above, as a business exposed to both market shocks and critical people issues, we believe we should retain flexibility to act very quickly to take steps that could increase dilution up to a maximum of 15 per cent.
on a temporary and short-term basis, if the Remuneration Committee and Board believes it is clearly in shareholders interests to do so.
If dilution were to exceed 10 per cent.
in any rolling 10 year period, this would be on an exceptional basis and for a short time period.
The Remuneration report for the relevant year would also contain the necessary justifications for such an outcome.
The Remuneration Committee and Board would ensure that dilution levels returned to within the 10 per cent.
