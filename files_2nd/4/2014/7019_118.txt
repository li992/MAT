Remuneration Committee Report continued Annual Remuneration Report The three-year performance period over which ROTIC performance will be measured is April 2013 to March 2016.
TSR performance is measured between 1 May 2013 and 1 August 2016 due to three-month averaging of TSR at 1 August 2013 being compared to the threemonth average at 1 August 2016.
The award is eligible to vest in its entirety on the third anniversary of the date of grant i. e. 7 August 2016, subject to 50% on ROTIC and 50% on TSR performance.
The performance targets applicable to awards granted in 2013 are illustrated below.

Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2015 Salary The Committee conducted a consultation of the top ten shareholders in February and March 2014.
The consultation was prompted by the Committees indentification that, whilst Halmas performance in terms of TSR and market capitalisation has been strong in recent years, salaries for Halmas executive Directors and the fair value of the total package were not competitive for a Group of Halmas size and complexity.
The Committee believed it was appropriate to move salaries above market lower quartile and closer to a market median level.
Going forward, it is anticipated that salary increases will normally align with those awarded across the Group more generally.
The Committee recognises the need to continue to exercise restraint on executive remuneration, and notes that the resulting packages remain below median for companies of our size and sector.
Therefore, the Committee approved the following salary increases with effect from 1 April 2014.
By way of comparison, the average salary increase across the sectors for 2015 was between 3% and 4%.
