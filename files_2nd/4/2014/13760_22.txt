62 Governance SABMiller plc Annual Report 2014 Directors remuneration report Remuneration policy The remuneration committees main responsibility is to ensure that payments to executives are appropriate and aligned with shareholder interests, producing sustainable value creation through the delivery of our long-term business strategy.
Dear Shareholder In this, my introduction to the directors remuneration report, I summarise the groups performance and the resulting pay outcomes for the year ended 31 March 2014, and highlight some of the key issues that the remuneration committee has considered during the year.
The remainder of this report consists of our remuneration policy and the annual report on remuneration, both of which are presented for shareholder approval this year.
Performance and outcome for 2014 This has been a year of resilient financial performance, against a number of headwinds, with the depreciation of key currencies against the US dollar also having a significant negative impact on the translation of reported financial results for the year.
This is reflected in the reduced annual bonus payments to executive directors and in some of the long-term incentive awards not vesting in full, illustrating the very challenging performance targets set each year by the remuneration committee.
Year on year improvements in underlying performance have produced a 26% increase in EPS and a 99% increase in TSR over the three years to 31March 2014, and a 76% increase in EPS and a 203% increase in TSR over the five years to 31 March 2014.
Further details of the performance measures and payouts are shown on pages 74 to 76, with the outcome for the current executive directors remuneration summarised in the remuneration at a glance table on page 63.
Graham Mackay During the year, the untimely death of Graham Mackay on 18December 2013 meant that it was our sad duty to consider how to treat his unvested long-term incentive awards.
Graham presided over a significant corporate success, leading the company from its listing on the London Stock Exchange in 1999.
100 invested in SABMiller at that time was worth 1,114by 31 March 2013, while over that same period a 100 investment across the FTSE 100 would have been worth just 167.
The committee approached this matter in the same way that it has in the past for other employees in the same circumstances.
In accordance with the rules of the plans and the companys termination policy, the treatment of unvested long-term incentive awards was determined by EPS performance to 31 March 2013 being the latest audited full-year EPS before his death and Total Shareholder Return performance to 17 December 2013.
This resulted in some awards vesting in full while others lapsed.
It had already been agreed with Graham that he would not be entitled to any annual bonus payment for the year ended 31 March 2014.
Lesley Knox, Chairman of the remuneration committee This has been a year of resilient financial performance, against a number of headwinds.
Based on feedback from our shareholder consultation, we have strengthened the performance conditions for the vesting of share options, changed the comparator group for the vesting of value shares, and formalised our forfeiture and clawback provisions.
Governance SABMiller plc Annual Report 2014 63 Details of achievement against each performance condition fact, both would have made vesting more difficult.
We have with the resulting outcomes are shown on pages 75 and 76. also incorporated more formal and explicit provisions into our The early vesting of awards, which would ordinarily have annual bonus and long-term incentive plans enabling the vested over a number of years through to June 2017, have forfeiture and clawback of annual bonus and share awards resulted in a sizeable single figure of remuneration for Graham if there is required to be a material restatement of financial this year, as it includes the outcome of all long-term incentive results other than due to changes in accounting policy, awards in accordance with the reporting regulations, which misconduct, or other action causing harm to the reputation of do not cater for such sad circumstances.
Of course, it is not anticipated that this will prove necessary, but the committee agreed with shareholders that Remuneration policy review and changes this is a sensible precaution.
In 2010 we changed the structure of remuneration so that performance at median or below would not be rewarded The committee considered all the remuneration structures in at all, but exceptional performance relative to our peers light of the new remuneration reporting regulations, and we over performance periods of up to five years would result in have taken a number of steps to clarify and strengthen our exceptional rewards.

that many chose to contribute.
Based on feedback from our Lesley Knox shareholder consultation, we have strengthened the Chairman of the remuneration committee performance condition for the vesting of share options, changing from an EPS growth measure linked to UK RPI to 2 June 2014 fixed targets in constant currency, which is considered a more relevant and consistent measure of performance.
We have also changed the comparator group for the vesting of value share awards, to remove some of the smaller beer competitors and include large consumer goods companies with a similar exposure to developing markets.
We have back-tested both of these changes based on historical performance to ensure that they would not have made vesting easier to achieve in Remuneration at a glance The table below summarises the pay of the current executive directors for the year ended 31 March 2014.

Governance SABMiller plc Annual Report 2014 67 Remuneration policy notes 1 The committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payment, notwithstanding the policy set out in this report, where the terms of the payment were determined before the policy came into effect, or if the individual was not an executive director at the date the remuneration was determined unless that remuneration was set in consideration or in anticipation of becoming an executive director.
The committee may make minor amendments to the policy for regulatory, exchange control, or administrative purposes, or to take account of a change in other legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that minor amendment.
2 The remuneration policy for other UK employees is similar to that for executive directors in accordance with our philosophy that remuneration should be appropriate to the local competitive market.
Certain components of remuneration for example, car allowance and long-term incentives are paid only to certain levels of employees.
There are other variances depending on geographic location and local market practice, but the general approach is consistent across the group.
3 The specific financial performance measures applicable to short-term and long-term incentive plans may be varied to align with the companys key strategic priorities.
The targets for each Remuneration policy table performance measure are set to be stretching, based on a number of reference points including company targets, analyst forecasts, and shareholder expectations.

Governance SABMiller plc Annual Report 2014 75 Share option plan Outcome for the year ended 31 March 2014 audited As explained in the remuneration policy table on pages 66 and 67, share options provide a direct and transparent link between executive pay and value creation for shareholders, as no gains are possible unless there has been an absolute increase in the share price.
Furthermore, to ensure that any share price increase is supported by a sustainable improvement in the groups underlying financial performance, additional performance conditions are applied before vesting of: two-thirds of the share options after three years: and one-third of the share options after five years.
If these performance conditions are not met, the appropriate proportion of share options will lapse, and there is no opportunity for retesting.
Following Mr Mackays untimely death on 18 December 2013, the committee considered the treatment of his unvested share options in accordance with the rules of the Executive Share Option Plan 2008 and the termination policy.
The existence of pre-determined performance conditions enabled the committee to calculate the vesting with reference to the extent that the performance conditions had been achieved by the date of his death.
Accordingly, the last audited full-year EPS before his death as at 31March 2013 was used to calculate the appropriate vesting of his remaining share options over shortened performance periods, as shown in the table below.
The vesting of share options for the other executive directors for the full performance periods ended 31 March 2014 are also shown in the table below, which for Alan Clark also includes share options granted in respect of services as an employee, rather than as, or in contemplation of appointment as, an executive director.

The number of shares which can be released under a value share award is dependent upon TSR out-performance compared with a comparator group identified on page 77 with: below median TSR performance, no shares will vest: at median TSR performance, no shares will vest: but for every 10 million of additional shareholder value created, a fixed number of shares will vest.
Following Mr Mackays untimely death on 18 December 2013, the committee considered the treatment of his unvested share awards in accordance with the rules of the Executive Share Award Plan 2008 and the termination policy.
Accordingly, the last audited full-year EPS before his death 31 March 2013 was used to calculate the appropriate vesting of his remaining performance shares, and TSR to 17 December 2013 was used to calculate the vesting of his remaining value shares over shortened performance periods, as shown in the table below, with the vesting of share awards for the other executive directors for the full performance periods ended 31March 2014.

The previous comparator groups comprised global and regional beer and alcoholic drinks companies, but with the continuing consolidation of the industry, the scale and characteristics of the comparator group members have diverged.
It had become apparent that many shareholders increasingly see SABMiller as a global consumer business with significant exposure to developing markets, rather than just a global brewer.
Accordingly, other companies operating in wider consumer goods categories in developing markets are considered more relevant comparators than some of the smaller scale, regional, beer and alcoholic beverage companies in the previous comparator groups.
Accordingly, the comparator group has been changed for performance periods commencing from 2014, to remove some of the smaller beer competitors i. e. Molson Coors, Asahi Breweries, Constellation Brands and Sapporo Holdings and include large consumer goods companies with a similar exposure to developing markets Coca-Cola, Nestl, Unilever and Mondelez, while maintaining a larger weighting for our principal global competitors for beer.

The 300 chart below compares the companys TSR with the FTSE 100 Total Return Index over the period from 1 April 250 2009 to 31 March 2014, assuming an initial investment 200 of 100.
The company is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Total Return Index and, accordingly, this is considered 150 to be an appropriate comparison to demonstrate the companys relative performance.

His total remuneration for the whole of the year ended 31 March 2014 is shown above for ease of comparison.
Percentage change in remuneration for the Chief Executive compared with other employees The table below shows the percentage change in remuneration for the Chief Executive from the prior year, compared with a comparator group of other employees of the SABMiller group based in the UK over the same time period.
This population was felt to be the most appropriate comparator to the Chief Executive, who is also UK-based.
Salary and fees Taxable Annual cash 1 2 annualised benefits bonus Chief Executive % change 3.0% 80% 126% 3 UK employees % change 3.4% -19% -3% 1 Mr Clark was appointed an executive director on 26 July 2012.
Therefore, the increase in taxable benefits for him in his new position of Chief Executive is mainly due to the comparison with only a part of the prior year.
The decrease in taxable benefits for UK employees is due to a reduction in the cost of medical insurance premiums, and not due to any reduction in the level of benefits provided.
2 The 126% increase in annual cash bonus for Mr Clark is also mainly due to the comparison with only a part of the prior year, and also the increase in bonus opportunity upon his appointment as Chief Executive on 23 April 2013.
The small decrease in the average annual cash bonus for UK employees reflects the lower achievement against the group financial performance targets for 2014 compared with 2013, which also impacted the bonus payments to executive directors to the same extent.
3 Given the global nature of SABMillers operations and the diverse pay markets in which our employees operate, the UK employees were deemed to provide the most appropriate comparator group for the purposes of this table.
Payments to past directors and treatment of Graham Mackays outstanding LTI awards audited Following the death of Graham Mackay on 18 December 2013, the committee determined the appropriate treatment of his outstanding long-term incentive awards in accordance with the rules of the Executive Share Option Plan 2008 and the Executive Share Award Plan 2008, and with reference to the companys termination policy.
The outcomes are shown on pages 75 and 76.

82 Governance SABMiller plc Annual Report 2014 Directors remuneration report Annual report on remuneration continued Share options granted to executive directors before 2014 have a performance condition that requires compound annualised adjusted EPS growth, expressed in sterling, of: UK RPI 3% per annum for any of the share options to vest: and UK RPI 5% per annum for full vesting.
Share options granted to executive directors from 2014 have a performance condition that requires compound growth in adjusted EPS in constant currency of: 6% per annum for any of the share options to vest: and 11% per annum for full vesting.
2 Following the untimely death of Mr Mackay on 18 December 2013, 297,850 performance shares were released on 14 January 2014 with a market value of 30.205 per share.
Before 2010, 50% of the performance shares awarded to executive directors and to executive committee members and all the performance shares awarded to Mr Wilson had a performance condition that required compound annualised adjusted EPS growth over a three-year period.
All performance shares awarded since 2010 have this performance condition.
The other 50% of the performance shares awarded to executive directors and to executive committee members before 2010 had a performance condition that required the companys TSR to exceed the median TSR of a comparator group identified on page 77.
Two-thirds of these shares had a three-year performance period and the remaining one-third of these shares had a five-year performance period, the last award being made in May 2009 and shown in the table above, vesting during the year ended 31 March 2014 with performance condition of: Below median TSR performance no shares vest: At median TSR performance 25% of the shares vest: and If TSR exceeds the median by 33% or more 100% of the shares vest.

2 The value shares awarded to Mr Mackay on 1 June 2010, and available for release from 1 June 2013, were released conditional upon TSR out-performance to 30 November 2013.
The resulting award, comprising 241,560 shares, was released in the form of a nil cost option granted on 5 December 2013 and vesting one-third immediately, one-third on the fourth anniversary of the grant date, and one-third on the fifth anniversary of the grant date, in accordance with the plan rules.
Following Mr Mackays death a short time thereafter, the deferred awards became exercisable and were subsequently exercised in full by Mr Mackays estate on 6 May 2014, with a market value of 32.52 per share.
3 Following the untimely death of Mr Mackay on 18 December 2013, the outcome of his remaining value share awards were calculated with reference to the extent that the performance conditions had been achieved by the date of death, and were released or lapsed as shown on page 76.
Accordingly, in respect of the value shares awarded on 1 June 2011, an award comprising 102,960 shares was released to Mr Mackays estate in the form of a nil cost option, and was subsequently exercised in full on 6 May 2014 at a market price of 32.52 per share.
The value shares awarded on 1 June 2012 did not achieve the required performance criteria and therefore the award lapsed in full.
The number of shares which can be released under a value share award is dependent upon TSR out-performance compared with the median of a comparator group identified on page 77 over three, four and five-year performance periods: for below median TSR performance, no shares will vest: at median TSR performance, no shares will vest: but for every 10 million of additional shareholder value created, a fixed number of shares as set out in the table above will vest.
Additional shareholder value represents the amount of additional return to shareholders as a result of the companys TSR performance exceeding that of the comparator group.
It is calculated as the percentage change in TSR of the company, less the percentage change in TSR of the median of the comparator group, multiplied by the companys market capitalisation at the commencement of the performance period.
The maximum number of shares that can vest is capped at the level at which additional shareholder value at the end of each performance period equals the market capitalisation of the company at the commencement of the performance period.
The maximum value for all participants including executive directors in the aggregate is therefore capped at 0.4% of additional shareholder value created for any five-year performance period.
This is the maximum theoretical percentage that can be earned in aggregate by all participants, with 99.6% of the additional value created accruing to shareholders.
84 Governance SABMiller plc Annual Report 2014 Directors remuneration report Annual report on remuneration continued The value shares conditionally awarded before 2013 vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date, subject to TSR outperformance, but participants may request the release of all or part of the award from the third anniversary of the grant date.
If the committee exercises its discretion to release shares in such circumstances, the number of shares is determined based on TSR out-performance to that date, with the shares partially deferred and released in equal instalments over the period until the fifth anniversary of the grant date.
There is no opportunity for retesting against future TSR performance, and the deferred shares are subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances should the participants employment terminate before the fifth anniversary.
Value shares conditionally awarded from 2013 vest one-third on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date respectively.
Any shares are then released, based on TSR out-performance to the preceding 31 March.
If the performance conditions for any award are not achieved at the relevant date, the appropriate proportion of shares will lapse and there is no opportunity for retesting.
The earliest opportunity for any value shares to be released was in the period ended 31 March 2014, although no awards had been released to Mr Clark or Mr Wilson as at 2 June 2014.
At 31 March 2014 TSR out-performance, additional shareholder value created, and the indicative value of shares capable of vesting for the highest paid executive Alan Clark were: Performance period commencing 1 April 2010 1 April 2011 1 April 2012 1 April 2013 SABMillers TSR to 31 March 2014 87.601% 52.636% 33.139% 3.719% Comparator group median TSR to 31 March 2014 45.799% 36.485% 37.601% 7.183% Out-performance 41.802% 16.151% nil nil SABMiller market capitalisation at commencement of the performance period 27,746m 33,485m 37,639m 47,580m Additional shareholder value created 11,598m 5,408m nil nil Value of shares capable of vesting at 29.95 per share 4.0m 1.9m nil nil Value of shares as % of additional shareholder value created 0.03% 0.03% Approval This report complies with the requirements of the regulations.
