DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT for the 52 weeks ended 26 July 2015 Annual statement Dear shareholder This report complies with the changes to the Companies Act which came into force on 1 October 2013.
The remuneration committee does not propose any changes to the remuneration policy this year.
Early in this financial year, the finance director, Kirk Davis, left the Company.
Ben Whitley assumed his responsibilities for financial matters for the remainder of the financial year.
The committee decided to increase the salaries of the CEO and the personnel and legal director by 10%, in recognition of their continued high performance and commitment to the Company.
The annual cash bonus scheme will pay out 5% of basic salary this year.
Directors will receive an amount equivalent to 25% of their salary in shares under the SIP scheme, which is a share incentive scheme open to all Company employees after an 18-month qualifying period.
Directors will also receive 100% of their basic salary in shares under the deferred bonus scheme.
Looking forward, the committee proposes a 10-year renewal of the current deferred bonus scheme which expires at the AGM on 12 November 2015.
Approval for this proposal will be sought from shareholders at the 2015 AGM.
No further changes to the remuneration policy are intended in the coming year.
We believe that our remuneration policy continues to be fair and reasonable and aligns both the short and long-term interests of directors with those of the company and its shareholders.
Further details are set out below, with shareholders invited to approve this report and proposals at the AGM on 12 November 2015.
By order of the board Debra van Gene Chair of the Remuneration Committee 10 September 2015 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015 51 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Remuneration policy The committee reviews the executive directors remuneration packages at least annually.
The aim of the remuneration policy is to: n provide attractive and fair remuneration for directors.
n align directors long-term interests with those of shareholders, employees and the wider community.
n incentivise directors to perform to a high level.
In agreeing on remuneration, account is taken of the pay levels at Wetherspoon, as well as those in the leisure industry in general, along with other comparisons and reports.
The committee aims to take a fair and commonsense approach.
This policy came into force on the date of the AGM 13 November 2014.
The elements of the remuneration package of each executive director are as follows: Component Reason Operation, maximum achievable and performance criteria Base salary Provide attractive Salaries are reviewed at least annually, with any changes normally taking and fair effect from 1 October each year.
Salary increases are awarded at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
When considering salary levels and whether an increase should be offered, the committee takes account of a variety of factors, including Company performance, individual performance, experience and responsibilities, market information and the level of increase being offered to other employees.
Benefits Provide attractive A range of taxable benefits is available to executive directors.
These benefits and fair comprise principally the provision of a car allowance, life assurance, private remuneration medical insurance and fuel expenses.
The cost of benefits provided changes in accordance with market conditions.
The committee monitors the overall cost of the package periodically.
Pension Provide attractive The Company does not operate any defined benefit pension schemes.
and fair Contributions of 12% of executive directors base salary are made by remuneration the Company to the Company stakeholder pension scheme.
If directors expect to reach their lifetime allowance under HMRC rules, they are able to opt out of the stakeholder pension scheme and receive an equivalent salary supplement instead.
In addition, any contributions above the annual HMRC-approved threshold are paid as a salary supplement.
This is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee.
Annual bonus plan Incentivise directors Annual bonus payments are paid in cash, at the discretion of the to perform to a remuneration committee.
The maximum bonus potential is 50% of salary.
The major part of the bonus is based on profit growth, multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and paid to a maximum of 45% of salary.
Profit growth is calculated on profit before tax and exceptional items.
In addition, a further 5% is awarded for carrying out a set number of calls on our pubs per month, in order to monitor service and other standards.
52 J D WETHERSPOON PLC DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Component Reason Operation, maximum achievable and performance criteria Share Incentive Plan Align directors The SIP an HMRC-approved scheme allocates shares equivalent to 5% of SIP long-term interests salary to all Company employees after an 18-month qualifying period.

employees and the wider community.
The Company offers extra SIPs under this scheme to some employees: pub managers receive an extra 5% annual award: head-office staff 1015%: senior managers and directors, including executive board directors, 20%.
In addition, an executive director may purchase partnership shares up to the government cap, at present 1,800 per annum.
Awards under this scheme are not based on financial or other targets.
The Company believes that excessive use of financial targets can lead to distortions in companies behaviour and that it is important for there to be some share awards which can be accumulated gradually, the value of which depends on the overall success of the Company.

The shares required under the scheme are purchased in the market by an employee benefit trust, funded by the Company.
Bonus is awarded at a rate of 2.5% of salary for each 1% increase in owners earnings per share and 2.5% of salary for each 1% increase in diluted adjusted earnings per share, based on the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.
An element of adjusted earnings per share growth including shares held in trust is included in this scheme, to reduce the potential volatility which may be inherent in relying purely on the owners earnings calculation, which is heavily influenced by maintenance capital expenditure.
Owners earnings are calculated as follows: Profit before tax: excluding unrealised exceptional items Add: Depreciation and amortisation Less: Cash reinvestment in current properties Less: Cash tax Equals: Owners earnings The maximum bonus to be earned under the scheme is 100% of annual salary.
Provisions are in place which permit the Company to reclaim awards under this scheme in exceptional circumstances of misstatement or misconduct.
