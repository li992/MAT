These objectives include improving returns, enhancing operating profit, increasing the efficiency of capital employed and delivering strong customer satisfaction.
Such objectives are measurable via the Groups reported KPIs of ROCE, earnings per share and customer satisfaction scores, all of which are built into the Groups incentive schemes.
Annual bonus arrangements are demonstrably linked to the Groups near term strategy via the inclusion of profit before tax, ROIC, cash flow and customer service as performance measures.
The LTIP has a longer term perspective and features performance measures of total shareholder return and earnings per share, both of which are measured over a three year period.
The inclusion of ROCE as a measure in the LTIP also ensures that efficiency of earnings is not compromised for the sake of near term returns.
The Committee is, therefore, satisfied that current arrangements clearly support the business strategy.
Key remuneration decisions during 2014 During 2014, the Committee set targets for the 2014 annual bonus shown on page 49 and approved 2013 bonus payments.
It set targets for and approved LTIP awards made in 2014 and approved the level of vesting for the 2011 LTIP awards.
A consultation with shareholders took place on the increase in the maximum award under the LTIP, which was approved at the 2014 AGM.
The Committee also completed the 2015 remuneration review, which included consideration of the link between executive remuneration and the pay and employment conditions throughout the Group including the proposals for general staff for 2015.
The salary of the Chief Executive was carefully reviewed for 2015 in conjunction with advice from Deloitte which showed that CEO salary levels had moved significantly at comparable companies in the housebulding sector leaving the CEO out of line by some margin.
In reaching its decision for 2015 the Committee noted that, following the increase, the CEOs total remuneration arrangements continue at the lower end of the sector range, reflecting the size and complexity of the Group relative to peers.
As explained in the Committee Chairmans letter, the response from major shareholders in engagement has been largely supportive.

Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan Long term incentive awards are made in the form of performance shares or nil-cost options under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting.
Each award is made subject to the achievement of performance criteria as set out below and will ordinarily vest after three years.
Discretions available to the Committee contained in the LTIP rules are set out in the policy table annexed to this report and also in the exit payments policy contained in the remuneration policy in the 2013 Annual Report and available at www.
Awards vesting in respect of 2014 The LTIP awards made in 2012 were measured over the three year period to 31 December 2014 and will vest to the extent of 66.6% on 28 February 2015.
One third of the award was measured against EPS performance: one third of the award was measured against TSR performance against an index: and one third of the award was measured against ROCE performance.
The threshold EPS target was 100p and the maximum target was 136p measured on a cumulative three year basis.
Absolute cumulative EPS over the three year performance period was 153.7p.

The threshold TSR target was performance equal to the median of the index and the maximum target was performance equal to 10% annual outperformance of the median of the index.
Actual TSR was 94.1% which was below the median of the index of 167% and, therefore, none of the award based on TSR will vest.
The threshold ROCE target was 8.9% and the maximum target was 12.4% measured in the third year of the performance period 2014.
Actual ROCE in 2014 was 16.2% and, therefore, the ROCE element will vest in full.

Implementation of remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December 2015 Changes in the way that remuneration policy will be implemented in 2015 versus 2014 include a base salary increase for CEO and the introduction of a measure for individual performance, as a non-financial metric key to business performance, for the 2015 annual bonus.
Executive directors base salaries and benefits The salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 2015 are as follows: % increase Executive directors Position 2015 base salary from 2014 David Ritchie CEO 550,000 18.3% Jonathan Hill GFD 280,000 0.0% The Committee carefully considered the above increase for David Ritchie, with Alastair Lyons writing to major shareholders in December 2014 to outline the rationale behind this decision.
In summary, this was as follows: i The Chief Executive was appointed in July 2008 on a salary significantly below that of his predecessor.
The expectation was that this salary would be moved progressively forward with experience, the creation of a successful track record, the delivery of shareholder value and increasing returns.
However, due to the downturn in the housing market which followed his appointment, the Committee felt that until now that it was inappropriate to implement this progression.
Instead, a pattern of inflationary increases was applied between 2008 and 2014. ii Under the Chief Executives tenure the Group has been successfully steered through a very challenging period for the housebuilding industry.
This has resulted in a significant increase in the scale and complexity of the business under his leadership.
iii Following a material movement in salaries amongst peers, the Committee concluded that David Ritchies salary was no longer appropriately positioned against the wider UK housebuilder sector.
Prior to this increase, David Ritchie was also still positioned below that of his predecessor despite over six years of experience in the role.
The salary of Jonathan Hill, the GFD, was not increased, given his departure from the Group on 6 March 2015.
An allowance of just over 3% of salary roll was provided for general staff increases.
Benefits will continue on the same basis as for 2014.
Bovis Homes Group PLC | 55 6% 4% 10% 7% 18% 13% m Annual remuneration report Remuneration report Approach to annual bonus Following the annual review, it was concluded that the annual bonus scheme continues to measure key elements of performance that are in line with the Companys stated strategy over the shorter term, but that the introduction of a measure for individual performance would enhance the executive directors focus on strategic priorities, to be assessed against defined individual attributes agreed by the Committee at the start of the year.
These attributes will be measurable and will be linked to the financial measures in a way that facilitates the delivery of the financial performance targets.
There is no change to quantum but weightings are amended to allow for a rebalancing of financial and non-financial metrics to 70%:30% as permitted by the approved remuneration policy.
The Committee has decided not to disclose the detail of performance targets in advance as they are considered commercially sensitive, being indicative performance indicators closely linked to the Groups growth strategy, but will disclose them retrospectively in the 2015 Annual Remuneration Report.
The 2015 performance measures are described below.
Measure Rationale link to strategy % weighting Financial measures 70% Profit before tax Explicitly ties reward to financial performance.
40% Challenges management to deliver and out-perform profit target.

Performance conditions Total Shareholder Return one-third of total award The threshold target for maximum vesting of outperformance of the index by 10% per annum is historically equal to at least upper quartile performance, and is thus deemed appropriately stretching.
TSR will be calculated using a three month averaging period at the start and end of the period to smooth the impact of share price volatility on vesting.
Performance measurement Threshold performance Maximum performance TSR Equal to the median of the Index Median plus 10% per annum 56 | Annual report and accounts | Our governance Our governance Annual remuneration report Earnings per share one-third of total award The Committee adopted cumulative EPS targets for the 2015 awards.
When setting minimum and maximum absolute EPS targets for the 2015 awards, the Committee considered data providing visibility over the three year performance period, including internal forecasts and analysts forecasts, and set absolute minimum and maximum EPS targets of 320p and 400p per share to be measured on a cumulative basis over the three year performance period.
Where EPS falls below the minimum, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS can be realised.
Performance measurement Threshold performance Maximum performance EPS Cumulative EPS of 320p Cumulative EPS of 400p Return on Capital Employed one-third of total award When setting minimum and maximum absolute ROCE targets for the 2015 awards, the Committee again considered data providing visibility over the three year performance period, including internal forecasts and analysts forecasts.
The Committee set absolute minimum and maximum ROCE targets for the 2015 awards of 19.4% and 23.3%, to be measured in the third year of the performance period 2017.
