Governance Directors Remuneration report Annual statement Dear shareholder, It is my pleasure to present the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Remuneration overview In 2014, the Remuneration Committees membership, remit and role were unchanged compared to 2013 and we continued to apply our remuneration policy, as approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in May 2014.
Remuneration policy We operate a remuneration structure comprising base salary and benefits, a bonus plan and a long-term incentive plan, which provides a clear link between pay and strategic priorities.
We believe that the policy as a whole is well aligned to the current business strategy and the outcomes reflect business performance.
Activities of the Committee Ruth Cairnie The Committees main regular activities during 2014 were as follows: Chairman of the Remuneration Committee we reviewed the performance of the Group for the year, and the performance of the Executive Directors to determine bonus outcomes for 2014 Remuneration Committee Membership: we approved share awards for 2014 Ruth Cairnie Chairman we set base salaries and established the Executive Directors Chris Girling bonus arrangements for 2015 Paul Withers we reviewed the Directors remuneration report we considered remuneration market trends and corporate Key objective governance developments.

to help us to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre executives to manage the business and deliver against our strategy, ensuring the long-term success of the company 48 Keller Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Remuneration for 2015 The base salaries of James Hind and Wolfgang Sondermann were increased by 3%, to 340,337 and 355,402 respectively, with effect from 1January 2015, in line with general pay increases of 3% awarded across the Group.
As reported by the Chairman in his Corporate Governance report, an external search is underway for a successor to the CEO at Keller.
Justin Atkinson will continue to be employed by the Company until 31December 2015.
Justin will continue to receive his normal base salary and benefits during his employment but his bonus for 2015 will be pro-rated to the date he steps down as CEO and he will not be eligible for a share award in 2015.
The financial arrangements relating to Justins retirement will be consistent with the remuneration policy and will be disclosed once his employment ceases.
The Committee has set Justins base salary at 477,400 with effect from 1January 2015, an increase of 2% reflecting general inflation.
During 2015, Wolfgang Sondermann will reach retirement age and he will, therefore, not receive a share award.
The Committee considered the impact of the 2015 retirements of Justin and Wolfgang and, given the exceptional circumstances, decided it was appropriate to use its discretion under the remuneration policy to award James Hind shares in the amount of 200% of salary.

Notes to the policy table Performance measure selection and approach to target setting The measures used under the annual bonus plan are selected annually to reflect the Groups plans for the year and reflect both financial and non-financial priorities.
Performance targets are set annually to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular strategic priorities and economic environment in a given year.
The Committee believes that EPS and TSR continue to be appropriate measures of long-term performance for Keller.
EPS provides a link to long-term financial performance and is highly visible internally, while TSR provides strong alignment with shareholder interests.
EPS targets will be reviewed and confirmed prior to each grant, taking account of analyst estimates, historical performance and EPS performance ranges used at other FTSE250 companies.
The TSR target for full vesting has been determined on the basis of an historical analysis of the median to upper quartile spread and is in line with typical market practice for a company of Kellers size.
The Committee retains discretion to adjust this target for future awards should circumstances change.
If an event occurs which causes the Committee to consider that an outstanding PSP Award or bonus would not achieve its original purpose without alteration, the Committee has discretion to amend the targets, provided the new conditions are materially no less challenging than when originally imposed.
Such discretion could be used to adjust appropriately for the impact of material acquisitions or disposals, or for exceptional and unforeseen events outside the control of the management team.
The application of any such discretion would have regard to the Committees practice of ensuring the stability of measures and targets throughout the business cycle.
Shareholding guidelines To reflect the importance the Committee places on aligning their interests with shareholders, Executive Directors are required to hold shares with a value equivalent to 100% of salary.
Executive Directors are required to retain 50% net of tax of shares acquired on vesting of share Awards until the required holding is attained.
Awards under previous remuneration policies Any awards or remuneration-related commitments made to Directors under previous remuneration policies will continue to be honoured.

Recruitment remuneration arrangements In the case of appointing a new Executive Director from outside the Company, the Remuneration Committee will seek to align the remuneration package with our remuneration policy, which may include elements outlined in the policy table above.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both Keller and its shareholders and will seek not to pay more than is necessary for this purpose.
The Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer on a like-for-like basis, which may be awarded in addition to the remuneration structure outlined in the table above.
In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met.
The Committee may also rely on exemption 9.4.
2 of the Listing Rules to facilitate such a buy out if required.
Internal promotions to the Board In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Remuneration Committee will apply the policy consistently as for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to Executive Director level, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements.
Incentive opportunities for below Board level employees are typically no higher than Executive Directors, but measures may vary.
Non-executive Director recruitment In recruiting a new Non-executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will utilise the policy as set out in the table above.
All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement, the dates of which are set out below.

52 Keller Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Service contracts and exit payment policy In accordance with general market practice, it is the Companys policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one years notice.
Service contracts between the Company or other companies in the Group and individuals who served as Executive Directors at any time during the year are summarised below.
Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.

When considering exit payments, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and participants.
The table below summarises how the Awards under the annual bonus and PSP arrangements are typically treated in specific circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the Committees discretion: Event Timing of vesting Calculation of vesting payment Annual bonus Resignation Awards lapse Not applicable 1 Good leaver, Death, On termination A pro-rata bonus may become payable for the period up to the termination date.

If employment is terminated by the Company, the departing Executive Director may have a legal entitlement under statute or otherwise to additional amounts, which would need to be met.
In addition, the Committee retains discretion to settle any other amounts reasonably due to the Executive Director, for example to meet the legal fees incurred by the Executive Director in connection with the termination of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement and the individual must seek independent legal advice.
In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing Executive Directors including but not limited to settlement, confidentiality, restrictive covenants and or consultancy arrangements.
These will be used sparingly and only entered into where the Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so.
Terms and conditions for Non-executive Directors The appointment of Non-executive Directors is for a fixed term of three years, during which period the appointment may be terminated by either party on three months notice.
There are no provisions on payment for early termination in letters of appointment.
The letters of appointment of Non-executive Directors and service contracts of executives are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal hours and will be available at the Annual General Meeting.

54 Keller Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Incentive outcomes for the year ended 31December 2014 Annual bonus in respect of 2014 performance Under the 2014 annual bonus plan, the Executive Directors delivered strongly on both financial targets and their own personal targets, of which Justin Atkinson had six and James Hind and Wolfgang Sondermann each had five.
Notably, on the personal objectives, Justin put in place an executive development programme for the Group, to support talent development and succession planning: James reviewed and refinanced the Groups main debt facilities, at improved rates: and Wolfgang continued to lead improvements in the Groups bid appraisal process, to reduce the risk from underperforming contracts.
However, PBT and EPS elements of the financial targets in the annual bonus plan are set after exceptional items and performance was thus impacted by the exceptional charge detailed in Note 7 of the Annual Accounts.
This led to the payment potential of the PBT and EPS elements being reduced to zero and, under the rules of the plan, reduced the payment potential against personal strategic objectives from 30% to 15% for Justin, James and Wolfgang.
Leading safety targets were met by each of the Executive Directors: however, the Committee exercised its discretion to reduce the pay-outs under that target in recognition of a fatality in the business during the year.
The overall outcome is an annual bonus pay-out for Executive Directors of between 30 and 33% for 2014.
Without the exceptional charge, annual bonus pay-outs would have been in the range of 78 and 82%.
The Committee did not exercise any discretion in relation to the financial performance targets.
