The corresponding values shown in the 2013 report prior to the actual vesting were an estimate and calculated using a share price as at 31 December 2013 of 2,013p.

The amount shown 2.958m is the gross cash payment 9.405m less amounts previously disclosed 6.447m.
It is included here but is not shown in the illustrative bar chart above as it was a one-off payment and was in respect of benefits already accrued.
4 Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson was appointed to the Board as Chief Financial Officer effective as of 1 January 2014.
5 Kirk Kinsell was paid in US dollars and the sterling equivalents were calculated using an exchange rate of $1 0.61.
In accordance with the APP rules, Mr Kinsell will receive only the 50% cash portion of his 2014 APP award, as shown here.
6 As a result of Tom Singers resignation from IHG with effect from 1 January 2014, he only received the 50% cash portion of the 2013 APP award and will not receive a 2014 APP award.
Following Mr Singers resignation, the Remuneration Committee determined that the 2011 13 LTIP award would vest without pro-ration in line with the terms of the LTIP Plan rules, as the performance period for this award would be completed by his departure date.
This award was released on the normal vesting date and only to the extent the performance conditions were met.
Mr Singers salary for 2014 was in respect of one day, 1 January 2014, after which his resignation took effect.
82 GROUP PARENT COMPANY ADDITIONAL STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INFORMATION Notes to single total figure of remuneration Executive Directors audited information Kirk Kinsell remuneration arrangements on departure Kirk Kinsell left the Board and his role as President, The Americas effective as of 13 February 2015.
The Remuneration Committee determined that Mr Kinsell would be treated as a Good Leaver for the purposes of the LTIP awards, in line with the DR Policy on termination of employment.
He therefore retained all outstanding LTIP awards which will vest on the normal vesting dates, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, with the awards pro-rated to his leaving date.
Mr Kinsell also received the cash portion of his 2014 APP award and the deferred share portion of his 2011 APP on the normal vesting date.
Outstanding deferred awards under the 2012 and 2013 APPs lapsed, and no APP award will be made in respect of 2015.
The Remuneration Committee has reserved the right to determine that, prior to the vesting of shares under each outstanding LTIP cycle, Mr Kinsells entitlement to shares under the LTIP will be forfeited in full if Mr Kinsell commits a breach of his continuing post-termination contractual obligations.
The relevant figures will be included in next years report.
Fixed pay Salary: salary paid for the year for Kirk Kinsell, who was paid in US dollars, this shows actual salary paid converted into sterling.
Benefits: this includes taxable benefits such as company car, healthcare, life cover and other taxable benefits.
Provision during 2014 was in line with previous years and the approved DR Policy, and no exceptional benefits were paid.
Variable Pay 2014 APP The weighting, measures and targets relating to the APP are determined by the Committee, on an annual basis, in line with our strategic objectives.
A combination of global and regional targets were used in 2014.
Executive Directors with only global roles were subject to global measures.
Kirk Kinsell was subject to partly regional measures, reflecting his regional role as President, The Americas.
The measures for 2014 were determined in accordance with the DR Policy and were as follows: Guest satisfaction as measured by the Guest HeartBeat score: year-on-year improvement: Employee Engagement survey score: year-on-year improvement: and EBIT achievement against target corporate and regional.
Why do we use these measures?
Guest HeartBeat score Employee Engagement survey score EBIT vs target Guest HeartBeat is part of the guest We measure employee engagement EBIT is a key measure of business satisfaction survey.

at global and regional level.
Award levels relate to achievement against target under each of the measures.
The link between our strategy and the performance measures of the APP is explained in more detail on page 79.
Threshold, target and maximum opportunity are shown on the graph on page 84, along with actual achievement on a global basis and further detail.
The actual award level was determined on a straight-line basis between threshold and target, and target and maximum, and relates to achievement vs target under each measure: Threshold is the minimum level that must be achieved for there to be an award in relation to that measure: for achievement below this, no award is made.
Target is the target level of achievement and results in a target award for that measure 115% of salary.
Maximum is the level of achievement at which a maximum award for that measure is received 200% of salary.
Threshold award was subject to a global EBIT affordability gate such that: if global EBIT was below 85% of target, no award would be made: and if global EBIT was between 85% and 90% of target, half of any award relating to the Guest HeartBeat and or Employee Engagement survey measures would bemade.

For the Guest HeartBeat and Employee Engagement survey measures, the 2014 outcome scores are detailed on pages 31 and 32 of the Annual Report.
Detail on the financial targets set is not disclosed at this stage as it is, in the opinion of the Directors, commercially sensitive.
Disclosure would risk providing IHGs major competitors with an unfair commercial advantage as these companies are either unlisted or listed on a stock exchange other than the London Stock Exchange and, therefore, not subject to the same regulations.
During 2015, we will consider what further transparency we can provide to shareholders without disadvantaging the business.
2012 14 LTIP The performance measures for each three-year LTIP cycle are set by the Committee.
Awards are made annually and eligible executives will receive shares at the end of that cycle, subject to achievement of the performance measures.
The performance measures for the 2012 14 cycle were as follows and in line with the DR Policy: relative growth in net rooms over three years: relative like-for-like RevPAR growth over three years: and IHGs TSR relative to a global hotels index see page 89 for further details.
Growth in net rooms and RevPAR is measured on a relative basis against the comparator group, comprising the following major, globally branded competitors: Accor, Choice Hotels, Hilton Worldwide, Hyatt, Marriott International Inc. Starwood Hotels and Wyndham Worldwide.

balance between the quality of IHG hotels and the speed at which IHG grows.
In order to generate higher returns for our shareholders, we need to increase revenue share, improve operating efficiency and grow margins through increasing the number of rooms we have available to sell, as well as increasing RevPAR for those rooms.

2 In line with the DR Policy, the Remuneration Committee determined that Kirk Kinsell would retain his 2012 14 LTIP award in accordance with and subject to the terms of the LTIP Plan rules, as the performance period for this award was completed when Kirk Kinsell resigned effective as of 13 February 2015.
3 The Remuneration Committee determined that the 2012 14 LTIP award would vest in line with the terms of the LTIP Plan rules on a pro-rated basis for the proportion of the performance period in which Tom Singer remained in employment.
This award will be released on the normal vesting date and only to the extent the performance conditions were fulfilled.

Pensions Pension benefit: the value of Company contributions to pension plans and any cash allowances paid in lieu of pension contributions.
As published in the 2013 Annual Report, the Group commenced the phasing out of potential enhanced early retirement terms related to those defined benefit pensions in 2014 see page 87 for further details.
In addition, the planned cash out offer was made to the participants of the unfunded, unregistered, defined benefit top-up arrangement, ICETUS, which had previously provided the balance of any benefit accrual that was restricted in the tax-registered plan due to the annual or lifetime allowances.
Payments associated with the cash out were made in the financial year and are therefore disclosed appropriately in this years Annual Report.
For 2014, the pension benefits for Richard Solomons include the payment of a cash out value in respect of his accrued, unfunded ICETUS benefit.
Richard Solomons received a one-off gross cash payment of 9,405,362 in lieu of any future entitlement to ICETUS benefits.
An amount of 6,447,000 in respect of his ICETUS benefit was included as part of the disclosure of his total accrued benefits in the 2013 Directors Remuneration Report based on the HM Revenue & Customs methodology of valuing pensions at 20 times their annual amounts, hence only the balance in excess of this i. e. 2.958m is shown in the single figure table.
The actual payment was greater than 20 times the annual pension because the ICETUS benefit was valued using a more accurate actuarial calculation method, in line with that used for valuing the total ICETUS liabilities for accounting purposes.
Following the cash out, Richard Solomons has no future entitlement to any benefit from ICETUS.

Richard Solomons defined benefit pension accrual in both ICETUS and the IC Plan ceased on 30 June 2013 and the Trustee of the IC Plan subsequently entered into an insurance contract in August 2013 under which all defined benefit liabilities of the plan, plus the provision of increases to pensions which were previously only provided at the discretion of the Company, were fully insured known as a buy-in.
During 2014, arrangements were made to fully transfer the responsibility for the provision of benefits from the Trustee of the IC Plan to the insurance company, Rothesay Life.
This process known as a buy-out was completed on 31 October 2014.
Following the buy-out, Richard Solomons has no future benefit entitlement from the IC Plan and it is not considered necessary to make these disclosures in the future.
In last years Annual Report, we published the Boards plans to phase out the Companys Enhanced Early Retirement Facility EERF.
However, during the period over which it is phased out, Richard Solomons remains eligible to benefit from the EERF, albeit at a reduced level.
Under the EERF, executive participants of the defined benefit section of the IC Plan had an option, with the Companys agreement, to retire without reduction to their pension if they are within five years of their normal retirement date and to retire on improved early retirement terms before this.
As set out in the Remuneration Committee Chairmans 2013 Statement, the phasing out of this facility commenced on 1 March 2014.
As a result of the phasing out of the EERF, Mr Solomons could retire, with no reduction in his pension, from approximately age 58 and no earlier.
Prior to the phasing out, Richard Solomons was eligible to retire without reduction from age 55.
The terms of the EERF require an executive to obtain Company consent and would also require the payment by the Group of an additional insurance premium to secure the benefit entitlement for that executive.
Richard Solomons IC Plan pension, which formed part For 2014, Richard Solomons received a cash allowance of the buy-out, was as follows: in lieu of pension contributions.
The breakdown of the pension element of the single figure for 2013 and 2014 pa for Mr Solomons is as follows: Accrued annual pension at 1 January 2014, 2014 2013 assuming retirement at normal pension age 000 000 9 October 2021 71,950 Pension benefit under defined Accrued annual pension at 31 December 2014, 135 benefit section of IC Plan assuming retirement at normal age 1 9 October 2021 73,680 ICETUS cash-out 2,958 The increase in accrued pension represents the standard Cash allowance in lieu of pensioncontribution 228 111 inflation increase provided for deferred pensions in the IC Total 3,186 246 Plan rules.
