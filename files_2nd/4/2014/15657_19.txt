As described in the FY13 Remuneration report, this approach has beenamended for the 2013 PSP awards.
Group EBIT excludes exceptional items.
Cash conversion is defined as free cash flow post exceptional items, before capital expenditure EBITDA.
At the time the performance targets were set, the Committee considered that these were challenging.
The Companys share price when HarrietGreen joined on 30 July 2012 was 16.25p and in September 2012 when these share price targets were being set it remained around thesame level.
Therefore even the threshold target represented a significant increase.
Maximum achievement of the cash conversion target would represent achievement of our publicly stated FY15 target of 60% subsequently increased to 70%.
The Committee also considers the Group underlying EBIT targets to be stretching, however due to our ambitious plans for the business transformation we consider that these targets are commercially sensitive at this point.
We commit to disclosing the target range on a retrospective basis at the end of the performance period.
We have discussed this approach with our major shareholders, who are supportive.
