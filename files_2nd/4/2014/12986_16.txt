Directors report DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Committee activity during the year The key focus of the committee during the year has Remuneration committee been to ensure alignment of remuneration policy with the Groups business strategy and to ensure that the Companys remuneration policy will continue to be motivating, performance-related and retention-focused.
With this in mind the committee has embarked on a review of remuneration arrangements for the senior management team, in particular long-term incentive arrangements.
The committee is reviewing the suitability of the current plan and potential changes to the plan over the course of the year.
We will consult with shareholders regarding any new plan, or changes to the current plan, towards the end of the year.
Responsible gambling The committee gave consideration to whether it was appropriate to include measures tied to responsible gambling within the remuneration framework in light of shareholder feedback.
The Rank board rmly believes that responsible operation is a fundamental part of each employees day job and that to link a Chairman component of remuneration to responsible gambling measures Tim Scoble would detract from that principle.
Therefore, the committee and the board do not currently believe it appropriate to link Other Members aspects of Ranks executive remuneration to responsible Owen ODonnell, Shaa Wasmund gambling measures.

Policy Report by way of a binding vote and the Annual Remuneration Report by way of a non-binding advisory vote.
Tim Scoble, Chairman of the remuneration committee Performance outcome 13 August 2014 Rank experienced a challenging first half to the financial year and, although performance improved in the second half, the improvement was not sufficient to make up the lost ground in the first half.
Although revenue and operating profit have grown during the year, this was due to the contribution of the acquired casinos.
On a like-for-like basis, revenues declined during the year.
Against this backdrop, targets for bonus purposes were not achieved and therefore no annual cash bonuses have been awarded to the executive directors.
64 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 POLICY REPORT Remuneration and its components The committee reviews the Companys remuneration philosophy and structure each year to ensure that the remuneration framework remains effective in supporting the Companys strategic objectives and fairly rewards individuals for the contribution that they make to the business, having regard to the size and complexity of the Groups operations and the need to motivate and attract employees of the highest calibre.
The policy on remuneration of directors the Policy is set out on pages 65 to 70.
A binding resolution will be put to shareholders at the annual general meeting to approve the Policy which, if approved, will take effect immediately following the annual general meeting on 16 October 2014.
The performance of Rank is dependent upon the quality of its directors, senior executives and employees and therefore the Group seeks to attract, retain and motivate skilled directors and senior executives of the highest calibre, without paying more than is necessary.
In order to attract such individuals the committee needs to ensure that the remuneration packages properly reect an individuals duties and responsibilities, are appropriate and competitive, sensitive to pay elsewhere within the Group and directly linked to performance.
Committee approach to setting pay policy The committee intends that the base salary and total remuneration of executive directors should be in line with market median.
Remuneration is benchmarked against rewards available for equivalent roles in suitable comparator companies, with the aim of paying neither signicantly above nor below the median for each element of remuneration at par target performance levels.
The committee also considers general pay and employment conditions of all employees within the Group and is sensitive to these, to prevailing market and economic conditions and to governance trends when assessing the level of salaries and remuneration packages of executive directors and other members of the executive committee.
The total remuneration package links corporate and individual performance with an appropriate balance between shortand long-term elements, and xed and variable components.
The policy is designed to incentivise executives to meet the Companys key objectives, and so a significant proportion of total remuneration is performance-related.
The committee considers that the targets set for the different components of performance-related remuneration are both appropriate and sufciently demanding in the context of the business environment and the challenges facing the Group.
