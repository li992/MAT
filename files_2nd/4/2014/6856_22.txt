A description of how the company intends to implement the policy set out in this table for 2014 15 is set out in the annual report on remuneration on page 60.
The choice of performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflect the committees belief that the compensation should be appropriately stretching, butachievable, and tied to both the delivery of profit growth, key financial metrics and specific individual objectives.
The EPS performance condition underpinning the core LTIP award was selected by the committee on the basis that it would reward the delivery of long-term financial growth and is the most widely understood profit-based measure across the business.
ROCE was chosen as the performance condition to apply to the growth LTIP award as it will ensure that management focuses on generating the necessary returns in excess of the cost of capital and because it provides a more strategic measure of long-term performance, where capital needs to be re-deployed in order to focus on Retail.
The performance targets are set by the committee following a detailed review of the companys projections and are believed to be appropriately stretching.
T he policy and practice for the remuneration of employees generally differs from that for the executive directors as follows: A lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity or zero bonus opportunity may apply to employees other than the executive directors and certain senior executives and targets may differ by business unit and by employee.
Other employees may be receive fewer or lower levels of benefits than those for executive directors.
Company car benefits are only offered where required for the role or to meet market norms.
Pension contribution levels may be lower for employees generally compared with those for the executive directors.
Participation in the core LTIP is limited to the executive directors and around 40 senior managers.
Participation in the growth LTIP is limited to an even smaller senior management population.
Thesedifferences generally arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for various categories of employees.
They also reflect thefactthat, in the case of executive directors and senior executives, there is a greater emphasis on performance related pay.
Subject to the achievement of the applicable performance conditions, executive directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval andimplementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report.

The remuneration committee The remuneration committee is appointed by the board.
The members are Lynne Weedall chairman, John Brady, Mike Coupe appointed 29 April 2014 and Ian Durant.
All of the committee members are regarded by the board as independent non-executive directors.
The role of the committee, as set out in its terms of reference which are available on the companys website, includes determining the remuneration policy for the executive directors, the chairman and certain members of senior management.
It agrees total individual remuneration packages, considers the granting of awards under the long-term incentive plan and determines bonuses payable to the executive directors and certain senior executives.
It approves the service contracts of the executive directors and any compensation arrangements arising from their termination.
Thecommittee is made aware of, and takes into account, the salary levels of the wider senior management team and of the incentive arrangements operating throughout thecompany.
During the year there were three scheduled meetings of the committee.
Attendance atthese meetings is shown in the table onpage43.
Advisers to the remuneration committee The committee seeks advice on general remuneration matters and comparator information from New Bridge Street, a subsidiary of Aon plc.
Aon plc provides insurance broking and consultancy services to the group.
The committee is satisfied that the provision of these services does not in any way prejudice the position of New Bridge Street as independent advisers to the committee.
Fees paid during the year to New Bridge Street in respect of advice to the committee were 33k.
Rooney Anand, chief executive, attends meetings of the committee and provides advice to help the committee determine appropriate remuneration and incentive packages for the finance director and the other senior executives, but he leaves the meeting when his own remuneration is being discussed.
The chairman of the board also attends meetings of the committee.

This is no longer being operated.
In2013 14 Matthew Fearns bonus was pro-rated to cover the ten months of the year when he was working, prior to his current illness.
3 Long-term incentives in 2013 14 comprised the value of the awards granted in August 2011, which will vest in August 2014 and which were subject to performance targets measured over the three years to May 2014.
The value of the award has been calculated using 892p, being the average share price for the last quarter of the 2013 14 financial year, and also takes into account the dividend equivalent payable on the award.
100% vesting of the 2011 awards has been assumed.
For the long-term incentives in 2012 13 the actual share price on the date of the award has been used.
The original value of Rooney Anands 2011 awards which will vest in August 2014 was 684k.
The original value of the 2010 award which vested last year was 669k respectively.
The remaining value of the awards has resulted from the share price growth and dividend notes equivalent payments from which all shareholders have benefited.
Details of the elements included in the table above are as follows: Base salary The base salaries for 2013 14 for Rooney Anand and Matthew Fearn, on a 52 week basis, were 540,600 and 341,000 respectively.
Thebase fee for the chairman on a 52 week basis was 174,250.
The base fees for the non-executive directors on a 52 week basis were 44,100 for John Brady and Mike Coupe and 51,250 for Ian Durant and Lynne Weedall.
Taxable benefits Taxable benefits were provided to directors in line with the policy table set out on page 51.
Pension-related benefits Cash in lieu of pension contributions were in line with the policy table set out on page 51.
Annual bonus Executive directors may earn bonuses depending on the companys performance and their own individual performance.
Awards for the chief executive were based 90% on financial performance and 10% on individual performance, whilst for the group finance director the respective percentages were 72.5% on financial performance and 27.5% on individual performance.
For the chief executive, the financial performance measures were based on PBTE and free cash flow, whilst the group finance director had an additional financial target based on return on investments.
The committee has decided that disclosing specific short-term financial targets is inappropriate as it may give competitors an advantage if they were able to see our financial targets, although the 2013 14 targets will be disclosed in next years report.
Both PBTE and free cash flow are among the groups KPIs, details of which are on page 29.
The return on investment measure comprised the return on investments undertaken during the year on sites within Greene Kings core Retail estate.

2 The personal targets for Matthew Fearn included targets relating to corporate reputation and certain financial targets which have not been disclosed on grounds ofcommercial sensitivity.
Performance against the combined financial and individual targets resulted in bonuses being paid at 525k 97.1% of salary for the chief executive and at 257k 90.3% of salary pro-rated down to 75.2% for 10 months service prior to his current illness for the group finance director.
Long-term incentive plans The LTIP award granted on 4 August 2011 was based on a three-year performance period ended 4 May 2014.
A maximum of 60% of each award vests if an adjusted free cash flow target has been met and the remaining 40% vests if an EPS target has been met.
The target ranges, calculated on a straight-line basis from 0% to 100%, are set out below.

As explained in the single remuneration table above, a significant proportion of the estimated value of the LTIP award derives from the increase in the share price from which all shareholders have benefited.
2 The LTIP enables award holders to benefit from the payment of dividend equivalents but only to the extent that the underlying share awards vest.
