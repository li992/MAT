About Us 01 05 45 Strategic Report 06 35 Governance 36 69 Report of the Board on Accounts 70 98 Other Information 99 112 Directors Remuneration ANNUAL STATEMENT Dear shareholder, This is my second report under the new regulations for the reporting of directors remuneration, following early adoption last year.
This report, which has been prepared pursuant to, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013, has three sections this Annual Statement, the Directors Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Directors Remuneration Policy, which will be subject to a binding shareholder vote normally on a triennial basis, provides details of the remuneration policy for directors for 2014 15 onwards.
The Annual Report on Remuneration, which together with the Annual Statement will be subject to an annual advisory shareholder vote, details the remuneration of directors in respect of the financial year under review and how the policy will be operated for 2014 15 onwards.
Remuneration paid in 2013 14 The Committee considers that the remuneration paid to executive directors fairly reflects both Company and individual performance during the financial year.
As set out in last years report and reflecting the Committees policy to set salary levels, from appointment, significantly below market levels for quoted housebuilders but move them to mid-market over time, the Committee agreed to increase the basic salaries of the executive directors in two instalments to bring their salaries in line with those of their predecessors and peer companies.
The first instalment was made from 1 August 2013, and as explained below, the second instalment was made from 1 August 2014.
The basic salaries of the executive directors in 2013 14 were determined in July 2013 after consultation with shareholders and were set out in last years report.
Total remuneration was determined in large part by bonuses awarded for performance.
As set out on pages 22 to 25 of this report, the Group performed extremely strongly in the year as management took full advantage of favourable market conditions to increase sales, average selling price, margin, operating profit, dividend and NAV while maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Looking forward, the Group concluded the year with a record order book supported by a healthy increase in plots available with detailed planning permission.
Two additional operating divisions were opened and management changes were made to support future development.
Overall, operating performance substantially exceeded the expectation of the Board and investors at the start of the year.
This performance is reflected in the annual bonus earned by the executive directors.
The profit related element of the bonus required increases in operating profit but in the event the increase of 69.5% was above the top of the target range and this element of the bonus was earned in full.
In relation to the non-financial elements of the bonus the targets for land bank and health and safety were met, but the customer care score, while remaining high, fell just below the threshold for bonus payment.
As a result the directors earned a total bonus of 110% out of a maximum of 120% of salary.
In 2011, Ted Ayres had been granted an award of 35,689 shares under the Bellway p. l. c. 2004 Performance Share Plan.
The performance condition in relation to half of these shares was met in 2013 14 and these shares will vest on 24 October2014.
Keith Adey was not a director at the time of the grant and so was not granted any shares in 2011 underthis plan.
Implementation of the remuneration policy in 2014 15 The Committee has consulted with and taken into account the views of its major shareholders, the Association of British Insurers ABI and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.
ISS during the year on the proposed remuneration policy, in particular in relation to the salary increases for the executive directors, changes to the non-financial annual bonus performance measures and long-term incentive provision.
Under the direction of the executive directors, the Group has continued its strong performance during the year as described above.
As a result, as disclosed last year and as discussed with a number of the Companys major investors, the Committee has completed the second stage of base salary increases.
With effect from 1 August 2014, the Chief Executives salary was increased from 500,000 to 600,000 while the Finance Directors salary was increased from 285,000 to 350,000.
In reaching these decisions, the Company was mindful of the salary levels paid by competing housebuilders and was informed by a benchmarking analysis undertaken by the Committees advisers, New Bridge Street.
The Committee considers that the new base salaries now reflect market levels for quoted UK housebuilders and, as such, future increases to base salaries are normally expected to increase in line with the general workforce.
While the maximum annual bonus potential remains at 120% of salary, with 90% of salary based on operating profit and 30% ofsalary based on non-financial performance measures, the Committee has made some changes to the way the non-financial performance measures operate.
Therefore, for 2014 15 onwards, rather than placing 10% of salary each on land bank, health and safety and customer care targets, a greater emphasis will be placed on land bank management reflecting the importance of this metric in determining future profitability.
In addition, sliding scale targets have been introduced rather than the simple on off measures operated in prior years, and the approach to measuring health and safety and customer care has been refined.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 46 Governance Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued Finally, in response to feedback from a number of the Companys shareholders and in the interests of simplicity, 2014 will be the last year in which the Committee will grant awards under the Share Matching Plan SMP.
Performance Share Plan PSP award levels from 2015 onwards will be set at 130% of salary, with the increase reflecting the Committees estimate of the likely value of SMP awards forgone.
The Committee believes that this change will improve the alignment of executive remuneration with the interests of shareholders.
As the PSP permits the grant of awards to an individual in any year of up to 150% of salary, no amendments to the PSP rules are required.
In addition and consistent with emerging best practice in this area, a two-year minimum holding period will be introduced whereby executive directors will be expected to retain shares which vest under long-term incentive awards net of any shares required to be sold to settle the relevant taxes for a period of at least two years from vesting.
Conclusion The Committee has continued to consult with its major shareholders and advisory bodies over directors remuneration and considers that the remuneration policy it is asking shareholders to approve at this years AGM will reward directors appropriately for improvements in Company performance which are aligned with the Companys strategy of improving shareholder returns.
I am pleased to report that over 98% of our shareholders voted in favour of last years Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
At this years AGM on 12 December 2014 there will be two votes on directors remuneration.
The first will be a binding vote on the remuneration policy and the second will be an advisory vote on the Annual Statement and Annual Report on Remuneration.
Both votes will require a majority vote in favour to pass.
Further information on these resolutions is set out onpage 100.
Mike Toms Chairman of the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration 13 October 2014 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 About Us 01 05 47 Strategic Report 06 35 Governance 36 69 Accounts 70 98 Other Information 99 112 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY The remuneration policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code published in 2014, the views of the Companys major shareholders and the ABI IMA guidelines on remuneration.
Objectives of remuneration policy The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and motivate executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Group, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has a policy of paying a level of remuneration at around the mid-market level of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses, subject to experience and performance.
The Committee uses this comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising the relatively low number of direct housebuilding comparators, their differing size andthe risk of an upward ratchet effect with any peer-based analysis.
The structure of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance-related elements of remuneration annual bonus and long-term incentives constitute a significant proportion of an executives potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable if stretching performance targets are achieved.
The structure of the performance conditions for annual bonus and long-term incentives has been designed to provide a strong link to the Groups performance, namely a focus on maximising profit in a sustainable fashion and producing superior shareholder returns, thereby generating a strong alignment of interest between senior executives and shareholders.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group While the Company does not consult directly with employees when drawing up the executive remuneration policy, in determining the elements of remuneration for the executive directors the Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group as a whole, paying particular attention to the levels of basic pay increase awarded to the workforce generally.
Normally the salaries of the directors are increased in accordance with the general pay increase awarded to the workforce, and it is the intention of the Committee to revert to this practice now that the executive directors salaries have reached mid-market levels.
All employees, including the executive directors, can join the Groups savings related share option arrangements, have life assurance benefits, and a significant proportion of employees benefit from health insurance, a company car or car allowance.
Following the introduction of auto-enrolment during the year, all employees now have access to pension arrangements.
The Committee is apprised regularly of any significant policy changes for the workforce generally and management below Board level in particular.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee takes into account the views of shareholders.
When any significant changes are proposed to the remuneration policy, the Chairman of the Committee will consult with major shareholders in advance.
During 2013 14 the Committee consulted with major shareholders, the ABI and ISS on the proposed salary increases for the executive directors to bring them in line with their peers, the proposed changes to the non-financial annual bonus performance measures and long-term incentive provision going forward.

The executive directors may also participate in any all-employee plan operated by the Company up to prevailing HMRC limits.
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current orformer directors such as in connection with the unvested SMP awards and the final SMP award to be granted in 2014, notwithstanding that the SMP will not form part oftheCompanys policy going forward.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014 000 54 Governance Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION The Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration The Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration comprises Mike Toms Chairman, John Cuthbert, Paul Hampden Smith and Denise Jagger, who were members of the Committee throughout the year.
Peter Johnson was a member of the Committee until his retirement from the Board on 31 January 2014.
The Committee meets at least twice a year and during the year it met on four occasions.
Its duties are to review and recommend the basic salary, taxable benefits, terms and conditions of employment, including performance-related payments, long-term incentive plans and other benefits of the executive directors and the Chairman.
The Committee also reviews remuneration policies for senior management below Board level.
During the year, in addition to routine matters, the Committee dealt with, inter-alia: arrangements for the introduction of the new performance share plan: the remuneration packages in respect of the recently appointed executive directors: consideration of the new disclosure requirements for remuneration reports: recommendations regarding changes to the Companys Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all employees, and the replacement of an executive share option scheme which expires in 2015, with a similar scheme which may be used to reward employees below Board level.
The remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman is determined by the Committee within a framework set by the Board.
None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Groups website www.
During the year, the Group Company Secretary provided advice on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration.
The Committee also received independent external advice from New Bridge Street NBS, part of Aon plc.
NBS was appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other services to the Company other than to the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration.
NBS is also a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and abides by its Code of Conduct.
The Committee is satisfied that NBS is independent.
The total fee paid to NBS for advice to the Committees during the year was62,128.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors apart from the Chairman is determined by the Board Committee on NonExecutive Directors Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors.
It also receives advice from the Group Company Secretary and NBS.
IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2014 15 This section sets out how the Company has implemented the remuneration policy for the 2014 15 financial year.
Basic salaries The Chief Executive was appointed as a director in 2011, and as Chief Executive in 2013, and the Finance Director was appointed in 2012.
As disclosed in previous years reports, their starting salaries were lower than their predecessors and mid-market levels amongst peer housebuilding companies and the Committee stated its intention to raise these salaries in incremental stages to market levels, subject to satisfactory performance.
The first stage of these increases was put in place from 1 August 2013.
The Committee has carried out an independent review of executive directors salaries in peer housebuilding companies and following the continuing strong performance of both the business and each of the executives during the year, the Committee has decided that it is appropriate to award the second and final instalment to bring the executives salaries to market levels.
Accordingly, from 1 August 2014, the Chief Executives salary was increased to 600,000 p. a. and the Finance Directors salary was increased to 350,000 p. a. Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 About Us 01 05 55 Strategic Report 06 35 Governance 36 69 Accounts 70 98 Other Information 99 112 Annual bonus For the 2014 15 financial year the bonus opportunity will continue to be limited to 120% of basic salary.
The performance conditions relate to a stretching target of pre-exceptional operating profit 90% and non-financial performance 30%, with non-financial performance being assessed by reference to land bank management 15%, health and safety 7.5% and customer care 7.5%.
The Committee considers that performance in relation to targets based on annual profitability and non-financial metrics provide a good link to the long-term performance of the business and that the split between financial and non-financial performance targets provides an appropriate balance between long and short-term shareholder returns.
The non-financial measures have been changed from previous years, both in relation to their proportions previously each non-financial measure equated to 10% of the bonus opportunity and different assessment performance criteria will be used to assess performance for health and safety and customer care.
For health and safety, the Committee has decided to move from a seven-day lost time accident measure to the NHBC safety score which is an independent measure based on regular inspections of each site.
The customer care element will be measured by taking the proportion of unsatisfied customers from those which are satisfied, to produce a net assessment of customer satisfaction score indifferent customers are ignored for the purposes of the calculation.
For each non-financial element, rather than the binary on off targets operated in prior years, sliding scale targets have been introduced, whereby a proportion of the bonus will be payable if a base threshold is achieved, with further bonus paid on a sliding scale for improvements in performance up to the maximum bonus opportunity.
In the event that the threshold profit criterion is not met, no bonus will be payable under the non-financial elements.
Long-term incentives It is envisaged that the Company will grant awards under the PSP in November 2014 with a face value of 100% of salary to the executive directors.
In addition, the executives may invest up to 25% of their net 2013 14 annual bonus into the SMP for a period of three years, in return for which they will receive a match of up to two times the level of investment on a gross of tax basis.
The 2014 15 PSP awards and any SMP awards will vest to executives after three years, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, based around TSR, which measures the total return on a notional investment in Bellway shares, compared to the return on the same notional investment in shares in a group of other companies or an index.
This will be the last time that the Company invites management to participate in the SMP.
Consistent with last year, the PSP and SMP awards granted in 2014 15 will be subject to a relative TSR condition with 50% of awards measured against a group of housebuilders and the other 50% against the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts and financial services sector companies.
From 2015 16 onwards, reflecting the likely value of the SMP awards forgone, PSP awards for executive directors will be set at 130% of salary previously PSP awards were limited to 100% of salary with the ability to earn up to a further 60% of salary under the SMP.
Awards will vest subject to the achievement of an underpin which requires an improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company over the performance period.
In addition to the above, the Committee has decided that for future PSP and any 2014 SMP awards, it will introduce a two-year minimum holding period for any shares which vest after allowing for tax.
This will increase the alignment of directors interests with the longer-term interests of shareholders.
Chairman and non-executive director fees Following a review of time commitment and relevant market data, the Chairmans fee was increased from 185,000 to 195,000 p. a. with effect from 1 August 2014.
For 2014 15, the base fee for non-executive directors will increase by 3% from 51,500 to 53,045.
This is in line with the average pay awards for the workforce generally.
The fees for chairing the Audit Committee and the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration will also increase by 3% from 5,000 to 5,150.
Reflecting the responsibilities of the role and relevant market data, the additional fee for the senior independent non-executive director is to increase from 5,000 to 7,725.

Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 About Us 01 05 57 Strategic Report 06 35 Governance 36 69 Accounts 70 98 Other Information 99 112 Annual bonus for the year ended 31 July 2014 The annual bonus is payable in November 2014 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2014.
The performance conditions for the 2013 14 bonus were operating profit pre-exceptional items 90% and non-financial performance 30%, with non-financial performance being assessed by reference to land bank management, health and safety and customer care.
Each of these elements accounted for a maximum bonus of 10% of salary.
The actual bonus payment against operating profit was determined on the following basis: Measure Weighting Threshold Target Maximum Actual Payout Payout % of salary value % of % of salary maximum Operating profit 90% 170.0 185.0 195.0 256.1 100% 90% million million million million As can be seen from this table, the actual operating profit exceeded the top of the range set by the Committee at the start of the year.
This was the result of both a favourable business environment and of the success of the management in exploiting this environment by acquiring land and constructing and selling more homes at higher prices.
The three non-financial metrics were not determined on a range of targets but related to specific individual performance targets for each.
Details are set out in the table below: Non-financial measure Objectives Score Land bank Increase in the forward land bank of plots with detailed planning Maximum 10% of salary permission in the year to 31 July 2014 to ensure the Groups revenue aspirations are not frustrated by land shortages in future years.
The Group exceeded its land bank target for the following Achieved 10% of salary financial year.
Health and safety Improvement in performance by reference to the rate of over Maximum 10% of salary seven-day lost time accidents, taking account of the volume of activity.
The Group reduced its rate of over seven-day lost time accidents Achieved 10% of salary per 100,000 employees to 447.09 from 486.51 in 2013.
Customer care Improvement in the Groups performance, taking account Maximum 10% of salary of the results of the Companys survey of buyers satisfaction Would you recommend a Bellway home?
The Group experienced a slight reduction in its customer care Not achieved no payment score to 93.8% from 94.8% in 2013.
The land bank and health and safety targets were achieved and the full bonus was payable in relation to both these elements.
If the targets had not been achieved then no bonus would have been payable.
In the case of health and safety, no bonus would have been payable if a work related fatality had occurred on one of the Groups sites.
The customer care performance score remained very high but the target was missed, albeit by a small margin, so no bonus was payable in respect of this element.
Overall, the Committee is satisfied that the resulting bonus payout of 110% of salary out of 120% is reflective of the Companysstrong performance during the year.
Long-term incentives vesting in respect of performance period ended 31 July 2014 The PSP award granted on 24 October 2011 which will partially vest on 24 October 2014, was based on the three-year performance period to 31 July 2014.

The performance period is 1 August 2012 31 July 2015.
On 18 December 2013 awards of performance shares under the 2013 PSP were made to Ted Ayres and Keith Adey.
The awards were in the form of nil cost options.
The face value of awards granted were equal to 100% of their respective salaries, which is in line with the Committees prevailing grant policy.
Ted Ayres was granted an award over 34,506 shares with a face value, on grant, of 500,000 and Keith Adeys award was over 19,668 shares with a face value, on grant, of 285,000.

The awards are subject to a TSR performance condition, which is in two parts.
Half is measured by reference to Bellways TSR against the TSR of UK housebuilders.
If Bellways TSR matches the median of the housebuilder group, 25% of this part of an award vests.
Full vesting for this part of an award would be achieved for 22.5% outperformance of the median.
The housebuilder group is comprised of Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Crest Nicholson Holdings plc, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc.
The other half is measured by reference to the companies in the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial services.
Awards start to vest at 25% for this part of an award if Bellways TSR matches the median of the companies in the Index, increasing on a straight-line basis so that full vesting would be achieved if Bellways TSR reaches the upper quartile.
Furthermore, no part of either element of this award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been an improvement in underlying financial performance, taking into account, inter alia, operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and NAV.
These awards are also subject to clawback provisions.
The performance conditions for previous awards are summarised below: a For the awards made on 21 October 2010, the performance criteria were not achieved.
b For the awards made on 24 October 2011 and 13 November 2012, the TSR performance condition was in two parts.
Half was measured by reference to the Housebuilders Index as above excluding Crest Nicholson Holdings plc which was re-listed in February 2013.
If Bellways TSR matches that of the Housebuilders Index excluding Crest Nicholson Holdings plc, 25% of the award vests.
Full vesting would be achieved for 7.5% per annum outperformance of the Housebuilders Index.
The other half was measured by reference to the companies in the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial services as above.
Awards start to vest at 25% if Bellways TSR matches the median of the companies in the group, increasing on a straight-line basis so that full vesting would be achieved if Bellways TSR reaches the upper quartile.
Regardless of TSR performance, no part of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR over the performance period is reflective of underlying financial performance, taking into account, inter alia, operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and NAV.

Full vesting occurs where actual PBT reaches the forecast PBT, within a 10% range, in each of the three financial years of the performance period, with one-third vesting if the target was met in only one year and two-thirds vesting if the target was met in two of the three years.
If the target was not reached in any of the three years then the total award would lapse.
