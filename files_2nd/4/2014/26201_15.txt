com The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. 34 Remuneration report continued Part 2 Remuneration policy The policy that shareholders approved at the 2014 AGM is as set out below.
It became effective on 9 April 2014 and will be in place for three years unless amendments are required, in which case shareholder advance approval will be sought.
The policy is predicated on the assumption that there will be only one executive director of the Corporation the Executive Director in post at any given time.
At the moment this is the Managing Director, Caroline Banszky.
Should the board decide to increase the number of Executive Directors, other than for short periods to enable smooth succession, then the policy will be re-examined and if necessary, re-submitted to shareholders for approval.
The policy applies to UK directors of the Corporation and senior staff employed in its subsidiaries and will be applied also to directors and senior staff of non-UK subsidiaries subject to local legal obligations.
Executive Directors and senior staff The major components of Law Debentures remuneration package for the Executive Directors and senior staff will be as set out in the table below Table 2A.
Component Commentary Basic salary Set at levels consistent with individual performance and market rates applicable to positions of similar complexity and responsibility as measured annually by an independent remuneration consultant, but ordinarily subject to a cap for the Executive Director of increasing by no more than inflation or by that amount awarded to the rest of the workforce.
Benefits package Consists of private medical insurance, life insurance cover, disability income plan, season ticket loan and professional subscriptions.
The remuneration committee may award nonpensionable cash payments in lieu of one or more of these benefits.
Such payments will be capped at the equivalent gross amount that it would have cost to provide the benefit being foregone.
Private medical insurance All staff including the Executive Director are entitled to receive private health scheme membership for themselves family cover and any other extensions require contribution by the executive.
Life insurance cover Life insurance cover is provided to all members of the pension scheme and to those staff, including the Executive Director, who are not members of the pension scheme.
The cover provides for a payment of up to 6 times salary in the event of death in service.
Disability Income Plan A standard benefit for all staff, including the Executive Director, whereby subject to the length of service conditions, 75% of salary continues to be paid after 26 weeks absence through illness.
Season ticket loan Season ticket loans are available to all staff including the Executive Director.
The loans are interest free, repayable from monthly salary.
The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. www.
com 35 Component Commentary Benefits package continued Professional subscriptions One professional subscription will be paid for an Executive Director and all other members of UK staff if it can be demonstrated that the professional membership is relevant to the Executive Directors role.
Pension arrangements A funded contributory, HMRC approved, final salary occupational pension scheme.
Benefits accrue at 1 80ths with a salary cap linked to increases in RPI which is set from 1 January each year for accrual purposes the figure from 1 January 2015 will be 47,586 2014: 46,516.
Any employee earning more than the cap benefits from a cash sum paid to a separate money purchase scheme.
A non-pensionable cash payment may be payable in the form of a pension allowance for value up to 15% of basic salary if an individual is not or does not become a member of the pension scheme.
The pension allowance is adjusted to reflect the cost of employers NI to the group.
The remuneration committee reserves the right to close the scheme completely, or close it to new entrants, and or to negotiate amendments to the scheme if it is deemed in the best interests of shareholders to do so.
Bonus arrangements Employees are eligible for the following annual bonuses which are discretionary, not contractual, and subject to performance.
a A general discretionary bonus payable to all UK IFS employees other than the Executive Director.
This general bonus, which will be between 5-15% of salary, is dependent on the IFS profits in a given year being at least 80% of the IFS profits measured against a rolling average of the three prior years performance.
b Individual performance related discretionary bonus payable to middle and senior management including the Executive Director as a part of their overall remuneration package, a portion of which will be deferred.
No discretionary bonuses are payable unless IFS profits in a given year are at least 80% of the IFS profits measured against a rolling average of the three prior years performance.
c One off performance related bonuses may be paid to any employee not entitled to a discretionary performance related bonus to reflect outstanding performance.
com The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. 36 Remuneration report continued Component Commentary Bonus arrangements continued Calculation of amount available for distribution The Executive Director and staff eligible for the discretionary performance related bonus will receive awards based on the profits of the IFS in the year under review, with the total pool distributable being calculated by reference to performance against the rolling average of IFS profits for the last three reported years.
All relevant figures will be subject to audit and disclosed in the annual report and financial statements.
This calculation basis enables smoothing out of any exceptional items, as can happen with the nature of the IFS businesses.
The formula for establishing how much profit will be distributable as bonuses is as follows: Performance achieved as percentage Pool amount percentage of IFS profit of three year rolling average made in the year under review 79.99 or lower 0 80 - 99.99 15 - 18.99 100 - 119.9 19 - 21.99 120 and above 22 - 25 Once the committee has established the total bonus pool for distribution, it will determine an award payable to the Executive Director taking into account the performance measures set out below.
The first 11% of the total bonus pool will be available for this purpose.
Other than for outstanding performance when an award up to 100% of basic salary may be made, it is expected that the Executive Directors bonus will normally be between 0 and 75% of basic salary.
Should the 11% set aside prove to be insufficient to make an award up to 75% of basic salary, or should the committee decide that the Executive Directors performance has been outstanding and warrants a payment higher than 75% of salary, then the committee may resolve to draw such further amounts as necessary from the IFS profits to make that higher award.
On the other hand, should the committee decide not to utilise the full amount set aside in this manner, then any surplus from the 11% set aside after the committee has finalised the sum payable to the Executive Director will be released back to the shareholders.
The remaining 89% of the bonus pool will be distributed firstly, to fund the general bonus and secondly, to those individuals entitled to receive a discretionary performance related bonus award.
For the purpose of this policy, profit is deemed to be the reported amount of IFS profit before tax and bonus.
com 37 Component Commentary Bonus arrangements continued The total bonus pool will be used to pay any employers NI due on awards made.
Basis of distribution of individual discretionary awards performance measures Individual awards will be made to the Executive Director dependent on whether performance has been assessed as satisfactory, good, excellent, or outstanding.
Awards will be made in the following ranges: Performance Bonus as % of basic salary Not adequate 0 Satisfactory 0-25 Good 25-50 Excellent 50-75 Outstanding 75-100 Where performance is deemed to be not adequate, no discretionary bonus is payable even if the IFS profits have been sufficient to generate a bonus pool.
Performance awards for senior staff will also be assessed on similar parameters: more junior staff who are entitled to a discretionary award will receive graduated percentages between 0 and 50% of basic salary.
Awards above 75% of basic salary will only be made in exceptional circumstances.
75% is thus the effective cap, but recognising that outstanding performance may warrant a higher award in some circumstances.
Performance is measured against certain KPIs: an individuals personal performance including performance against targets set annually both financial and non-financial : revenue performance of an individuals department against budget and or prior year or for the Executive Director or employees in non-fee earning departments, the performance of the IFS as a whole : percentage change in profit of an individuals department over the years and or prior year budget or for the Executive Director or employees in a non-fee earning department, the performance of the IFS profits as a whole : and delivery of costs against budget.
com The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. 38 Remuneration report continued Component Commentary Bonus arrangements continued In addition, for the Executive Director, the committee will take into account performance that is non-financial and not specific to a particular year or a particular strategic target such as acquisition and disposal policy, exceptional events, etc and will assess any factors relating to the performance of the investment trust portfolio that may be deemed relevant.
It is not the intention to state publicly what the financial targets will be.
Given that performance is in respect of the IFS businesses, financial targets are commercially sensitive and could, if published, compromise our competitiveness.
This will be kept under review.
Deferred element All UK recipients of a discretionary bonus will have between one third and one half of the bonus withheld for three years under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The remuneration committee will decide the percentage to be withheld on a case by case basis.
Shares will be purchased in the open market up to the amount of an individuals bonus to be withheld.
The shares will be held on trust for the withholding period, to be released to the individual on the third anniversary of grant or earlier if good leaver provisions apply.
The individual must pay PAYE and NI before the shares are released, otherwise they are forfeited.
Entitlement to deferred shares will be lost if the individual gives notice to resign, or is put on notice of termination for cause, before the award release date.
Dividend rights and voting rights on shares held pending release will be waived.
Clawback and malus The following rules apply: i clawback there is a requirement on the Executive Director to pay back an amount already received under the bonus arrangements if: a the IFS profits turn out to have been overstated at the time a payment or share award was made: or b it is later discovered that the Executive Director was in breach of contract at the time a payment or share award was made.
ii malus is the forfeit of all or part of a bonus share award before it has vested and been paid.
Any cash award determined but not yet paid, or any deferred shares awarded but not yet vested, may be reduced or taken away altogether if the circumstances described under clawback above are discovered to be the case before vesting or payment.
com 39 Component Commentary Long term incentive plans No long term incentive plans exist and the committee has no intention of introducing such a plan whilst this policy remains in place.
Schemes available Eligible staff are able to join a Save As You Earn Share Save Plan SAYE and or a Share Incentive Plan SIP.
Both plans are HMRC approved.
The committee intends to maintain these schemes and operate them in accordance with scheme rules and HMRC Regulations.
Both schemes require employees to contribute their own money and participation is open to all UK employees.
While offering employees some tax advantages, the Schemes have a negligible operating cost and are deemed to be a key part of the Corporations ability to recruit and retain staff.
Under the SAYE, the Executive Director and all UK members of staff may make monthly savings in aggregate up to HMRC limits currently 500 per month direct from post-tax pay with a guaranteed tax free return after five years.
On joining the scheme, savers are given an option to acquire shares in the Corporation at the end of the five year saving period, at a price fixed at the beginning of the saving period.
This will be the market price of the shares on the invitation date or the latest published NAV, whichever is higher.
At the end of the five year saving period, participants may choose to apply the amount saved to exercise the options over the shares notified at the outset of the saving period, or they may choose to relinquish their options in favour of receiving a cash repayment of all of their contribution plus a bonus as specified by HMRC current HMRC rules do not permit a bonus.
The SIP enables participants all the UK employees to sacrifice up to the HMRC limit currently 5,400 of their pre-tax cash bonus to buy the Corporations shares at current market price.
These are held by a trustee and released tax free after five years.
Any earlier release is subject to PAYE and NI.
Participants receive dividend and voting rights on shares held in the SIP during the five year trust period.

The fees are reviewed by the board on advice from the Executive Director, who from time to time undertakes comparative studies using an independent remuneration consultant to ensure that the non-executive fee levels are consistent with the marketplace.
Fees will only be increased in line with inflation unless the recommendation from the external consultant justifies consideration of a higher award.
