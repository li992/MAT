GOVERNANCE Directors remuneration report Dear Shareholder I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for supporting our remuneration policy, which was approved by 98% of shareholder votes at last years AGM.
Since then, we have not made any significant changes to our remuneration arrangements and continue to take a disciplined approach to execution to ensure that our remuneration framework rewards the right behaviours and supports the strategic goals of GKN.
PROFESSOR RICHARD PARRY-JONES CBE Chairman of the Remuneration Committee We note the emphasis in the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code on designing pay schemes that promote the long term success of the Group.
This is in line with our approach to reward.
GKN is a long term business, with automotive platforms often lasting for seven years or more and aerospace platforms frequently lasting for more than twenty years.
This is why in 2012 we were one of the first industrial companies to introduce a significant five year element into our long term incentive scheme.
The other elements of our incentives arrangements are also carefully designed to align with our strategy and risks, as described below.
Incentive scheme Link to strategy and risk Our Short Term Variable Remuneration Scheme STVRS is designed to incentivise the achievement of short Annual bonus term financial and strategic initiatives which are required to deliver the long term strategy.
scheme STVRS As described on page 9, we aim to achieve a balanced approach between growth, margin and return on invested capital ROIC, resulting in increased cash flow.
The STVRS financial targets are designed to reward the achievement of these measures.
We set challenging targets, whilst seeking to avoid excessive risk taking.
The STVRS strategic measures are designed to reward the achievement of key strategic goals that will help deliver the broader Group and divisional strategies and address key risks.
The 2014 strategic measures were tailored to Group and divisional strategies but there were some common themes as set out below: Strategic goal Link to strategic objective Link to principal risk New business wins Leading in chosen markets Highly competitive markets Development of technology Technology driving margin Technology and innovation Implementation of our Voice of the Operational excellence Product quality Customer initiative We ensure that the strategic goals are specific, measurable and fairly assessed.
Any STVRS payment that exceeds 65% of salary is deferred into shares for a two year deferral period.
Awards Deferred bonus will generally lapse on resignation.
This aids retention as well as aligning executives interests with those of plan DBP our shareholders.
As described on page 9, our strategy aims to increase earnings per share EPS on a sustainable basis.
The Long term Sustainable Earnings Plan SEP incentivises executives to sustain EPS growth over the medium to long term.
incentive Performance is measured over three and five years.
Whilst we want to encourage earnings growth, we do not plan SEP want to drive the wrong behaviour.
We therefore consider the quality of earnings before we approve the vesting of each SEP award.
As with the DBP, the structure of the SEP is designed to aid the retention of executives, recognising that the appointment and retention of key executives continues to be crucial to the Groups achievement of its strategic objectives.
78 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Performance and STVRS outcome for 2014 As described in the strategic report, GKN made good progress in 2014 despite some difficult trading conditions.
These included the effects of translational currency exchange rates, market volatility in Land Systems and certain automotive territories and some declining military programmes.
These adverse factors were more than offset by some good performances.
STVRS payments to executive Directors were between 38% and 55% of salary, depending upon performance against their targets.
The maximum annual bonus achievable was 110% of base salary.
Given the Groups good results, this outcome reflects the stretching targets we put in place at the start of 2014.
As a general principle, the Committee seeks to avoid exercising discretion unless there are good reasons to do so.
During 2014 we exercised discretion to ensure that STVRS performance was measured on a consistent, like-for-like basis by excluding the impact of two small transactions: the acquisition of Williams Hybrid Power and the disposal of the Groups 50% share in Emitec.
These transactions were not included in the financial targets set at the start of the year and therefore we felt it was reasonable to exclude them.
We also reviewed the circumstances surrounding the fatal accident at El Cajon and exercised our discretion to adjust some payouts in the chain of accountability downwards in line with our principle that safety is our top priority.
SEP The first SEP award was granted in 2012 and the three year performance period for that award ended on 31 December 2014.
The core element of the 2012 SEP award vested at 67.5% of maximum following annual compound growth in earnings per share of 9.4% over the performance period.
The Committee carefully considered the quality of earnings, noting that performance across the Groups KPIs was generally strong during the performance period.
In particular, ROIC was good for each year of the performance period, ending at 17.7% for the Group in 2014.
This is a particularly credible outcome given that we acquired Volvo Aerospace during the relevant performance period.
The share price performed well during the performance period, increasing from 183p on 1 January 2012 to 344p on 31 December 2014 and the dividend per share increased from 7.2p in 2012 to 8.4p in 2014.
The sustainability element of the 2012 SEP award will be measured at the end of 2017 after the five year performance period.
Other key decisions during 2014 Marcus Bryson, CBE, retired from the Board at the end of 2014.
Given Marcus contribution to GKN and his retirement after many years of exceptional performance, he was treated as a good leaver and, in line with our approved remuneration policy, his outstanding awards under the SEP will vest taking into account performance achieved and time served during the relevant performance periods.
We approved salary increases for the executive Directors of around 2.7% for 2014, after carefully considering their performance, market reference points, and salary increases awarded to both the senior management population and all UK employees.
The salary increases approved for the executive Directors were broadly in line with those awarded to UK employees generally.
We approved an increase in the Chairmans fee: this is explained in more detail on page 92.
We concluded that this increase was appropriate in light of the scope of the role, time commitment and positioning against the market.
We also considered the Chairmans shareholding requirement of 30% of his fee and decided that it continued to be appropriate.
In the course of the year, the Committee considered the external environment for executive talent and changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code, consulted with shareholders, reviewed its effectiveness and agreed on actions for continuous improvement.
Our approach for 2015 No major changes will be made to the structure of the STVRS for 2015 but we will continue to refine it to ensure that it incentivises the right behaviours.
Having reviewed the STVRS payments over the last three years against Group performance and shareholder expectations, we consider that the targets have been challenging.
Whilst we have not changed our approach to setting targets for 2015, we have revised the ranges above and below target to encourage executives to drive beyond the targets, whilst carefully managing risk.
We have tailored the ranges for each division and our view of their markets in 2015.
In addition, we have refined the cash targets to continue encouraging improvement in sustainable cash flow.
The strategic measures for 2015 are aligned with our strategy and risks and include incentivising the continued development of our risk management systems, implementation of our diversity and inclusion programme, new business wins and operational excellence.
As a Committee, we keep the remuneration framework under review to ensure that it continues to be appropriate and effectively aligns executives with the long term sustainability of the business.
Whilst we do not plan to make any significant changes for 2015, we will apply malus and clawback provisions to our STVRS and SEP schemes for our executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee.
In addition, we will review the STVRS and SEP schemes and targets to ensure that they continue to be both appropriately stretching and an effective tool for the appointment and retention of top executives.
Overall, given GKNs performance over the one and three year periods to the end of 2014, I am comfortable that the absolute amounts awarded to our executive Directors in respect of 2014 are appropriate.
We will continue to take a rigorous, principled and fair approach to setting remuneration.
The following pages describe in further detail how we have implemented our remuneration policy in respect of 2014, together with our plans for 2015.

GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 81 GOVERNANCE Directors remuneration report continued Salaries During the year In June 2014, we undertook an annual review of salaries for executive Directors.
We took into account a number of factors, including their performance, increases awarded to senior management and employees in the UK generally, the advice of our remuneration advisers and market data.
We approved salary increases of 2.7% rounded to the nearest thousand for executive Directors as set out below.
This increase was broadly in line with the average increase awarded to UK employees generally.
Salary increases were effective from 1 July 2014. a 1 July 2014 1 July 2013 Nigel Stein 785,000 764,000 Marcus Bryson 490,000 477,000 Andrew Reynolds Smith 490,000 477,000 b Adam Walker 498,000 485,000 a Or date of appointment if later.
b Appointed as a Director on 1 January 2014.
Implementation of policy for 2015 Any salary increases in 2015 will be made in line with the approved remuneration policy as set out at the end of this report.
Taxable benefits All Directors received healthcare benefits and car and fuel allowances.
In addition, William Seeger received US benefits medical insurance, life insurance, long and short term disability benefit and fees for computation of annual tax return that were taxable in the UK and converted into UK sterling using the average exchange rate for the first business day of each month.
Pension entitlements During the year Pension benefits are provided to executive Directors through the GKN Group Pension Scheme 2012 the Scheme.
The Scheme has changed in recent years in line with pension regulations.
Directors receive benefits either under the defined benefit section of the Scheme or the defined contribution section of the Scheme depending on when they joined.
Defined benefit section of the Scheme These are legacy arrangements which apply to Nigel Stein, Marcus Bryson and Andrew Reynolds Smith, under which they receive: th a pension of up to two-thirds of pensionable salary on their normal retirement date with a maximum annual accrual rate of 1 30.
From 1 September 2007, benefits under the Scheme have been calculated on a career average basis: and a supplementary cash allowance of up to 40% of the difference between their pensionable salary and base salary.
They may choose to opt out and receive a cash allowance on their full base salary.
Nigel Stein opted out of the Scheme.
Defined contribution section of the Scheme Adam Walker receives retirement benefits by way of a cash allowance equivalent to 25% of base salary which may be delivered in cash or as a payment into the defined contribution section of the Scheme.
He was automatically enrolled into the Scheme but chose to opt out and therefore receives the full allowance as cash.
No compensation is offered for any additional tax suffered by a Director in the event that the value of his or her pension exceeds the statutory lifetime allowance.
William Seeger did not participate in the Scheme during the period he was a Director but received an overall allowance of 40% of base salary, which included the Companys contributions to qualified and non-qualified defined contribution pension arrangements consistent with US practice.
Details of the pension benefit provisions under the defined benefit and defined contribution sections of the Scheme can be found on page 90.
Implementation of policy for 2015 There are no plans to change Directors pension entitlements in 2015.
82 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information STVRS Purpose of Short Term Variable Remuneration Scheme STVRS Aligning short term financial and strategic measures with long term strategic objectives Payments under the STVRS are triggered by performance against targets set for financial and strategic measures.
The financial measures represent a maximum opportunity of 90% of base salary, assessed against targets relating to profit, margin and cash flow in relation to Group or individual portfolios as appropriate.
The strategic measures for 2014 are summarised below and represent the remaining bonus opportunity of 20% of base salary.
The STVRS financial measures are designed to reward the achievement of profit, margin and cash flow without encouraging excessive risk-taking.
Strategic objectives are tailored to meet the broader Group strategies and the individual business needs of each division.
Payments of up to 65% of base salary are made in cash and any balance is deferred into shares under the DBP seepage84.
2014 STVRS performance audited Performance of the financial measures achieved relating to Group profit and margin for 2014 are set out below: Maximum opportunity Payout Measure Threshold Target Maximum Actual % of salary % of salary Profit m 611 643 675 642 50 24.2 Margin % 8.9 9.2 9.5 9.3 10 6.7 The profit and margin figures above are calculated using 2014 budget exchange rates to eliminate the impact of translational currency fluctuations.
As described in the Chairmans letter, actual performance has been adjusted to remove the impact of two small one-off items to ensure that performance is measured against targets on a like-for-like-basis and some payouts were reduced in light of a fatal accident at our Aerospace site in El Cajon, US.
Targets are set on a monthly, cumulative basis to reflect the budgeted cash profile for the year and also include an element in relation to cash conversion and an underpin to encourage capital expenditure broadly in line with budget phasing.
Performance of strategic goals at Group and divisional levels included the following: Strategic goals Outcome Winning appropriate new business and delivering other strategic A good performance across the Group, with particularly strong initiatives relating to technology development and market new business wins by Driveline at appropriate margins and good expansion.

STVRS is based on performance against stretching targets set by the Committee at the start of the year.
The Board believes that detailed cash flow and divisional financial targets are , but the disclosure set out overleaf in relation to 2014 STVRS provides information on the level of performance achieved against the various measures during 2014 and demonstrates the extent to which this performance met threshold, target and maximum levels.

Clawback and malus will be applied in the event of a material misstatement of the Groups published accounts or if an individual is guilty of serious misconduct or has committed a serious breach of the GKN Code.
We will also be able to apply malus provisions where there has been a failure of risk management or major reputational damage to GKN.
In applying clawback, the value of any other long or short term incentive awards may be reduced.
STVRS deferred shares Purpose of Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Aligning interests of key executives with those of shareholders Currently any STVRS payment above 65% of base salary is deferred into shares under the DBP.

The release of DBP awards is subject to continued employment and malus provisions.
The 2014 STVRS award did not meet the 65% threshold so no amounts will be deferred into shares.
84 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Implementation of policy for 2015 There is no change to the policy for setting targets for 2015.
However we have revised the ranges above and below target to encourage executives to drive performance beyond the targets.
Any STVRS payment above 65% of salary earned in respect of 2015 will be deferred.
Long term incentives Purpose of Sustainable Earnings Plan SEP Sustained earnings performance to support the Groups growth strategy and objective of creating long term shareholder value The SEP is designed to improve alignment with the Groups growth strategy and with shareholder interests, as well as encouraging and rewarding earnings performance which is sustained over the long term.
Awards take the form of a Core Award and a Sustainability Award andare normally granted annually to executive Directors and to the senior management population.
The chart below illustrates how the SEPoperates: Year 1 Year 2Year 3Year 4Year 5 Core performance period Sustainability performance period Core Award Deferred Core Award 50% Core Award released 50% Core Award released Sustainability Award Total of Core and Sustainability Sustainability Award will be Sustainability Award vests Awards: 174% of salary reduced to the extent that the at the end of year 5 subject core target is not satis ed over to the achievement of the the Core Performance Period sustainability target The Core and Sustainability Awards are subject to performance targets and to an additional assessment of the quality of earnings as set outbelow.

b V esting level is subject to reduction to reflect the extent to which the core target is not satisfied.
c Sustainability target is assessed separately in years 4 and 5.
As a Committee, we take into account the following factors to ensure we are satisfied that the level of vesting is justified by the quality of earnings: Group ROIC against internal projections: shareholder expectations: new investment performance: and cost of capital to ensure the level of vesting appropriately reflects the creation of shareholder value.
GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 85 GOVERNANCE Directors remuneration report continued Vesting of awards in 2014 audited The long term incentive values shown in the single total figure table on page 81 relate to the 2012 SEP Core Award for which the performance period ended on 31 December 2014.
The performance targets and vesting levels are set out in the table below.
The quality of earnings is an important assessment which includes the creation of both financial and shareholder value.
Before we approved the 2012 SEP vesting levels we reviewed the quality of earnings.
This included a review of organic sales growth, trading margin, free cash flow, ROIC, dividend per share, net debt and cost of capital during the performance period.

50% of the vested Core Award shares together with accrued dividend equivalent shares are due to be released on 24 February 2015 see page 95. Dividend equivalent shares accrue based on the value of dividends paid from the date of grant to the date of release.
The remaining 50% of the vested Core Award shares together with dividend equivalent shares will be released in 2017 see page 89.
The chart below shows the value of the vested Core Awards as shown in the single total figure table that is attributable to performance and share price appreciation: Chief Executive 831 557 1,388 Nigel Stein Chief Executive, Aerospace & Land Systems 516 346 862 Marcus Bryson Chief Executive, Automotive 516 346 862 Andrew Reynolds Smith 0 300 600 900 1200 1500 000 Performance element Share appreciation element The Sustainability Awards associated with the vested Core Awards will vest subject to the satisfaction of the sustainability target measured in each of the financial years ending 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016, and will be capable of release in 2017.

The number of Core Award shares is calculated using the GKN share price of 396.23p, being the average share price for the three dealing days immediately before the date of grant 10 March 2014.
The number of Sustainability Award shares is based on 20% of the Core Award Shares.
The value excludes the amount attributable to dividend equivalents paid in additional shares or cash over the relevant performance periods which are released at the same time as the Core and Sustainability Award shares.
Implementation of policy for 2015 Awards under the SEP, with a face value of 174% of base salary, will continue to be measured against growth in EPS using the targets set out on page 85 and against a baseline EPS for 2014 of 32.1p.
Provided all or part of the Core Award vests, the Sustainability Award will be measured by reference to the highest level of EPS achieved in any year of the core performance period.
Taking into account the revisions to the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code, we will apply malus and clawback provisions to the 2015 SEP awards and subsequent awards.
Clawback and malus will be applied to the SEP Core awards in the event of a material misstatement of the Groups published accounts or if an individual is guilty of serious misconduct or has committed a serious breach of the GKN Code.
We will also be able to apply malus provisions to all SEP awards where there has been a failure of risk management or major reputational damage to GKN.
Historic plans Prior to the introduction of the SEP in 2012, long term incentive awards were granted under the GKN Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP which targeted EPS growth and the GKN Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS which was based on TSR performance.
Details of vested and outstanding LTIP and ESOS awards are shown on pages 89 and 90.
Since 2012, all long term incentive awards have been granted under the SEP.
Joining awards Purpose of joining awards To compensate for long term incentives forfeited on leaving former employer Adam Walker joined the Board on 1 January 2014 and became Group Finance Director on 26 February 2014.
In addition to participating in the normal ongoing incentive arrangements STVRS and SEP, he was granted joining awards as set out below.
These awards were granted in line with the remuneration policy to compensate him for the long term incentive arrangements he forfeited on leaving his former employer.

GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 87 GOVERNANCE Directors remuneration report continued Executive Directors share interests audited We believe that the interests of Directors should be closely aligned with those of shareholders so we operate a shareholding requirement to achieve this.
For executive Directors, a considerable part of this alignment can be achieved through the retention of shares released under the DBP and under long term incentive plans.
In July 2012, the alignment between shareholders and executive Directors was improved as the minimum shareholding requirement was increased from 100% to 200% of base salary.
Nigel Stein, Marcus Bryson and Andrew Reynolds Smith, who were all in post at that time, were expected to meet the requirement within five years and did so comfortably see table below.
Adam Walker, as a newly appointed Director, is expected to acquire shares with a value of 100% of his base salary within five years of appointment and 200% of base salary as soon as possible after that.
He is expected to retain all vested long term incentive awards net of tax until the requirement is met in full.
He has made considerable progress towards meeting the requirement since his appointment to the Board on 1 January 2014.
The shareholding requirement is tested annually on 31 December using the average share price for the final three months of the year based only on shares that are held outright by the Director or their connected persons.
We also apply a similar shareholding requirement for Executive Committee members and the top 100 executives in the Group as we believe that their interests should be closely aligned with shareholders in the same way as those of executive Directors and non-executive Directors see page 93.

He will be employed on a part-time basis until 31 December 2015.
No STVRS or SEP awards will be made to him in respect of 2015.
Incentive awards In accordance with the rules of the relevant incentive plans and the remuneration policy, Marcus Brysons incentive awards will be treated as follows: The 2011 ESOS award over 168,353 shares with an option price of 199.58p has vested in respect of performance to 31 December 2013 and can be exercised until 1 July 2015 six months after retirement.
The 2011 LTIP award of 343,558 shares has vested in respect of performance to 31 December 2013 and will be released i. e. the award will become capable of exercise as soon as practicable following his retirement, in accordance with the rules of the plan.
A cash amount equivalent to the dividends on the vested shares from the beginning of the third year of the relevant performance period to the release date will also be paid.
The 2014 DBP award over 11,675 shares will be released as soon as practicable following his retirement in accordance with the rules of the plan.
A cash amount equivalent to the dividends on the shares during the period from grant to release will also be paid.
The 2014 STVRS award will be paid wholly in cash as it did not exceed the 65% threshold for any deferral into shares.
We considered Marcus Bryson to be a good leaver for the purposes of the SEP awards granted in 2012, 2013 and 2014: this was considered appropriate given his retirement from full time employment and his contribution to the Group.
The number of shares under his unvested 2013 and 2014 SEP awards will be reduced on a pro rata basis to reflect his length of service during the relevant performance periods.
These awards will remain subject to the original performance conditions and any core awards that vest will be released at the end of the relevant three year core performance period.
The sustainability awards relating to all of his 2013 and 2014 SEP awards will lapse.
The 2012 Core Award which vested at 67.5% as shown on page 89 will be released in full 217,489 shares on 24 February 2015 together with 12,152 dividend equivalent shares.

Implementation of policy for 2015 In November 2014, we reviewed the fees for the Chairman and approved an increase of 6% with effect from 1 January 2015.
We concluded that this increase was appropriate taking into account the scope of the role, time commitment and positioning against market.
In November 2014 the fees for non-executive Directors were reviewed by the Board and an increase of 9% was approved taking into account the current market environment, the scope of the role, the time commitment expected of them and the time since the last increase was made being two years ago.
The additional fees for the Audit and Remuneration Committee Chairmen and Senior Independent Director were also reviewed but not increased.

94 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Value Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Dilution limits The rules of the discretionary share plans SEP, ESOS and LTIP contain limits on the dilution of capital.
These limits are monitored to ensure that the issue of new shares or transfer of shares from treasury does not exceed 5% of the issued share capital in any rolling 10 year period for discretionary plans or 10% of the issued share capital in any rolling 10 year period for all employee plans.
At 31 December 2014 the cumulative number of shares issued under discretionary plans for the previous 10 year period as a percentage of the issued share capital was 2.67%.
The Company no longer operates an all employee share plan.
GKNs policy is to satisfy awards under the SEP, ESOS and LTIP by the issue of shares, transfer of shares from treasury or from an employee share ownership plan trust Trust established for that purpose.
DBP awards are satisfied by transfer of shares held in the Trust.
A dividend waiver operates in respect of shares held in the Trust.
During the year, shares held in treasury were used to satisfy awards under the ESOS and LTIP and shares held in the Trust were used to satisfy awards under the DBP.

GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 97 GOVERNANCE Directors remuneration report continued Performance measures STVRS: a combination of financial and strategic measures which support the delivery of the Groups long term strategic objectives.
Appropriate targets are set each year which align with the specific business objectives for that year.
The Committee has discretion to alter targets to reflect changed circumstances such as material changes in accounting standards or changes in the Groups structure.
The Committee also has discretion to reduce payments based on its assessment of underlying performance of the Group, including health and safety performance.
SEP: based on sustained EPS growth over the long term in line with GKNs stated growth strategy and objective of creating long term shareholder value.
Before any vesting can occur, the Committee must be satisfied that this is justified by the quality of earnings.
This will involve consideration of Group return on average invested capital ROIC against internal projections, shareholder expectations, new investment performance and cost of capital to ensure that the level of vesting appropriately reflects shareholder value creation.
In accordance with the rules of the SEP, the Committee can adjust and or set different performance measures and targets if events occur such as a change in strategy, a material acquisition and or divestment of a Group business or a change in prevailing market conditions which cause the Committee to determine that the measures or targets are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that they achieve their original purpose.
Whilst stretching, targets under the STVRS and SEP are designed to discourage inappropriate risk taking.
