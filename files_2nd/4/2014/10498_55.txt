The policy was developed taking into account the principles of the governance codes in South Africa and the UK and the views of our major shareholders and describes the policy applicable from 2014 onwards.
The policy report was approved under a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 annual general meetings.
The Groups remuneration policy has been set with the objective of attracting, motivating and retaining high calibre directors, in a manner that is consistent with best practice and aligned with the interests of the Groups shareholders.
Remuneration policy for executive directors is framed around the following key principles: remuneration packages should be set at levels that are competitive in the relevant market: the structure of remuneration packages and, in particular, the design of performancebased remuneration schemes, should be aligned with shareholders interests and should support the achievement of the Groups business strategy and the management of risk: a significant proportion of the remuneration of executive directors should be performance-based: the performance-based element of remuneration should be appropriately balanced between the achievement of short-term objectives and longer-term objectives: and the remuneration of executive directors should be set taking appropriate account of remuneration and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
