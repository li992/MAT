h Remuneration details for 2014 reflect remuneration received for the period 1 January 2014 31 May 2014.
Remuneration received for the period 1 June 2014 1 September 2014 was base salary of C$237,000, STIP of C$351,000, value of LTIP awards vesting of C$377,000, pension of C$0 and other benefits of C$13,000.
i Superannuation contributions for Alan Davies for 2013 have been restated as a Company contribution was incorrectly recorded as a personal contribution.
The previous figure disclosed for 2013 was A$174,000.
j Remuneration details for 2013 reflect remuneration received for the period 14 February 2013 31 December 2013.
Context to outcomes for the Executive Committee The decrease in the single total figure of remuneration for most executives is due mainly to the lower value of LTIP awards vesting in 2014 compared to 2013, partly offset by higher STIP payments in 2014 compared to 2013.
Hugo Bague, Jacynthe Ct, Andrew Harding and Debra Valentine all received less remuneration related to the vesting of 2011 PSP awards in 2014 comparedto the vesting of 2010 PSP awards in 2013.
While the vesting levels for the awards were similar 73.5 per cent for the 2011 PSP and 75 per cent for the 2010 PSP, the number of PSP awards granted in 2011 was significantly lower than the PSP awards granted in 2010 because PSP awards are calculated based on the average share price over the calendar year prior to the year of grant and the average 2009 share price was significantly lower than the average 2010 share price.
In addition, the share prices at the date the 2011 PSP awards vested in February 2015 were lower than the share prices at the date the 2010 PSP awards vested in February 2014.
The value of SOP awards vesting with respect to both the 2014 and 2013 performance periods was nil as both the 2012 SOP and 2011 SOP options are currently under water.
Harry Kenyon-Slaney elected to receive his full 2011 LTIP allocation in the form of PSP awards and hence he received a relatively larger number of 2011 PSP awards compared to other executives.
The reduction in his value of LTIP awards vesting is therefore less pronounced.
The decrease in remuneration for Jacynthe Ct reflects that her 2014 remuneration represents part-year remuneration for the period 1 January 2014 to 31 May 2014.
The significantly higher single total figure of remuneration for Jean-Sbastien Jacques reflects that his 2013 remuneration represents part year remuneration for the period 14 February 2013 to 31 December 2013, a higher 2014 base salary and a higher 2014 STIP payment primarily due to higher product group financial performance.
The value of LTIP awards vesting was higher due to a larger number of MSP awards granted prior to his appointment to the Executive Committee vesting with respect to the performance period that ended 31 December 2014. riotinto.
