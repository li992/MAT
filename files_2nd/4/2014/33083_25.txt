Key responsibilities The principal role of the Remuneration Committee is to determine and then agree with the Board the framework and policy for the remuneration of the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chairman of the Company and such other members of the executive management as it is tasked to consider.

This will remain unchanged for 2015.
Annual bonus payments are based on pre-determined performance measures.
Two thirds is based on adjusted EPS performance in the year, split evenly between performance versus budget and prior year figures.
The remaining third is based on achievement of strategic and operational objectives against a scorecard of measures.
The Remuneration Committee considers the objectives carefully each year to align with Intus strategic objectives, and include quantitatively assessed financial and operational measures and milestones.
Each objective relates directly to the strategic plan.
Under the scorecard approach, the weightings of each objective vary between Executive Directors to reflect their roles and responsibilities.
For 2015, the scorecard will include objectives in the following key areas: Optimising performance of assets Key capital expenditure projects Building the Intu brand and delivering customer experience Maximising the growth opportunities internationally Financial flexibility Talent development and staff engagement Annual bonus 2014 out-turn Performance against the targets for the 2014 short-term incentive arrangements is given below: Target 2014 Out-turn Performance element Weighting Threshold Target Maximum performance % max element Adjusted EPS vs. budget 33% 12.0p 12.6p 13.2p 13.3p 100% Adjusted EPS vs. prior year 33% 100% 102.5% 105% 97.1% 0% David Fischel Matthew Roberts Scorecard of strategic and operational measures 33% See details of scorecard achievements 95% 96% Total 65.0% 65.3% The strategic objectives in the annual bonus are a key part of the remuneration framework for incentivising and rewarding the achievements and milestones which are the foundation for value creation in the future.
The Committee follows a rigorous process in the setting and monitoring of scorecard objectives.
This includes determination of objectives by reference to the approved board strategy, quarterly reviews of quantitative and qualitative data, and an end of year full review with supporting evidence, to ensure a robust assessment of performance against the objectives.

Long-term incentives Awards with performance periods ending in the year Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The LTIP awards shown in the single figure relate to 2012 ESOS awards which were due to vest in March 2015.

Awards lapse for growth of less than 4 per cent p. a.

Since 2009, a key driver for growth in value within the UK real estate market has been exposure to central London properties.
As a result of the demerger of Capital & Counties from Liberty International now intu Properties plc in 2010, Intus portfolio does not include properties in central London and Intu has therefore not benefited from the recent uplift experienced by those property companies with exposure to London.
However, given the cyclical nature of the property sector, we would not expect this trend to endure over the long-term cycle.
