In the case of Colin Child the total figure includes an estimated value 140,849 of the PSP shares including dividend shares that are due to vest in June 2014 2013 14 being the final year of the performance period.
It is based on the number of shares that will vest multiplied by the average share price of 810.5p over the quarter ending 31 March 2014 as the vesting price is not known at the date of the directors remuneration report.

Base salary and fees Executive Directors decided not to accept a salary increase in 2013 14.
The base salaries are shown in the table below.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the salary levels of Executive Directors and agreed an increase in salary of 3 per cent for 2014 15 which is consistent with increases across the UK business.
The following is payable from 1 April 2014: Base salary Base salary 2014 15 2013 14 000 000 Tim Cobbold resigned 29 March 2014 464 Colin Child 335 325 The remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman, is determined by the Board.
Fees reflect the responsibilities and duties placed upon Non-executive Directors while also having regard to the market place.
The Non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the Groups share incentive plans nor do they receive any benefits or pension contributions.
Fees to Non-executive Directors were last increased in October 2012 to 45,000.
The Chairmen of the Remuneration Committee and Audit Committee and the Senior Independent Director receive an additional fee of 7,200 to reflect their additional duties.
The Chairman received a fee of 175,000 in 2013 14.
Fees payable to Non-executive Directors were increased by 4 per cent for 2014 15 and are as follows: 2014 15 2013 14 Non-executive Director fees 000 000 Basic fee 47 45 Additional fee for chairmanship of Audit and Remuneration Committees and Senior Independent Director 8 7 In 2014 15 Philip Rogerson will receive a fee of 182,500 as Chairman.
In order to reflect the additional time commitment for the period he continues to assume executive responsibilities pending appointment of a new Chief Executive, he will be paid an additional fee of 297,500 per annum.
This will take effect from 1 April 2014 and will be pro-rated for so long as he continues in this role.
Performance against targets subject to audit Annual Bonus Under the existing ABP, the annual bonus is paid as a combination of cash and share based elements deferred for three years, calculated as a percentage of salary, and is based on achieving business targets for the year set by the Remuneration Committee.
The maximum bonus opportunity is 135 per cent of salary for the Chief Executive being 100 per cent cash and 35 per cent shares and 115 per cent of salary for the Group Finance Director being 80 per cent cash and 35 per cent shares.
ABP 2013 14 performance measures A cash bonus became payable in respect of the year 2013 14 for Group underlying operating profit in excess of 90m with payments increasing on a straight line basis from 90m to a maximum of 100m.
Deferred shares would be awarded on a similar basis for achievement of underlying operating profit between 100m and 105m.
Based on achievement of an underlying operating profit of 90.5m for 2013 14, the cash bonus element under the ABP was a payout of 5 per cent of maximum opportunity.
There was no deferred share entitlement in respect of the ABP for the period.
Performance Share Plan PSP Executive Directors did not receive awards under the PSP in 2013 14.
Awards under the PSP in January 2011 and June 2011 respectively had the following performance measures over a three year period ending during or at the end of the financial year 2013 14: Date of award Performance measures Performance thresholds Proportion of award vesting Vested % % of salary January 2011 60% of award based 1 on annual growth in EPS EPS RPI 3% 50% of maximum 30 EPS RPI 5% 100% of maximum 100 60 2 40% of award based on relative TSR TSR at median 50% of maximum Nil 20 TSR in upper quartile 100% of maximum Nil 40 3 June 2011 2013 14 underlying operating profit 3 target in excess of 100m Operating profit 85m Nil Nil Nil 3 Operating profit 100m 66.67% of award 24.44 36.66 3 Operating profit 115m 100% of award Nil 150 Notes 1 EPS is defined as the fully diluted post tax earnings per share adjusted for exceptional items although exceptional items which are attributable to management may be taken into account.
EPS was chosen because it is a key performance indicator for shareholders.
Based on half year results, EPS growth of 14.1 per cent per annum over the three year performance period exceeded the hurdle which was 8.8 per cent per annum being equivalent to RPI 5 per cent per annum 2 Total Shareholder Return TSR is measured relative to the TSR of the companies in the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts.
TSR was chosen because it is a widely accepted measure that is recognised by our institutional shareholders.
TSR performance was 34.7 per cent below the median of the comparator group and this portion of the award lapsed 3 Threshold target was linked to the three year Improvement Plan underlying operating profit for 2013 14 of 100m.
Entry was at 85m and vesting started at zero for threshold performance at the end of the three year performance period.
Underlying operating profit for 2013 14 was 90.5m and therefore 24.44 per cent of the award will vest and the balance of the award will lapse fide La Rue Annual Report 2014 53 Directors remuneration report continued Operation of awards from 2014 15 It is intended that awards under the ABP will be made under the amended ABP to be put to shareholders for approval at the AGM.
The Plan rules have been updated as described more fully in the explanatory notes to the notice of the AGM.
The overall timetable of pay under the PSP has increased to four years.
The performance measures that will apply to awards under the ABP and PSP are described more fully below.
ABP performance measures from 2014 15 The ABP has been refined to include a re-weighting of the elements attributable to cash and deferred shares and to include a larger number of performance metrics apportioned as follows: Group revenue 20% Group underlying operating profit 40% Group cash conversion 20% Individual objectives 20% Sixty per cent of the bonus opportunity is payable in cash with the remaining 40 per cent deferred in shares.
Half of the deferred shares will vest one year after the cash payout and the remaining half of the deferred shares will vest two years after the cash payout.
There will be no change to the maximum bonus opportunities for Executive Directors as described on page 45.
The Board considers that the specific profit and revenue targets are commercially sensitive and they are therefore not disclosed here.
This will remain under review but the Remuneration Committee will continue to disclose how the bonus payout delivered relates to performance against the targets on a retrospective basis.
PSP performance measures from 2014 15 The PSP is designed to provide Executive Directors and selected senior managers with a long term incentive that promotes annual and long term performance and reinforces alignment between participants and shareholders.
No changes are proposed to the maximum opportunity which will remain in the absence of exceptional circumstances 100 per cent of salary.
Subject to the performance measurements outlined below, 60 per cent of an award will vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary of grant and 40 per cent will vest and become exercisable on the fourth anniversary of grant.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the most appropriate performance measures for the PSP at the current time are EPS and ROCE, with a weighting of 75 per cent measured against average growth in EPS and 25 per cent subject to ROCE.
For proposed awards in 2014 15, the vesting of PSP awards will be subject to EPS compound average growth rate and ROCE absolute performance conditions.
Award vesting levels under the EPS target will apply as follows: Vesting % of EPS element of award for Executive Directors EPS growth Threshold 25% 5% Maximum 100% 10% ROCE supports the strategic focus on growth and margins through ensuring that cash is reinvested to generate appropriate returns.
ROCE targets are based on average ROCE and vesting levels will be as follows: Vesting % of ROCE element of award for Executive Directors ROCE Threshold 25% 40% Maximum 100% 45% The Remuneration Committee believes that the performance necessary to achieve awards is sufficiently stretching.
All awards are made as performance shares based on a percentage of salary and the value is divided by the average share price over a period before the date of grant in accordance with the rules of the PSP.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the vesting reflects the underlying performance of the Group and retains the flexibility to adjust the vesting amount to ensure it remains appropriate.
Any adjustments will depend on the nature, timing and materiality of any contributory factors.
