Directors remuneration report As highlighted by the Chairman and Chief Executive in their annual Remuneration Committee statements on pages 20 to 24 of this Annual Report, the Groups markets remained challenging in the year to 31 July 2014.
In this difficult economic climate, the Group has seen broadly flat headline revenue and a 12% decrease in headline EPS.
Cash conversion remains strong 97% in the last financial year and ROCE 15.7% in the last financial year remains well ahead of the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
A significant part of this headline revenue and EPS outcome was a direct result of the impact of currency movements over the year.
Against this backdrop, annual bonus pay-outs are between threshold and target, and the TSR and EPS elements of 2011 LTIP awards lapsed in full following the end of the performance period on 31 July 2014.
The Groups cash conversion, however, warranted the partial payout of that element of the bonus and LTIP, and the matching award under the CIP vested reflecting Anne Quinn, CBE our sustained ROCE performance.
The Committee recognises Chair of the Remuneration Committee the importance of close alignment of remuneration with Group performance, and we consider the incentive outcomes for this year Annual Statement further details of which are disclosed in this years Annual Report On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the report on Remuneration to demonstrate this link appropriately.

Existing grants or entitlements It is the Companys intention to honour all pre-existing commitments at the date of this report and to honour all future obligations entered into, consistent with the approved remuneration policy.
In the case of internal promotion to the Board, the Committee intends to honour any pre-existing commitments made prior to becoming a member of the Board, including where these differ from the approved remuneration policy.
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting Annual bonus measures are selected to reflect the Companys short-term financial and non-financial priorities.
At its discretion, the Committee may vary these measures at the start of each financial year to maintain close alignment between executive incentives and the annual business plan.
The combination of measures used in the long-term incentives reinforces Smiths current strategy to create value through four key drivers: revenue growth, operating margin which the Committee continues to advocate is best represented by EPS, cash conversion and ROCE currently incentivised by the CIP.
Relative TSR excluding financial services companies is a widely used measure amongst FTSE 100 companies.
This balance between both internal and external performance and between absolute and relative performance is considered to be important by the Committee.
Annual bonus, CIP and LTIP targets are reviewed annually, and take into account the Companys strategic plan, analyst forecasts for Smiths and its sector comparators and external expectations for Smiths key markets.
The Remuneration Committee sets targets that it considers to be challenging but attainable and aligned to the Companys business objectives over the short term, as reflected in the annual business plan, and longer term, consistent with the strategic plan.
On top of aligning strategy with incentives, targets are designed to ensure that participants are aligned with the interests of shareholders.
Difference in policy between executive director and other employees There is no difference in the reward policy for executive directors and other senior employees and the Company does not currently operate any incentive plans in which only executive directors participate.
The Remuneration Committee reviews each year the all-employee pay and incentive trends and takes these into account in setting executive director pay levels.
The principles of remuneration packages being market related, performance sensitive and driven by business needs are applied at all levels and geographies in the Group.
96 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2014 Pay scenarios The graphs below provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunity for executive directors, and the potential mix between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Minimum, On-Target and Maximum.
For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for 2014 15.
It should be noted that any awards granted under the CIP and LTIP in a year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant.
This illustration is intended to provide further information to shareholders on the relationship between executive pay and performance.
Please note, however, that actual pay delivered will further be influenced by changes in factors such as share price appreciation and the value of dividends paid.

The Chairman and the non-executive directors are not eligible for bonuses or participation in share schemes or any pension provision.
They are paid an attendance allowance for each overseas meeting attended in addition to the annual fee and are reimbursed for actual expenses incurred transportation, hotels etc.
Approach to recruitment remuneration External appointments The Remuneration Committee approves the remuneration of each executive director on their appointment.
In setting the remuneration during the recruitment of external appointments, the Committee will apply the following policy: External appointments Pay element Policy on recruitment Salary Salary on recruitment is determined based on the same principles as the annual salary review, as outlined in the policy table.
Pension As described in the policy table.
Benefits As described in the policy table.
Annual bonus As described in the policy table and typically pro-rated for proportion of year served.
Maximum annual award opportunity: 180% of salary.
CIP Eligible for match, as described in the policy table only after bonus is first earned.
LTIP May be considered for an award under the LTIP on similar terms to other executives.
Maximum annual award opportunity: 300% of salary.
Other The Remuneration Committee may make an award in recognition of incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Any such award will take account of relevant factors including the fair value of awards forfeited, any performance conditions attached, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
For the purposes of making such awards, but for no other reason, the Committee may avail itself of Listing Rule 9.4.
The Remuneration Committee may also make payments to cover reasonable expenses in recruitment and relocation, and any other miscellaneous expenses including but not limited to housing, tax and immigration support.
Annual bonus maximum shown is prior to mandatory 50% deferral 98 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2014 Internal promotions In cases of appointing a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the policy will be consistent with that for external appointees, as detailed above.
Any commitments made prior to an individuals promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Company may, where appropriate, seek to revise an individuals existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors and prevailing market best practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director external or internal, including details of any exceptional payments, will be disclosed in the RNS notification made at the time of appointment and in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year in which the recruitment occurred.
Non-executive directors In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on page 98.
Service contracts The Companys policy is that executive directors are normally employed on terms which include a one-year rolling period of notice and provision for the payment of a predetermined sum in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances but excluding circumstances where the Company is entitled to dismiss without compensation.
In addition to payment of basic salary, pension allowance and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the one-year notice period, the predetermined sum would include annual bonus and share awards only in respect of the period they have served, payable following the relevant performance year-end and subject to the normal performance conditions.
Existing service contracts are available for viewing at the Companys Registered Office.
Mr Bowman Mr Bowman is employed under a service contract with the Company dated 15 November 2007 and effective from 10 December 2007.
It may be terminated by 12 months notice given by the Company or six months notice given by Mr Bowman.
The Company may elect to terminate the contract by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to 150% of Mr Bowmans basic salary, other than for cause, this being a genuine pre-estimate of Mr Bowmans entitlement in respect of the unserved notice period, to cover: 1. salary: 2. annual pension contribution by the Company 42% of base salary : 3. the annual cost to the Company of providing all other benefits to which Mr Bowman is entitled under his contract, but excluding bonus.
In this event, the contract provides that Mr Bowmans bonus entitlement for the financial year in which termination occurs and for the unserved notice period will be the subject of a separate, good faith discussion between Mr Bowman and the Chairman: the contract also specifies that Mr Bowman would in this case be treated as a good leaver for the purposes of relevant share plans.
In certain constructive dismissal events, Mr Bowman is entitled to resign and be treated in the manner set out above.
Mr Turner Mr Turner is employed under a service contract with the Company dated 23 March 2010 and effective from 19 April 2010.
It provides for a rolling one-year notice period given by the Company or six months notice given by Mr Turner.
In the event of termination by the Company other than for cause, the Board is required to consider what sum should be payable as compensation to Mr Turner.
In doing so, the Board shall take into account a number of specific matters, including Mr Turners personal circumstances, the financial performance of Smiths Group, applicable corporate governance best practice, the likelihood of Mr Turner obtaining alternative employment, and various other matters relating to Mr Turners financial loss.
The amount of compensation, as so determined, will not be less than 12 months basic salary.
Chairman and non-executive directors The Chairman and the non-executive directors serve the Company under letters of appointment and do not have contracts of service or contracts for services.
Except where appointed at a general meeting, directors stand for election by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting AGM following appointment.
Although the articles of association only require directors to stand for re-election at every third AGM or such earlier AGM as the Board may determine thereafter under Article 49, the Board has resolved that all directors who are willing to continue in office will stand for re-election by the shareholders each year at the AGM.
Either party can terminate the appointment on one months written notice and no compensation is payable in the event of an appointment being terminated early.

A good leaver will typically remain eligible for a pro-rated annual bonus award to be paid after the end of the financial year and will also continue to be eligible to receive a pro-rated number of matching shares under the CIP subject to the normal performance criteria provided the individual holds the relevant proportion of their invested shares until the end of the original three-year performance period.
LTIP awards will typically vest at the normal vesting date for good leavers to the extent that the TSR, EPS and cash conversion performance conditions are met, but will normally be pro-rated on the basis of actual service within the performance period.
In cases of death or disability, individuals are automatically deemed to be good leavers under the plan rules of the LTIP and CIP.
All other good leavers will be defined at the discretion of the Committee on a case-by-case basis.
LTIP awards automatically lapse for those not regarded as good leavers.
In the event of a change of control, for awards under the CIP and LTIP, performance would be measured over the performance period to the date of change of control and awards will vest to the extent that each of the performance conditions is met at that date.
Awards will also normally be pro-rated to reflect the time that has elapsed between the grant of the award and the date of change of control.
The rules of the plans provide the Committee with the discretion to amend the vesting level of CIP matching shares and in relation to the EPS and cash conversion elements of the LTIP, to adjust the vesting level if it considers that the performance conditions would have been met to a greater or lesser extent at the end of the full three-year performance period.
The Committee also retains discretion to vary these provisions on a case-by-case basis.
External appointments Subject to the overriding requirements of the Company, the Committee allows executive directors to accept external appointments where it considers that such appointments will contribute to the directors breadth of knowledge and experience.
Directors are permitted to retain fees associated with such appointments.
Consideration of employment conditions The Committee always takes into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company.
We do not consult directly with employees regarding executive director pay.
Each year the Committee is provided with information on pay trends and ratios of the wider employee population across the Group.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee has actively consulted with major shareholders whenever there have been changes to the remuneration policy in a manner that is receptive and respectful of shareholder views.
Annual report on remuneration This section of the remuneration report details how our Policy was implemented in the year ended 31 July 2014.
Committee members and meeting attendance in 2013 14 The members of the Committee and their attendance at meetings held during the year are set out in the Corporate governance statement on page 91.
Sir George Buckley is absent when his own remuneration as Chairman of the Company is under consideration.
The Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee by invitation but he is not involved in the determination of his own remuneration.
Advisers to the Committee During the year, the Committee received material assistance and advice from the Chief Executive, the HR Director who is also Secretary to the Committee, the Group Director of Reward, Kepler Associates the Committees appointed independent remuneration adviser and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP.
The Company paid a total annual fee of 56,218 to Kepler Associates in relation to remuneration advice to the Remuneration Committee during the year.
Fees were determined on the basis of time and expenses.
During FY2014, Kepler provided the Remuneration Committee with benchmarking analysis of executive and non-executive directors pay, information on market trends, drafting support for this and last years Directors remuneration report, and other relevant assistance on determining directors remuneration.
Kepler was reappointed by the Remuneration Committee via competitive tender in 2013.
Kepler is a founding member, and signatory, of the Remuneration Consultants Group.
Kepler does not provide any other material services to the Group, and the Committee is therefore satisfied that the advice provided by Kepler is objective and independent.
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP was appointed by the Company to advise the Group on various legal matters during the year.
Main activities during the year During the year under review, the Committees main activities included: consideration of market trends and pay levels for executive directors and the Chairman: review of all senior executive salary and bonus payments: target setting for both the Annual Incentive Plan and Long-Term Incentive Plan: performance review of the executive directors against the targets for the financial year: and other activities included consideration of the effectiveness of the incentive arrangements.

The Committee will disclose targets at such a time as they will no longer be deemed to affect the commerciality of Smiths Group.
