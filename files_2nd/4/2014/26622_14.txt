CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 44 Directors remuneration report 1.
Chairmans annual statement quantifiable metrics applied are the same KPIs as are used to evaluate progress against our key business priorities as set out on page 15 of the Annual report.
The 20% qualitative element allows the Committee to reflect its assessment of the business culture and behaviours which underlie and support the directors financial achievement.
The DEIP objectives are set at year 0 and, for awards made in respect of 2015 and future years, at the end of year 3 the Committee reviews the level of achievement according to the scorecard and applies that to the potential level of award to determine the maximum possible award value.
As a final step, the Committee considers whether that value is justified by overall company performance over the period.
If, as was the case in respect of the 2013 award, the Committee considers that the calculated value is not supported by the level of performance, it will exercise discretion to make an appropriate reduction.
I would stress, however, that the Committee cannot apply any upward discretion as this would be Phillip Colebatch, Remuneration Committee Chairman outside the rules of the DEIP and the policy approved by shareholders.
A further point to be emphasised is that since the targets are set in Dear Shareholder advance and the level of achievement against these targets is assessed at the end of the performance period, the proportion of the award I am pleased to present our Directors remuneration report for made is determined, within the limits established by the remuneration 2014 which wewill be submitting to shareholders for approval policy, in much the same way as the proportion of awards vesting is atour 2015 Annual GeneralMeeting.

A number of areas of the Committees effectiveness were tested by means of a written self-assessment completed by members and executive director attendees and suggestions for improvement were invited in each case.
A summary of the findings of the evaluation was presented to the Committee in January and priority areas for 2015 were discussed.
The overall view emerging was that the Committee provided an effective forum for open debate and constructive challenge on executive reward, with members candid discussions and the responsiveness and engagement of executive director attendees being seen as an area of strength.
The Committee commended the executive directors clear differentiation between individual senior managers in their compensation recommendations and believed that due regard was taken of risk and compliance issues in reward decisions.
There was appreciation of the sustained and ongoing shareholder engagement programme and the Chairmans regular feedback on his dialogue with key investors and shareholder representative bodies.
The following priorities were agreed for 2015: providing a comprehensive induction for John Cryan as a new Committee member to enable him to play a full part in Committee decision making as quickly as possible: spending sufficient time on in depth discussion of incentive and reward, including the assessment of the current directors remuneration policy inthe context of the Companys development, the competitive landscape and internal relativities: consideration of managements adherence to the Companys recently published business principles to be built into reward decisions: and continuing the development and update of Committee members knowhow.
2.6 Shareholder voting and engagement At last years AGM, as shown in the table below, some 96% of the votes cast were in favour of our remuneration policy and report and some 97% were in favour of our DEIP.
There was, however, a sizeable level of abstention in respect of the remuneration report.
The Committee sought to understand and address the reasons for the abstention through meetings between the Chairman, key shareholders and shareholder voting bodies in the course of the year.
The Chairmans annual statement explains some of the queries relating to our directors remuneration structure raised by shareholders inthose meetings and we hope that this will help address any uncertainties which may have led to their abstention last year.

As part of this, he acquired a significant shareholding in Man Group and contractually committed to retain those shares for a period.
Along with selected other senior GLG management, he committed to work for the effective integration of GLG into Man Group, to receive only a fixed salary of $1 million and agreed not to be eligible to participate in any bonus plan.
During this period he became a key member of the Man Group senior management team.
These acquisition arrangements subsequently expired and, in recognition of his broad contribution, he was appointed CEO in February 2013.
The Board determined at that time that it would be inappropriate to reduce his salary upon appointment to CEO and that his incentive compensation should transition over a short period to an approach consistent with the arms length market for this role.
Calendar year 2014 was the first year of that transition.
A summary of Mannys achievements against his 2014 objectives is given in Table R3 on page 50.
The Committee concluded that he deserved full credit for his strategic focus, commitment and leadership during 2014 and, therefore, awarded him 100% of the maximum award as his short-term cash bonus for the year.

His base salary was set at that time to reflect this.
Since then, Jonathan has grown to be a seasoned CFO, his performance has been outstanding and his role has expanded to include Operations and Technology, Human Resources, Facilities and Communications.

Payments in lieu are to be made in monthly instalments unless the Company and the executive agreeotherwise.
Unless the Company decides otherwise both executives have a duty to mitigate their losses arising from termination of their employment: any replacement earnings earned in what would otherwise have been the notice period will reduce the obligation on the Company to make payments in lieu.
Short-term annual cash bonus The service contracts do not oblige the Company to pay any cash bonus to executive directors and bonuses are awarded at the Boards discretion following a recommendation from the Remuneration Committee.
Payment of any cash bonus is conditional upon the executive being in employment andnotunder notice at the paymentdate.
Long-term deferred bonus Treatment of deferred bonuses and long-term incentives is governed by the relevant Plan rules.
andincentives To protect the Groups business interests the executive directors service contracts contain covenants which restrict the executives ability to solicit or deal with clients and their ability to solicit senior employees.
Emmanuel Roman has also entered into a broader non-compete covenant for an agreed period post termination.
The Board also has the right at its discretion to require Jonathan Sorrell to comply with a broader non-compete covenant for up to six months post termination to provide additional protection for the Group.
If the Board exercises this right, the Company will pay an additional amount up to six months base salary and the value of pension contributions or alternative cash allowance and certain other insured benefits so that he is not left without income during the time when the Board wishes the non-compete to operate.
This amount is paid in two equal instalments and is reduced byany payments made in lieu of notice.
