com Corporate governance Annual Report 2014 Victrex plc 45 Directors remuneration policy restated from Annual Report 2013 In formulating the remuneration policy, full consideration has been given to the principles set out in the Code and the Committee regularly reviews the policy to ensure it takes due account of best practice and the particular circumstances of the Company.
Consistent with the legislation, the Directors Remuneration Policy Report, the policy for which will operate from 1 October 2013, was put to a binding shareholder vote and became formally effective at the 2014 AGM.
Policy overview The Company aims to provide a remuneration structure that is aligned with shareholder interests and, as such, is competitive in the marketplace to retain and motivate executive Directors of superior calibre in order to deliver continued growth of the business.
Company policy is that performance related components should form a significant portion of the overall remuneration package, with maximum total potential rewards being earned through the achievement of challenging performance targets based on measures that represent the best interests of shareholders.
Consideration of shareholder views The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year at a meeting immediately following the AGM.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time, is then considered as part of the Companys annual review of remuneration policy.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee will seek to engage directly with major shareholders and their representative bodies should any material changes be made to the remuneration policy.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years remuneration report and any matters discussed with shareholders during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary increases and remuneration for the executive Directors.
Employees have not been consulted in respect of the design of the Companys senior executive remuneration policy to date, although the Committee will keep this under review.

2 The following differences exist between the Companys policy for the remuneration of executive Directors as set out above and its approach to the payment of employees generally: A lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity or zero bonus opportunity may apply to employees other than the executive Directors and certain senior executives.
Benefits offered to other employees generally comprise provision of healthcare and company car benefits where required for the role or to meet market norms.
The majority of employees participate in local defined contribution pension arrangements.
A small number remain in the UK defined benefits section which closed to new entrants in 2002.
Participation in the LTIP is limited to the executive Directors and certain selected senior managers.
Other employees are eligible to participate in the Companys share option schemes.
In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the various categories of individuals.
They also reflect the fact that, in the case of the executive Directors and senior executives, a greater emphasis tends to be placed on performance related pay.
3 T he choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflect the Committees belief that any incentive compensation should beappropriately challenging and tied to both the delivery of profit growth and specific individual objectives.
4 T he TSR and EPS performance conditions applicable to the LTIP were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery oflong-term returns to shareholders and the Groups financial growth and are consistent with the Companys objective of delivering superior levels of long-term value to shareholders.
The TSR performance condition is monitored onthe Committees behalf by New Bridge Street whilst the Groups EPS growth is derived from the audited financial statements.
5 T he Committee operates share plans in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC where relevant.
TheCommittee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plans.
6 All employee share plans SAYE and AESOP do not operate performance conditions.
Executive Directors do not participate in the Victrex 2005 Executive Share Option Plan ESOP which is the primary share incentive arrangement for below Board executives.
7 As highlighted above, the Company has a share ownership policy which requires the executive Directors to build up and maintain a target holding equal to100% of base salary.
8 F or the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors such as the payment of a pension or the vesting exercise of past share awards.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.

Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
For an internal executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and or incidental expenses as appropriate.

For good leavers, awards will normally vest on cessation, subject to the satisfaction of therelevant performance conditions at that time and reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.
However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine that awards vest at a later date and or to disapply time pro-rating.

Any amount of bonus will only be payable if, in the opinion of the Committee, there is an improvement in the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group during the year ending 30 September 2015.
Deferral into shares for any part of the Chief Executives bonus above 100% of salary and the claw back provisions for all executive Directors will continue to apply.
Long-term incentives Consistent with past awards, the extent to which LTIP awards which will be granted in 2015 will vest will be dependent on two independent performance conditions 50% determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return TSR and 50% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS, as follows: the TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 25% on a pro-rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance: and the EPS element of an award will vest in full if EPS growth exceeds inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, by an average of 12% per annum or more over the three year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 20% on a pro-rata basis if EPS growth exceeds inflation by an average of 5% per annum over the period and is reduced to nil if EPS growth fails to exceed inflation by 5% per annum.
As set out in the 2013 Directors Remuneration Policy Report, awards granted from December 2013 onwards are subject to a clawback provision.
Non-executive Directors The Companys approach to non-executive Directors remuneration is set by the Board with account taken of the time and responsibility involved in each role, including, where applicable, the Chairmanship of Board Committees.

Annual bonus payments The annual bonus outturn presented in the table below was based on performance against growth in Group profit before tax and an element of achievement against both shared and individual personal performance measured over the 2014 financial year.

Final bonus outcome is determined by calculating the pay-out based on achievement of PBT growth targets and personal performance based on the Committees assessment of achievement of personal objectives set at the beginning of the year.
Personal objectives are set for each individual and relate to organisational development of the Group, acceleration of overall growth strategy, and development strengthening of the management team.
