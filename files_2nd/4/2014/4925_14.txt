The Committee will also consider Group relativities when setting base salary levels The Committee may set initial base salaries below the perceived market rate with the aim to make multi-year staged increases to achieve the desired market position over time.

Details of variable pay earned in the year Annual bonus plan The incentive for the financial year ended 28 December 2014 was in the form of a cash bonus based on performance against a combination offinancial targets, set to require a significant increase in the Groups underlying PBT, and non-financial targets, set to reflect a number of the Companys strategic priorities.
The financial targets applying to the bonus operated on a banded bonus scale commencing at 20% through to 50% of bonus at target levels of performance through to 150% for Chief Executive Officer, although pro rated for the period of service in the role or 125% for Chief Financial Officer of salary at maximum performance levels.

Graduated scale Maximum: 60.5m operates between performance points The non-financial targets set for the Chief Executive Officer related to a number of key strategic objectives for 2014 which included: o exceeding UK like-for-likesales growth by 3%: o effective working with franchisees: and o delivering against pre-set milestones in the international businesses.
Dominos Pizza Group plc 56 Annual Report & Accounts 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Details of variable pay earned in the year continued Annual bonus plan continued In addition for any bonus to become payable in relation to the above non-financial targets, the threshold level of profitability included in the PBT target is required to be met.
The extent of achievement against financial targets was as detailed above at 48.2% of maximum.
The Committees assessment of performance against the above objectives concluded that the non-financial targets had been fully met resulting in 100% out-turn inthis part of the bonus.
In aggregate, therefore, the total bonus payable to the Chief Executive Officer was 58.6% of the maximum which resulted in a total bonus, pro rated for his period of service, becoming payable at 292,727.
With regards to Sean Wilkins, the Chief Financial Officer from 2 April 2014 through to the end of the year under review, his non-financial objectives included delivering against pre-set milestones in the international businesses as noted above for the Chief Executive Officer in addition to targets relating toestablishing an upgraded financial reporting system and increasing the capability of the finance team.
However, in light of his cessation ofemployment, a payment in lieu of any entitlement to bonus in respect of the year under review, and the part year of employment in the current financial year, was agreed at 100,000 following external advice received by the Company.
In light of this payment, a formal testing of the bonus targets was not undertaken for the Chief Financial Officer although the Committee took comfort from the fact that had a bonus been based on the above targets, the payment would have been higher than the 100,000 payment given the extent of achievement against the financial target alone.
With regards to Lee Ginsberg who remained eligible for a bonus award for the period of the year under review to 2 April 2014 as a result of his being treated as a good leaver in connection with his retirement, his bonus targets were as detailed above with his non-financial objectives including delivering against pre-set milestones in the international businesses and also delivering an effective handover to his successor and completion of all work in connection with the 2014 audit cycle.
The Committees assessment of performance against the above objectives concluded that the non-financial targets had been achieved by 75% of this part ofthe bonus.
In aggregate, therefore, the total bonus payable to the Chief Financial Officer for the period through to2 April 2014 was at 53.5% of the maximum which resulted in a total bonus, pro-rated for his period of service, becoming payable at 46,559.
The previous Chief Executive Officer did not participate in the 2014 APB in light of his resignation.
LTIPs audited Given the recent appointments of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, neither had any awards vesting based on performance during the year ended 28 December 2014.
In line with the discretions afforded to the Committee and as disclosed in last years Directors remuneration report, with regard to Lee Ginsbergs retirement from the Board, he was treated as a good leaver in relation to his 2012 LTIP.
The performance period for this award ended on 28December 2014 andhis award will vest, subject to performance measured over the full performance period, on 2 April 2015.
The number of shares comprising this option award will be pro rated for the proportion of the vesting period between the grant date 2 April 2012 and the date ofretirement 2 April 2014 relative to the original three-year vesting period.
The award was made on 2 April 2012.

Three-year performance period, no retesting, straight-line vesting between the points As a result of remaining in employment for 24 months of the three-year vesting period, his award was the subject of a pro rata reduction based on two thirds: this resulted in the maximum number of shares comprising the option eligible to vest being 163,731.
For the purposes of these calculations the share price over the three-month period ending on 28 December 2014 has been used to calculate the value of the award on vesting.
In addition, as disclosed in last years Directors remuneration report, the award granted to Lee Ginsberg in place of his 2013 LTIP award following his retirement from the Board vested during the year under review.
The award was a pro rated one-third of a normal LTIP award based on the Companys historic LTIP policy which represented 100% of salary worth of share options on which he received the growth in value over 5.28 per share to the date of his retirement, subject to satisfaction of a number of individual objectives set by the Committee The vesting of this award is detailed below in the table: Value of award Number of awards granted Exercise price Vesting period Performance conditions Performance achieved Vesting % on vesting 52,801 options 528.3p 2 April 2012 Completion of work in 2014 Annual Report and 100% 293,573.56 to2April 2014 connection with the sign off Accounts signed off by the of the Companys Annual Company's auditor and an Report and Accounts for orderly handover completed 2014 and achieving an orderly handover of responsibilities The share price on vesting was 556p, resulting in a net gain of 14,626.
