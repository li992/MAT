SPORTS DIRECT INTERNATIONAL PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 33 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT STATEMENT FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Dear Shareholder, On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our report on the remuneration strategy and policy of the Company at the end of yet another very successful year.
We firmly believe that this continued success is strongly connected with the introduction of our Employee and Executive Bonus Share Schemes in 2009 and 2011.
The schemes are designed to recognise and reward outstanding performance and have clearly driven shareholder value.
New regulations have come into effect which impact the presentation and disclosure of Directors remuneration, and the lay-out of this report reflects those new regulations.
This report is, therefore, presented in two sections: the Annual Report on Remuneration and the Directors Remuneration Policy.
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details on the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 27 April 2014 and will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM.
The Directors Remuneration Policy sets out the forward-looking remuneration policy that will be subject to a binding vote at the AGM and shall take binding effect from the end of the Companys 2014 15 financial year.
The Remuneration Policy of the Company is aligned to its commercial strategy for long-term, consistent and profitable growth.
The remuneration package for Senior Executives is highly weighted towards performance-related remuneration, paid mostly in shares, and its design is consistent with the reward philosophy for the wider employee population.
This strategy is reflective of an extremely strong Executive and employee performance culture and a reward ethos of One Team.
The Company philosophy is that Executive remuneration should be simple, transparent and directly support the delivery of the business strategy and shareholder return.
The Executive Directors basic salaries have been deliberately set at a level well below the lower quartile of a business of the size and complexity of the Group.
Indeed these salaries have remained the same since 2002 and again will not increase in 2014 15.
Also, the Senior Executives currently enjoy no additional benefits from the Company.
The Executive Directors do not receive an annual bonus.
Rather, to drive sustained long-term business performance, instead of granting smaller awards on an annual basis, larger upfront awards are granted which only vest if significant and consistent growth is delivered year on year.
Annual performance targets which must be hit ensure a focus is maintained on a consistent and long-term profitable growth strategy.
The extended time horizon for vesting of awards for the 2011 Executive Bonus Share Scheme is six years in 2017.
Clear, published and stretching annual performance targets must be fully satisfied before any of the share awards vest.
Aligned to the Companys high performance culture, the Employee and Executive Bonus Share Schemes are designed on the basis that awards should vest in full for achieving stretching targets i. e. with an `all or nothing vesting schedule rather than providing for a lower level of vesting for meeting a threshold target rising to full vesting for achieving the stretch targets i. e. a scaled vesting schedule.
Because the Executive Directors remuneration opportunity is highly weighted towards performance-related remuneration which will not vest if stretching performance targets aligned with the business strategy are not met, they share risk with the shareholders.
The size of these performance-only awards should be considered in this context.
The Remuneration Committee firmly believes that this simple and very transparent share incentive framework is totally aligned with both the Company strategy for growth and its performance culture.
We also believe that this strategy has directly driven the historic and continued out-performance of stretch targets originally set by the Committee by further aligning Executive and employee remuneration potential to increased and on-going shareholder value.
This increased share value incentive has also led to a further lifting of the performance bar for future awards.
There is no doubt that since the inception of the current remuneration strategy in 2009, it has clearly led to strong shareholder value increases during a difficult economic period, and has provided a strong platform for the on-going and long-term success of the Company.
Specifically tailored to Company culture and growth strategy we continue to review the robustness of the scheme.
During 2013 14 the Remuneration Committee re-assessed the shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors and determined that the Executive Directors must now hold a minimum shareholding of 50,000 while they remain employed by the Company.
As noted on page 39 Dave Forseys shareholding on 27 April 2014 meant that he satisfied the guideline and held shares with a value equal to approximately 260% of his salary.
On 2 July 2014, we were pleased to announce that the resolution to approve the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme was passed, with a majority of shareholders eligible to vote on the resolution voting in favour the Executive Directors elected not to vote.
Under the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme all eligible employees including Executive Directors who meet the qualifying conditions and performance criteria as determined and agreed by the Remuneration Committee and the Board will be able to participate.
The terms of the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme provide for the grant of nil-cost options over up to 25 million ordinary shares in the Company amounting to approximately 4.2% of the issued share capital of the Company.
The vesting of any options would be conditional upon the achievement by the Company of all the following EBITDA targets before scheme costs : i FY16 of 480 million: ii FY17 of 570 million: iii FY18 of 650 million: and iv FY19 of 750 million.
If these performance targets are all met, 25% of any award would vest following the announcement of the Companys audited results for FY19 in July 2019 and 75% of the award would vest following the announcement of the Companys audited results for FY21 in July 2021.
To date Mike Ashley has not received any remuneration from the Company since before the public offering in February 2007, nor has he participated in the Executive Share Bonus Scheme.
Despite being eligible to participate in the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme, following discussions with the Committee Mike Ashley has informed the Company and the Committee that he does not wish to participate in the scheme, nor does he expect any share based incentive scheme to be proposed to shareholders in relation to his role as an Executive Director while the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme is in place.
He remains fully committed to achieving the stretching targets of the scheme.
The Board considers the leadership of Mike Ashley to be essential to the Company and we are grateful that shareholders have now recognised the huge impact of our proven and innovative share scheme on the success of the Company, its Executives and employees.
It has always been our intention to continue with the existing highly performance-geared remuneration policy for our Executives, i. e. low salary, no annual bonus or additional benefits, and the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme allows us to continue on this path.
We are committed to further building an open and transparent engagement with our investors and employees.
We believe that a key objective of the Directors Remuneration Report is to communicate clearly how much our Executive Directors are earning, how this is very clearly linked to the performance of the Company and is of benefit to our shareholders.

Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any bonus or share schemes.

INFORMATION SUPPORTING THE POLICY TABLE Prior to the introduction of the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme, awards were granted to Executive Directors under the Executive Bonus Share Scheme.
One award held by an Executive Director remains outstanding under the Executive Bonus Share Scheme as referred to on page 39.
Other than where the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme is not in place for example, if one of the Adjusted Underlying EBITDA targets is not met so that awards under the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme lapse or where an award is to be granted in connection with the recruitment of an Executive Director as referred to on page 36, no further awards will be granted to Executive Directors of the Company under the Executive Bonus Share Scheme during the period for which this policy applies.
The Committee may amend the terms of the Executive Bonus Share Scheme, the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme or any awards granted under them within the scope defined in the rules of those schemes including in the event of a variation of the Companys share capital or a demerger or special dividend which may, in the Committees opinion, affect the current or future value of shares and may elect to settle awards under those schemes in cash.
EXPLANATION OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES CHOSEN For the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme, underlying Group EBITDA is chosen because it is a measure that provides a simple and transparent basis on which to measure the Companys performance over the longer term and to provide alignment with the Companys business strategy.
In addition, the Committee considers it to be a robust measurement of sustained earnings growth for shareholders.
This measurement has been consistently and publicly used by the Company as a performance measure since the floatation in 2007.
In respect of each relevant year, the Committee will adjust reported underlying Group EBITDA as it considers appropriate.
Underlying Group EBITDA is calculated prior to any charges relating to any Bonus Share Scheme s outstanding at the relevant time.
EXPLANATION OF DIFFERENCES IN REMUNERATION POLICY FOR OTHER EMPLOYEES The Company has a large number of employees with different responsibilities and differing levels of seniority.
Reward policies for employees other than Executive Directors are determined by reference to grade, role, performance and other relevant factors.
The Committee does not consult with the wider employee population about the remuneration policy for Directors.
However, the Committee has reviewed the salaries, other remuneration and other employment conditions of senior and middle managers throughout the Group, and has taken them into account in considering Directors salaries and the creation of new incentive schemes in order to create a sense of common purpose and sharing of success.
Indeed, in order to reflect the Companys One Team ethos, the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme applies to both Executives and eligible employees who meet the qualifying conditions as determined and agreed by the Committee on the same basis including the performance conditions.
ILLUSTRATIONS OF APPLICATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY The charts below set out an illustration of the policy for 2014 15 in line with the future policy table above.
The charts provide an illustration of the total remuneration opportunity that could arise under three different levels of performance.
No chart is included for Mike Ashley, who does not receive any remuneration from the Company and does not participate in any share scheme.

The value of the award is then calculated based on a share price of 7.045 being the price at the close of business on 15 July 2014 when this report was approved by the Committee and one quarter of this value is then shown, representing the intention to grant one award under the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme, the vesting of which will be subject to EBITDA performance targets measured over a period of four financial years FY16, FY17, FY18 and FY19.
The vesting of any awards is conditional upon the achievement by the Company of all four EBITDA targets under the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme.
Total remuneration 000 GOVERNANCE 36 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION When agreeing a remuneration package for the appointment of a new Executive Director, the Committee will apply the following principles: given that the high gearing of reward for performance over a long period and a low basic salary may result in a cash flow issue for any new Executive Director, the intention is to move the Director appropriately and in a timely manner onto an equal footing with other Executive Directors: the package will be sufficient to attract the calibre of Director required to deliver the Companys strategy: the Committee will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary: and in the next Annual Report on remuneration, the Committee will explain to shareholders the rationale for the arrangements implemented.
The Committee will ordinarily seek to implement the remuneration package in accordance with the elements referred to in the policy table on pages 34 and 35.
The Committee retains discretion to make appropriate remuneration decisions outside that policy including the ability to grant awards under the Executive Bonus Share Scheme to meet the individual circumstances of the recruitment, subject to the limits and parameters of this recruitment remuneration section of the Directors Remuneration Report.
ELEMENT APPROACH Base salary and benefits Aligned with the policy set out in the policy table on page 34 if the new Executive Director participates in the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme at the same level as existing Executive Directors other than Mike Ashley.
Retirement benefits Aligned with the policy set out in the policy table on page 34 if the new Executive Director participates in the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme.
Otherwise, up to 20% of salary paid to a pension arrangement or paid as a supplement to base salary in lieu of a pension arrangement until the new Executive Director joins that scheme.
2015 Bonus Share The Remuneration Committees intention is for a newly-appointed Executive Director to participate in the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme with an award Scheme of up to 1 million shares subject to such adjustment as the Committee determines to reflect any variation in the Companys share capital i. e. up to the maximum level referred to in the policy table, but reduced to reflect the new Executive Directors shortened period of service.
Variable remuneration In recognition of the fact that a newly appointed Executive Directors award under the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme would not vest until 2019, the Committee may award a newly appointed Executive Director an award over up to 1 million shares subject to such adjustment as the Committee determines to reflect any change in the Companys share capital under the Executive Bonus Share Scheme or a similar scheme, the vesting of which would be subject to the same performance conditions as apply to existing awards under the Executive Bonus Share Scheme or other stretching performance conditions determined by the Committee.
In addition, until such time as the newly appointed Executive Director participates in the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme, he or she may be awarded an annual or longer-term incentive opportunity of up to 200% of salary per annum.
Maximum variable The maximum level of variable remuneration that may be awarded to a new Executive Director is: remuneration a. an award over up to 1 million shares subject to such adjustment as the Committee determines to reflect any change in the Companys share capital under the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme but reduced to reflect any variable remuneration awarded as referred to in c below : b. an award over up to 1 million shares subject to such adjustment as the Committee determines to reflect any change in the Companys share capital under the Executive Bonus Share Scheme or a similar scheme: and c. until such time as he or she participates in the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme, an annual or longer-term incentive opportunity of up to 200% of salary per annum.
In each case, the value of any buy-out arrangements described below does not count towards the maximum.
Compensation for The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buy-out the remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous forfeited arrangements employer.
In doing so, the Committee will have regard to relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to such arrangements and whether such conditions were achieved, the form of those arrangements e. g. cash or shares and the timeframe of such arrangements.
While such awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to below, the Committees intention is that the value awarded would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements.
Buy-out awards will be subject to forfeiture or clawback on early departure, with 100% being subject to forfeiture if the Executive departs within 12 months of joining, and a sliding scale down to 50% if the departure occurs within 12 and 24 months of joining, at the Committees discretion.
Relocation costs If necessary, the Company will pay appropriate relocation costs.
The Committee will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under the Companys existing share schemes.
If necessary and subject, where relevant, to the limits referred to above, awards may be granted outside existing share plans as permitted under the Listing Rules, which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of an Executive Director.
Where a position is filled internally, any on-going remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue according to their subsisting terms.
The remuneration package for a newly appointed Non-Executive Director would normally be in line with the policy set out in the future policy table above for Non-Executive Directors.
SPORTS DIRECT INTERNATIONAL PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 37 SERVICE CONTRACTS AND POLICY ON PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE The Companys policy is for Executive Directors to be employed on the terms of service contracts which may be terminated by either the Company or the Executive Director on the giving of not less than 12 months notice.
Executive Directors Details of each current service contract are set out below: Contract date Unexpired term notice period Proper law Mike Ashley 11 02 2007 12 Months England & Wales Dave Forsey 11 02 2007 12 Months England & Wales The principles on which the determination of payments for loss of office will be approached are summarised below: The Company may terminate an Executive Directors employment with immediate effect by making a payment in lieu of notice consisting of: basic salary for the notice period: if the Executive Director participates in an annual bonus scheme, a pro-rated amount reflecting completed months of service in the year of termination assuming on target performance: Payment in lieu either the cost of providing other benefits other than pension and bonus that the Executive Director would have been entitled to during the notice period of notice or an amount equal to 10% of base salary or alternatively the Company may continue to provide benefits for the remainder of the notice period that would have applied.

In accordance with the current policy as set out in the policy table on page 34, no annual bonus scheme is offered to existing Executive Directors.
Were an Executive Director to participate in an annual bonus arrangement, whether to award a bonus in full or in part in the event of a termination of employment Annual bonus would be at the discretion of the Committee on an individual basis and dependent on a number of factors, including the circumstances of the Executive Directors departure and his contribution to the business during the bonus period in question.
Typically bonus amounts would be pro-rated for time in service to termination.
2015 Bonus If a participant in the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme or Executive Bonus Share Scheme ceases employment before the performance conditions attaching to an Share Scheme award under that scheme are satisfied, the award will lapse.
If the participant ceases employment after the performance conditions are satisfied but before and Executive the vesting dates as a result of his death or any other reason determined at the discretion of the Committee, the award will vest: in the case of a reason Bonus Share other than death, the extent of vesting will be determined by the Committee at its absolute discretion taking into account the time that has elapsed between Scheme grant and cessation.

In appropriate circumstances, payments may also be made in respect of legal fees.
Were the Company to make an award on recruitment of an Executive Director to buy out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer then the leaver provisions for that award would be determined at the time of grant.
In the event of a change of control of the Company or other relevant corporate event, unvested awards under the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme and the Executive Bonus Share Scheme will lapse unless the performance conditions are satisfied and the event occurs between satisfaction of the conditions and the vesting date, in which case the award shall vest.
In the case of the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme the extent of vesting shall be determined by the Committee taking into account the period of time that has elapsed between the grant date and the date of the relevant event and in the case of the Executive Bonus Share Scheme the awards shall vest in full unless the Committee determines otherwise.

SPORTS DIRECT INTERNATIONAL PLC GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 39 SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES AND TOTAL SHAREHOLDINGS OF DIRECTORS The Board believes it is important that Executive Directors have a significant holding in the capital of the Company.
In order to participate in the Executive Bonus Share Scheme, there were internal guidelines that the Executive Directors would be required to maintain a minimum level of shareholding in the Company equivalent to one years salary while they remain employed by the Company.
However, these guidelines can be waived with the permission of the Board.
The Committee has raised the required shareholding value of Executive Directors to 50,000 shares while employed by the Company in 2014.
Dave Forseys beneficial shareholding on 27 April 2014 was 50,000 shares and, based on a share price of 7.79 being the price at the close of business on 25 April 2014, the last trading day before Sunday 27 April 2014 the value of that holding was 389,500.
