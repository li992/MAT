Overall turnover and adjusted profitability increased, underpinned by another very strong performance by the Groups UK business.

The levels of variable remuneration paid out to the Executive Directors for the 2014 financial year reflect this, but also a recognition from the Board that the performance of the Groups French business was poor, and the Groups performance in Germany was slightly disappointing, albeit that this improved throughout the course of the year and finished on an upward trend.

The Group Company Secretary is the secretary to the Committee.
The principal adviser to the Committee is Mercer Limited Mercer, who was first selected by the Committee in 2010 by way of a tender process.
During the year, Mercer provided advice to the Company principally in respect of the consultation undertaken with the Groups largest shareholders concerning the addition of a second performance criterion for its Performance Share Plan Scheme.

The total fees paid by the Company to Mercer in 2014 in respect of this advice was 39,957.

2015 Base Salaries The Base Salaries of the CEO and CFO have not been increased since 2011 and 2012 respectively, and will remain unchanged in 2015.
2015 Annual Bonus Scheme There will be two elements to the annual bonus in 2015.
The main part of the bonus pays up to 130 per cent of Base Salary for the CEO and up to 100 per cent of Base Salary for the CFO, and will operate in the usual way based upon the performance of the business, as illustrated below: Mike Norris CEO Tony Conophy CFO 2015 2015 Pro t Group pro t before tax Pro t Group pro t before tax up to 50% up to 50% Services contribution growth Services contribution growth up to 15% up to 10% Average cash balance Cost savings up to 15% up to 10% Personal objectives Average cash balance up to 20% up to 10% Personal objectives up to 20% The proposed levels for 2015 have been set to be challenging relative to our 2015 business plan.
The targets themselves, as they relate to the 2015 financial year, are deemed by the Committee to be commercially sensitive and therefore have not been disclosed.
They will be disclosed at such time as the Committee no longer deems them to be commercially sensitive.
73 In addition, the Remuneration Committee has decided to increase the 2015 bonus opportunity to the Executive Directors on a one-off basis, following the divestment of RDC by the Group.
The bonus opportunity equates to a maximum of 300,000 each for the CEO and CFO, which represents 60 per cent of Base Salary for the CEO and 92.3 per cent of Base Salary for the CFO.
These payments are payable contingent on shareholder value being secured through the successful implementation of the Operating Agreement entered into between Computacenter and RDC under its new ownership, and the overall performance of the Group in 2015.
This second element of bonus is a one-off item that it is anticipated will apply for 2015 only.
The aggregate potential payment of both items is within the limits set by Computacenters Directors Remuneration Policy maximum of 200 per cent of Base Salary.
2015 PSP Scheme The award levels of Performance Shares for the Executive Directors in the 2015 financial year are 200 per cent of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 175 per cent of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
The 2015 financial year LTIP awards will be subject to the following performance conditions: A Compound Growth of Company Earnings per Share 70 per cent of total vesting criteria Threshold Maximum Below Threshold Vesting On-target 100% 0% vesting 25% vesting 50% vesting vesting Compound Growth of Company Earnings per Share than 5% 5% 8.33% 12.5% In respect of the growth of Earnings per Share, awards will vest on a straight line between these points.
These targets will require management to deliver a strong, sustainable performance over the period.
B Growth in the Companys total services revenue 30 per cent of total vesting criteria Following a consultation with the Companys top 15 shareholders by size of holding during the year, the Committee approved the addition of a second performance criterion for the Performance Share Plan.
Whilst the Committee deems the actual services revenue growth targets to be commercially sensitive, these will be disclosed by the Company at the time of vesting.
