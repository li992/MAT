Strategic report Governance Financial Shareholder statements information RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 49 Directors remuneration report: Remuneration committee chairmans annual statement D ear Shareholder On behalf of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to present the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2014.
This report sets out the remuneration policy for the directors of RPC Group Plc and discloses amounts paid to them over the course of the financial year and proposed remuneration for the forthcoming year.
This report complies with the new reporting regulations, published by the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills during 2013 and will be subject to two shareholder votes at the forthcoming AGM: t The Directors remuneration policy sets out the directors remuneration policy for the Company from the date of the AGM in July 2014 and will apply for the next 3 years unless shareholder approval S Rojahn is obtained to make changes to the policy in the interim.
The policy will be subject to a binding Chairman of the shareholder vote: and  t The Annual report on remuneration provides details of the remuneration earned by directors in the year to 31 March 2014 and how the policy will be implemented for the year ending 31 March 2015 and will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote.
Remuneration Outcomes in 2013 14 For the year under review, the Remuneration Committee considers the remuneration of executive directors to fairly reect their individual performance whilst reecting the challenges the Company has faced in a difficult macro-economic environment in the UK and Eurozone.
Notwithstanding both the difficult trading conditions and challenging targets, the performance against the PBIT profit before interest and tax annual bonus target was above stretch and the free cash ow and ROCE before taking account of the acquisitions during the year moderators were also achieved.
As a result, a bonus of 100% of maximum is payable to the executive directors for the year ended 31 March 2014.
The 2011 Performance Share Plan PSP award which vests in August 2014, based on performance over the three year period up to and including 31 March 2014, will vest at 49.0% in respect of the EPS performance targets being partially achieved.
Remuneration Policy for 2014 15 The Remuneration Committee continually reviews the executive remuneration policy to ensure it promotes the attraction, retention and incentivisation of executives to deliver the Groups strategy.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the existing remuneration policy remains t for purpose and, as such, no changes to the policy have been made for 2014 15.
Specically: t xed pay levels remain appropriately positioned against the market a 1.0% to 1.3% increase to basic salary was awarded to executive directors with effect from 1 April 2014 : t the structure of the annual bonus remains appropriate to incentivise the delivery of annual objectives.
The maximum bonus opportunity for 2014 15 will remain at 100% of salary for the executive directors and the target structure will be similar to those operated in the previous year: t the long term incentive policy continues to act as an effective mechanism to reward long term internal and external growth and provides alignment between executives and shareholders.
PSP awards to be granted in 2014 will therefore continue to be based on stretching EPS and relative TSR total shareholder return targets.
I hope that you will be supportive of the two resolutions to approve the Directors remuneration report at this years AGM.
Yours sincerely, S Rojahn Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 09 June 2014 50 RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Directors remuneration report: Directors remuneration policy Policy Overview The objective of our remuneration policy is to attract, retain and incentivise a high calibre of senior management who can direct the business and deliver the Groups core objective of growth in shareholder value by building a business that is capable of delivering long-term, sustainable and growing cash ows.

Strategic report Governance Financial Shareholder statements information RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 51 Consideration of Employment Conditions Elsewhere in the Group In determining the remuneration of the Groups directors, the Committee takes into account the pay arrangements and terms and conditions across the Group as a whole.
Whilst employees were not directly consulted, the Committee seeks to ensure that the underlying principles which form the basis for decisions on directors pay are consistent with those on which pay decisions for the rest of the workforce are taken.
There are some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for the executive directors and other senior employees, which the Remuneration Committee believes are necessary to reect the different levels of responsibility of employees across the Company.
The key differences in remuneration policy between the executive directors and employees across the Group are the increased emphasis on performance related pay and the inclusion of a share-based PSP for executive directors.
The PSP is not granted to employees outside of the most senior executives as they are reserved for those anticipated as having the greatest potential to inuence Group level performance.
Key Elements of the Remuneration Policy for Directors Set out below is a summary of the main elements of the remuneration policy for directors, together with further information on how these aspects of remuneration operate.
This policy, subject to shareholder approval, will become formally effective from the date of the Annual General Meeting in July 2014 andwill apply for three years unless shareholder approval is obtained to make changes in the interim.

52 RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Directors remuneration report: Directors remuneration policy continued Notes: The Committee has given careful consideration to the performance measures applicable to both the annual bonus and the PSP.
The annual bonus measure is primarily based on growth in adjusted PBIT profit before interest and tax which the Committee believes appropriately rewards directors for growing the business whilst maintaining a suitable profit margin.
As a result of the Committees desire to further align management performance with the Companys key objectives, bonus moderators may operate to reduce payouts for failure to achieve targeted levels in certain areas.
The Committee retains discretion over the calculation of adjusted PBIT and the moderators in order to appropriately adjust for any material one-off items including but not limited to : major acquisitions and changes in accounting policies.
PSP performance measures incentivise sustained growth in adjusted EPS and the generation of TSR total shareholder return.
The adjusted EPS measure appropriately captures the impact of managements decisions and actions in areas such as product efficiency, margin improvement and efficient use of financial resources.
TSR is a clear indicator of the relative success of the Group in delivering shareholder value and, as a performance measure, rmly aligns the interests of directors and shareholders.
The EPS target range will be assessed annually and will normally be based on outperformance of a relevant ination index.
Performance against the adjusted EPS and TSR targets will be independently calculated and reviewed by the Committee.
The Committee retains discretion over the calculation of adjusted EPS in order to appropriately adjust for any material one-off items including but not limited to : major acquisitions, changes in accounting policies and major share issues.
The Committee operates share plans in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC where relevant.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plans.
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors remuneration policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors.
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Illustration of Application of Remuneration Policy The balance of the potential remuneration package available for executive directors is weighted towards variable pay elements, which have stretching performance targets attached to them.
The chart below shows the value of the executive directors packages under three performance scenarios, minimum, on-target and maximum: Basic Salary, Benets and Pension Annual Bonus PSP Award 1,750 1,655 1,500 36% 1,250 1,124 1,099 1,000 26% 36% 750 746 28% 21% 593 26% 500 28% 392 21% 250 100% 53% 36% 100% 53% 36% 0 Minimum Target Maximum Minimum Target Maximum P R M Vervaat S J Kesterton Notes: 1.
P R M Vervaats remuneration has been converted into using the exchange rate prevailing on 31 March 2014 being 1:1.2074.
Salary levels are based on those applying from 1 April 2014.
Benets have been estimated based on the cost of provision in the year-ending 31 March 2014.
Pension cost is estimated at 20% of annual basic salary applicable at 1 April 2014.
For illustrative purposes and in the interests of simplicity, the target annual bonus and PSP have both been assumed to be 50% of the maximum values see below.
The maximum bonus potential is 100% of base salary.
The maximum value of the PSP is taken to be 100% of the face value of the award at grant i. e. 125% of salary.
No share price appreciation has been assumed for the deferred bonus shares and PSP awards.
Approach to Recruitment and Promotions The remuneration package for a new executive director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Companys prevailing approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract the most appropriate candidate and may be set initially at a below mid-market level on the basis that it may progress towards the mid-market level once expertise and performance has been proven and sustained.
The annual bonus potential would be limited to 100% of salary and grants under the PSP would normally be limited to 125% of salary with the capability to grant 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based awards to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer.
The Committee would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
000s Strategic report Governance Financial Shareholder statements information RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 53 For an internal executive director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.

54 RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Directors remuneration report: Annual report on remuneration Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for the Year Ending 31 March 2015 The Remuneration Committee awarded the executive directors an increase in basic salary in March 2014, which was effective from 1 April 2014: 1 Basic salary From 1 April 2013 From 1 April 2014 Increase P R M Vervaat 564,000 569,640 1.0% S J Kesterton 310,000 314,000 1.3% 1.
Salary with effect from 1 May 2013 for P R M Vervaat.
The increase excluding promotion and increases in responsibility across the Groups UK employees was up to 2% for the 2014 pay review.
Pension Arrangements Recent changes in Dutch legislation are increasing the standard retirement age in retirement plans and reducing the maximum amount that can be accrued under the current pension arrangement for P R M Vervaat.
During the year ending 31 March 2015, the pension arrangement for P R M Vervaat will be reviewed with a view to retaining the current plan or replacing it with a dened contribution arrangement.
The employers obligation will continue to be capped at a maximum of 20% of salary.
S J Kesterton continues to participate in a dened contribution pension plan in the UK with an employers pension contribution of 9% and a salary supplement of 11% making up the maximum of 20% of salary.
Performance Targets for the 2014 15 Annual Bonus The performance conditions for the annual bonus for the financial year ending 31 March 2015 will continue to be based on the Groups adjusted PBIT with a sliding bonus scale commencing at 0% of salary for a challenging threshold level of performance.
Full bonus payout 100% of salary will result for achieving the stretch level of performance, with 50% of the maximum bonus payable for achieving 57% of the target range between threshold and stretch levels.
The adjusted PBIT will exclude the results for the recently acquired Ace Corporation Holdings Ltd. As a result of the Committees desire to ensure the long term financial health of the Company and to align management performance targets with wider stakeholders, a reported accident frequency rate RAFR moderator will be introduced.
Consequently, bonuses for the year ending 31 March 2015 will be reduced by: t 9% if the health and safety RAFR for the calendar year 2014 is not reduced compared with the calendar year 2013: t 8% if the targeted level of free cash ow generation is not achieved: and t 8% if the targeted ROCE is not achieved.
The Committee deems the performance targets for the upcoming year to be commercially sensitive and has therefore taken the decision to not disclose the targets in advance.
The performance targets and performance against them will be disclosed retrospectively in next years Directors remuneration report when the Committee is comfortable that the information is no longer commercially sensitive.
The maximum bonus potential will continue to be 100% of salary for the executive directors.
Of the bonus payable, 50% will be paid in cash and the remaining 50% is paid as deferred shares which are held for 3 years subject to continued employment.
An exceptional negative event provision operates and the deferred bonus is subject to claw back provisions.
Performance Targets for PSP Awards to be Granted in 2014 15 The Committee reviewed the performance targets in the year and decided that in view of the continued low level of growth in GDP in mainland Europe, where the majority of the Groups revenue arises, the threshold performance level for the EPS element of the award should be reduced from CPI 5%p.
a. with a corresponding reduction from 20% to 15% in the amount of the award that will vest at threshold performance.
The target at the maximum 100% vesting level is unchanged.
Therefore, PSP Awards to be granted in 2014 15 will be subject to the following performance targets: t EPS element 2 3rds growth in the Companys adjusted EPS in excess of CPI.
15% of this element of an award will vest for annual adjusted EPS growth of CPI 4% p. a. increasing pro-rata to 50% vesting for annual adjusted EPS growth of CPI 8% p. a. Vesting then increases pro-rata to 100% vesting for annual adjusted EPS growth of CPI 12% p. a. t Relative TSR element 1 3rd the Companys TSR relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
20% of this element of the award will vest if the Company is ranked at the median, increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting for a ranking at upper quintile or better.
The 2014 15 grant level will be 125% of salary for the executive directors.
Strategic report Governance Financial Shareholder statements information RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 55 Non-executive Directors As detailed in the remuneration policy, the Companys approach to setting non-executive directors fees is by reference to fees paid at similar companies and reects the time commitment and responsibilities of each role.
Fees are reviewed every three years, with the most recent review occurring in March 2014 and fees increased from 1 April 2014.
Current fees are as follows: From 1 April 2013 From 1 April 2014 Increase Chairman 140,000 150,000 7.1% Non-Executive Base fee 37,000 40,000 8.1% 1 Committee Chairmans fees 7,000 10,000 42.9% 1 Committee Chairmans fees are paid to the Chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committees but not to the Chairman of the Nomination Committee.
The increase in the Chairmans and non-executive directors base fees compares with the increase in CPI ination over three years to March 2014 of 8.1% equivalent to approximately 2.6% p. a..
The increase in the fees for the Remuneration and Audit Committee chairmen reects the Boards view of the significant increase in the responsibilities and time commitment of both roles.
There are no additional fees paid to the Senior Independent Director.
As P R M Vervaat is paid in euros, his salary is converted using the average exchange rate for the year, 1: 1.1861 2013: 1: 1.2279.
2 S J Kesterton was appointed to the Board with effect from 1 April 2013.
3 R J E Marsh retired from the Board on 10 July 2013 but remained an employee of the Group until 30 September 2013.
The remuneration information in the table above represents the remuneration received whilst a member of the Board.
Salary, benets, pension contributions and bonus paid in respect of the 2014 financial year have been apportioned to represent the remuneration received whilst a member of the Board.

56 RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Directors remuneration report: Annual report on remuneration continued Additional Information in Respect of the Single Figure Table Taxable benets The taxable benets for P R M Vervaat include: a company car and fuel provision in the Netherlands, an allowance for medical insurance premiums and fees for preparation of his tax return.
Additionally, P R M Vervaat received an ex-pat allowance of 2,833 per month and was also provided with the following benets: a UK company car and fuel provision, UK accommodation, the cost of commuting from the Netherlands to the UK and an amount equivalent to the UK income tax payable on these benets for part of the year.
However, the provision of the ex-pat allowance ceased on 30 April 2013 and the additional benets all ceased on 31 July 2013 or earlier.
The taxable benets for S J Kesterton and R J E Marsh comprised a UK company car and fuel provision or a car allowance alternative and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2014 The annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2014 was based upon the Groups adjusted PBIT operating profit with a sliding bonus scale commencing at 0% of salary for a threshold 5% below the adjusted PBIT for the year ended 31 March 2013 and full pay out 100% of salary for achieving a stretching level of performance.
In addition, 50% of the maximum bonus would be payable for achieving 60% of the target range.
In addition, free cash ow and ROCE key performance indicators moderators applied.
Any bonus payable would be reduced by: t 12.5% if the Groups free cash ow for the year ended 31 March 2014 was less than 50m: and t 12.5% if the Groups ROCE for the year ended 31 March 2014 was less than 18.3%.
The results of the annual bonus for the year under review were: Threshold 50% Maximum Actual Bonus payable m m m m reduction 1 Adjusted operating profit 85.0 91.0 95.0 101.3 100% Free cash ow 50.0 63.4 0 % 2 ROCE 18.3% 18.7% 0 % Total Bonus Payable % of maximum 100% 1 The Committee considered the impact on the adjusted PBIT of the credit for the depreciation adjustment of 3.7m in the year in relation to an increase in the useful economic life of primary production line machinery from 10to 12 years, amortisation of acquired intangibles of 0.8m and, following the application of IAS 19 Revised 2011 adopted from the beginning on the financial year, pension administration expenses of 0.6m.
The Committee concluded that there would be no impact even if an adjustment was made as the revised adjusted operating profit gure 96.2m would still exceed the target for the maximum bonus payout.
2 ROCE before taking account of the acquisitions during the year was 20.2%.
If the impact of the depreciation credit, amortisation of acquired intangibles and pension administration expenses were adjusted for, it would reduce the ROCE below the threshold level.
However, the Committee decided that it would not be appropriate to make this adjustment as it would penalise the participants and may discourage the directors from making acquisitions that were beneficial to the Group in the future.
R J E Marshs annual bonus was pro-rated based for the proportion of the financial year served prior to retiring from the Company and paid 100% in cash.
Vesting of Performance Share Plan awards The award of nil cost options made on 1 August 2011 under the RPC Group 2008 Performance Share Plan PSP were subject to a performance condition based on a sliding scale of growth in the adjusted basic EPS in excess of CPI for the three years ended 31 March 2014.
At threshold vesting 25% of the award would vest for an annual adjusted EPS growth of CPI 5% p. a. increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting based on 75% of salary at the award date for annual adjusted EPS growth of CPI 10% p. a.
The performance targets taking into account the actual CPI over the vesting period and the actual performance against those targets was as follows: Threshold vesting Maximum vesting Actual Vesting Metric EPS EPS EPS % Adjusted basic EPS 36.9p 41.3p 41.1p 49.0% 1 The Remuneration Committee decided that the actual adjusted basic EPS should be reduced for the depreciation credit of 3.7m 1.7p in relation to an increase in the useful economic life of primary production line machinery from 10 to 12 years and the employee benefit net finance expense of 2.4m 1.1p.
Consequently, the EPS used to determine the outcome of the 2011 PSP award is 38.3p which is lower than the adjusted basic EPS of 41.1p reported in the Consolidated income statement on page 76.
The Committee is of the view that this approach is both fair to shareholders and management, and is reective of Company performance.
The resulting awards for the current and former executive directors are as follows: Estimated value No of shares to lapse No of shares to lapse No of shares at grant No of shares to vest good leaver performance 000 P R M Vervaat 51,541 25,255 26,286 154 R J E Marsh 59,212 20,967 16,423 21,822 128 1 R J E Marsh retired from the Board on 10 July 2013 and retired as an employee on 30 September 2013.
2 The estimated value of the shares under option that vest is based on the average share price over the three months ended 31 March 2014 of 6.09 per share.
Strategic report Governance Financial Shareholder statements information RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 57 No dividends accrue in respect of awards of free shares or nil cost options under the PSP.
The awards will normally vest on 1 August 2014, the third anniversary of the date of grant.

Up to 30 April 2013 P R M Vervaat contributed 8.7% of basic salary, thereafter, his contributions are nil.
Although it is a dened benefit plan, the employers obligation for the provision of pension benets is xed at 20% of salary and previously capped at 60,000 p. a.. Consequently, RPC is no longer expected to be exposed to any material actuarial risks in relation to the accrued benets in this plan.
Therefore, the pension arrangement is being treated as a dened contribution plan for accounting and disclosure purposes.
This is a change from the disclosures made in previous years when the employers contributions were unaffected by the cap of 60,000 p. a. and there was a dened benefit obligation on the employer.
Under Dutch legislation, there will be a further reduction in the maximum accrual rate from 2.15% to 1.875% and a maximum pensionable salary imposed of 100,000 p. a. from 1 January 2015.
S J Kesterton is entitled to receive a Group pension contribution of 20% of basic salary, paid either as a non-pensionable salary supplement or delivered partly through the Groups dened contribution arrangement capped at 15% of basic salary, subject to a 5% of basic salary employee contribution and partly through a salary supplement 5% of basic salary.
For the year ended 31 March 2014, the employer pension contribution was 9% of basic salary 27,900 and the 11% salary supplement paid was 34,100.
In addition, S J Kesterton has elected to participate in the employers pension salary exchange arrangement whereby salary is reduced in exchange for the employer paying additional contributions of 3% 9,300.
Life assurance of four times basic salary is also provided for P R M Vervaat and S J Kesterton.
The Company does not contribute to any pension arrangements for non-executive directors.

Strategic report Governance Financial Shareholder statements information RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 61 Percentage Change in Chief Executives Remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in the salary, taxable benets and annual bonus from the year ended 31 March 2013 to the year ended 31 March 2014 compared with the average equivalent amount per employee for all UK participants in the Groups Annual Bonus Plan.
This group of UK employees was considered a more appropriate comparator group given that the three elements required for comparison are present and that the Chief Executives remuneration is based on UK remuneration practices.
Chief Executive UK employee comparator group % change % change Salary 59.5% 9.5% Taxable benets 40.1% 8.0% Annual bonus n a n a 1 The maximum bonus is payable in respect of the year ended 2014 but no bonus was paid for the previous year.
The percentage increase cannot be computed.
The change in the Chief Executives remuneration is the result of comparing the remuneration for P R M Vervaat who became Chief Executive on 1 May 2013 with the remuneration of R J E Marsh who was Chief Executive prior to 1 May 2013.
For historical reasons, the former Chief Executives remuneration was not in line with Chief Executives of other companies of similar size and complexity.
There have been a number of promotions within the more senior management throughout the Group including the UK which has resulted in the above ination increase in the remuneration of the comparator group.
Relative Importance of Spend on Pay The following table shows the Groups actual expenditure on pay for all its employees relative to other financial indicators: 2014 2013 Change m m % Staff costs 239.3 231.8 3.2 Dividends 28.1 24.7 13.8 Revenue 1,046.9 982.3 6.6 Operating profit 73.2 62.0 18.1 Capital investment including acquisitions 184.5 72.5 254.5 Staff costs include salaries, fees, bonus and employer pension and social security contributions for directors.
