DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2015 FOR NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The Non-Executive Director fee levels were reviewed in 2014 and no changes were made to the sterling reference with the exception of the Vice Chairman position.
With effect from the 2015 NV and PLC AGMs the fees of the Vice Chairman will be based on the modular fee structure set out below, including a fee of 30,000 for the Vice Chairmans responsibilities.
The Non-Executive Directors fees are set at a reference point in sterling and then 50% is paid in sterling by PLC and 50% is paid in euros by NV at a exchange rate which is reviewed periodically to ensure that the balance between the fees remains appropriate.
We reviewed the exchange rate used in this calculation in 2014 and updated the amount paid by NV in euros to reflect the movement in exchange rates since 2011 when the balance was last set.
The table below outlines the updated 2015 fees.
