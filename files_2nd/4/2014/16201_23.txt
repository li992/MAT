Corporate Governance REMUNERATION REPORT ANNUAL STATEMENT ON REMUNERATION The Remuneration Committee is focused on ensuring Executive Directors are rewarded for long-term performance, rather than short-term returns.
JEREMY WILSON CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Summary of major decisions made in 2014 DEAR SHAREHOLDER There was a radical overhaul of pay for Executive Directors On behalf of the Board, I am presenting the Remuneration and Senior Managers at the start of 2013, which resulted in Committees report for 2014 on Directors remuneration the introduction of the Tullow Incentive Plan TIP.
This plan my first report after taking over from David Bamford as combines an annual bonus and long-term incentive linked Committee Chairman after the 2014 AGM.
The report is to a set of stretching financial, operational and total split into three main sections: shareholder return TSRrelated objectives, explicitly linked to the achievement of Tullows long-term strategy.
This Annual Statement, which provides a summary of The Committee has continued to operate this remuneration the year under review and the Committees intentions policy during 2014 and will continue to do so during 2015. going forward: As such, the major work of the Committee involved: the The Directors Remuneration Policy Report, which sets monitoring of this plan under the 2014 targets KPIs : the out the three-year Directors remuneration policy for application of appropriate discretion where applicable: the Company which commenced 1 January 2014 and and the setting of targets for 2015. became formally effective from the 2014 AGM.
While disclosure of this part of the report is not required this Performance and reward for 2014 year, this section has been included again in line with At the start of 2014, Executive Director base salaries were best practice: and frozen to reflect the challenging market background.
The The Annual Report on Remuneration, which provides performance targets set for 2014 in respect of the TIP details of the remuneration earned by Directors in the awards to be granted in 2015 were challenging in the context year ended 31 December 2014 and how the policy will of the time and proved even more so as the year progressed.
88 Tullow Oil plc 2014 Annual Report and Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS It is disappointing to report that the targets in production, opex, COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION exploration and portfolio monetisation were missed and these contributed to our poor share price performance and a nil FIXED PAY contribution for the TSR measure, which made up 50% of the scorecard.
However, the Executive team performed well in the BASE SALARY area of Safety, Sustainability and External Affairs and on a number of the longer-term strategic objectives.
In particular, regional developments in Ghana around Jubilee and the TEN Project and in East Africa were strong.
Moreover, objectives around funding resilience, risk management and delivery of Pathway were mostly met.
The net result of these various factors produced an overall PENSION & BENEFITS KPI scorecard performance of 23%, resulting in a cash bonus of 69% of salary and a further 69% of salary awarded in shares Pension which will be deferred 50% over four years and 50% over five years.
Benefits Medical Insurance The Committee believes this longer-term vesting period that was Permanent Health Insurance introduced with the TIP is in line with shareholder desire for Life Assurance Executive Directors to be rewarded for long-term performance rather than short-term returns.
The 2012 PSP Awards, where vesting in 2015 was based on relative TSR performance over the three years ended 31 December 2014, did not vest as a result of Tullows below-threshold TSR over the performance period.
PERFORMANCE Executive Director Remuneration Policy for 2015 RELATED As we looked forward to set the salary levels and TIP performance targets for 2015, the Committee wanted to recognise the ongoing TULLOW INCENTIVE PLAN challenging environment, the revised strategy and the need to Annual award of cash up to 100% of salary streamline and refocus the business.
We also wanted to recognise and reward the talent and continued commitment of the Executive Balance awarded in shares up to 500% salary team, albeit in light of market conditions.
The result of these deliberations has led to a freeze in fixed pay for the second year running and a set of KPI targets which include TSR performance 50%, strong production of Jubilee, and the ongoing delivery of the TEN development as well as developments in Uganda and Kenya.
Stretching financial metrics and a strong balance sheet are also included in the scorecard as well as measures to deliver on the longer-term growth strategy of the Company.
Details of the actual TOTAL REMUNERATION targets are currently commercially sensitive and will therefore be disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report.
Finally, in line with the pay freeze, the Committee has agreed with the Executive Directors to reduce the maximum award available under the TIP in 2015 from 600% to 500% of salary.
