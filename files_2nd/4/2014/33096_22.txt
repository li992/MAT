Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2014 87 The Companys policy is to provide remuneration packages that fairly reward the Executive Directors for the contribution they have made tothe business and to ensure that the packages are appropriately competitive to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and Senior Managers of the right calibre.
The policy is to align the directors interests with those of shareholders and to incentivise the directors to meet the Companys financial and strategic priorities by making a significant proportion of remuneration performance related.
The Companys strategic objectives are set out in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 69.
The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration policy outlined in the table below is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promoteexcessive risk-taking: Maximum opportunity Performance metrics Base salary increases will be in applied in line with the outcome of the review.
Individual and Company performances are considerations in setting base salary.
In the normal course of events, increases in the base salaries will not exceed the average increase for employees.
Increases may be made above this level to take account of market alignment to around mid-market levels of comparable organisations particularly within thelistedproperty sector and individual circumstances such as: increase in scope and responsibility: and to reect the individuals development and performance in the role e. g. foranew appointment wherebase salary may be increased over time ratherthanset directly atthe level of the previous incumbent ormarket level.
The Committee is, however, mindful of the need to treat comparisons with caution toavoid an upward ratchet of remuneration levels.
The 2014 15 annual salaries for the Executive Directors are set out in the Annual report on remuneration on page 103.
Set at a level which the Committee considers: Not applicable.

General terms Investment shares will remain registered in the name of the holder with full voting and dividend rights.
The SMP award consists of a conditional allocation of shares worth up to three times theequivalent of the amount so invested or pledged.

An award may, at the discretion of the Committee, include the right to receive cash or shares on vesting equal in value to the dividends payable on such number of shares subject to the award which vest, for the period between grant and vesting.
If Investment shares are disposed of then the corresponding conditional Matching shareawards willlapse.
Quantum The Committee reviews the quantum of awards annually.
All-employee share plans Encourages Executive Directors and The Company operates a Share Incentive Plan SIP under which all employees, including employees to acquire shares in order to Executive Directors, may be awarded free shares and may purchase shares which can be matched increase the alignment of interests with on a two for one basis.
The Companys current practice is to operate partnership and matching shareholders over the longer term.
If the shares are held in a trust for at least three years and the employee does not leave the Company during that period, then the matched shares may be retained by the individual subject to some relief against income tax and national insurance charges.
Dividends are also paid directly to participants on all plan shares.
In 2010, shareholders approved a Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE for all employees which isnot currently operated but which might be utilised in the future.
Under the SAYE, participants which may include Executive Directors may make monthly contributions over a savings period linked to the grant of an option with an exercise price which may be at a discount of up to 20% ofthe market value of the underlying shares at grant.
Awards under the SIP and SAYE may be adjusted to reect the impact of any variation of sharecapital.
Shareholding policy To ensure that Executive Directors interests Executive Directors are expected to accumulate and maintain a holding in ordinary shares in the are aligned with those of shareholders over Company equivalent in value to no less than 100% of base salary.
Notes to the Future Policy Table 1.
Performance measures and targets Shortand long-term performance measures have been selected by the Committee for 2014 15 in order to provide a direct connection to the Companys strategy by being linked to the key fundamental performance indicators as set out below: the Companys TPR Capital growth performance is measured against the performance of a relevant IPD index to reect the Companys operations: NAV targets are set by reference to internal forecasts to ensure focus on sustained asset growth: and the Companys TSR performance is measured against the performance of an appropriate comparative Index selected by the Committee to ensure superior shareholder returns.
The Committee regularly reviews the TSR and TPR Capital growth comparators to ensure that they remain appropriate the TPR comparator group was adjusted last year and the NAV targets are set following a robust budget setting process.
The targets for the annual bonus and the LTIP SMP for 2014 15 are set out in the Annual report on remuneration on page 103.
The Committee is of the opinion that given the commercial sensitivity around GPEs business, disclosing capital growth, NAV and individual targets for the Annual Bonus Plan in advance would not be in the best interests of shareholders or the Company.
Actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of performance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees All employees of GPE are entitled to base salary and benets on the same basis, with quantum of awards being set at levels commensurate with their role.
All employees participate in an employee annual bonus plan, with quantum of awards being set at levels commensurate with their role and with performance measures, similar to the executive scheme, based on growth of the Companys property portfolio against IPDs relevant Total Property Return Index and performance against personal objectives.

Changes to remuneration policy from previous policy There have been no changes to the operation of the policy, maximums or performance measures in relation to the salary, annual bonus, LTIP SMP, pension or other benets.
Discretion The Committee will operate the annual bonus LTIP and SMP awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan according to their respective rules and ancillary documents and in accordance with the Listing Rules where relevant.
The Committee retains discretion consistent with market practice, in a number of regards to the operation and administration of these plans as noted in the policy table and in the recruitment remuneration and payments for loss of ofce sections as relevant.
Any use of these discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual report onremuneration and may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultations with the Companys major shareholders.
In addition, the Committee has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or waitfor shareholder approval.

Approach to recruitment remuneration The Committees approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract appropriate candidates to the role, and our principle is that the pay of any new recruit would be assessed following the same principles as for the directors and the policy previously summarised.
Executive Directors recruitment Component Policy Base salary The salary level will be set taking into account relevant market data, the experience and skills of the individual, andbenets responsibilities of the individual and the salaries paid to similar roles in comparable companies in line with the current process undertaken by the Committee when setting the salary levels for its existing directors.
Executive Directors shall be eligible to receive benets in line with the Companys benets policy as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Pension Executive Directors will be able to receive a pension contribution or receive a supplement in lieu of pension contributions in line with the Companys pension policy as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Annual bonus Executive Directors will be eligible to participate in the Annual Bonus Plan as set out in the remuneration policy table.
For Executive Directors joining part way through a year, awards would be pro-rated.
Different performance measures may be set initially for the annual bonus, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial year that they joined.
The annual maximum potential opportunity under this plan is 200% of salary.
Long-term Executive Directors will be eligible to participate in the Long-Term Incentive Plan set out in the remuneration policy table.
incentives Awards may be granted up to the maximum opportunity allowable under plan rules at the Committees discretion of 200% of salary under the LTIP element of the plan and 100% of salary under the SMP element of the plan when the Executive invests a third of salary.
Share buyouts Awards may be granted to replace those forfeited by the Executive Director on taking up the appointment where replacement awards considered by the Committee to be appropriate.
The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards such that overall they are no more generous in terms ofquantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited.
Where the Company compensates new directors inthisway, it will seek to do so under the terms of the Companys existing variable remuneration arrangements, but maycompensate on terms that are more bespoke than the existing arrangements, including awards granted under Listing Rule 9.4.
2, where the Committee considers appropriate.
In such instances, the Company will disclose a full explanation of the detail and rationale for such recruitment related compensation.
In making such awards, the Committee will seek to take into account the nature including whether awards are cash or share based, vesting period and performance measures and or conditions for any remuneration forfeited by the individual in leaving a previous employer.
Where such awards had outstanding performance or service conditions which are not signicantly completed, the Company will generally impose equivalent conditions.
In exceptional cases the Committee may relax those requirements where it considers this to be in the interest of theshareholders, for example through a significant discount to the face value of the replacement awards.
Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2014 91 Component Policy Relocation policies In instances where the new Executive Director is non-UK domiciled or needs to be relocated, the Company may provide one-off or ongoing compensation as part of the Executive Directors relocation benets to reect the cost of relocation for the Executive in cases where they are expected to spend significant time away from their country of domicile.
The level of the relocation package will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and may take into consideration any cost of living differences, housing allowance and or schooling.
Legacy Where an Executive Director is appointed from within the organisation, the normal policy of the Company is that any arrangements legacy arrangements would be honoured in line with the original terms and conditions on a prorata basis.
Similarly, if an Executive Director is appointed following the Companys acquisition or merger with another company, legacy terms and conditions on a prorata basis would be honoured.
Non-Executive Directors recruitment Component Policy Fees Newly appointed Non-Executive Directors will be paid fees consistent with existing Non-Executive Directors.
Service agreements and payments for loss of ofce The policy of the Company is to have service contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of one year.
It is sometimes necessary when recruiting a new Executive Director to give a service contract with an initial term of up to 18 months in which case a 12 month notice period may be given no earlier than six months from the start date or the contract.
Non-Executive Directors who have letters of appointment, are subject to the provisions of the Articles of Association dealing with appointment and rotation every three years, however, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code they are subject to annual re-election and have a notice period of three months by either party.
They are not eligible for payment in lieu of notice or any other payment on termination.
The following table sets out the dates of each of the Executive Directors service agreements and their unexpired term, the dates of the NonExecutive Directors letters of appointment and the date on which the Non-Executive Director is next subject to reappointment or re-election.

The Companys policy on termination payments for Executive Directors is to consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant contractual terms, the circumstances of the termination and any applicable duty to mitigate.
It is the Committees policy not to reward poor performance.
The Committee will always seek to minimise the cost to the Company whilst seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time.
The Committee will honour Executive Directors contractual entitlements.
Service contracts do not contain liquidated damages clauses.
If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case.
There are no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement.
There is no agreement between the Company and its directors or employees, providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
The Company reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation : or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising on connection with the termination of an Executive Directors office or employment.
