The Committee continued to seek to further evolve the Groups remuneration and incentive structures in order to attract and retain management and staff of the highest quality and to retain an appropriate level of entrepreneurial culture while ensuring that its structures remain in accordance with best practice for a FTSE 250 listed business.
The remuneration framework for 2014 remained consistent with that of 2013 comprising basic salary and benefits, an annual incentive scheme and the Groups LTIP, as set out in the remuneration policy approved by shareholders.

iii The schemes contain forfeiture provisions over the investment period of the fund which may reduce the scheme interest accruing to any participant.
The table reflects the maximum scheme interest receivable should no forfeiture occur.
iv Accrued value of scheme interests is calculated based upon the current fair value of the relevant limited partnerships assets in excess of the capital contributed and the hurdle rate of return.

v As described earlier in this report, Charles Winward stepped down from the Board with effect from 23 April 2014.

Former Fusion IP LTIP As an executive director of Fusion IP plc, Mr Baynes was conditionally awarded 1,000,000 shares in Fusion IP plc under the Fusion IP LTIP.
As part of the arrangements for the acquisition of Fusion IP plc, Mr Baynes Fusion IP LTIP awards were converted into awards over IP Group shares at the same conversion price per share as the scheme of arrangement was undertaken 0.446 IP Group plc shares for every Fusion IP plc share.
The awards will vest on 31 December 2017 provided certain performance conditions are met which relate to, inter alia, the growth in value of Fusion IP plcs net asset value Fusion NAV from the date of acquisition and the continued employment of the individual by the Group.
In summary, if Fusion NAV growth of 10% per annum is achieved then 30% of an award shall vest.
Maximum vesting will occur if Fusion NAV growth of 20% per annum is achieved with straight-line vesting between 30 and 100% if Fusion NAV growth of 10%-20% per annum is achieved.
No vesting shall occur if Fusion NAV growth of less than 10% is achieved.

Where an executive director accepts an appointment to the board of a company in which the Group is a shareholder, the Group generally retains the related fees.
In the limited circumstances where the executive director receives such fees directly, such sums are deducted from their base salary from the Group.
Fees earned for directorships of companies in which the Group does not have a shareholding are normally retained by the relevant director.
