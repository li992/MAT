Andrew Fisher Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 2 March 2015 44 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements General Directors Remuneration Policy At the Annual General Meeting held on 23 April 2014 shareholders approved the current remuneration policy which has operated since 23 April 2014.
The Remuneration Committee is proposing changes to the performance measures relating to the Companys annual bonus and long-term incentive plan, and as a result, shareholder approval is being sought for a revised remuneration policy.
In formulating the revised remuneration policy, full consideration has been given to the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Committee regularly reviews the policy to ensure it takes due account of best practice and the particular circumstances of the Company.
The revised Directors remuneration policy which will operate from 30 April 2015, will be put to a binding shareholder vote and become formally effective at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.
Policy overview The Company aims to provide a remuneration structure that is aligned with shareholder interests and, as such, is competitive in the marketplace to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of superior calibre in order to deliver continued growth of the business.
Company policy is that performance related components should form a significant portion of the overall remuneration package, with maximum total potential rewards being earned through the achievement of challenging performance targets based on measures that reflect the best interests of shareholders.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee will consider shareholder feedback received in relation to the Annual General Meeting each year at its next meeting following the Annual General Meeting.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time, will then be considered as part of the Companys annual review of remuneration policy.
In addition, the Committee engaged directly with major shareholders and their representative bodies in advance of the changes to this remuneration policy.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years remuneration report and any matters discussed with shareholders during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee does not formally consult employees in relation to remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
However, the Company regularly carries out engagement surveys which enable employees to share their views with management.
To the extent that employees are shareholders, they can vote on this policy at the Annual General Meeting.

2 The following differences exist between the Companys policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors as set out above and its approach to the payment of employees generally: A l ower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity as a percentage of base salary may apply to employees other than the Executive Directors and certain senior executives.
B enefits offered to other employees generally comprise a car allowance where required for the role or to meet market norms.
P articipation in the LTIP is limited to the Executive Directors and certain selected senior managers.
Other employees are eligible to participate in the Companys share plans, details of which are provided on page 47.
A lower level of pension rate applies to employees other than the Executive Directors and certain senior executives.
In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the various categories of roles.
They also reflect the fact that, in the case of the Executive Directors and senior executives, a greater emphasis tends to be placed on performance related pay.
3 The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflects the Committees belief that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging and aligned to the Groups strategy and the creation of shareholder value.
4 The adjusted earnings per share and comparative total shareholder return performance conditions applicable to the LTIP further details of which are provided on page 51 were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term returns to shareholders and the creation of shareholder value.
5 The Committee operates share plans in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC where relevant.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plans.
6 All employee share plans do not operate performance conditions.
7 The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
8 The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval.
