Key details of the performance delivered over 2014 are set out under BSP Key Performance Aspects.
The Committee reviewed the annual targets set at the 1,557 beginning of 2014 and, in light of the positive results achieved across the group in 2013, decided to raise RENE MEDORI threshold performance expectations to a more stretching 2013: 979 level in 2014 threshold of $1.50.
To ensure the core structure of the incentive scheme remained the same, the potential pay out at threshold performance was increased to 17.6%, on this measure, with no payment for performance 960 below threshold.
The resulting target and maximum outcomes remained the same.
The executives individual objectives were set at the start of the year and reflect the Companys strategic priorities for the year.
Each category contained between one and five specific objectives.
Some of these are reflected under BSP Key Performance Aspects.
Given the non-financial nature of these, specific quantitative targets were not set but, at the end of the year, the Committee made a detailed assessment of performance against each, leading to the evaluations shown in Figures 8a and 8b.
The overall outcome for each executive director was then adjusted by the safety deductor based on loss of life, lost time injury frequency rate LTIFR and a risk and change management rating.

5 The performance condition attached to the 2012 Enhancement Share award was not met and none of these shares will vest.
6 As vesting of the LTIP awards granted in 2012 is due to take place after publication of this report, vesting levels are on an expected basis and a share price of 12.98 has been used to calculate the values shown.
The value shown includes a dividend equivalent amount 66,105 for Ren Mdori.
The LTIP amounts shown in last years report in respect of the LTIPs awarded in 2011 were also calculated on an expected vesting levels basis with an assumed share price of 14.12.
