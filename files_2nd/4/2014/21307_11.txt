The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Governance: Remuneration report Annual statement from the Chairman of the Board Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholders As Chairman of the Board Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to introduce the Directors Remuneration Report for 2014.
We recognise that remuneration is an area of particular importance and interest to shareholders and it is critical that we listen to and take into account your views.
Accordingly, my meetings with major investors and shareholder representative groups have been helpful and meaningful, contributing directly to the decisions made by the Committee for 2014.
Performance and pay An important principle which the Committee applies in its deliberations is that while Barclays will not pay staff more than we judge to be necessary, it is in shareholders interests that Barclays should pay for performance.
Front of mind is that we determine the correct level of The Committee remains focused on paying for variable pay in a given year in order to maximise shareholder value over sustainable performance, aligning remuneration with risk the medium term.

assets therein over time, assets which are no longer strategically attractive to Barclays.
This restructuring has enabled Barclays to strengthen performance across a range of metrics.
The Group has delivered solid financial performance with adjusted profit before tax up 12% to 5,502m for 2014.
In achieving this there have been particularly good results in Personal and Corporate Banking and Barclaycard.
These results are partly offset by a reduction in Investment Bank adjusted profit before tax, as well as the impact of adverse currency movements in Africa Banking.
Sustained progress is being made and the balance now present in the Group means that Barclays is a stronger business.
There has been considerable progress in strengthening the capital position of the Group with Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 ratio of 10.3% and a leverage ratio of 3.7% at the end of the year.
Adjusted operating expenses excluding costs to achieve Transform ex CTA are down by 1.8bn year on year, in line with target.
Barclays Non-Core reduced Risk Weighted Assets by nearly a third, making substantial progress towards the target, and materially reduced its drag on returns.
In formulating our 2014 decisions on variable pay the Committee ensured that pay appropriately reflects financial performance delivered, both on Remuneration Committee members an adjusted and statutory basis, but also rebalanced returns back towards shareholders.
Performance against the commitments across the 5Cs of the Balanced Scorecard was also an important consideration.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Governance: Remuneration report Performance, pay and distribution of earnings to key stakeholders Since 2010 there has been a significant shift in the allocation of earnings between employees and shareholders.
Comparing 2014 against 2010, adjusted profit before tax excluding costs to achieve for Transform in 2014 has increased by 18%, against an absolute reduction in the Group incentive pool of 47%.
Over the same period the distribution to shareholders and government through dividends paid and taxes borne have increased by 99% and 11% respectively, while Group compensation costs have reduced by 20%.
How did we perform and pay in 2014?
Adjusted profit before tax increased between 2013 and 2014 by 12%, while the absolute reduction in the Group incentive pool was 22%.
After adjusting for the introduction of RBP, the reduction in the Group incentive pool would be 11%.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 79 Governance: Remuneration report Remuneration policy for all employees This section sets out Barclays remuneration policy for all employees, explaining the purpose and principles underlying the structure of remuneration packages, and how the policy links remuneration to the achievement of sustained high performance and long-term value creation.
Remuneration policy The Committee formally adopted the current remuneration policy for 2013 as part of the Transform programme.
The principles set out in the policy below underpin 2014 remuneration decisions made by the Committee and throughout Barclays.
The remuneration structure for employees is aligned with that for executive Directors, set out in detail in the Directors remuneration policy which was approved by Shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
A full copy of the policy can be found on the Barclays PLC website.
An abridged version is at pages 102 to 110 of this Report.
Support the goal of becoming the Go-To bank by attracting, retaining and competitively rewarding colleagues with the ability, experience, skill, values and behaviours to deliver that goal.
Will only reward business results when these are achieved in a manner consistent with Barclays Values and Behaviours: Respect: We respect and value those we work with, and the contribution that they make Integrity: We act fairly, ethically and openly in all we do Service: We put our clients and customers at the centre of what we do Excellence: We use our energy, skills and resources to deliver the best, sustainable results Stewardship: We are passionate about leaving things better than we found them 3.
Protect and promote shareholder interests by incentivising colleagues to deliver sustained performance and create long-term value through the delivery of Barclays goal.
Those decisions will reflect that performance for individuals and in aggregate.
Barclays will pay competitively for high performance but will not pay more than the amount appropriate to maximise the long-term value of the bank for its shareholders.
Create a direct and recognisable alignment between remuneration and risk exposure, as well as adjusting current and deferred incentives for current and historic risk, including malus adjustments, as appropriate.
Should be as simple and clear for colleagues and stakeholders as possible as is the process used to determine them.
Ensure that the balance between shareholder returns and remuneration is appropriate, clear and supports long-term shareholder interests.
Remuneration and performance Our remuneration policy means that remuneration decisions for all employees across the whole of Barclays are aligned with and support the achievement of Barclays goal of becoming the Go-To bank.
This is achieved by linking remuneration to a broad assessment of performance based on expected standards of delivery and behaviour discussed with employees at the start of and throughout the performance year.
A new approach to performance management was implemented for all employees in 2014 to ensure alignment of these expectations to Barclays strategy.
This started with all employees aligning each of their 2014 objectives to the 5Cs of the Balanced Scorecard Customer & Clients, Colleagues, Citizenship, Conduct and Company and discussing behaviour expectations in relation to our Values with their managers.
This ensures that clear expectations are set for not only what employees are expected to deliver, but also how they are expected to go about it.
Individual performance is then evaluated against both the what performance against objectives and the how demonstration of our Values and Behaviours, with ratings agreed for both of these elements and overall performance at year-end.
This evaluation takes into account various factors including: Performance against agreed objectives both financial and non-financial and core job responsibilities Adherence to relevant risk policies and procedures and control frameworks Behaviour in line with Barclays Values and Behaviours Colleague and stakeholder feedback Input from the Risk and Compliance functions where there are concerns about the behaviour of the individuals concerned or the risk of the business undertaken.
There is no specific weighting between the financial and non-financial considerations for employees because all of them are important to the determination of the overall performance assessment.
Linking individual performance assessment and remuneration decisions to both the Balanced Scorecard and our Values and Behaviours in this way promotes the delivery of sustainable individual and business performance, and establishes clear alignment between remuneration policy and Barclays strategy.

Some senior employees receive Role Based Pay RBP.
Barclays was accredited in 2014 as a UK Living Wage employer, which recognised the Banks commitment to ensure that all its employees and those employees of third party contractors who provide services to us at our sites, are paid at least the current London or UK Living Wage.
This is a commitment which we have also extended to all our UK employed apprentices.
Further information on remuneration structure is provided below.
Fixed remuneration Salary Salaries reflect individuals skills and experience and are reviewed annually in the context of annual performance assessment.
They are increased where justified by role change, increased responsibility or where justified by the latest available market data.
Salaries may also be increased in line with local statutory requirements and in line with union and works council commitments.
Role Based Pay A small number of senior employees receive a class of fixed pay called RBP to recognise the seniority, breadth and depth of RBP their role.
RBP was introduced in 2014 to enable Barclays to remain competitive for global talent, given the CRD IV 2:1 maximum ratio of variable to fixed pay which came into effect in 2014.
Pension and The provision of a competitive package of benefits is important to attracting and retaining the talented staff Barclays needs to benefits deliver Barclays strategy.
Employees have access to a range of country specific company funded benefits, including pension schemes, healthcare, life assurance and Barclays share plans as well as other voluntary employee funded benefits.
The cost of providing the benefits is defined and controlled.
Variable remuneration Annual bonus Annual bonuses reward and incentivise the achievement of Group, business and individual objectives, and the demonstration of individual behaviours in line with Barclays Values and Behaviours.
The ability to recognise performance through variable remuneration enables the Group to control its cost base flexibly and to react to events and market circumstances.
Bonuses remain a key feature of remuneration practice in the highly competitive and mobile market for talent in the financial services sector.
The Committee is careful to control the proportion of variable to fixed remuneration paid to individuals.
Bonus deferral levels are significantly in excess of PRA requirements.
For MRTs, the deferral rate is a minimum of 40% for bonuses of up to 500,000 or 60% for bonuses of more than 500,000.
For non-MRTs, bonuses over 65,000 are subject to a graduated level of deferral.
2014 bonuses awarded to Managing Directors in the Investment Bank are 100% deferred.
Deferred bonuses are generally delivered in equal portions as deferred cash under the Cash Value Plan CVP and deferred shares under the Share Value Plan SVP, each typically vesting in annual tranches over three years subject to the rules of the plans and continued service.
Deferred bonuses are subject to malus provisions which enable the Committee to reduce the vesting level of deferred bonuses including to nil at its discretion.
Events which may lead the Committee to do this include, but are not limited to, employee misconduct or a material failure of risk management.
Clawback applies to any variable remuneration awarded to a MRT on or after 1 January 2015.
Barclays may apply clawback if at any time during the 7 year period from the date on which variable remuneration is awarded to a MRT: i there is reasonable evidence of employee misbehaviour or material error, and or ii the firm or the business unit suffers a material failure of risk management, taking account of the individuals proximity to and responsibility for that incident.
Share plans Alignment of senior employees with shareholders is achieved through deferral of incentive pay into the SVP.
We also encourage wider employee shareholding through the all employee share plans.

2014 pay and performance headlines The key performance considerations which the Committee took into account in making its remuneration decisions for 2014 are highlighted below: Adjusted profit before tax was up 12% to 5,502m Adjusted profit before tax ex CTA was up 9% to 6,667m Within the Core business, Personal and Corporate Banking and Barclaycard continued to grow profits up 29% and 13% respectively, Africa Banking has done well but was impacted by adverse currency movements, and the Investment Bank is making progress despite challenging market conditions impacting income Statutory profit before tax was down 21% at 2,256m 2013: 2,868m CRD IV Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 ratio was up to 10.3% 2013: 9.1% The BCBS 270 leverage ratio was up to 3.7% September 2014: 3.5% Balanced Scorecard Steady progress has been made against the Balanced Scorecard in respect of 2018 targets.
Full details of 2014 performance against the eight key measures within the Scorecard are set out on page 11.
The pay outcomes and decisions can be summarised as follows: The Group compensation to adjusted net income ratio improved to 37.7% 2013: 38.7%.
The Core compensation to adjusted net income ratio was 35.7% Total compensation costs decreased 8% to 8,891m 2013: 9,616m.
Total compensation costs in the Investment Bank were down 9% at 3,620m 2013: 3,978m Total incentive awards granted were 1,860m, down 22% on 2013.
Investment Bank incentive awards granted were 1,053m, down 24% on 2013 Although no resolutions have yet been reached with the relevant investigating authorities, the Committee has adopted a prudent approach in relation to any potential settlements with respect to the ongoing Foreign Exchange trading investigations.
The 2014 incentive pool, has as a result, been adjusted downwards by the Committee.
The Committee will, however, keep the matter under review There has been strong differentiation on the basis of individual performance to allow the Group to more effectively manage compensation costs Average value of incentive awards granted per Group employee is 14,100 2013: 17,000 and the average value of incentive awards granted per Investment Bank employee is 51,400 2013: 61,000.
Average value of incentive awards granted per Group employee excluding the Investment Bank and Non-Core is 6,900 2013: 7,600 Levels of bonus deferral continue to significantly exceed the PRA Remuneration Codes minimum requirements and are expected to remain among the highest deferral levels globally.
2014 bonuses awarded to Managing Directors in the Investment Bank were 100% deferred.
2014 pay Questions and answers Why is a 2014 compensation to adjusted net income ratio of 37.7% appropriate for the Group?
The Committee continues to recognise the importance of rebalancing the allocation of income towards shareholders and the ongoing journey towards achieving this remains a key focus.
The Group compensation to adjusted net income ratio has decreased significantly from 42.4% in 2010 to 37.7% in 2014, continuing the trajectory towards a mid-30s ratio in the medium term.
The introduction of RBP in 2014 meant that an additional accounting charge of c. 250m was taken in the year, which would otherwise have been borne in future years under the previous remuneration structures.
If RBP had not been introduced and an equivalent amount provided through bonus, this ratio would have been approximately 1% lower.
The impact is greatest within the Investment Bank c. 3%.
Without this change, the compensation to adjusted net income ratio for the Investment Bank would have been down year on year.
Within Barclays Core, the ratio is at 35.7% down from 36.2% and is therefore already tracking at the target level of mid-thirties, demonstrating the efficiencies achieved in the Core business.
How do you justify a 2014 incentive pool of 1,860m?
The Committee remains focused on paying for performance while continuing to deliver a greater share of the income we generate to shareholders.
The final 2014 incentive pool of 1,860m is down 22% on 2013.
This is despite a 12% improvement in adjusted profit before tax, increases in CET1 and leverage ratios and steady progress towards our key measures under the Balanced Scorecard.

2010, 2011 and 2012 Investment Bank incentive awards have not been restated.
What have you done in terms of risk and conduct adjustments in 2014?
The Committee takes risk and conduct matters very seriously and will continue to ensure that there are appropriate adjustments to both individual remuneration and, where necessary, the incentive pool.
Conduct is included as a key metric in the Balanced Scorecard and risk and conduct events are considered as part of the performance management process and reflected in incentive decisions for individuals.
All employees have their performance assessed against objectives the what as well as demonstration of Barclays Values and Behaviours the how.
To support this there is a strong governance structure with a dedicated review body, the Remuneration Review Panel Panel, which reports directly to the Committee.
The Panel is independent of the business and includes senior representatives from the key control functions of Risk, Compliance, Internal Audit, Legal and HR.
It sets the policy and processes and is responsible for assessing the impact on compensation of risk and conduct events.
It is the Committees intention that individuals who are accountable, responsible or directly culpable for risk and conduct matters are subject to remuneration reductions as appropriate.
This will include reductions to bonus and unvested deferred awards i. e. malus reductions.
While investigations are ongoing, individuals who are under investigation will be subject to suspensions of variable pay, in line with our Values and the expectations of our regulators.
For current employees who are directly culpable, disciplinary action up to and including dismissal may also result.
In 2014 reductions were made to the incentive pool funding by the Committee for a number of conduct and risk events.
These included the ongoing Foreign Exchange trading investigations, PPI, the fines received for gold price fixing, for breaches of the FCAs Client Asset rules and the US Securities and Exchange Commissions sanction for compliance violations as well as other issues requiring remediation.
With respect to the ongoing Foreign Exchange trading investigations, although no resolutions have yet been reached with the relevant investigating authorities, the Committee adopted a prudent approach.
The 2014 incentive pool has as a result been adjusted downwards by the Committee.
The Committee will, however, keep the matter under review.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 83 Governance: Remuneration report 2014 incentives Deferral levels vary according to the incentive award quantum.
With reductions in incentive award levels, this has reduced the proportion of the bonus that is deferred.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 85 Governance: Remuneration report Annual report on Directors remuneration This section explains how our Directors remuneration policy was implemented during 2014.
Executive Directors Executive Directors: Single total figure for 2014 remuneration audited The following table shows a single total figure for 2014 remuneration in respect of qualifying service for each executive Director together with comparative figures for 2013.
Antony Jenkins has an LTIP award scheduled for release for the peformance period 2012-2014 which is shown in the table.
Tushar Morzaria joined the Board with effect from 15 October 2013 so his 2013 salary, pension and benefits relate to his part year qualifying service.
Additional information in respect of each element of pay for the executive Directors audited Salary Antony Jenkins is paid a salary of 1,100,000 per annum as Group Chief Executive.
Tushar Morzaria has been paid a salary of 800,000 per annum since his appointment to the Group Finance Director role.
Role Based Pay RBP With effect from 1 January 2014, both executive Directors received RBP.
RBP is delivered quarterly in shares which are subject to a holding period with restrictions lifting over five years 20% each year.
The value shown is of shares at the date awarded.
Taxable benefits Taxable benefits include private medical cover, life and ill health income protection, tax advice, relocation, home leave related costs, car allowance and the use of a company vehicle and driver when required for business purposes.
Annual Bonus Annual bonuses are discretionary and are typically awarded in Q1 following the financial year to which they relate.
The 2014 bonus awards reflect the Committees assessment of the extent to which each of the executive Directors achieved their Financial 50% weighting and Balanced Scorecard 35% weighting performance measures, and their personal objectives 15% weighting.
More information on the performance measures and the outcomes for the 2014 bonuses is set out on pages 87 and 88.
60% of each executive Directors 2014 bonus will be deferred in the form of an award under the SVP vesting over three years with one third vesting each year.
20% will be paid in cash and 20% delivered in shares.
All shares whether deferred or not deferred are subject to a further six month holding period from the point of release.
2014 bonuses are subject to clawback provisions and, additionally, unvested deferred 2014 bonuses are subject to malus provisions which enable the Committee to reduce the vesting level of deferred bonuses including to nil.
LTIP Barclays LTIP amount included in Antony Jenkins 2014 single total figure is the value of the amount scheduled to be released in relation to the LTIP award granted in 2012 in respect of performance period 2012-2014.
As Tushar Morzaria was not a participant in this cycle, the LTIP figure in the single figure table is shown as zero for him.
Release is dependent on, amongst other things, performance over the period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014.
The performance achieved against the performance targets is as follows.

The Committee was satisfied that this underpin was met, and accordingly determined that the award should be considered for release to the extent of 30% of the maximum number of shares under the total award.
The shares are scheduled to be released in May 2015.
50% of any shares that are released after deductions for income tax and social security contributions are subject to a 12 month holding period.

2014 Annual Bonus outcomes i Antony Jenkins The Committee considered Antony Jenkins performance against the financial and non-financial measures which had been set to reflect the strategic priorities for 2014.
A summary of the assessment for Antony Jenkins against his specific performance measures is provided in the following table.
Antony Jenkins Performance measures Weighting Target 2014 Assessment Outcome Financial Adjusted profit before tax 20% 5.14bn 5.92bn 5.5bn 100% 20% Adjusted Costs ex CTA 10% 17.11bn 16.24bn 16.9bn 100% 10% CET1 ratio fully loaded basis 10% 10.1% 10.6% 10.3% 100% 10% Leverage ratio 10% 3.0% 3.5% 3.7% 100% 10% Balanced Scorecard 5 Cs Customer & Client Colleague 2018 targets are set Steady progress Citizenship 35% out at page 11 on all targets 22% Conduct Company Personal objectives contribution 15% See below Judgemental 11% assessment Total 100% 83% Final outcome after the exercise of Remuneration Committee discretion 57% In aggregate, the performance assessment resulted in an overall outcome of 83% of maximum bonus opportunity being achieved.
Notwithstanding the performance assessment outcome of 83%, the Committee subsequently used its discretion to reduce the overall outcome by 26% to 57%.
The adjustment was considered appropriate in the context of an holistic assessment which recognised that, amongst other factors, while there has been solid financial performance and steady progress has been made on strategic repositioning, statutory profit before tax continues to be impacted by material conduct issues and there remains significant further work to be done to improve overall returns.
This adjustment therefore also incorporated consideration of executive accountability for the significant group-wide conduct issues that impacted Barclays in 2014 which included, for example, the ongoing Foreign Exchange trading investigations.
The resulting 2014 bonus is 1,100,000 57% of maximum bonus.
The considerations and rationale for the outcome of each component are set out below.
Financial 50% weighting The approach adopted for assessing financial performance is based on driving balanced performance outcomes across a range of measures.
In line with this, performance is initially assessed against a target range for each financial measure with a binary outcome i. e. below range zero and within range 100%.
Each financial measure has a weighting allocated, the total of which equals 50% of maximum bonus opportunity.
After this the Committee is required to apply discretion, considering all relevant factors, to ensure that the final outcome is appropriate.
As each financial target has been met or exceeded, a formulaic assessment of the current outcomes against financial measures implies a full 50% weighting prior to the application of Committee discretion.
There has been sustained and consistent progress made towards our 2016 Transform targets and Barclays has met all 2014 Transform financial and capital targets.
Higher Group and Core adjusted profit before tax were driven by focused cost saving initiatives.
Significant Non-Core run down throughout the year contributed to strengthening of Group capital and leverage ratios.
Group adjusted profit before tax increased 12% to 5,502m.
CET1 ratio increased to 10.3% 2013: 9.1% demonstrating progress towards the 2016 Transform financial target in excess of 11%.
The leverage ratio increased to 3.7% close to the 2016 Transform target to exceed 4%.
Balanced Scorecard 35% weighting Each of the five Cs of the Balanced Scorecard was assessed.
This year the Balanced Scorecard was cascaded throughout the organisation and now forms part of the framework against which employees are assessed.
Barclays has published its 2018 targets on page 11.
There has been steady progress across the Balanced Scorecard towards our 2018 targets.
There was however deterioration in the sustained engagement metric and the Relationship Net Promoter Score.
The move in both metrics is predominately due to changes Barclays has undergone during 2014 with the Strategy Update affecting a structural change in the company.
Citizenship initiatives are on track or ahead of target.
Progress has been made on the company metric especially in our fully loaded CRD IV CET1 ratio metric where recent European Banking Authority and Bank of England stress tests highlighted Barclays capital strength and resilience to stress scenarios.
Based on an assessment of performance against 2014 Balanced Scorecard milestones, the Committee has agreed a 22% outcome out of a maximum of 35%.
Personal objectives 15% weighting Antony Jenkins has shown strong leadership throughout the year and has been fully committed to delivering on the Transform financial targets and on improving the control environment across the organisation during 2014.
Progress against the Transform targets provides strong evidence that the decisive reshaping of the business announced in the 2014 Strategy update is working.
Antony Jenkins commitment to Barclays Values, both personally and in continuing to promote their importance throughout the organisation is highly commendable.
Progress in embedding cultural change has continued and changes made are being recognised both internally and externally as illustrated in the Conduct measures in our Balanced Scorecard.
He has strengthened the Executive Committee and the Senior Leadership Group.
The Committee judged that 11% of a maximum of 15% was appropriate.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 87 Governance: Remuneration report Annual report on Directors remuneration ii Tushar Morzaria The Committee undertook the same considerations in respect of financial performance, achievement against the Balanced Scorecard targets and personal measures for Tushar Morzaria.
A summary of the assessment for Tushar Morzaria against his specific performance measures is provided in the following table.
Tushar Morzaria Performance measures Weighting Target 2014 Assessment Outcome Financial Adjusted profit before tax 20% 5.14bn 5.92bn 5.5bn 100% 20% Adjusted Costs ex CTA 10% 17.11bn 16.24bn 16.9bn 100% 10% CET1 ratio fully loaded basis 10% 10.1% 10.6% 10.3% 100% 10% Leverage ratio 10% 3.0% 3.5% 3.7% 100% 10% Balanced Scorecard 5 Cs Customer & Client Colleague 2018 targets are set Steady progress Citizenship 35% out at page 11 on all targets 22% Conduct Company Personal objectives contribution 15% See below Judgemental 11% assessment Total 100% 83% Final outcome after the exercise of Remuneration Committee discretion 64% The assessment on the financial and Balanced Scorecard performance measures is set out above.
There was continued strong momentum on costs and capital both for the year and in terms of progress towards 2016 financial targets.
On a personal basis, the Committee concluded that Tushar Morzaria had demonstrated a consistent strive for excellence and challenged the status quo where appropriate to drive results and achieve cost targets.
He has also demonstrated strong and effective leadership of the finance, tax and treasury functions and has developed strong external relationships with the regulators.
In aggregate, performance assessment resulted in an overall outcome of 83% of maximum being achieved.
Following a holistic review by the Committee and after the exercise of discretion, the annual bonus has been set at 900,000 64% of maximum bonus.
Executive Directors: Other LTIP awards The Directors remuneration reporting regulations require inclusion in the single total figure of only the value of the LTIP awards whose last year of performance ends in the relevant financial year and whose vesting outcome is known.
For 2014, this is the award to Antony Jenkins under the 2012-2014 LTIP cycle and further details are set out on page 86.
This section sets out other LTIP cycles in which the executive Directors participate, the outcome of which remains dependent on future performance.
LTIP awards to be granted during 2015 The Committee decided to make awards under the 2015-2017 LTIP cycle to both Antony Jenkins and Tushar Morzaria with a face value at grant of 120% of their respective fixed pay at 31 December 2014.
The 2015-2017 LTIP awards will be subject to the following performance measures.
Performance measure Weighting Threshold Maximum vesting a Net Generated Equity 30% 7.5% of award vests for Net Generated Equity Net Generated Equity of 1,844m of 1,363m Core Return on Risk Weighted 20% 5% of award vests for average annual Core Average annual Core RoRWA of 1.81% Assets RoRWA excluding RoRWA of 1.34% own credit Non-Core drag on Adjusted 2.5% of award vests for Non-Core drag on Return on Equity RoE 10% Adjusted RoE of 4.02% Non-Core drag on Adjusted RoE of 2.97% Loan Loss Rate 10% 2.5% of award vests for average annual loan Average annual loan loss rate of 55bps or below loss rate of 70bps Balanced Scorecard 30% Performance against the Balanced Scorecard is assessed by the Committee to determine the percentage of the award that may vest between 0% and 30%.
Each of the 5Cs in the Balanced Scorecard has equal weighting.
The targets within each of the 5Cs are deemed to be commercially sensitive.
However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be made in the 2017 Remuneration Report subject to commercial sensitivity no longer remaining.
Note a Net Generated Equity is a metric which converts changes in the CET1 ratio into an absolute capital equivalent measure.
For remuneration purposes, Net Generated Equity will exclude inorganic actions such as rights issues, as determined by the Committee.
Straight line vesting applies between the threshold and maximum points in respect of the financial and risk measures.
The awards are subject to a discretionary underpin by which the Committee must be satisfied with the underlying financial health of the Group.
Awards under the 2015-2017 LTIP cycle will also be subject to malus and clawback provisions.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 105 Governance: Remuneration report Directors remuneration policy Notes to the table on pages 102 to 105: Performance measures and targets The Committee selected the relevant financial and risk based performance measures because they are key to the banks strategy and are important measures used by the executive Directors to oversee the direction of the business.
The Balanced Scorecard has been selected as it demonstrates the performance and progress of Barclays in the journey of becoming the Go-To bank as measured across the following dimensions 5Cs : Customers & Clients, Colleagues, Citizenship, Conduct and Company.
Each of the 5Cs in the Balanced Scorecard will have equal weighting.
All targets are set to be stretching but achievable and aligned to enhancing shareholder value.
The Committee is of the opinion that the performance targets for the annual bonus and Balanced Scorecard element of the LTIP are commercially sensitive in respect of the Company and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them before the start of the relevant performance period.
The performance against those measures will be disclosed after the end of the relevant financial year in that years remuneration report subject to the sensitivity no longer remaining.
Differences between the remuneration policy of the executive Directors and the policy for all employees of the Barclays Group The structure of total remuneration packages for executive Directors and for the broader employee population is similar.
Employees receive salary, pension and benefits and are eligible to be considered for a bonus and to participate in all employee share plans.
The broader employee population typically does not have a contractual limit on the quantum of their remuneration and does not receive RBP which is paid only to some, but not all, Code Staff.
Executive Director RBP is determined on a similar basis to other Code Staff.
The Committee approaches any salary increases for executive Directors by benchmarking against market data for named banks.
Incremental annual salary increases remain more common among employees at less senior levels.
As with executive Directors, bonuses for the broader employee population are performance based.
Bonuses for executive Directors and the broader employee population are subject to deferral requirements.
Executive Directors and other Code Staff are subject to deferral at a minimum rate of 40% for bonuses of no more than 500,000 or 60% for bonuses of more than 500,000 but the Committee may choose to operate higher deferral rates.
For non-Code Staff, bonuses in excess of 65,000 are subject to a graduated level of deferral.
The terms of deferred bonus awards for executive Directors and the wider employee population are broadly the same, in particular the vesting of all deferred bonuses subject to service and malus conditions.
The broader employee population is not eligible to participate in the Barclays LTIP.
How shareholder views and broader employee pay are taken into account by the Committee in setting policy and making remuneration decisions We recognise that remuneration is an area of particular interest to shareholders and that in setting and considering changes to remuneration it is critical that we listen to and take into account their views.
Accordingly, a series of meetings are held each year with major shareholders and shareholder representative groups including the Association of British Insurers, National Association of Pension Funds and ISS.
The Committee Chairman attends these meetings, accompanied by senior Barclays employees including the Reward and Performance Director and the Company Secretary.
The Committee notes that shareholder views on some matters are not always unanimous, but values the insight and engagement that these interactions and the expression of sometimes different views provide.
This engagement is meaningful and helpful to the Committee in its work and contributes directly to the decisions made by the Committee.
The Committee takes account of the pay and employment conditions of the broader employee base when it considers the remuneration of the executive Directors.
The Committee receives and reviews analysis of remuneration proposals for employees across all of the Groups businesses.
This includes analysis by corporate grade and by performance rating and information on proposed bonuses and salary increases across the employee population and individual proposals for Code Staff and highly paid individuals.
When the Committee considers executive Director remuneration, it therefore makes that consideration in the context of a detailed understanding of remuneration for the broader employee population and uses the all employee data to compare remuneration and ensure consistency throughout the Group.
Employees are not consulted directly on the Directors remuneration policy.

Barclays deferral policy shall however apply as a minimum to any buy out of annual bonus opportunity.
