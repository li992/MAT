Long term incentive plan Performance conditions Set out below is a summary of the performance conditions that apply to both the LTIP awards maturing in 2014 and the outstanding LTIP awards, including those granted in 2012 and 2013.
With effect from 1 October 2014 and subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 21 January 2015, new LTIP awards will be granted under the PSP at 175% of base salary: no further awards will be made under the SMP although existing SMP awards will continue to mature with the final awards maturing in November 2016.
The performance conditions applying to new awards made under the PSP will be revised from those set out below for existing awards granted in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
The first performance condition for the LTIP awards is that the average annual compound growth in the Companys adjusted EPS, over the three consecutive financial years following the financial year immediately prior to the grant, must exceed the annual compound growth rate in the UK Retail Price Index RPI by a specified amount over the same period.
For the new awards, the adjusted EPS targets will be specified as absolute figures, not relative to RPI.
The performance conditions are as follows: % of new % of existing awards Existing awards awards vesting New awards vesting Adjusted EPS growth over 3 years PSP SMP Adjusted EPS growths over3years PSP RPI 15% p. a. or above 100 100 RPI 12% p. a.

For the purposes of this condition, EPS is adjusted EPS as defined in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and this definition remains consistent with the definition of adjusted EPS approved by the Committee in previous years.
The second performance condition compares the growth of the Companys TSR over a three year period to that of the companies in the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts.
The performance conditions are as follows: % of new % of existing awards Existing awards awards vesting New awards vesting TSR relative to FTSE 250 Index over 3 years PSP SMP PSP Median 15% p. a. or greater 100 100 Median 12% p. a.

The FTSE 250 Index was chosen because this is a recognised broad equity market index of which the Company is a member.
Awards vesting in 2014 The PSP and SMP awards made to the Executive Directors on 16 and 19 December 2011 respectively, were subject to independently operating performance conditions, assessed over a three year period ended 30 September 2014, as set out in the table above.

These awards were based onthe midmarket price of an ordinary share in the Company at close of business on the day immediately preceding the award.
Under the SMP, the Executive Directors are required to pledge shares for a minimum period of three years: these shares were pledged on an after tax basis and awards were made on a pretax basis.
Under normal circumstances, the options will not become exercisable until the performance conditions are determined after the end of the threeyear measurement period which begins on the first day of the financial year in which the award is made, and provided the Director remains in employment.
The level of vesting is dependent on the achievement of specified performance criteria at the end of the threeyear measurement period.
The performance conditions for these awards are set out on pages 61and62.
Outstanding sharebased performance awards Set out below is a summary of the sharebased awards outstanding at 30 September 2014, including both share awards which have vested during the year based on performance and share awards which have been granted during the year.

Relative importance of Executive Director remuneration unaudited FY2014 FY2013 Change m m m Total employee remuneration 57.1 54.8 2.3 Total dividends paid 18.2 17.4 0.8 66 DIPLOMA PLC Governance Remuneration Committee Report continued Annual Report on Remuneration Executive Directors interest in options over shares In respect of nil cost options granted under the PSP and SMP, the remuneration receivable by an Executive Director is calculated on the date that the options first vest.
The remuneration of the Executive Director is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to exercise the options to acquire the shares and the total value of the shares on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil cost options on the vesting date he may exercise the options at any time up to the day preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the underlying share price between the initial vesting date and the date of exercise of the option.
This increase or decrease in value reflects an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
The nil cost options outstanding at 30 September 2014 and the movement during the year are as follows: Options Earliest Vested unexercised normal Year of Options as at Exercised during as at 30 Sep Exercise exercise 5 vesting 1 Oct 2013 in year the year 2014 price date Expiry date 1 Bruce Thompson 2013 246,154 246,154 1 Nov 2013 Jan 2021 2014 142,717 142,717 1 Nov 2014 Dec 2021 2 Iain Henderson 2013 150,428 150,428 1 Nov 2013 Jan 2021 2014 88,967 88,967 1 Nov 2014 Dec 2021 3 Nigel Lingwood 2013 157,264 157,264 1 Nov 2013 Jan 2021 2014 92,675 92,675 1 Nov 2014 Dec 2021 1 Bruce Thompson exercised 246,154 options on 21 November 2013, at a market price of 676.0p per share and the total proceeds before tax were 1,664,001.

DIPLOMA PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance 67 Shareholding guidelines The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors, to encourage substantial long term share ownership.
These specify that, over a period of five years from the date of appointment, the Chief Executive Officer should build up and then retain a holding of shares with a value equivalent to 200% of base salary.
The guideline holding for other Executive Directors is 100% of base salary.
The guidelines also require that, in relation to LTIP awards, vested shares net of tax should be retained by the individual until the required shareholding level is reached.
As at 14 November 2014, all Executive Directors exceeded the applicable shareholding guidelines.

Annual bonuses are linked to short term financial targets which use similar performance metrics to the targets for the Executive Directors.
They also participate in cash based long term incentive plans which are focused on the operating profit growth of their businesses over rolling three year periods.
The Committee reviews and monitors the senior executive remuneration arrangements.
