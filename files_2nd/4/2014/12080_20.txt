Thomas Thune Andersen Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 24 February 2015 Petrofac 98 Annual report and accounts 2014 Directors remuneration report continued Policy Report Looking forward Our Directors Remuneration Policy the Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 15 May 2014 for a period of up to three years.
In order to provide the context in which individual remuneration decisions have been made during the year, the approved policy table, and notes to the table, have been included below.
The full Remuneration Policy, as approved, is available on www.
The policy for Executive Directors is designed in line with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration for the wider Group and all our reward arrangements are built around common objectives and principles.
As a Jersey-incorporated company, Petrofac does not have the benefit of the statutory protections afforded by the UK Companies Act 2006 in relation to the new reporting regime.
While the Policy Report was not submitted as a binding resolution at the AGM, the Committee considers the vote of shareholders to be binding in its application.
However, if there is any inconsistency between the Companys Policy Report as approved by shareholders in 2014 and any contractual entitlement or other right of a Director, the Company may be obliged to honour that existing entitlement or right.

This share price represents the five-day average share price up to 19 March 2014.
The Committee reviewed targets in early 2014 by reference to a number of internal and external reference points to ensure that they are positioned at a level which it considers appropriate and stretching in the context of the business strategy and earnings expectations for the next three years, whilst ensuring that they do not drive unacceptable levels of risk and encourage inappropriate behaviours.
Strategic report Governance Petrofac Financial statements 107 Annual report and accounts 2014 As a result, the EPS targets were repositioned for the 2014 awards as follows: EPS growth per annum Percentage of EPS element vesting 7.5% or less 0% 10% 30% 15% or more 100% The TSR peer group used for this award is the same as outlined on page 106, save that Maire Tecnimont is replaced by Baker Hughes.
The TSR outperformance requirements and associated vesting schedule remain unchanged.

Statement of Directors shareholding and share interests Directors shareholdings held during the year and as at 31 December 2014 and share ownership guidelines Following discussions with shareholders in relation to the VCP in 2012, the Committee introduced a shareholding requirement of 300% of base salary for those Executive Directors participating in the plan.
Ayman Asfari was not a participant in the VCP and was therefore not subject to the formal shareholding requirement.
In any event, as a founder, Ayman already had a substantial shareholding interest in the Company, signicantly in excess of the required levels.
Until the relevant shareholding guidelines have been met, Executive Directors are encouraged to retain vested shares earned under the Companys incentive plans.
Unvested share awards are not taken into account when considering an Executive Directors progress towards the shareholding requirements.

6 Shares awarded under the RSP on 6 September 2011 were not subject to performance conditions and the final tranche vested to Tim Weller on Monday 8 September 2014 when the closing share price was 1095p.
