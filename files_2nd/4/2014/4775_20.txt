Overview Strategic Report Financial Statements Other Information Governance Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 47 Introduction At the AGM held on 5 June 2014, shareholders overwhelmingly approved a new Directors' Remuneration Policy for the Company.
This policy, which specifies the pay elements operated by the Company and summarises the approach that the Committee will adopt in certain circumstances such as the recruitment of new directors and or the making of any payments for loss of office, became effective on approval of the Policy and was applied by the Committee during 2014.
It will continue to be operated in 2015.
Although not required by The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Regulations 2008 as amended in 2013, the substantive terms of the above Directors' Remuneration Policy are repeated for ease of reference.
However, any details that were specific to 2014 or earlier years including, for example, any disclosures relating to named directors and the illustrative remuneration scenarios set out on page 50 have been updated to reflect the current position.
The policy as originally approved by shareholders can be found on pages 54 to 67 of the Annual Report & Accounts 2013, a copy of which is available on the Company's website www.
REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will: Align rewards with the interests of shareholders: Motivate and encourage superior performance: Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy: Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management: and Ensure that the overall package for each Director is linked to strategic objectives of the Group.
The Remuneration Committee is confident that this policy will retain and develop further the Groups entrepreneurial culture, whilst also focusing executive remuneration on performance which the Committee believes will best serve shareholders interests.
It is therefore the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior performance by Executive Directors with that performance being measured against robust financial performance and returns to shareholders.
This is achieved by heavily weighting the overall remuneration package towards variable pay.

In terms of annual performance targets, underlying EPS is used as the primary performance metric reflecting the Company's objective of increasing earnings and shareholder value.
Total Shareholder Return is an important benchmark of the success of the business and provides a strong alignment with the returns received by shareholders.
The EPS measure ensures a focus on long-term profitability which the Committee believes is a driver of shareholder value.
Dignity plc 50 Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance Report on Directors remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 26 December 2014 Bonus Plan and LTIP discretions The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and LTIP according to their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
A copy of the LTIP rules is available on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of these plans.
These include but are not limited to the following albeit with the level of award restricted as set out in the policy table above : Who participates in the plans: The timing of grant of award and or payment: The size of an award and or a payment: Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction: Determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate treatment chosen: Adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends : and The ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose whilst being no less stretching.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed previously to shareholders.
Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees The Committee is made aware of pay structures across the wider Group when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary review for the Executive Directors.
An annual bonus plan operates across all employees in the Group and all permanent employees are eligible to participate in the SAYE scheme.
Overall, the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees.
This ensures that there is a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration received by the Executive Directors given it is the Executive Directors who are considered to have the greatest potential to influence Company value creation.
Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors The Company's policy results in a significant portion of remuneration received by Executive Directors being dependent on Company performance.
The graph below illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the Executive Directors for 2015 vary under three performance scenarios: below target, on-target and maximum.
Fixed pay is the sum of 2015 basic salary, the value of benefits in 2014 and 2015 pension provision.
Fixed pay is constant across all three scenarios.
For On-target: assumed 70 per cent of maximum bonus paid which is also the start-to-earn point and 50 per cent of LTIP vests.
For Maximum: assumed full bonus payment and LTIP vests in full.
No account has been taken of any changes in the Company's share price since the end of the period.
Below target On-target Maximum Below target On-target Maximum Below target On-target Maximum Below target On-target Maximum Overview Strategic Report Financial Statements Other Information Governance Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 51 Recruitment and Promotion policy The remuneration package for a new director will be established in accordance with the Company's approved policy subject to such modifications as are set out below.
Salary levels for Executive Directors will be set in accordance with the Company's remuneration policy, taking into account the experience and calibre of the individual and their existing remuneration package.
Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, a series of increases to the desired salary positioning may be made over subsequent years subject to individual performance and development in the role.
Benefits will generally be provided in line with the approved policy, with relocation or other expenses provided for if necessary.
A pension contribution of up to 15 per cent of salary may be provided or continued participation in the defined benefit pension scheme for a promoted employee who currently participates in the plan.
The structure of variable pay elements will be in accordance with the Company's approved policy detailed above.
The maximum aggregate variable pay opportunity is 225 per cent of base salary.
Different performance measures may be set initially for the annual bonus in the year of joining, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial year that he or she joined the Board.
In the case of external recruitment, if it is necessary to buy out incentive pay or benefit arrangements which would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer, this may be provided, taking into account the form cash or shares, timing and expected value i. e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria of the remuneration being forfeited.
Replacement share awards, if used, may be granted using the Company's existing share plans to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the LSE Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal recruitment, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms of grant or adjusted as considered desirable to reflect the new role.
Fees for a new chairman or non-executive director will be set in line with the approved policy.
Service contracts and payments for loss of office The Company's policy is to have service contracts for Executive Directors that continue indefinitely unless determined by their notice period.
Under the Executive Directors' service contracts and in line with the policy for new appointments, 12 months' notice of termination of employment is required by either party.
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of two years, subject to annual reappointment at the AGM.
Appointments may be terminated with three months' notice.
The appointment letters for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors provide that no compensation is payable on termination, other than accrued fees and expenses.
In accordance with the terms of the UK Corporate Governance Code all Directors submit themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting each year.
Service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.
Details of the service contracts with all Executive Directors and letters of appointment with Non-Executive Directors are as follows: Unexpired term of contract or letter of appointment Name Contract date Notice period at period end Mike McCollum 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract Andrew Davies 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract Richard Portman 1 November 2006 12 months Rolling Contract Steve Whittern 1 January 2009 12 months Rolling Contract Peter Hindley 7 December 2013 3 months 24 months Ishbel Macpherson 1 January 2015 3 months 24 months Alan McWalter 1 January 2015 3 months 24 months Jane Ashcroft 1 April 2014 3 months 15 months Martin Pexton 1 April 2014 3 months 15 months Dignity plc 52 Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance Report on Directors remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 26 December 2014 For Executive Directors, the Company may in its absolute discretion at any time after notice is served by either party, terminate a Directors' contract with immediate effect by paying an amount equal to base salary for the then unexpired period of notice plus the fair value of contractual benefits subject to the deduction of tax.
An Executive Director's service contract may be terminated without notice for certain events such as gross misconduct or a serious breach of contract.
No payment or compensation beyond salary and the value of holiday entitlement accrued up to the date of termination will be made if such an event occurs.
There are no special provisions relating to change of control.
The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations and the Committee ensures that there are no unjustified payments for failure.
Any statutory payments required by law may be made.
The Group allows Executive Directors to hold a Non-Executive position with one other company or organisation, for which they can retain the fees earned.
Mike McCollum was appointed a non-executive director of CVS Group plc on 2 April 2013 and received remuneration of 40,000 per annum including an allowance for his role as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Treatment of incentives The treatment of share-based incentives previously granted to an Executive Director under the LTIP will be determined based on the plan rules.
The default treatment will be for outstanding awards to lapse on cessation of employment.
However, an executive will be treated as a 'good leaver' under certain circumstances such as death, illness, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, his employing company ceasing to be a Group Company or the undertaking business or division for which he or she works being sold out of the Company's Group, or any other circumstances at the discretion of the Employee Benefits Trust trustee having obtained the opinion of the Committee.
If treated as a good leaver, awards will vest, as normal, three years after grant after an assessment of the extent to which performance targets have been achieved.
The number of awards that would vest will be reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the three year period actually served.
How shareholder views are taken into account The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time, is then considered as part of the Company's annual review of remuneration policy.
In early 2015 the Committee consulted our leading shareholders and certain institutional shareholder bodies proxy agencies over proposed salary rises.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Company, does not actively consult with employees on Directors' remuneration.
However, when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of other employees in the Group.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION This part of the report has been prepared in accordance with Part 3 of Schedule 8 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013, and 9.8.
The Annual Report on Remuneration set out below and the Chairman's Annual Statement will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2015 AGM.
The information from the single total remunerations figures for Directors on page 54 to the end of page 56 has been audited.
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2014 Salaries Following the review of Executive Directors' base salaries during the last quarter of the financial period ending 26 December 2014, and after considering the levels of anticipated salary increases across the Group as a whole, the Committee decided to increase the Executive Directors' salaries as shown in the table below with effect from 1 January 2015.
2015 2014 Increase Mike McCollum 486,000 476,250 2% Andrew Davies 310,000 270,500 15% Richard Portman 235,000 230,000 2% Steve Whittern 300,000 265,000 13% Over the last two years the Committee has moved to correct Steve Whitterns below market base salary, to reflect his progress in his role of Finance Director.
In last year's report, we flagged that the Committee may continue this process by applying above inflationary increases and the latest increase reflects Mr Whittern's continued strong performance in the role.
A key example of this in 2014 was the strong leadership he showed in the complex 600 million refinancing of the Group's debt obligations.
The increase for 2015 also reflects his overall increased experience and the Committee's staged approach to increases over a period of time.
The Committee is aware of the dangers of over-reliance on market data but, for information, the latest increase will position his salary and total target remuneration below market levels by FTSE 250 standards.
Overview Strategic Report Financial Statements Other Information Governance Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 53 The Committee has increased Andrew Davies's salary by 15 per cent to reflect his increased responsibilities as Operations Director and the importance of his role in delivering the Group's strategy.
In making its decision, the Committee considered the following factors: The number of funeral locations has increased from 544 to 718, a 32 per cent increase, since 2008: Acquisition activity for small businesses has increased significantly with Andrew Davies taking a vital role in overseeing each deal undertaken.
This includes the successful integration of Yew Holdings Limited which, under his guidance, is operating well ahead of plan: Mr Davies is taking additional responsibility for vehicle procurement in 2015: Since an increase to his salary in 2008, his annual increases have been modest at two per cent or lower in each of the last five years: It is imperative that Mr Davies is remunerated at a rate that is in line with market levels and that he is appropriately incentivised and retained for the next stage in the Company's strategy: and Mr Davies's 2015 salary and total target remuneration will also be below FTSE 250 market levels.
The salaries for Mike McCollum and Richard Portman have increased by two per cent which is in line with the general employee increase.
The Committee is satisfied that the above salary changes reflect the size, breadth and sophistication of the Group and the roles and will assist in providing market competitive salaries which better reflect the individuals' responsibilities and experience.
Chairman and NonExecutive Directors' fees As set out in the Policy Report, the Company's approach to setting Non-Executive Directors' remuneration is with reference to market levels in comparably sized FTSE companies, levels of responsibility and time commitments.
An inflationary rise has been applied to their fees for 2015.
A summary of current fees is as follows: 2015 2014 Increase Peter Hindley 166,600 163,250 2% Jane Ashcroft 45,000 44,000 2% Ishbel Macpherson 54,000 52,900 2% Alan McWalter 60,400 59,000 2% Martin Pexton 45,000 44,000 2% The base fees for Non-Executive Directors in 2015 were 45,000.
The Senior Independent Director receives an additional fee of 9,300 and the Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration Committees receive additional fees of 9,000 and 6,100 respectively.
The fees have been increased by two per cent from 2014.
Pension and Benefits Mike McCollum receives a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 15 per cent of his basic salary.
Richard Portman ceased to be an active member of the Group's defined benefit plan on 31 March 2014 and receives a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 15 per cent of his basic salary.
No contributions will be made for Andrew Davies or Steve Whittern in 2015.
Annual bonus The annual bonus will operate on the same basis as for 2014 and consistent with the policy detailed in the Policy Report in terms of the maximum bonus opportunity and clawback and malus provisions.
All of the bonus will be based on EPS targets with nothing payable for performance below a minimum level of performance, 70 per cent payable for achieving a demanding target and a further 30 per cent payable for achieving a second, more demanding, target.
The EPS targets themselves are deemed to be commercially sensitive and have not been disclosed prospectively.
However, full retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year's remuneration report.
Longterm incentives The maximum normal annual award limit under the LTIP is 125 per cent of salary and it is intended that awards will be granted in 2015 at this level to Executive Directors.
Clawback and malus provisions will operate as set out in the Policy Report.
Consistent with the conditions applying to the 2014 awards, half of the 2015 awards will be subject to a relative TSR measure measured against the constituents of the FTSE 350 as at 29 December 2014 and the other half subject to EPS growth targets.
The performance period for both tranches will be the three financial years, 2015-2017.
TSR No part of this award vests if performance is below median, 25 per cent vests for achieving median, with 100 per cent vesting for upper quartile performance with straight line vesting in between.
For this part of the award, no vesting can occur unless the Committee considers that the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory.
EPS No part of this award vests if compound annual growth in underlying EPS above RPI is less than six per cent p. a.
15 per cent vests for six per cent p. a. real growth, 50 per cent vests for nine per cent p. a. real growth with full vesting for 11 per cent p. a. real growth or better.
Vesting is on a straight line basis for performance in between these points.
The Committee believes the EPS targets are sufficiently challenging in light of internal and external forecasts.

b Pension includes a cash contribution for Mike McCollum and the value of participation in the Groups defined benefit pension scheme for Richard Portman to 31 March 2014 and a cash contribution thereafter.
c The bonus refers to performance in the 2014 financial year and is due to be paid in cash in March 2015. d The LTIP value relates to the award that was granted on 28 March 2012.
The performance period for this award ends on 28 March 2015.
Our estimate of likely vesting is based on performance to 26 December 2014 and using the average share price for the 28 day period to 26 December 2014.
The comparative number is the 2011 LTIP that vested in 2014 which has been updated for the final level of vesting of 100 per cent and for the share price at the date of vesting 1,471 pence.
This represents the gain on options exercised by the Executive Directors in 2014. e The value of SAYE awards upon exercise.

Half of the awards will vest depending on the Companys TSR performance over a three year period commencing on 1 January 2014, with no opportunity to retest.
TSR will be compared to the constituents of the FTSE 350.
No award will vest unless the Committee considers that the Groups underlying financial performance over the period has been satisfactory.
None of the award shall vest if the Company's ranking is below median.
At median, 25 per cent of the award will vest and the award will vest in full if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile.
Awards will vest on a straight line basis for a ranking between median and upper quartile.
The other half of the awards will vest subject to a sliding scale of underlying EPS growth targets measured over three financial years to 30 December 2016.
15 per cent of this part of the award vests for compound annual growth in underlying EPS above RPI of six per cent p. a.
50 per cent vests for nine per cent p. a. real growth with full vesting for 11 per cent p. a. real growth or better.
Clawback and malus provisions apply.
Awards will only be released if the Groups comparative TSR performance is equal or greater than the median level of performance over the holding period at which point 25 per cent of the award will be released with full vesting occurring for an upper quartile performance.
Vesting occurs on a straight line basis between these points.
Half of the awards made in 2013 and 2014 are subject to a relative TSR condition as described above with the other half based on EPS growth targets.
