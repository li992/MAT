It also describes the groups compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to remuneration.
REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES Our overall remuneration principles align to our strategy.
The strategic objectives are to grow the business in several key areas: LGIM international expansion, retirement solutions, protection, direct investments and focus on the use of digital technology to enhance customer experience and deliver operational effectiveness.
To deliver the growth requires a strong performance culture and our remuneration principles take this into consideration.
We also want to ensure we operate within the appropriate culture and therefore the principles support and reinforce customer outcomes, our values, behaviours and risk appetite.
Our remuneration principles aim to be clear and simple and strengthen the link of reward for exceptional performance, as well as emphasise the importance of teamwork.
The principles of our remuneration policy are summarised below: 1.
The structure should be fair, simple and transparent, with targets objectively set and independently reviewed by the CRO.
It should be reflective of external best practice.
We should never be laggards and where appropriate we should take a leadership position.
Overall remuneration should be competitively positioned and consistent with executives experience.
It should be sufficient to ensure that we can recruit and retain the best talent to support our strategy.
Strong performance will be rewarded, but only if consistent with living and respecting Legal & Generals values and behaviours, ensuring that we deliver results within our risk parameters and that we have desired customer outcomes Malus and clawback will apply as appropriate.
Remuneration should have a balance of reward for short term one year or less delivery as well as long term three plus years delivery.
Executives interests should be aligned to those of shareholders.
Both at Board level and below, the reward structure should recognise teamwork and the proportion of an individuals reward that is linked to overall Legal & General performance as opposed to business unit performance should increase with seniority.
At executive level this reinforces the collective responsibility across divisions.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY 81 Approach to recruitment recruitment remuneration STANDARD POLICY AND OTHER PROVISIONS PROVISION General approach The Committee aims to attract, motivate and retain an executive director with the required expertise to develop and deliver the business strategy, while at the same time ensuring that the remuneration arrangements offered are in the best interests of both the company and its shareholders and paying no more than considered necessary to attract the right calibre of candidate to the role.
In determining the appropriate remuneration arrangements on hiring a new executive director, the Committee will take into account all relevant factors including, but not limited to: The individuals skills and relevant experience Internal relativities Local market practice in the jurisdiction from which candidate was recruited Logistics and support if a relocation is required Appropriate market data The individuals existing remuneration package Where possible the Committee endeavours to align the remuneration arrangements of new executive directors with the remuneration outlined in the policy for other executive directors.
Any such awards will be within the maximum level of variable remuneration limit set out below.
Where an existing internal candidate is made an executive director, the Committee may continue to honour prior commitments made before joining the Board.
Maximum variable The maximum level of annual variable pay and long-term incentives which may be awarded to a new executive director pay levels will be in line with the policy table i. e. 475% of base salary.
This limit excludes buyout awards.
Buyout of The Committee recognises that, as a consequence of regulatory changes around the globe in the financial services sector, any existing long serving executives in the sector are likely to have accrued significant levels of deferred remuneration which may remuneration be lost on a transfer of employment.
Accordingly, to aid the recruitment of a new executive director, the Committee may components make awards to buyout remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, taking into consideration or other relevant factors including, but not limited to: arrangements Form of the award Any performance conditions attached to those awards The vesting profile of the awards and likelihood of vesting Relevant regulatory requirements and guidance in place in relation to buy-out awards Buyout awards will typically reflect the terms and the value of the arrangements foregone.
Where possible the Committee will use existing share based plans to effect a buyout.
However, in the event these are not an appropriate vehicle, the Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to use the Listing Rules exemption LR 9.4.
2 for the purpose of making an award to buyout remuneration terms forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Relocation Where a new executive director has to relocate to take up the appointment, either within the UK or from overseas, practical and mobility and or financial support may be given in relation to relocation or mobility in line with our internal policies.
This may include the cost of any tax that is incurred.
For appointments from overseas, home country benefits may continue to apply.
Note that relocation and mobility support may also apply to the recruitment of a non-executive director NED.
Shareholder The Committee believes that remuneration arrangements should be as transparent as possible.
Therefore the Committee transparency will make every effort to explain the rationale for the recruitment arrangements in the Directors remuneration report following the recruitment of a new executive director.
Recruitment of The Committee will normally align the remuneration arrangements for new non-executive directors with those outlined non-executive within the policy table on page 73 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2013. directors LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 | 82 GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REPORT ON REMUNERATION Directors report on remuneration Directors remuneration policy Approach to termination service contracts, termination and payment for loss of office When determining leaving arrangements for an executive director, the Committee takes into account any pre-established agreements, including the provisions of any incentive plans, typical market practice, statutory and contractual obligations, the performance and conduct of the individual and the commercial justification for any payments.

Payments in lieu of notice: Our policy for new appointments is that termination payments in lieu of notice would consist solely of base salary and the cost of providing benefits for the outstanding notice period and will be subject to deductions for income tax and National Insurance as appropriate.
Any statutory requirements will be observed.
Our standard practice is to include within executive directors contractual terms mitigation provisions as regards payments in lieu of notice.

In line with policy, the Committee carefully reviewed the companys underlying performance over the performance period.
The review included considerations of partnerships entered into and maintained, cost management, capital management and risk.
The Committee felt the company performance had been strong over the period and saw no reason not to allow the PSP to vest in accordance with the TSR out-turn.

To do this the Committee will look at a number of factors including: whether the result is reflective of underlying performance and has been achieved within the companys agreed risk appetite: the quality of earnings and the nature of any changes in leverage: key assumptions: dividend cover and behaviours etc.
If such considerations mean that the formulaic outcome of the vesting schedule is not felt to be justified, then the Committee can exercise downwards discretion.

They include vested shares where the executive director has beneficial ownership, shares independently acquired in the market and those held by a spouse or civil partner or dependent child under the age of 18 years.
Although the share ownership guidelines are not contractually binding, executive directors are normally expected to retain any after tax vested share awards until the guideline is met.
The Committee retains the discretion to withhold future grants under the PSP if executives are not making satisfactory progress against the guidelines.
Once shareholding requirements have been met, executive directors may sell surplus shares if they wish.
The Committee has discretion to allow executive directors to sell shares prior to the shareholding requirements being met if there are extenuating circumstances for example, changes to personal circumstances such as divorce.

As outlined to shareholders during the consultation last year, Nigel Wilson was appointed at a base salary level which was below the market rate, with the intention to increase his salary to a more appropriate level to reflect his experience and performance in the role over time.
Following a review of Nigels performance in the role for 2014, his third year of CEO tenure, the Committee considered it appropriate to continue with the salary progression for Nigel, who receives an increase of 4.9% for 2015.
Benefits for 2015 Benefits for 2015 to be in line with policy, as outlined on page 79.

Johns usual maximum AVP opportunity is 150% of base salary.
Performance will be based on a combination of group and or Divisional financial performance targets as well as strategic including customer and employee measures and personal measures.
The majority of the targets will be financial.
Performance share plan PSP 2015 For 2015, each executive director will be granted an award over nil-cost options with a face value of 250% of base salary except for John Pollock who will not receive a PSP award in his year of cessation.
Given the level of stretch within the financial and TSR performance conditions used for the 2014 award, the Committee considered it appropriate to use the same performance conditions for the 2015 award.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION 95 Considering risk The Reward Steering Committee RSC and the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function make a key contribution to the process of designing reward structures and evaluating whether achievement of objectives and any payment from plans have taken into account the overall risk profile of the company.
Reward Steering Committee RSC Reporting to the Remuneration Committee, the RSC helps set the framework within which our incentive arrangements are normally reviewed and implemented, with a view to supporting business strategy, whilst acting within the groups risk appetite.
The members of the RSC include group and business HR directors, reward and performance director, the group director of regulatory risk and compliance, the regulatory risk director and the chief compliance Officer, LGIM.
Where a business unit tables a proposal for consideration, the relevant business manager is required to attend the RSC meeting to explain the background and to answer all questions and challenges from the RSC.
Group regulatory risk and compliance function The Remuneration Committee also works closely with the group regulatory risk and compliance function with respect to remuneration proposals.
In particular the Function reports to the Committee on an annual basis on whether any risks have been taken outside of pre-agreed parameters, there have been regulatory breaches, or they are aware of any other considerations that may lead the Committee to consider whether it should impact the payment of bonuses to staff including in particular the executive directors and Code Staff.
The CRO also specifically looks at the overall risk profile of the company and whether executive directors have achieved objectives within the companys accepted risk appetite.
The CRO also reviews the executive directors objectives for the forthcoming year to ensure they are in line with the risk parameters.
Engagement with shareholders The Committee seeks to maintain an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance generally and any changes to the companys executive pay arrangements.
During early 2014, the Remuneration Committee sought the views of the groups major shareholders on the proposed changes to executive remuneration arrangements for 2014 onwards.
Following the strong support received from shareholders at both individual meetings and at the AGM, the Committee considered it appropriate to enact the proposed changes to the policy during 2014.
The Committee remains committed to open dialogue with shareholders and as such will engage with shareholders as appropriate in 2015.

Remuneration is considered within the overall context of the groups sector and the markets in which the divisions operate.
The policy for the majority of employees continues to be to pay around the relevant mid-market range with a competitive package designed to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, and with an appropriate proportion of total remuneration dependent upon performance.
We define core remuneration as base salary, annual bonus and other benefits such as pension.
Key employees are also eligible to participate in the performance share plan PSP.
Summary of the remuneration structure for employees below Board ELEMENT POLICY Base salary We aim to attract and retain key employees by paying salaries which deliver competitive total remuneration, taking into account market pay levels at companies of similar size, scale and scope as well as overall business performance.
A key factor is also the ability, experience and performance of the individual.
For 2015, base salary budgets have been set at 2.4% for all employees below Board, including LGIM.
However, this does not mean a flat increase at this level for everyone.
Annual bonus The majority of employees have a discretionary bonus scheme based on individual performance against objectives.
Bonuses above a certain threshold are subject to deferral with the deferral amount increasing with the size of the bonus.
Deferred awards are normally held in shares for three years.
The company reserves the right to adjust deferral levels for Code staff as deemed appropriate.
The group operates bespoke bonus schemes where business appropriate, however, the Remuneration Committee has ultimate discretion over all bonus plans.
Separate plans operate within LGIM consistent with industry practice.
Performance share Participation in the PSP generally is extended to the senior management population but may include other employees plan PSP in key roles.
This includes employees in LGIM whose roles span different business divisions and whose participation encourages synergy and teamwork across the group.
Typically less than 100 employees participate in total in the PSP.
Participation in the plan for one year does not guarantee participation in future years.
PSP awards will be made to under 100 employees during 2015.
Where appropriate, grants under the PSP may also be made for new employees who join the company during the year in key roles.
Pension All employees are given the opportunity to participate in a group pension scheme.
Shareholding The leadership group is asked to build up a voluntary shareholding of 50% of base salary.
requirements LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION 97 Annual equal pay audit The group seeks to ensure that our pay policies and practices are free from unfair bias.
Part of the pay review process is an annual equal pay audit that reviews pay and bonus decisions by gender, ethnicity, age and full-time versus part-time working.
In addition, it considers the pay of the control function departments risk, compliance and internal audit as well as the oversight departments of finance and human resources and looks at decisions for employees who report directly to the business versus those who report to the function head.
The review extends to all employees, including those in LGIM.
All employee share schemes There are approved HMRC employee share plans in operation for all UK employees including the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme SAYE and the Employee Share Plan ESP.
The Committee has increased the amount which may be saved under the SAYE from 250 to 375 per month from April 2015.
The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the group shares on the invitation date.
Each year the Committee also considers a grant of Group Performance Shares Freeshares after the annual results.
The Committee did not grant any awards in respect of 2014 performance for 2013 performance 280 shares were granted.
Dilution limits The companys all-employee plans and the now-closed ESOS operate within the ABIs dilution limit of 5% of issued capital in 10 years for executive schemes and all its plans will operate within the 10% of issued capital in 10 years limit for all schemes.
As at 31 December 2014, the company had 4.91% of share capital available under the 5% in 10 years limit, and 9.57% of share capital under the 10% in 10 years limit.
As at 31 December 2014, 22,452,298 shares were held by the Employee Benefit Trust to hedge outstanding awards of 40,749,876 shares for the PSP and SBP.
Other information relating to directors remuneration External appointments The company considers that certain external appointments can help to broaden the experience and contribution to the Board of the executive directors.
Any such appointments are subject to annual agreement by the group and must not be with competing companies.
