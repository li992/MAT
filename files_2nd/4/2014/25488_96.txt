Gross remuneration increases for other employees across the group have generally been in the range of 4.0% to 6.0%.
The executive directors receive other benefi ts which may include pension schemes: life, disability and personal accident insurance: and medical cover, on similar terms to other senior executives.
Retirement benefi ts: None of the directors belong to a defi ned benefi t pension scheme and all are members of one of our defi ned contribution pension or provident schemes.
The amounts refl ected in the table above represent the contribution to these schemes payable by thecompany.
Annual bonus Notwithstanding that HJ du Toit is currently a director of Investec plc and Investec Limited: he does not perform Investec group-wide executive activities.
Accordingly, HJ du Toit and any remuneration benefi ts due to him are subject to the remuneration policies, rules and regulations applicable to employees of Investec Asset Management and not the remuneration policies, rules and regulations applicable to other entities within the Investec group.
Investec Asset Management reported an increase in adjusted operating profi t before tax and non-controlling interests of 2.4% to 143.8 million.
Assets under management amounted to 68.0 billion, with 2.6 billion in net infl ows.
HJ du Toit applied the after taxation proceeds of his bonus against the funding of his interest in the Investec Asset Management equity ownership scheme as explained onpage 135.
S Koseff, B Kantor and GR Burger are classifi ed as PRA Code staff.
The annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2014 for S Koseff, B Kantor and GR Burger was determined with reference to performance against fi financial and non-fi financial metrics as set out below and described in detail on pages 141 to 143.
152 Investec integrated annual report 2014 Remuneration report Remuneration report continued The determination of the bonus for S Koseff and B Kantor is shown below: Adjusted operating profi t at 31 March 2014 000 440787 CEO MD incentive pool at 0.5% 000 2 204 Maximum leverage at 180%, i. e. maximum potential bonus 000 3967 Financial metrics Achievement levels Actual achieveActual Actual ment at allocation weighting 31 March Threshold Target Stretch achieved achieved Weighting 2014 0% 100% 200% 000 % Return on risk-weighted assets 35% 1.14% 0.9% 1.2% 1.6% 612 27.7% Return on equity 25% 10.1% 9% 12% 15% 194 8.8% Tier 1 capital adequacy 12.50% 10.7% 9.5% 10.5% 12.0% 312 14.2% LCR 6.25% 255.7% 115% 132.5% 162.5% 275 12.5% NSFR 6.25% 97.5% 82% 89.5% 99.5% 247 11.2% Total 85.0% 1640 74.4% While the above approach was not applied in the calculation of the bonus in the 2013 fi financial year, if one had to use the same basis retrospectively, the portion of the 2013 bonus achieved for fi financial metrics would have amounted to 1 248 000 403 000 for return on risk-weighted assets: 62 000 for return on equity: 337 000 for tier 1 capital adequacy: 266 000 for the LCR: and 180 000 for the NSFR.
The increase in the portion of the bonus for the 2014 fi financial year attributable to performance against fi financial metrics is thus largely a result of the improvement in return on risk-weighted assets and return on equity.
Non-fi financial metrics Following an assessment of these metrics as described on pages 143 and 144 the remuneration committee decided to allocate an award of approximately 330 000 for performance against non-fi financial metrics which equated to an overall weighting achieved of 15%.

Non-fi financial metrics Following an assessment of these metrics as described on pages 143 and 144 the remuneration committee decided to allocate an award of approximately 295 000 for performance against non-fi financial metrics which equated to an overall weighting achieved of 15%.
