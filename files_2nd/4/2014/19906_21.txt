INCENTIVE OUTCOMES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014 AUDITED Performance Related Annual Bonus in respect of 2014 performance The 2014 annual bonus consists of two elements, corporate and individual.
The corporate element of the bonus is calculated on a sliding scale up to a maximum of 120% of base salary, in accordance with which 'on target' performance by the Group results in a corporate bonus of an amount equivalent to 70% of base salary.
To determine the actual bonus payment to an Executive Director, a multiplier being the 'individual' element of the scheme ranging between zero and 1.2 is applied against the corporate bonus.
The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 73 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED Applying the maximum individual multiplier of 1.2, against the maximum corporate bonus of 120% of base salary results in a maximum annual performance related bonus opportunity of 144% of base salary.
However, bonus payments at that level would only be made subject to the achievement of extremely stretching corporate performance targets and exceptional individual performance by the relevant Director.
Target performance typically requires meaningful improvement on the previous years outturn, and for financial measures targets are typically in line with the upper end of market consensus.
The performance related bonuses awarded in respect of 2014 reflect corporate bonuses of 107.3% of base salary.
After applying individual multipliers, actual performance related bonus payments awarded to the Executive Directors were 128.8% of their respective base salaries 89.4% of their maximum bonus opportunities.
Further details, including the targets set and performance against each of the metrics, are provided in the tables below: Corporate element outcomes Original performance targets Threshold Target 100% Stretch Vest Measure Wgt.

Following the placing, the Remuneration Committee evaluated the potential impact on the outcomes of the Performance Related Annual Bonus in respect of 2014 performance and adjusted the actual outcomes for both operating cash flow and see-through LTV to hold Executive bonuses neutral to the capital raise, as follows: Actual operating cash flow was reduced by 2.4 million to neutralise the impact on cash flow of a higher stake in USAF Actual see-through LTV was increased by 4% to account for additional net cash on the balance sheet awaiting deployment No adjustment were made to Adjusted EPS or TR measures which are, as per share measures, already neutral to the capital raise.
The Committee is satisfied that the overall bonus outcomes detailed above are a fair reflection of each individuals performance during the year.
2012 LTIP VESTING VESTED ON PERFORMANCE TO 31 DECEMBER 2014 Awards in 2012 were made under the New LTIP, consisting of The Unite Group plc Performance Share Plan and The Unite Group plc Approved Employee Share Option Scheme.
Vesting of the awards was dependent on three equally-weighted measures over a three-year performance period: NAV per share growth, Net Portfolio Contribution NPC and TSR outperformance of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Super Sector Index.
There was no retest provision.
Further details, including vesting schedules and performance against each of the metrics is provided in the table below: Measure Weighting Targets Outcome Vest % Net Asset Value NAV 1 3 0% vesting below 6% pa 379 pence 434 pence 85.66% per share 25% vesting for 6% pa 379 pence 100% vesting for 12% pa 447 pence or more Straight-line vesting between these points 1 Net Portfolio Contribution 1 3 0% vesting below 23.5m 35.3m 100% NPC in 2014 25% vesting for 23.5m 100% vesting for 31.5m or more Straight-line vesting between these points TSR outperformance of the 1 3 0% vesting if Group underperforms the Index Index 100% FTSE 350 Real Estate Super 25% vesting for matching the Index 14.9% pa 172% Sector Index 100% vesting for outperforming Index by 9% pa return Straight-line vesting between these points Total LTIP vesting sum product of weighting and vest % 95.22% 1 After adjustment for placing, see details below.

No adjustments were made to NAV per share which is already neutral to the capital raise, or to TSR which is not directly impacted by the placing.
In line with regulations, the value disclosed above and in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 73 captures the full number of interests vesting ie excluding the one-year holding period.
As the market price on the date of vesting is unknown at the time of reporting, the value is estimated using the average market value over the last quarter of 2014 of 438.0 pence.
The actual value at vesting will be trued-up in the 2015 Annual Report on Remuneration.

As foreshadowed in the 2013 Directors Remuneration Report, following feedback from shareholders the Committee made a small number of evolutionary changes to the performance measures governing vesting of the LTIP awards.
Consequently, vesting of 2014 awards is dependent on three equally-weighted measures over a three-year performance period: TR per share previously NAV, EPS previously NPC and TSR outperformance of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Supersector Index.
There is no retest provision.
The Committee considers that the targets applying under each of the performance measures are no less stretching than in previous years.
Details of the vesting schedules are provided below: Measure Weighting Targets 2016 Adjusted EPS 1 3 0% vesting below 18.1 pence 25% vesting for 18.1 pence 100% vesting for 23.5 pence or more Straight-line vesting between these points TR per share pa 1 3 0% vesting below 8.5% pa 2014 2016 25% vesting for 8.5% pa 100% vesting for 14.5% pa or more Straight-line vesting between these points TSR outperformance of the 1 3 0% vesting if Group underperforms the Index FTSE 350 Real Estate Super Sector 25% vesting for matching the Index Index 2014 2016 100% vesting for outperforming Index by 9% pa Straight-line vesting between these points EXIT PAYMENTS MADE IN THE YEAR AUDITED No exit payments were made in the year.
PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS AUDITED Details of awards vesting to John Tonkiss under the 2011 LTIP were included in the 2013 Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 77 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2015 Base salary Market positioning of base salary is approached on an individual basis, taking account of advice received from the Committees independent advisers on the rates of salary for similar roles in selected groups of comparable companies and the individual performance and experience of each Executive.
The aim is for base salary to be set with reference to the market median, dependent on the Committees view of individual and Group performance.
The Committee approved the following base salary increases with effect from 1 March 2015: Base salary from 1 March 2014 Base salary from 1 March 2015 Executive Director to 28 February 2015 to 28 February 2016 Percentage increase M C Allan 423,400 434,000 2.5% J J Lister 267,900 274,600 2.5% R C Simpson 241,650 247,700 2.5% R S Smith 241,650 247,700 2.5% A salary increase averaging 2.5% across the Group was awarded at the annual pay review.
Pension Executive Directors will continue to receive a pension contribution of 20% of salary or an equivalent cash allowance.
Performance Related Annual Bonus The Performance Related Annual Bonus for the 2015 financial year will operate on broadly the same basis as in 2014.
The Committee has approved a maximum bonus opportunity for each Executive of 144% of salary, consisting of a maximum of 120% of salary under the corporate element and a maximum individual multiplier of 1.2x.
Financial 75% Adjusted EPS 25.0% TR per share 25.0% Net debt to EBITDA ratio 25.0% Non-financial 25% Customer satisfaction 25.0% For 2015, the corporate element of the annual bonus will continue to be based on a combination of financial and non-financial measures, weighted 75% and 25% respectively.
The Committee intends to replace the existing operating cash flow and LTV targets with a single measure of Net debt to EBITDA ratio, weighted 25%.
This change will help to further simplify the scheme and provide robustness against sector cyclicality going-forward, whilst still promoting strong cash flow generation and sustainable leverage.
Proposed target levels have been set to be challenging relative to the 2015 business plan, although specific targets are deemed to be commercially sensitive at this time.
It is the Committees current intention to disclose these targets retrospectively in the 2015 Directors Remuneration Report.
LTIP For 2015 the LTIP will continue to operate on the same basis as in the 2014 financial year.
Executive Directors will each receive an award equivalent to 150% of salary delivered through a combination of the PSP and ESOS, with the final level of vesting dependent on the achievement of three-year performance targets relating to EPS, TR and TSR, as follows: Measure Weighting Targets 2017 Adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS 1 3 0% vesting below 23.7 pence 25% vesting for 23.7 pence 100% vesting for 31.5 pence or more Straight-line vesting between these points TR per share pa 2015 2017 1 3 0% vesting below 9% pa 25% vesting for 9% pa 100% vesting for 15% pa or more Straight-line vesting between these points TSR outperformance of the FTSE350 Real Estate 1 3 0% vesting if Group underperforms the Index Supersector Index 2015 2017 25% vesting for matching the Index 100% vesting for outperforming Index by 9% pa Straight-line vesting between these points Any awards vesting will be released two-thirds after three years with the remaining one-third deferred for an additional year.
Further details of the grant date and number of interests awarded will be disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report on Remuneration.
78 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information IMPLEMENTATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2015 Chairman and Non-Executive Director Fees During the final quarter of 2014, the Board undertook its annual review of Non-Executive Director fees.
Following consideration of salary increases across the Group and indicative fee increases at sector and FTSE comparators, the Board determined that the basic fee should be increased from 43,000 pa to 44,100 pa and that additional fees should be increased by a similar rate.
The Committee, in considering similar factors, determined that the fee payable to the Chairman of the Board should be increased from 124,000 pa to 127,100 pa Each of these fee increases are at 2.5% in line with increases for employees across the Group.
