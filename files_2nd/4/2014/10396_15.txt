Mitie Group plc 50 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Directors remuneration report Statement from the Remuneration Committee Chairman Introduction On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2014, which has been prepared in line with the new reporting requirements which came into effect in October 2013.
This report sets out the remuneration policy which shapes our Directors pay and how that policy was applied during 2014.
This is also the first report I have prepared in my capacity as new Committee Chairman, a role I assumed on 1 November 2013, replacing Terry Morgan.
The other change in Committee composition during the year was the appointment of Jack Boyer who replaced Graeme Potts.
Both Terry and Graemes contributions to the Committees activities have been greatly appreciated.
Company performance As set out in the Chairmans and Chief Executives overviews, Mitie has had a strong year, delivering organic growth in headline revenues and profits.
Key highlights include: Headline revenue growth of 8.2%, of which 5.2% was organic statutory revenue growth of 4.7% : Headline operating profit growth of 6.0% statutory profit growth of 21.5% : Headline basic EPS growth of 5.2% statutory basic EPS growth of 13.6% : and Dividend per share growth of 6.8%.
Key decisions It has been in this positive context that the Committee has approached the key decisions it has taken in connection with the remuneration of our Executive Directors.
With regard to fixed pay, it has been agreed that the base salaries, which were not increased last year for the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, should be increased by 4.5% from 1 April 2014.
No increase was granted to Bill Robson.
The reason for this is that he has indicated his intent to step down from the Mitie Group plc Board on 31 July 2014.
Bill has served as a member of the Board since August 2001 and intends to stay within the group as Managing Director of our Property management division, focusing on the many new opportunities that are developing within the housing sector.
Performance-related pay continues to play an important role in our remuneration policy.
In assessing achievement against the years financial target and strategic objectives, the resulting bonus pay-outs as a percentage of base salary were 144.1% for the Chief Executive and 122.9% for the other two Executive Directors, with any bonus paid above 100% of base salary deferred in shares for a two year period.
As mentioned above, this reflects a year of strong performance at Mitie.
With regard to long-term incentives, the following decisions were taken by the Committee: Treatment of the 2010 LTIP awards LTIP awards granted in 2010 were based solely on real EPS growth targets.
Based on performance against these targets, the Committee determined on 29 June 2013 that 57.2% of the award vested, with the balance lapsing.
Treatment of 2011 LTIP awards LTIP awards granted in 2011 were based on solely absolute EPS growth for the three years ending 31 March 2014.
EPS growth was below the threshold of 7% and therefore the award will lapse in full.
2013 LTIP awards Following consultation with major shareholders, it was agreed that the previous approach of using solely EPS-based performance conditions for awards should be changed for the 2013 LTIP award.
Instead, this award will vest based upon a combination of three year absolute EPS growth, relative TSR, cash conversion and organic revenue growth targets.
In addition, it was also agreed, following this shareholder consultation, that the Chief Executive be granted an award over shares worth 250% of salary ie higher than the default award of 200% of salary but within the LTIP plan individual participation limit which allows for awards to be made over shares worth up to 250% of salary in exceptional circumstances to ensure her continued incentivisation and further strengthen her alignment with shareholders.
Strategic Report Governance Financial 51 Remuneration policy for 2014 15 The remuneration policy for which we are seeking shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM, and which will apply from that date, is set out on pages 53 - 56.
This policy broadly reflects the approach adopted by Mitie last year and, therefore, no substantial policy changes have been suggested for the following year.
However, one of my first objectives as the new Chair is to conduct a review of this remuneration policy during the course of 2014, with the assistance of our newly appointed advisers, FIT Remuneration Consultants.
The primary aim of this policy review will be to ensure that the Executive Directors remuneration is clearly and demonstrably aligned to the groups evolving strategy, ensuring that the interests of the Executive Directors are fully aligned with our shareholders.
If, as anticipated, the output of this review is that revisions to the existing policy are proposed, shareholder approval will again be sought for these changes at next years AGM.
As we continue to welcome ongoing discussions with investors on remuneration matters, the Committee will consult with major shareholders in advance of the 2015 AGM should it be intended that a revised policy be put to a formal vote at that meeting.

Those sections of the report which have been subject to audit are clearly indicated.
The Companys remuneration policy The key principles of the policy The remuneration policy of the Company promotes and embeds the Companys remuneration principles.
The key principles of this policy are: Performance-related At the Executive Director and senior management levels, the majority of reward opportunity is provided through performance-related incentives linked to the Companys strategic goals and taking account of the Companys attitude to risk.
Reward under these incentives is linked to both individual and group performance.
The performance-related incentive arrangements are designed to align the interests of the Shareholder aligned executives with those of shareholders.
The overall remuneration policy is comprehensive without becoming overcomplicated and Comprehensive and simple encourages executives to concentrate on profitable growth.
Strategic Report Governance Financial 53 The policy itself The Committee currently reflects these key principles in each of the main elements of the reward packages for the Executive Directors as set out in the table below.
This policy, if approved by shareholders, will take effect from the date of the forthcoming AGM.
However, as mentioned above, the Committee intends to conduct a review of the Companys senior executive pay policy in the forthcoming year.
Based on the outcome of the review, it is anticipated that Mitie will be putting forward a revised policy for the binding vote next year.

What discretions are retained in operating the incentive plans under our policy?
The Committee will operate the Annual Bonus Plan and LTIP according to their respective rules and the above policy table.
The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market practice, in a number of respects, in relation to the operation and administration of these plans.
These discretions include, but are not limited to, the following: the selection of participants: the timing of grant of an award bonus opportunity: the size of an award bonus opportunity subject to the maximum limits set out in the policy table: the determination of performance against targets and resultant vesting bonus pay-outs: discretion required when dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the group: determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the plan and the appropriate treatment chosen: adjustments required in certain circumstances eg rights issues, corporate restructuring events and special dividends : and the annual review of performance measures, weightings and targets from year to year.
In relation to both the LTIP and Annual Bonus Plan, the Committee retains the ability to adjust the targets and or set different measures if events occur eg material acquisition and or divestment of a group business which cause it to determine that the conditions are no longer appropriate and the amendment is required so that the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Directors remuneration report and may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Companys major shareholders.
Strategic Report Governance Financial 57 In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the relevant report going forward as required by the new Regulations.
How our policy actually influences levels of pay Under our policy, a significant proportion of remuneration is linked to performance.
The charts below show how much the Executive Directors could earn under Mities remuneration policy as detailed above under different performance scenarios.
The following assumptions have been made: Minimum performance below threshold Fixed pay only with no pay-out vesting under any of Mities incentive plans.
On-target Fixed pay plus an on-target bonus and vesting of 25% of LTIP awards.
Maximum performance above target Fixed pay plus maximum bonus and maximum LTIP awards.
Fixed pay comprises of: Salaries effective as of 1 April 2014.
Benefits amount received by each Executive Director in 2014, excluding the value of any matching SIP shares.
Pension amount received by each Executive Director in 2014.
The table below does not take account of the decision taken by Bill Robson to step down from the Mitie Group plc Board on 31 July 2014, referred to in the Chairmans Statement.
The scenarios do not include share price growth or dividend assumptions.

Under the service contracts, the Company is required to give 12 months notice of termination of employment: Executive Directors are required to give six months notice.
For Executive Directors, if notice is served by either party, the Executive Director can continue to receive basic salary, benefits and pension for the duration of their notice period during which time the Company may require the individual to continue to fulfil their current duties or may assign a period of garden leave.
With respect to the current Group Finance Directors contract, the Company has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice equivalent in value of up to 12 months salary payable in either monthly instalments or as a lump sum.
The Company will also pay for any benefit which the individual would have been eligible for until the date of cessation had full notice been given.
The Executive Directors service contracts are available for inspection at Mities registered office, the head office and at the AGM.
There are no other provisions for compensation on termination of employment set out within the contracts of the Executive Directors.
As reported in the Chairmans Statement, Bill Robson will be stepping down from the Mitie Group plc Board on 31 July 2014 and will be staying within the group as Managing Director of our Property management division.
For future Directors, notice periods will not exceed 12 months.
Mitie Group plc 58 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Directors remuneration report The effective dates of the service contracts of the Executive Directors are set out below: Date of agreement Ruby McGregor-Smith 01-Apr-03 Suzanne Baxter 10-Apr-06 Bill Robson 01-Apr-03 Our policy on loss of office The rules of the Annual Bonus Plan and LTIP set out what happens to awards if a participant ceases to be an employee or Director of Mitie before the end of a vesting period.
Regarding the annual bonus, in the event that the participant ceases to be an eligible employee before the date the bonus is paid or is subject to notice of termination of their employment on the bonus date, they shall forfeit all entitlement to the Bonus in respect of that financial year, unless the Committee in its absolute discretion determines otherwise.
The deferred shares will vest in full on the date of cessation for good leaver reasons: otherwise the shares will lapse on cessation.
Generally, any outstanding LTIP awards will lapse on cessation of employment, except in certain circumstances.
Specifically, if the Executive ceases to be an employee or Director as a result of death, injury, disability or ill-health, redundancy, retirement, the sale of the business or company that employs the individual or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee, then they will be treated as a good leaver under the LTIP rules, in which case awards will vest either on cessation or the normal vesting dates subject to the performance conditions and, if the Committee determines, a pro rata reduction.
A good leaver has 12 months to exercise their vested awards structured as options following the cessation of employment.
In addition, and consistent with market practice, in the event of termination of an Executive Directors employment, the Company may pay a contribution towards the individuals legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement.
Any such fees would be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements.
Should it become necessary to make additional payments in respect of such professional fees that were not ascertained at the time of reporting, the Company may do so up to a level of a further 10,000.
For the avoidance of doubt, the policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.
Our policy on external appointments The Board recognises that the appointment of Executive Directors to Non-Executive positions at other companies can be beneficial both for the individual Director and the group through the broadening of their experience and knowledge.
Ruby McGregor-Smith received fees of 53,515 per annum in respect of her role as a Non-Executive Director of Michael Page International plc and 15,000 for her role as Non-Executive Director of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.
Suzanne Baxter received fees of 47,499 for her role as a Non-Executive Director of WH Smith plc.
Both individuals are entitled to retain any fees earned.
Our policy on the recruitment of a new director In cases of a new hire, the Committee will typically align the Executive Directors remuneration package to the above Remuneration policy.
However, where appropriate, the Committee retains discretion to make decisions outside of policy to facilitate hiring key talent as set out below.
Base salaries will be set based on the individuals role and experience, with consideration given to internal equity.
Benefits will be provided in line with those offered to other employees at the similar level, with relocation expenses arrangements provided if necessary.
In the case of new Executive Directors, individuals will be given a choice of either participation in a defined contribution pension or a cash allowance in lieu of pension.
The maximum level of variable pay that may be offered on an ongoing basis and the structure of remuneration will be in accordance with the approved policy detailed above ie, at an aggregate maximum of 410% of salary 160% annual bonus and up to 250% for LTIP.
This limit does not include the value of buy-out arrangements.
The above policy applies to both internal promotions to the Board or an external hire.
For external hires, if it is necessary to buy-out existing incentive pay or benefit arrangements which would be forfeited on leaving their previous company, this would be provided taking into consideration relevant factors such as the commercial value of the amount forfeited from the previous employer, the performance conditions eg the likelihood of achieving those and timing eg where the award is in the vesting cycle.
Buy-out awards, if used, will be granted using Mities existing share plans, although, if necessary, buy-out awards may be made on more bespoke terms regarding matters such as vesting and performance conditions as permitted under the Listing Rules ie provision 9.4.
The Committee has placed a maximum limit on any such buy-out awards which it may be necessary to make: these will not exceed the commercial value of the amount forfeited from the previous employer.
In the case of an internal promotion to the Board, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the individuals previous role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms of grant.
On appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, their fees will be set taking into account the existing fee structure.
Strategic Report Governance Financial 59 Our policy on Non-Executive Director remuneration and appointment terms The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive an annual fee which is paid in monthly instalments.
The Chairmans fee is set by the Remuneration Committee and the fees for the Non-Executive Directors are approved by the Board, on the recommendation of the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee with an additional fee for chairing a Committee, together with expenses incurred in carrying out their duties on behalf of the Company.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys share schemes or the Annual Bonus Plan, nor do they receive pension or ancillary benefits.
The terms of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at Mities registered office, the head office and at the AGM.
The Non-Executive Directors are engaged for an initial term of three years which is terminable on either three or six months notice and thereafter on a rolling term.
They are also subject to annual re-election.

2 Terry Morgan retired as a Non-Executive Director on 31 October 2013.
3 Crawford Gillies was appointed as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 1 November 2013.
How does the executive pay policy differ from that of other Mitie employees?
The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees, ensuring that the greater part of their pay is conditional on the successful delivery of business strategy.
This helps create a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration received by the Directors.
The LTIP is limited to the most senior employees approximately 100 in total.
For employees below this level, variable pay may consist of share options and annual bonus both of which will be based on role and the opportunity to participate in SAYE and SIP.
How we take account of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company when setting our policy The Remuneration Committee is responsible for overseeing the remuneration policy for the group as a whole and is mindful of pay and employment conditions in the wider workforce within the group and externally when determining Executive remuneration.
When considering base salary increases, benefits and pension provision, the Committee reviews overall levels and increases offered to employees across the group.
The Committee also reviews information with regard to share awards made to other senior management of the group, noting that i all employees can participate in the SAYE and SIP, and ii participation in the LTIP is limited to a selection of senior executives.
However, consistent with general practice, the Committee does not consult with employees in preparing the policy or its implementation.
How we take account of shareholder views when setting our policy The Committee is committed to a continuing discussion with major shareholders and obtains their views when any significant changes to remuneration arrangements are being proposed.
A recent example of this was the consultation with major shareholders undertaken in relation to changing the performance measures for the 2013 LTIP award.
A similar consultation exercise will be undertaken following the culmination of the forthcoming review of the Companys pay policy.
Mitie Group plc 60 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Directors remuneration report Annual report on remuneration Executive Director remuneration subject to audit The table below reports a single figure for total remuneration for each Executive Director for the financial years ending 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2014.
Value of matching shares during the year under the Company Share Incentive Plan is also included as is the option gain under the 2012 SAYE grant.
Bonus payable in respect of the financial year includes any deferred element at face value at the date of award.
Further information about how the level of the 2014 award was determined is provided on pages 61 and 62.
The value of the 2014 LTIP is based on the 2011 LTIP award, which will lapse in full.
The value of the 2013 LTIP is based on the value of the shares that vested in respect of the 2010 LTIP award on the vesting date and includes the value of the dividend equivalent.
The pension benefits of the Directors comprise a pension supplement paid in cash in the year of 20% of salary and a capped cash contribution to a defined benefit pension scheme of 15,576 2013: 15,114 made by Mitie for each of the Directors.
The disclosures above in respect of pension benefits comprise the 20% pension supplement along with an actuarially derived value of the annually accrued pension benefits under the defined benefit pension scheme, net of personal contributions made by each Director.
This calculation is known as the net pension input amount and is affected by the number of years of scheme membership, the value of annual accrued benefits at each year end, inflation and a prescribed multiplication factor of 20.

Strategic Report Governance Financial 61 What happened in 2014 and changes for 2015 Base salary and benefits For 2014, the Remuneration Committee did not award pay increases for the Executive Directors.
For the Chief Executive, the Remuneration Committee considered an increase given her current pay positioning versus the market: however, the Chief Executive requested that the increase be waived.
For 2015, the Committee awarded average salary increases of 4.5% for two of the Executive Directors, resulting in the following base salaries being payable: Ruby McGregor-Smith 550,000 Suzanne Baxter 350,000 Bill Robson received no increase and his salary remains 330,000.
A review of Non-Executive Director fees was undertaken in March 2014.
The fees are reviewed every three years with the exception of the Chairmans fee, which had not been reviewed for the past six years.
As a result of that review, the fees for 2015 are as follows: Base salary fees 000 1 2015 2014 2 Chairman fees 185 140 3 Non-Executive Director core fees 52 46 Additional fees Senior Independent Director 7 Chairman of a Committee 8 7 Notes: 1 The core fee of 52,000 paid to each Non-Executive Director including the Chairman will total 260,000 for 2015 230,000 in 2014.
Total fees, including additional duties are expected to amount to 416,000 for 2015 338,000 in 2014.
2 The Chairmans fee is inclusive of the Non-Executive Directors core fee and no additional fees are paid to the Chairman where he is a Chairman, or is a member of, other committees.
3 For Non-Executive Directors, individual fees comprise the core fee and adding supplemental fees for chairing committees where a greater responsibility and time commitment is required.
Benefits are as described in the Remuneration policy table.
No changes are planned for 2015, aside from a modest increase made to the car allowance which was last reviewed in 2004 to retain market competitiveness.
Pension subject to audit Pension is as described in the Remuneration policy table.
The pension entitlement for each Director is as follows: Defined benefit pension scheme transfer values Transfer value of pension Contributions Increase in increase after Transfer values made by the accrued pension inflation, net of Transfer value Normal retirement 31 March 2013 Director over the year contributions 31 March 2014 date 000 000 000 000 000 Ruby McGregor-Smith 22 02 2028 207 0 3 24 238 Suzanne Baxter 16 04 2033 17 0 4 17 34 Bill Robson 11 08 2015 847 0 2 48 913 The pension benefits of the Executive Directors are based on a pensionable salary capped at 141,600.
The Company made contributions to the groups defined benefit scheme on behalf of the three Directors who are members of the scheme at a rate of 11% of the value of the benefit cap.
In addition, the Directors received a salary supplement as described in the policy table.
The normal retirement age for the three Directors is 65 and there are no additional benefits available to the Directors upon early retirement.

Annual Bonus Plan Awards in respect of 2014 were made under the group Annual Bonus Plan.
The outcomes were as follows: Evaluation of performance At the beginning of the year the Committee set a range for EBITA performance from threshold, target through to maximum.
Performance was slightly better than the target level of EBITA for bonus purposes, and this equated to performance 55% between threshold and maximum, thereby resulting in a pay-out of 101.6% of salary for this element.
Mitie Group plc 62 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Directors remuneration report At the beginning of the year, the Committee set objectives relating to organic growth, people management and strategy.
Key deliverables for the year included: Upper quartile performance on organic revenue growth versus comparator group.
Growth of our Healthcare offering through the completion of a strategic acquisition.
Good progress in our care and custody offering with substantial wins.
Launch of an integrated energy consulting business.
Key strategic hires made to strengthen the leadership pipeline across the business.
Having evaluated a range of outcomes and indicators of performance, the Committee determined that overall progress was excellent and warranted a pay-out of 85% of maximum, resulting in a pay-out of 42.5% of salary for the Chief Executive and 21.3% of salary for the other Executive Directors.
Therefore, based on the Committees assessment of achievement for both the financial and strategic objectives, the bonus was calculated as follows: Financial Performance Strategic Performance Total Bonus Payable % of salary % of salary % of salary % of salary payable at payable at % of salary payable at payable at % of salary Total Deferred threshold maximum payable threshold maximum payable bonus Cash shares Ruby McGregor-Smith 0 50 42.5 758.0 526.0 232.0 Suzanne Baxter 90 110 101.6 0 25 21.3 411.6 335.0 76.6 Bill Robson 0 25 21.3 405.4 330.0 75.4 While the actual financial and strategic target ranges have not been disclosed in this report due to commercial sensitivity, it is intended that the EBITA targets will be disclosed in next years Remuneration Report although not the strategic targets as they will remain commercially sensitive.
For 2015, no changes are proposed to be made to the bonus scheme.
The EBITA and strategic targets used are not disclosed at this time as they are considered commercially sensitive.
However, similar levels of disclosure as set out above will be made in future reports.
Details of LTIP vesting in June 2014 2011 award The Committee assessed the outcome of the 2011 LTIP awards against the performance condition of EPS growth % per annum.
The number of shares capable of vesting was determined based on the following scale: EPS% growth % of award vesting 13% or more 100% Between 7% and 13% On a straight-line basis between 25% and 100% 7% 25% Less than 7% 0% For the performance period, EPS growth was below the threshold of 7% and the award will therefore lapse in full.
Strategic Report Governance Financial 63 LTIP awards granted in year Following consultation with major shareholders, different performance conditions were applied to awards made in 2014 compared to awards made in earlier years, in order to provide improved alignment with the strategic drivers of our business.
Awards granted in 2014 will vest depending on performance against four weighted measures, measured over three years: Vesting of portion of the award Performance measure Weighting Performance range performance period ending 31 March 2016 Absolute Earnings Per Share 20% of the 3% 8% pa Zero vesting if EPS growth is less than 3% pa.
If performance is EPS growth award equal to 3%, 25% of the award will vest.
If Mitie achieves 8% EPS growth pa, all the awards will vest.
Between these two points, the proportion of awards vesting will be determined on a linear sliding scale basis.
Relative Total Shareholder 20% of the Outperformance against Zero vesting if Mitie Groups TSR performance is less than the award FTSE 350 Support median of the index.
If Mitie's TSR performance is equal to the Return TSR Services index median of the index, 25% of an award will vest.
If the Companys TSR exceeds the index TSR by 10% pa or more, all the awards will vest.

When arriving at this position the Board was assisted by a number of processes including the following: the Annual Report and Accounts is drafted by senior management with overall co-ordination by the Head of Group Finance to ensure consistency across the relevant sections: an internal verification process is undertaken to ensure factual accuracy: an independent review is undertaken by the Assurance team to assess whether the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable using a set of pre-defined indicators such as consistency with internally reported information, investor communications and relative performance in the industry : comprehensive reviews of drafts of the Annual Report and Accounts are undertaken by the Executive Directors and other senior management: an advanced draft is reviewed by the Companys Group Counsel and external legal advisers: and the final draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee prior to consideration by the Board.
Employees Employee involvement The Board remains committed to fostering and developing a culture of employee involvement in the business through communication with employees and equity involvement whereby employees are enabled to build a stake in the Company through the Companys various equity-based incentive schemes.
The Board believes that the groups culture of employee equity involvement is a significant driver in the groups growth performance and that this assists in attracting and retaining skilled and committed employees.
During the year, the group has continued to operate the Mitie Long Term Incentive Plan to incentivise and reward senior members of the Mitie management team, the Executive Share Option Scheme for certain other employees and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme and Share Incentive Plan which are open to all eligible employees of the group.
The group has historically grown by giving entrepreneurial managers the opportunity to create wealth by participating in the investment risk of starting a new business, taking equity stakes at fair value in those new businesses in conjunction with Mitie and then, dependent on a pre-agreed pricing structure, offering to sell but cannot require Mitie to buy that stake to Mitie predominantly in exchange for Company shares.
Under the terms of certain shareholders agreements and Articles of Association relating to Mitie Model companies, minority shareholders in such companies may provide an option for the purchase by the Company of their minority shares.
The mechanism for calculating the price to be paid in respect of such transfer is transparent, on an arms-length basis, and in accordance with the pricing structure generally applicable for other transfers under the Mitie Model.
In consideration for these purchases, the Company generally has the option to settle payment in cash or in Company shares.
In 2011, the group launched a 10m Entrepreneurial Fund to back management teams with innovative ideas for starting mutually owned businesses.
The Board remains committed to supporting growing businesses through the Entrepreneurial Fund which builds on a long history of partnering with management teams to start up new business ventures.

Details of these structures are generally available to the extent incorporated into the Articles of Association for individual Mitie Model companies from Companies House at www.
Communication with employees Communication with Mities employees remains a high priority, and has been the focus of a comprehensive review of employee engagement undertaken in the past year.
The group communicates with employees via multiple channels, including group-wide mailings, employee magazines and updates, employee-focused initiatives and events including group business roadshows, media networks and the provision of access to broadcasts of periodic financial presentations.
We are also committed to developing our use of social media tools as an effective way of communicating with our people because we recognise that these methods can provide great ways of allowing our people to give us feedback, share ideas and engage with the wider Mitie community.
Our social media tools are supported by a group-wide intranet system which has improved communication and information sharing across the business and includes blog updates from Executive Board members and functional teams.
Through this system employees are able to access key information such as online payslips, platforms such as eLearning, and key strategic messages as well as group news.
Each of the groups businesses is encouraged to ensure that employees are kept informed of group and individual business developments through the use of their own communication processes, and social networking sites continue to play an important part in engaging and communicating with employees.
Our group-wide Mitie Stars programme continues to grow year on year, and recognises and rewards exceptional performance displayed by Mitie people.
Mities Got Talent, the group-wide talent contest, continues to be supported and encourages employee engagement and recognition.
The group Sustainability report contains further details of these initiatives and is available from www.
Mities employees remain actively involved in the groups activities via an employee forum.
This year the forum held two meetings and included presentations by senior management or functional heads as requested by the employee representatives.
The Executive Board will continue to seek increasing involvement and activity of the employee representatives.
Our Speak Up service the whistleblowing programme continued to operate during the year, providing every employee with the ability to confidentially report any concerns or wrong-doings that they were aware of, if they felt unable to report these via our existing line management or human resources channels.
All Speak Up contacts are independently investigated.
The Audit Committee and Board receive regular reports on the status of material Speak Up investigations.
Employee diversity and inclusion The Board remains committed to developing a culture that encourages the inclusion and diversity of all of the groups employees through respecting and appreciating their differences and promoting the continuous development of employees through skills enhancement and training programmes.
The groups employment policies are designed to recruit, motivate, retain, train and develop the very best people, recognising that this can be achieved only through offering equal opportunities regardless of gender, race, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation or any other aspect of diversity.
Applications from disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned.

These support the Directors belief that the group is well-placed to manage its business risks successfully.

The Board reviews the groups sources of available funds and the level of headroom available against its committed borrowing facilities.
The groups financial forecasts, taking into account possible sensitivities in trading performance, indicate that the group will be able to operate within the level of its committed borrowing facilities.
The groups committed borrowing facilities comprise 251.7m of US Private Placement Loan Notes expiring in December 2017, December 2019, December 2022 and December 2024 and its committed banking facility of 250m which is available for use until September 2015.
