As stated above in the committee Chairmans letter to shareholders, the committee believes it is in the interests of shareholders that targets should be disclosed retrospectively, and at the earliest time when considerations of commercial sensitivity make it prudent to do so.

All employee share plans EDs are eligible to participate in two HMRC approved all employee share plans on the same basis as other eligible employees.
These plans include a partnership share element of the All Employee Share Option Plan AESOP under which eligible employees can invest up to the statutory limits, currently 150 per month, out of their gross salary in the Companys ordinary shares.
The Company matches every purchased share with two matching shares for the first 40 of a participants monthly contribution.
Matching shares are subject to forfeiture if the purchased shares are withdrawn from the AESOP within three years of purchase, as long as the participant remains employed by the Company.
Participants are eligible to receive dividend shares through the AESOP.
The Aviva 2007 SAYE Scheme allows eligible employees to acquire options over the Companys shares at a discount of up to 20% of their market value at the date of grant.
In order to exercise these options, participants must have saved through a 3, 5 or 7 year HMRC approved savings contract.
Savings are subject to a statutory savings limit, which in 2014 increased from 250 to 500 per month although the allowed increase has not so far been applied but will continue to be reviewed in line with the market.
From 2012, only 3 and 5 year contracts have been offered.
Details of options granted to EDs under these schemes are included in table 22.
