The Chairmans notice period is six months whilst the other non-executive directors have anotice period of one month.
Section 2 Approach to recruitment remuneration The Committee will apply the core principles on page 80 and the remuneration components set out in the table on pages 81 to 83 determine the remuneration of newly appointed directors.
Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the experience of the director being appointed.
Where this is below the market level, it will be adjusted over time to align with the market level, subject to good performance.
In relation to directors appointed from outside the Company, where the Committee considers it to be necessary to secure the appointment of the director, the Committee may:, pay sign-on compensation for loss of benefits on resignation from a previous employer, such as loss of long-term share incentives subject to the right to phase any payment to reflect performance, the requirement to mitigate loss and the right of the Company to clawback any amount which is subsequently paid to the executive by the former employer, and to clawback an appropriate proportion of the payment if the executive leaves soon after appointment : and, make appropriate payments in circumstances where a director is relocated from outside the UK.
Section 3 Service agreements Executive directors service agreements are of indefinite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months prior notice.
Under each of the executive directors service agreements the Company has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice of termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued to the executive director during the contractual notice period.
85 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Section 4 Remuneration scenarios The composition and value of the executive directors remuneration packages at below threshold, target and outperformance scenarios under the Drax Group remuneration policy are set out in the charts below: Salary, benets and pension Bonus BMP m Salary, benets and pension Bonus BMP % Chief Executive 0.5m 1.0m 1.5m 2.0m 2.5m 3.0m Chief Executive 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Outperformance Outperformance Target Target Below threshold Below threshold Finance Director Finance Director Outperformance Outperformance Target Target Below threshold Below threshold Production Director Production Director Outperformance Outperformance Target Target Below threshold Below threshold Retail and Trading Director Retail and Trading Director Outperformance Outperformance Target Target Below threshold Below threshold Notes: 1 Annual bonus threshold is assumed at 25% of maximum, target at 50% of maximum and outperformance at 100% of maximum bonus.
2 The BMP award threshold is assumed at 15% of maximum award and outperformance 100% of maximum, with target representing the average of the two.
3 The award of conditional shares under the BMP is based on the individuals prior year annual bonus and therefore it is assumed that corresponding threshold, target and maximum bonus is earned for calculating threshold, target and maximum BMP award under each scenario.
Section 5 Policy on loss of office If an executive directors employment is brought to an end by either party and if it is necessary to determine a termination payment, the Committees policy, in the absence of a breach of the service agreement by the director, is to determine a directors termination payment in accordance with his her service agreement.
The termination payment will be calculated based on the value of base salary and contractual benefits that would have accrued to the director during the contractual notice period.
The Committee will seek mitigation to reduce the amount of any termination payment to a leaving director when appropriate to do so, having regard to the circumstances and the law governing the agreement.
It may, for example, be appropriate to consider mitigation if the director has secured another job at a similar level.
Mitigation would not be applicable to a contractual payment in lieu of notice.
In addition, the director may be entitled to a payment in respect of his her statutory rights.
No service agreement includes any provision for the payment of compensation upon termination.
Any compensation payable in those circumstances would need tobe determined at the time and in the light of the circumstances.
All bonus payments are discretionary benefits.
The Committee will consider whether a departing director should receive an annual bonus in respect of the financial year in which, and or immediately preceding which, the termination occurs, prorated to reflect the period of the performance year completed at the date of termination.
The Committee will take into account performance: co-operation with succession: and any breach of goodwill and adherence to contractual obligations restrictions.
If the termination is by the Company on less than the specified notice in the directors service agreement, the Committee will also consider whether the director should receive an annual bonus in respect of any period of the financial year following termination for which the director has been deprived of the opportunity to earn annual bonus.
If the employment ends in any of the following circumstances, the director will be treated as a good leaver and the director will be eligible for a bonus payment:, redundancy:, retirement:, ill-health or disability proved to the satisfaction of the Company: and, death.
Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview 86 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Remuneration Committee report continued If the termination is for any other reason a bonus payment will be at the discretion of the Committee.
It is the Committees policy to ensure that any such bonus payment properly reflects the departing directors performance and behaviour towards the Company.
Therefore the amount of any such payment will be determined as described in the table on page 81, taking into account i the directors personal performance and behaviour towards the Company and ii the Group performance.
If a bonus payment is made, it will normally be paid as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Group performance element has been determined for the relevant period.
There may be circumstances in which the Committee considers it appropriate for the bonus payment to be made earlier, for example, on termination due to ill-health, in which case, on-target Group performance score shall be assumed.
No element of any such bonus payment shall be deferred.
The Committee will consider the extent to which deferred and conditional share awards held by the director under the BMP should lapse or vest.
Any determination by the Committee will be in accordance with the rules of the BMP as approved by shareholders.
In summary, the rules of the BMP provide that awards will vest pro-rated to the date of employment termination ifemployment ends for any of the following reasons:, redundancy:, retirement:, ill-health or disability proved to the satisfaction of the Company:, change of ownership: and, death.
If employment ends for any other reason, the rules of the BMP require the Committee to exercise its discretion.
In doing so it will take account of all relevant circumstances, in particular the performance of the Company: the directors performance and behaviour towards the Company during the performance cycle of the relevant awards: as well as a range of other relevant factors, including the proximity of the award to its maturity date.
The rules of the BMP also provide that in circumstances where awards vest, deferred bonus shares vest as soon as reasonably practicable following termination.
Awards, which vest subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions, will be time prorated and will be phased over the performance cycle of the relevant awards.
The Committee will consider whether the overall value of any benefits accruing to a leaving director is fair and appropriate taking account of all relevant circumstances.
Examples of circumstances in which the Committee may be minded to award an annual bonus payment and or permit the vesting of BMP awards include:, the directors continued good performance up to and following the giving of notice: and, the director accommodating the Company in the timing of his her departure and handover arrangements.
Conversely, the Committee may be minded not to allow such payments if the reason for the departure is:, poor performance: or, the director does not continue to perform effectively following notice: or, the director is departing to join a competitor.
Section 6 Context Wider employee population In determining executive remuneration, the Committee also takes into account the level of general pay increases within the Group.
It is the Committees policy that annual salary increases for executive directors should not exceed the average annual salary increase for the wider employee population unless there is a particular reason for a higher increase, such as a change in the nature or scope of responsibilities.
Views taken from the employee population In the course of discussions on pay with employee representatives, the Group discusses executive remuneration policy and provides details of the process by which the Committee establishes executive remuneration packages.
The information provided includes details of the benchmarking of executive director remuneration as well as information benchmarking the pay of employees in the collective bargaining unit with pay elsewhere in the industry.
