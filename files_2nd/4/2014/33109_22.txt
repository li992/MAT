84 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT 2014 ANNUAL REMUNERATION REPORT The following section provides details of how the Companys Remuneration Policy was applied during the financial year ending 31 December2014 and how it will be applied in 2015.
2 Taxable benefits include private medical healthcare, life assurance, plus a company car or a cash allowance in lieu of a company car.
3 For Andy Gulliford and Phil Redding, as members of the Defined Benefit Pension Scheme, this comprises the pension input value increase in accrued pension.
Further information can be found on pages 92 and 93.
For David Sleath and Justin Read, this comprises cash paid in lieu of pension.
4 Includes the cash Bonus payable and monetary value of the shares awarded under the DSBP.
The monetary value of the shares is calculated using the market value of shares at the date of award.
In accordance with the Remuneration Policy, 50 per cent of any Bonus earned in 2014 will be deferred into shares under the DSBP.
Due to IPD Benchmark data not being available at the date of publication of the 2013 Annual Report, the 2013 Bonus payments disclosed last year were based on an estimate of 50 per cent for the TPR element.
Finalisation of the TPR element was completed as soon as data became available and the amounts received by the Directors in respect of 2013 performance have been updated accordingly.
For a comparison of the reported figures, see Chart 4 on page 86.
5 The 2011 LTIP Award was based on Company performance to 31 December 2013: as the performance conditions were not met, this award lapsed and accordingly there was no LTIP vesting in 2014.
The 2012 Transitionary Award is based on Company performance to 31 December 2014 and will vest in May 2015, subject to performance.
For this award, achievement under the TSR performance condition has been calculated at 85.7 per cent and achievement under the TPR has been estimated at 0 per cent.
The TPR outcome will be trued up for actual performance in June 2015, and, if appropriate, the single figure will be updated accordingly in the 2015 Annual Remuneration Report.
6 Includes SIP, based on the number of shares awarded during the year and the share price used for the grant of the award: and Sharesave, based on the discount represented by the option price, multiplied by the annual savings.
Base salary and benefits With effect from 1 April 2014, the Chief Executives base salary was 566,500 and the base salaries of the Group Finance Director, Chief Investment Officer and the Chief Operating Officer were each 370,800.
With effect from 1 April 2015, each of the Executive Directors will receive an increase to base salary of three per cent, which is in line with the average all employee increase.
The Executive Directors currently receive life assurance, private medical insurance, company car or car cash allowance and pension contributions or cash in lieu of pension, as applicable.
Non-Executive Directors single figure audited The Non-Executive Directors fees are reviewed by the Board in the absence of the Non-Executive Directors, while the fees paid to the Chairman are reviewed by the Committee.
There were no changes to fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors or the Chairman in 2014 see Chart 2 opposite.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Companys share-based incentive schemes nor do they receive any other benefits or rights under the pension schemes.
Chart 2 shows the total remuneration received by each of the Non-Executive Directors during the year.

Bonus payment 2014 For the Executive Directors, the 2014 Bonus comprised three equally weighted components: EPRA Profit Before Tax PBT : rent roll growth RRG : and relative TPR.
Profit EPRA PBT against target For this element, a Bonus is earned for EPRA PBT performance against target.
25 per cent is earned on achieving the threshold target 115.8 million for 2014, rising to 100 per cent for achieving the maximum target 128.0 million for 2014.
100 per cent of this element was achieved in 2014, with EPRA PBT performance for bonus purposes of 130.0 million achieved, exceeding the target by 2 million.
Rent roll growth RRG against target For this element, a Bonus is earned if the rent roll growth from the existing standing stock is positive the threshold.
Once the threshold is achieved, the Bonus is determined based on total RRG existing standing stock plus the impact of development RRG, with a sliding pay-out scale from 0 per cent for flat total RRG through to 100 per cent for achieving the maximum increase 14 million in 2014.
In 2014, RRG from standing stock was positive, thus ensuring the threshold was achieved.
Total RRG including the contribution from developments was 16.8 million for Bonus purposes and, accordingly, 100 per cent of this element was achieved.
TPR Relative TPR against the IPD Benchmark For this element, 25 per cent is earned when the Companys TPR equals the TPR of a comparable IPD benchmark, rising on a straight line basis to 100 per cent when the Companys TPR exceeds the IPD Benchmark by 1.5 per cent.
Only the UK data for this calculation was available at the date of this report: TPR for the Companys UK assets under management AUM including 100 per cent of joint venture assets, was 22.7 per cent, compared to the performance of an equivalent IPD Benchmark of 23.5 per cent, meaning that no TPR-related Bonus will be earned in respect of UK assets.
Note that these figures are different to the figures in the KPIs on page 14 because the IPD Benchmark for Bonus payments is a bespoke calculation based on a portfolio of properties in the IPD universe constructed to mirror the Companys AUM as closely as possible, unlike the KPI equivalents which are based on the Companys wholly owned assets plus share of joint venture assets and are compared to the IPD UK Quarterly All Industrial data.
On the basis of the UK portfolio performance above, the Committee has estimated that 0 per cent of the overall TPR element will be achieved for 2014 Bonus purposes.
Bonus targets for EPRA PBT and RRG are set at the start of the year using the prevailing exchange rate at the time and are adjusted to reflect changes in the business such as acquisitions and disposals.
The EPRA PBT and RRG outturns which have been used to compare to the 2014 targets were calculated using a consistent exchange rate to that used when the target was set and also include adjustments for specific items in accordance with the Bonus scheme rules as approved by the Committee.
The profit and RRG element of the 2014 Bonus will be paid in April 2015, less a 50 per cent deduction for the DSBP.
Payment of the TPR element will be deferred until summer 2015, when the pan-European IPD data becomes available.
Accordingly, the actual payment made under the TPR element of the 2014 Bonus, together with the deferral under the DSBP, may differ from the amount disclosed in this Report.
The DSBP award will be made once the final Bonus figures can be calculated.
The vesting of the 2014 DSBP will be in April 2018, the third anniversary of the payment of the profit and individual elements of the 2014 Bonus.
Any payments under the 2015 Bonus and the DSBP will be made in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.

The Committee will determine the TPR element as soon as the measurement can be completed based onactual data.
Any difference between the estimated and actual figures will be reconciled in the 2015 Annual Report.
Bonus payment 2013 Calculation of the TPR element of the Bonus payment is based on comparison with the IPD benchmark, the data for which was not available at the time of publication of the 2013 Annual Report.
The Remuneration Committee estimated that 50 per cent of this element would be achieved.
The actual relative TPR against the IPD benchmark for 2013 was calculated as 26.2 per cent and the Directors were remunerated accordingly.
The TPR for the weighted IPD Benchmark which reflected the Companys portfolio and the Company were 10.96 per cent and 10.99 per cent respectively.
The Company outperformed the UK Benchmark by 0.2 per cent.
The table below provides a comparison between the amounts disclosed in the 2013 Annual Report to those used in the 2013 figures in Chart 1 on page 84 for all three Bonus targets.

Executive Director share scheme holdings audited DSBP The DSBP was implemented for the 2010 Bonus payment onwards for the Executive Directors and certain other members of the Leadership Team.
For the 2010, 2011 and 2012 Bonus, 25 per cent of any payment was deferred into shares.
From 2013, the deferral percentage was increased to 50 per cent for Executive Directors.
The shares held under the DSBP are shown in Chart 12 below.
On vesting, acash sum equivalent to the value of dividends that would have been paid on shares during the three years they were under award may also be paid to participants.
The Company failed to meet its EPS or TPR targets for this LTIP, accordingly no shares under this award vested during 2014.
LTIP 2012 award onwards In 2012, shareholders approved an increase in the performance period for the 2012 and subsequent LTIP awards from three to four years to reflect more closely the time horizon for value creation, in line with the Companys strategy.
LTIP awards made after 2011 are subject to TSR andTPR performance conditions, which are equally weighted and measured over a four-year performance period, save for the 2012 Transitionary award which is measured over a three-year performance period.
The performance conditions for the LTIP awards are based on TSR and TPR.
TSR this benchmark is based on the weighted mean TSR of other FTSE 350 REITs.
25 per cent of this element vests if the Companys four-year TSR is in line with benchmark TSR, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting if the benchmark is exceeded by 5 per cent per year.
TPR this benchmark is based on the IPD Benchmark with UK European industrials weighted to reflect the geographical mix of the Groups portfolio 75 25 UK Continental Europe for this cycle.
25 per cent of this element vests if the Companys four-year TPR is in line with the IPD Benchmark, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent if the IPD Benchmark is exceeded by at least 1.5 per cent per year.
On vesting, calculations are reviewed by theauditor and are approved by the Committee.
The Committee retains the discretion to withhold vesting of awards should such payments be deemed inappropriate.
The 2012 Transitionary award will vest on 1 May 2015, subject to relative TSR and TPR performance to 31 December 2014.
The Companys TSR over the performance period was 96.9 per cent and the benchmark TSR was 74.8 per cent.
The Companys TSR outperformance of 4.05 per cent per annum compared to the benchmark warranted 85.7 per cent vesting of the TSR element.
The TPR performance will not be available until after the date of this report.
For the purposes of the Directors single figure calculations Chart 1, the performance for the TPR element has been estimated at 0 per cent.
This is based on the Companys annualised TPR in 2012 and 2013 of 5.1 per cent and the IPD Benchmark over the same period of 6.3 per cent.
In estimating the overall 3 year performance, the Committee assumed that SEGROs 2014 relative TPR would be insufficient to overcome the historic underperformance in the first two years.
Details of the LTIP awards granted to the Executive Directors are set out in Chart 13 opposite.
Any awards made under the LTIP in 2015 will be made in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
com OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 91 Chart 13: LTIP awards outstanding END OF NO.
For the EPS element, 25 per cent of the award vests on the achievement of EPS growth of 4 per cent per year, rising on a straight-line basis for full vesting of EPS growth of10per cent per year.
For the TPR element 25 per cent of the award vests for performance equalling that of the IPD Benchmark, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for outperformance of the IPD Benchmark by 1.5 per cent per year or more.
Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated according to the applicable EPRA guidelines, excluding valuation gains losses and exceptional items.
Actual performance for EPS is calculated from the published figures in the Annual Report.
The Committee has the discretion to adjust awards downwards at vesting if it is not satisfied that the outcome is a fair reflection of underlying performance, or in the event of excessive risk-taking ormisstatement.
No such discretion was exercised in respect of the vesting of the 2010 award.
2 For 2012, the Committee made two reduced LTIP awards: the 2012 LTIP award and an LTIP transitionary award.
The 2012 LTIP award will vest, subject to performance conditions, based on four-year performance.
So as to prevent the lengthening of the performance period resulting in there being no potential LTIP vesting in 2015, the LTIP transitionary award will vest, subject to performance conditions, on three-year performance.
Each of these awards was based on the normal LTIP grant size, reduced by 25 per cent.
The same performance targets will apply to both awards.

com OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 93 Pension entitlement in the event of severance There are no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement.
Fees for external non-executive appointments Since September 2007, David Sleath has been a Non-Executive Director of Bunzl plc and during the year he received a fee of 78,500 for this role.
Exit payments No exit payments were made to Directors during the year.
Former Directors audited Ex gratia payments totalling 56,470 2013: 56,470 were made during the year to four former Directors, who retired at least 10 years ago.
These payments were made under legacy arrangements which are no longer offered.
A one-off social contribution of 16,831 was paid in respect of a pension benefit for Walter Hens, a former Director.
Remuneration Committee advisers The Committee has access to sufficient resources to discharge its duties, which include access to independent remuneration advisers, the General Counsel and Group Company Secretary, the Group HR Director and other advisers as required.
The Committee is responsible for appointing its external advisers and during the year it received advice from Kepler Associates, which is a founding member and signatory to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants in the UK, in discharging its responsibilities.
Kepler Associates was appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 2011 following a competitive tender process.
During the year, Kepler Associates provided advice on Executive Directors remuneration, market and best practice guidance and attended meetings when major remuneration issues were discussed.
Their total fees for advice to the Remuneration Committee in 2014 were 39,369 onthe basis of time and materials.
The Committee evaluates the support provided by its advisers periodically and is comfortable that Kepler Associates provide independent remuneration advice to the Committee and does not have any connections with SEGRO which may impair its independence.
To ensure a consistent approach to remuneration across the Group, Kepler Associates also provides advice to the Company in respect of matters relating to the remuneration of all employees.
Aon Hewitt Limited provided information to the Company in respect of pension-related matters.
Duringthe year, Slaughter and May provided advice to the Company in respect of its share-based incentive schemes as well as regulatory and pensionmatters.
