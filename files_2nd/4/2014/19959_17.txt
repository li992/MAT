Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Remuneration Report Directors Remuneration Report Melanie Gee Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholder As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present this 2014 Remuneration Report, incorporating our remuneration policy table as approved at the 2014 AGM.
This year, we have sought to make the detail of our remuneration arrangements easier to follow by including an At a Glance section at the beginning of the report.
Business context 2014 was a challenging year for most commodity prices, with the downward trend in mining company capital expenditure continuing and oil prices, having been stable through the year, experiencing their biggest fall since 2009 in the fourth quarter.
Against this background, and as described more fully in the Chief Executives Strategic Review at page 10, management has focused on accelerating operational efficiencies through our four strategic pillars as detailed on pages 15 to 21.
This includes significant progress on Value Chain Excellence, and we continue to build on our operational and strategic initiatives through Innovation, Collaboration and extending our Global Capability.
We remain confident in the long term growth trends in our key end markets.
However, in 2015 we expect continued price volatility in many commodities, including those to which we are most exposed, with our mining customers remaining focused on optimising their current assets to support increased production.
Many of our oil and gas customers have already significantly reduced their capital spending plans in response to lower oil prices, and our visibility in these markets is limited as they adjust plans in the evolving pricing environment.
In light of the near term uncertainties and emerging pricing pressure in oil and gas markets, which represented nearly 50% of our 2014 revenues, senior management undertook an efficiency review across all divisions in the third quarter of 2014, with a view to ensuring that the Group entered 2015 optimally placed to tackle what is expected to be a challenging year.
The oil and gas division took further action at the start of 2015.
In this letter and in the report itself, we have demonstrated how the various elements of compensation link to the implementation of our strategy and align Executive Directors with the long-term interests of our shareholders, in particular in these times of unpredictable oil and gas markets.
2014 remuneration outcomes As part of implementing our approved remuneration policy, the salaries of the Chief Executive and the Finance Director were unchanged in 2014.
During the year, the Company made changes to the pension arrangements for all UK staff in response to the introduction of pension auto-enrolment and, as of July 2014, senior executives had the option to join the Companys defined contribution scheme or receive an equivalent cash amount.
Prior to this, there had been no specific pension provision for senior executives.
Both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director have chosen to take the cash amount.
The 2014 annual bonus payout, as a percentage of maximum opportunity for both the Chief Executive and Finance Director, was 61.2%.
The 2014 bonus had two performance metrics financial 80% of bonus entitlement and personal 20% of bonus entitlement.
The financial element was based on the achievement of Normalised Profit Before Tax and Amortisation NPBTA, and capable of being reduced to the extent that Group working capital targets were not achieved.
Given challenging markets, the relative performances of our two main businesses were strong during the year and performance under the NPBTA measure was just below target.
The Group working capital target was not achieved and, as a result, the Committee has reduced the bonus entitlement under the financial performance element by 10%.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 91 Remuneration Report continued 2014 remuneration outcomes continued The Committee reviewed personal performance of each of the Chief Executive and Finance Director against their respective individual performance objectives, which were set at the beginning of the year and built around the Companys KPIs.
All individual performance objectives were measurable and further details are set out in the report.
The Committee concluded that all personal objectives were achieved and the Chief Executive and Finance Director were awarded the maximum entitlement under this element.
No performance or matching shares will vest in March 2015 under the 2012 LTIP awards, as the performance conditions required were not met.
Awards were based on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR and growth in Earnings per Share EPS performance conditions over the three year period to 31 December 2014.
The Companys TSR performance over the period was below median relative to the comparator group, this being the threshold vesting level, and EPS growth was 2.55% per annum, also below the threshold level of 7% per annum.
As part of our remuneration policy approved in 2014, the Company has the ability to operate malus and clawback in certain circumstances for the cash bonus, the bonus shares and the LTIP.
We have expanded on the disclosure of the details of our malus and clawback arrangements on pages 95 and 96.
Implementation of remuneration in 2015 The Committee considered base pay increases for our Chief Executive and Finance Director, in line with our policy.
We were comfortable that the good relative performance of the business and the strong performance of the two individuals supported an increase.
In April 2015, the salaries for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director will both be increased by 3.4%, which is broadly in line with salary increases applied to UK employees.
The bonus opportunity and LTIP award levels are unchanged in 2015.
Considering the appropriate performance measures and setting the underlying calibration has been particularly challenging this year given the external environment, as we seek to ensure the 2015 annual bonus and LTIP targets support the Groups strategy, are compatible with the Groups appetite for risk see page 25, and are stretching but achievable to provide appropriate incentivisation.
The market environment is discussed further in the Chief Executives Strategic Review starting on page 10.
In relation to annual bonus incentives and pursuant to our remuneration policy, the Committee reviews the measures and sets the targets each year, reflecting the relevant business context for the period.
As a result of this years review, we are introducing a new cash flow measure alongside NPBTA in the financial element of the 2015 bonus scheme targets.
The Committee has carefully considered the targets for the 2015 annual bonus scheme, against the backdrop of uncertain, and potentially volatile, oil and gas markets.
The Committee is comfortable that the targets we have set are sufficiently stretching and appropriate for the year ahead, based on the range of assumptions in the Companys internal budget at that time.
The Committee has also set the three year targets for the 2015 LTIP awards, which has been equally challenging and compounded by the relatively high EPS and Return on Capital Employed ROCE achieved in 2014, which forms the starting point for each measures growth target over the three year period.
The required growth targets are described below.
In relation to the ROCE measure, the Committee considered the 2014 base figure and the uncertain business environment over the three year period ahead covered by the 2015 LTIP awards, and concluded that there were exceptional circumstances making it appropriate to adjust the way we assess this performance measure.
As a result of this adjustment, 2017s ROCE only will be assessed relative to the 2014 level, rather than taking a three year average per annum growth approach.
This decision has been taken to ensure that the ROCE measure for the 2015 LTIP award remains both incentivising and challenging.
Overall, after careful consideration and in light of the uncertain longer term outlook for oil and gas markets, the Committee is also comfortable that the 2015 LTIP targets are sufficiently stretching and appropriate for the three year period ahead.
In line with our policy, remuneration will be implemented as follows: 2015 bonus scheme Our new cash flow measure, alongside NPBTA, better aligns Executive Directors interests with our operational priorities and provides a clearer link between performance and reward.
2015 bonus performance measures will therefore comprise 60% NPBTA, 20% cash flow and 20% personal performance.
The Committee will review performance against the 2015 bonus scheme targets on an interim basis, with appropriate input from management, at its meetings in the second half of the year.
In accordance with our policy, the Committee has the ability to exercise discretion in exceptional circumstances to alter the payout levels of an award at the end of a performance period if it believes this will better reflect the underlying performance of the Company.
The Committee has taken particular care in reviewing the personal objectives for the Chief Executive and Finance Director, given the market backdrop, and is comfortable that they are measurable and appropriately defined to support our growth strategy, including our four strategic pillars, whilst also focusing on the effective management of the business in the shorter term.
2015 LTIP awards The equal weighting of our three long-term measures of TSR, EPS and ROCE remains unchanged and our relative TSR group remains broadly the same.
For all measures, threshold vesting remains unchanged at 25% of maximum vesting.
For TSR, the performance required for threshold and maximum vesting remains unchanged at median performance and upper quintile performance respectively.
Against the backdrop of the recent significant fall in the oil price, emerging pricing pressure in our businesses exposed to oil and gas markets, and also the uncertain medium term outlook for these markets, the Committee has been concerned to ensure that the EPS element provides appropriate incentivisation that is both achievable and stretching for the next three years.
Recognising the 2014 base EPS of 141.3p, we have set the performance required for threshold EPS vesting to 2.5% per annum over the three year period from 5% for the 2014 LTIP awards and the level for maximum vesting to 7.5% per annum from 11% to ensure that Executive Directors remain incentivised.
92 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements We introduced our ROCE measure last year, which is a KPI used within the business as detailed in the Strategic Report on page 23.
Whilst it drives operational excellence, as it is calculated on a constant currency basis it is less influenced by external factors than the other two measures.
For the 2014 LTIP awards, the ROCE measure was expressed as a three year average percentage increase per annum and the range was set at 0.5% per annum to 4% per annum.
The Committee has decided that for the 2015 LTIP awards, instead of using the average per annum growth for the ROCE measurement it will assess the comparable 2017 ROCE against the base 2014 ROCE of 17.3%.
This is different from the 2014 ROCE of 18.1% as referred to on page 23 because, in accordance with our remuneration policy, we have included our recent Trio acquisition in the base figure, in order to make an appropriate comparator for our 2015 LTIP award ROCE targets.
These targets have been set with a threshold ROCE of 18.8% 0.5% per annum improvement to a maximum of 24.8% 2.5% per annum improvement.
Shareholder engagement The Committee welcomes the views of shareholders on remuneration on an ongoing basis.
In 2013 and early 2014, the Committee consulted extensively with shareholders on changes to our remuneration policy and received strong support for our proposals at the 2014 AGM.
The Committees activities following the 2014 AGM have focused on implementing this approved policy.
We continue to value shareholders views on our remuneration arrangements and I can be contacted via the Company Secretary.
Further details of the implementation of the policy and the outturn for 2014 are set out in the rest of this Remuneration Report and shareholders will be invited to approve the report in an advisory vote at the Companys AGM on 29 April 2015.
We look forward to shareholders continued support.

Statement of Implementation of Directors Remuneration Policy in 2015 In 2015, the approved Directors Remuneration Policy will be implemented as follows.
Executive Directors Fixed elements Base salary The Committee made the following 2015 base salary decisions which are in line with the approved Directors Remuneration Policy: 2015 salary 2014 salary Percentage change Keith Cochrane 750,000 725,000 3.4% Jon Stanton 455,000 440,000 3.4% Salaries are effective from 1 April each year.
The Committee has considered the broader employee context and economic factors in determining salaries.
In 2015, the increase in base salaries for UK employees will be up to 4%.
Fixed elements Retirement and other benefits The implementation of policy in relation to pension and benefits is in line with the approved Directors Remuneration Policy.
Short term incentives Annual bonus The implementation of policy in relation to annual bonus is in line with the approved Directors Remuneration Policy.
The annual bonus is based on in-year performance against targets.
The performance measures are: 60% Group Normalised Profit before Tax and Amortisation NPBTA measured over the financial period, 20% cash flow and 20% personal performance targets.
The cash flow measure is defined as cash generated from operations, including additional pension contributions paid and excluding the impact of derivative financial instruments on working capital cash flows.
The performance targets are determined annually by the Committee.
The performance targets for the cash flow measure are set at levels equivalent to the threshold, target and maximum levels for the NPBTA measure, with similar pay out percentages at each.
The performance target of cash flow is adjusted to match the actual foreign exchange rates during the financial period and is also increased or decreased to reflect the impact of any acquisitions or disposals made in the year that are of a size requiring Board approval.
Exceptional items or extraordinary items as agreed by the Remuneration Committee are excluded.
Targets are approved by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of the performance year.
As set out in the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Company will disclose the NPBTA and cash flow targets and the main groupings of individual performance measures retrospectively in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance targets will not be disclosed prospectively for commercial reasons.
30% of bonus payable will be converted into shares with a restriction on sale under the 2014 LTIP.
There are no performance conditions on the bonus shares.
Malus and clawback arrangements operate in respect of the annual bonus and bonus shares.
These arrangements enable the Company not to release any bonus shares before the end of the restriction period.
This policy also enables the Company to clawback the annual bonus after the payment date and the bonus shares or their relevant value after the restriction period has ended for a period of up to three years.
Malus and clawback may be applied in certain circumstances where there is found to be a material misstatement in the audited accounts of the Group or a Group company accounts, where the executives action or conduct amounts to gross misconduct, or where there is a significant detrimental reputational impact on the Company for which the executive is responsible.
Long term incentives performance shares The Committee has determined that the following awards be made for 2015, in line with the approved Directors Remuneration Policy.
Awards vest after three years, subject to performance conditions.
Awards for Executive Directors are then subject to a two year holding period.

Note The performance period for each LTIP award is based on calendar years.
The TSR performance measure is calculated over calendar years.
The EPS and ROCE measures are calculated over the relevant financial periods.
In all cases, awards will only vest subject to the achievement of the performance conditions and if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the vesting of the awards.
The base 2014 EPS and ROCE used for the purposes of the 2015 LTIP award are 141.3p and 17.3% respectively.
2017 figures will be calculated on a consistent basis, in accordance with our approved Directors Remuneration Policy.
Malus and clawback arrangements operate in respect of performance shares.
These enable the Company to reduce unvested awards and to clawback the relevant value of the vested shares for a period of up to three years after the date of vesting.
Malus and clawback may be applied in certain situations where there is found to be a material misstatement in the audited accounts of the Group or a Group company accounts, where the executives action or conduct amounts to gross misconduct, or where there is a significant detrimental reputational impact on the Company for which the executive is responsible.
Non-Executive Directors Annual fees for 2015 The implementation of the Non-Executive Director remuneration is in line with the approved Directors Remuneration Policy.
The fees per annum for Non-Executive Directors are set out in the table below.

100 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Statement of Directors shareholdings and share interests The Committee believes that employee share ownership is an important means to support long term commitment to the Company and the alignment of employee interests with those of shareholders.
The interests of the Executive Directors and other senior executives are closely aligned with those of shareholders in this regard through the operation of the Companys LTIP and the conversion into shares with restriction on sale of 30% of the annual bonus award for a period of three years.
These elements constitute a significant proportion of individual remuneration packages.
Following shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM, the shareholding guidelines outlined in the policy table on page 107 apply to all Executive Directors.
All shares beneficially owned by an Executive Director count towards achieving these guidelines.
There is no shareholding requirement for Non-Executive Directors.
Current shareholding levels for Directors are set out in the table below.

On 17 March 2014, the 2011 Award under the LTIP for Keith Cochrane and Jon Stanton vested in part.
On 29 May 2014, they exercised 42.8% of their performance and matching shares and 100% of their compulsory shares as set out in the table above, selling 23,933 shares and 9,955 shares respectively to pay the relevant tax and National Insurance and retaining the balance.
The market price at date of exercise was 26.11.
Awards under the LTIP take the form of nil cost options and have no performance retesting facility.
The share awards have a right to receive dividend equivalents in the form of shares payable at vesting.
The awards exercised by Keith Cochrane and Jon Stanton on 29 May 2014 include dividend equivalents of 134.0p per share, being the dividends paid between the date of award and the date of exercise, which equated to 2,527 shares and 1,051 shares respectively.
No Director had, during or at the end of the year, any material interest in any contract of any significance in relation to the Groups business, in any debenture stocks of the Company, or in the share capital or debenture or loan stocks of any subsidiary.
Due to the vesting outcome of the 2011 LTIP, 47,569 shares under Keith Cochranes grant and 20,367 shares under Jon Stantons grant lapsed.
There are no unexercised vested options held by Executive Directors.
All scheme interests outstanding or vesting in the year were share options rather than shares.
Total shares as a percentage of salary is based on salary as of 31 December in the relevant financial year and on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares at the financial period end.
For 2014, the closing market price at 2 January 2015 was 18.83.
There have been no changes to Directors interests between 2 January 2015 and 25 February 2015.
Mary Jo Jacobis interest in 2,000 shares shown above is through her holding of 4,000 of the Groups unsponsored American Depositary Receipts ADRs, one ADR being equivalent to 0.5 shares.
30% of the annual bonus is converted into shares with a restriction on sale.
This resulted in Keith Cochrane receiving 653 shares and Jon Stanton receiving 264 shares.
These shares are shown in the interests in shares column above.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 101 Remuneration Report continued Annual Report on Remuneration continued Performance graph and table for Chief Executive The graph below shows the total shareholder return TSR for The Weir Group PLC, the FTSE 100 Index and the 2014 LTIP Comparator Group over the six year period ending 31 December 2014.
This is set out with the total vested and received remuneration for the Chief Executive over the same period, which is set out numerically below the chart.
The Committee considers that these are the most relevant indices for a comparison of total shareholder return.
2009 remuneration relates to the ten months Mark Selway was Chief Executive until his resignation in November 2009.
2009 remuneration relates to the two months Keith Cochrane was Chief Executive from November 2009.
Total remuneration is calculated on the same basis as the 2014 remuneration summary in the single total figure of remuneration for Executive Directors table on page 96.
In particular, this includes the value of performance shares and matching shares that vest following the end of each financial year, including dividends equivalents where appropriate.
For 2014, the value of the share awards is estimated based on the average share price in the last financial quarter.
This will be restated next year once the share price at the date of vesting is known.
Prior year calculations are based on the actual share price at date of vesting and the 2013 value has been restated from that disclosed in the 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements accordingly.
Percentage change in Chief Executive remuneration The percentage change in elements of remuneration for the Chief Executive between the 53 weeks ended 3 January 2014 and the 52 weeks ended 2 January 2015 is detailed below.
The change in remuneration for UK employees for the same period is also provided.
Chief UK Executive Employees Percentage Percentage change change Salary & Fees 0.9% 3.4% Taxable Benefits 5.2% 15.4% Bonus 512.0% 284.3% For the purposes of this section, remuneration has been calculated in accordance with the Regulations to include salary, fees, taxable benefits including emoluments and certain performance-related pay for the relevant financial year primarily bonuses but excluding long term incentives.
Pension and retirement benefits are not included.
To help minimise distortions in the data, the UK employee remuneration figures have been prepared on the basis of employees who were employed by Weir companies whose principal reporting currency was pounds Sterling during 2013 and 2014.
102 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements The increase in bonus for the Chief Executive reflects the figures in the single total figure table in 2013 and 2014.
In 2013, the NPBTA element of the bonus did not meet threshold and the bonus paid out at 10.0% of maximum.
In 2014, the NPBTA element of the bonus was just below target and the bonus paid out at 61.2% of maximum.
The total of the single total figure for the Chief Executive decreased by 18.5% from 2013 to 2014.
The UK employee population has been selected as it reflects a broad sample of employees which includes Head Office employees and other individuals located in the same country as the Executive Directors.
Relative importance of spend on pay The table below shows the expenditure of the Company on employee remuneration costs in the 2014 financial year and 2013 financial year.

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors remuneration, Terms of Reference and Evaluation To ensure reward arrangements support the Companys philosophy, strategy and culture, the Committee reviews compensation and benefit plans for the Executive Directors, senior leadership, and the broader employee population.
In December 2014, the Committee reviewed its Terms of Reference.
The Remuneration Committee was evaluated as part of the 2014 Board evaluation process, conducted externally by Independent Board Review, and it was concluded that the Committee continued to function strongly in accordance with good corporate governance.
The report highlighted that in a busy year involving the formulation of the new remuneration policy, there had been a cohesive approach and in particular a significant amount of good work undertaken on shareholder consultation.
Improvements can always be made and the Committee has agreed a number of these for implementation in 2015.
More details of the Board evaluation can be found on pages 80 and 81.
The Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on the Companys website.

On behalf of the Board of Directors Melanie Gee Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Signed and approved for and on behalf of the Board 25 February 2015 104 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Directors policy table The Groups overarching remuneration policy is designed to ensure that remuneration supports the Groups strategy and business objectives.
The policy and practice have been developed to support the creation of value for shareholders, drive appropriate behaviours and incentivise outperformance, while being clearly linked to both individual and corporate performance.
The Committee is mindful of a broad range of stakeholders in setting this policy and has considered best practice guidelines from shareholders and representative bodies.
The Committee has adopted a set of principles which are used as the basis against which remuneration arrangements have been established.
The Groups remuneration principles are that reward should enable the Group to: attract, motivate and retain senior executives with the necessary abilities to manage and develop the Groups activities successfully for the benefit of shareholders: clearly align remuneration outcomes with the long term interests of the Group and its shareholders: drive appropriate behaviours that are in line with the culture of the Group and focus senior executives on the critical business objectives by rewarding them against challenging performance criteria: and provide a significant part of potential reward through performance based incentive plans.

The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 107 Remuneration Report continued Directors policy table continued Notes to the policy table 1.
Annual bonus performance measures and targets The profit performance measure of Normalised Profit before Tax and Amortisation NPBTA was selected by the Company as profitability is central to the Companys overall strategy.
The performance measure is adjusted to exclude items that are one off in nature, subject to Remuneration Committee approval.
The performance targets for the NPBTA performance measure are set in the context of consensus forecasts and the internal budget.
The performance required for maximum payout is typically set at a level that is above the level of the Companys forecasts.
If performance is in line with the forecast then typically part of the annual bonus would pay out.
The performance target of NPBTA is adjusted to match the actual foreign exchange rates during the financial period and is also increased or decreased to reflect the impact of any acquisitions or disposals made in the year that are of a size requiring Board approval.
For acquisitions, the target is increased by the expected NPBTA from the acquired business.
For disposals, the target is reduced by the budgeted NPBTA from the business which was disposed of.
The Committee is of the view that the performance target for the financial element under the annual bonus is commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose this before the end of the financial year.
Disclosure of the performance target of the financial element in advance could lead the Company to be at a competitive disadvantage as many competitors are not listed in the UK and would not be subject to this requirement.
The Company would be releasing potentially commercially sensitive information which many of the Companys direct competitors in its three end markets would not be required to disclose.
The personal performance measures relate to achievement of personal and strategic goals.
Personal performance measures and targets are set by the Chairman for the Chief Executive and by the Chief Executive for other Executive Directors.
The Committee discusses and approves these targets for Executive Directors in consultation with the Director of Human Resources and they are linked to the Companys annual appraisal process.
The Committee is of the view that the performance targets for the personal element are commercially sensitive as they relate to internal management projects and personal goals.
The performance targets for the financial elements of the bonus and the main groupings of individual performance measures will be retrospectively disclosed after the end of the relevant financial period in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
LTIP performance measures and targets The Committee selected the performance conditions for the LTIP as these are central to the Companys overall strategy and are intended to link reward to long term sustainable growth.
The performance measures are EPS, TSR and ROCE: - EPS is adjusted earnings per fully paid ordinary share in the capital of the Company calculated on such basis as the Committee may specify.
In addition, the EPS figure used to calculate the award may be adjusted for changes in accounting standards to ensure a consistent measurement basis across the performance period.
- TSR is the increase in the net return index the index that reflects movements in share price over a period and dividend reinvested net of any associated tax credit in shares on the ex-dividend date for a company as calculated by Datastream or such other financial information provider as selected by the Committee over the performance period.
- ROCE is defined as earnings before interest and tax divided by capital employed.
Earnings before interest and tax is taken as Group continuing operations after intangibles amortisation but before exceptional items for the relevant financial year.
Capital employed is taken as the average of opening and closing Group net assets excluding net debt cash and pension deficit net of deferred tax asset for the relevant financial year.
To eliminate the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates over the period of the plan, the average foreign exchange rates for the base year are held constant throughout the plan period.
With regard to acquisitions, those acquisitions made in the base year are included, based on a full years ownership, for the purposes of target setting.
Where acquisitions are made in subsequent years of the plan period, these are excluded from the assessment of performance relative to the target.
Where there are disposals during the plan period, the base and target ROCE calculations will be restated to eliminate the contribution from the disposed business in the period of ownership.
EPS, TSR and ROCE targets are set to ensure they are sufficiently stretching but also motivational and consistent with the Companys remuneration strategy.
In setting targets the Committee considers the Companys operating environment, and internal and external growth forecasts.
The performance required for maximum vesting is typically set at a level that is above the level of the Companys forecasts.
If performance is in line with the forecast then typically part of the award would vest.
EPS, TSR and ROCE targets are disclosed prospectively in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the relevant year.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees The Company seeks to operate a locally driven approach to pay and benefits in all its locations.
Employees in management roles are also eligible to participate in an annual bonus.
The maximum opportunity available in the annual bonus scheme is based on the seniority and responsibility of the role.
The LTIP seeks to encourage a shared focus on our corporate goals within the senior management and executive populations.
Grants under the 2014 LTIP may be made to around 300 of the most senior managers in the Group.
The nature of the award depends on the individuals location and seniority.
When used, the performance conditions will be the same throughout the Group.
In markets other than the UK, LTIP awards may be made in the form of a combination of performance shares and or either restricted shares or share appreciation rights with a corresponding reduction in award level.
The restricted shares or share appreciation rights are subject to a service condition of continued employment within the Group.
