COM All LTIP B awards are subject half to a relative TSR performance condition and half to an adjusted EPS performance condition.
All relative TSR performance conditions are measured against the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts index at the beginning of the performance period, over a three-year performance period from the date of grant.
12.5% of total awards will vest for a median performance, rising on a straight-line basis to 50% of total awards vesting for upper quartile performance.
For awards granted before 2012, the adjusted EPS performance targets for 12.5% of total awards vesting were RPI 3% pa, rising on a straight-line basis to 50% of total awards vesting for RPI 8% pa. For April 2012 awards, the EPS targets are 13% pa to 20% pa. For March 2013 awards, the targets are 8% pa to 15% pa and for February 2014 awards, the targets are 8.5% pa to 13.5% pa.
The table below sets out the potential vesting for these awards based on Essentras TSR performance as at 31 December 2014.

Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2015 unaudited Salary Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual.
As explained in the Remuneration Committee Chairmans Letter, in order to appropriately align the remuneration policy with Drive for 2020, it is the intention to set Executive Directors all elements of pay, including salaries for the three year period 2015-2017 at the pre-determined levels set out in the new Remuneration Policy Report subject to approval of the new Remuneration Policy Report by shareholders at the AGM.
For reference, the intended salaries for 2015 under this new policy are set out below.
m Colin Day Matthew Gregory 1 2 Annual salary effective from 1 January 2015 675,000 340,000 Annual salary effective from 1 January 2014 618,000 300,000 1 This salary is fixed until 1 January 2018 2 As highlighted in previous Remuneration Reports, Matthew Gregory was brought onto the Board at a salary level that was set deliberately well below the market rate for an established finance director with the intention that, subject to strong progression in role, the Remuneration Committee would implement a series of phased salary increases to bring his salary to a more appropriate level.
The Board has been pleased by the development of Matthew Gregory as Finance Director and these proposed increases, if implemented in full which will be subject to continued strong performance, will bring his salary to a more appropriate level by 2017 Benefits Executive Directors will be provided with the following benefits: Car, fuel and or car allowance Private medical insurance with family level cover Life insurance cover of four times basic salary Pension Colin Day will receive a supplementary payment equal to 25% of annual salary to permit him to secure pension benefits.
Matthew Gregory will receive a defined contribution and or supplementary payment of 20% of his basic salary to permit him to secure pension benefits.

COM Annual bonuses Each year, the Remuneration Committee reviews the annual bonus, to ensure the performance measures and targets remain appropriate and aligned to the Companys short-term strategy, while remaining within the appropriate risk profile.
Under the terms of the annual bonus arrangements for 2015, Colin Day is potentially entitled to a maximum bonus of up to 150% of basic salary.
Matthew Gregory is potentially entitled to a maximum bonus of up to 125% of basic salary.
Bonus payments are normally made one half in cash and one half in shares in the Company, the entitlement to such shares being deferred for three years, in accordance with the rules of the DASB.
For the year-ended 31 December 2015, the performance criteria will be as follows: Performance criteria Weighting % Balanced growth revenue and operating profit 80 Working capital 10 Personal objectives 10 The Remuneration Committee believes that revenue, profit and working capital targets are commercially sensitive, although targets will be set so as to provide alignment with the goals of Drive for 2020.
Therefore, the Remuneration Committee will not disclose the targets on a prospective basis.
The targets and actual performance against them will be disclosed on a retrospective basis where possible.
In addition to the financial measures, the Remuneration Committee has also set the personal performance measures for Colin Day and Matthew Gregory, which are designed to deliver further progress by the Company towards the strategic objectives associated with its Drive for 2020 strategy.
The objectives set do not have a specific weighting applied to them but are considered as a whole by the Remuneration Committee.
From 2015, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion, within a three-year period after the determination of the bonus, to withhold or recover annual cash bonuses or DASB awards via malus and clawback provisions in specified circumstances.
These circumstances will encompass if the original bonus was paid to a greater extent than it should have done due to a material misstatement in the Companys financial statements or due to an error in assessing the applicable performance conditions or if there has been serious misconduct by an individual or if there has been serious reputational damage to the Company or a relevant business unit.
Essentra Long Term Incentive Plan 2015 LTIP 2015 The existing long-term incentive plan LTIP B expires in 2015.
Shareholder approval will therefore be sought at the 2015 AGM for a new LTIP LTIP 2015.
Full terms of LTIP 2015 are summarised in the Notice of Meeting for the AGM, and key details of LTIP 2015 in so far as they affect the Executive Directors are outlined below.
An award granted under LTIP 2015 will consist of a conditional right to receive shares in the Company, subject to satisfaction of performance conditions.
The LTIP 2015 will usually permit annual awards over shares worth, at grant, 300% of salary.
However, as outlined in the Remuneration Policy Report, the Remuneration Committee proposes to fix the size of grants to the current Chief Executive and Group Finance Director for the three-year period of the Policy subject to shareholder approval of the Remuneration Policy Report.
Awards under the Policy in 2015 will be as set out below: Colin Day will receive an award over shares worth, at grant, 300% of his 2015-2017 annual salary 675,000 Matthew Gregory will receive an award over shares worth, at grant, 200% of his approximate average 2015-2017 salary 370,000 A share award under LTIP 2015 will not normally be exercisable before the third anniversary of its award and may only be exercised to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied.
The awards are structured as nil cost options.
For employees based outside the US, the options remain capable of being exercised up to the sixth anniversary of grant.
For employees based in the US, once the performance conditions have been satisfied the options must be exercised within 30 days of vesting.
For awards to be granted to the Executive Directors in 2015, one half of the awards will be subject to a TSR performance condition and one half of the awards will be subject to an adjusted EPS performance condition.
The Remuneration Committee believes that these conditions provide appropriate alignment with the strategic priorities outlined in Drive for 2020.
COM DIRECTORS REPORT | ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION The TSR performance condition assesses Essentras TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts index.
Performance is measured over three years from the time of grant.
12.5% of the total award vests for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to 50% of the total award vesting for upper quartile performance or above.
The adjusted EPS performance condition for these awards requires the Companys EPS growth adjusted to exclude items which did not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance and intangible amortisation over three financial years to be in excess of 8% per annum for 12.5% of the total awards to vest.
The proportion of the awards vesting will increase on a straight line basis, and for 50% of the total awards to vest the adjusted EPS growth must be in excess of 15% per annum.
The 15% per annum upper target is consistent with the aspiration of Drive for 2020, namely to double the size of the Company by 2020.
It is the current intention of the Remuneration Committee that awards in 2016 and 2017 will also be subject to a combination of TSR and EPS performance measures, and that the EPS targets for 2016 and 2017 awards will remain broadly the same as the targets for the 2015 award.
If any changes are required to measures or targets for future awards, we would consult in advance with our major shareholders.
Awards granted under the LTIP 2015 will be subject to malus and clawback provisions for a period of up to three years following the vesting date of the award.
Potential circumstances in which the malus and clawback provisions may be applied are consistent with those applying to annual bonus awards as described above.
The fees for the Chairman are set by the Remuneration Committee, while fees for the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole.
