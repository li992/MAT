The CEO and CFO participated in the RB annual bonus plan during 2014 with performance measures and targets set by RB prior to the start of the financial year.
The performance measures set were net revenue, operating profit and the delivery of key strategic objectives.
The CEO and CFO had a target annual bonus opportunity of 60% of salary.
Performance under each of the measures was combined multiplicatively.
For truly exceptional performance the maximum bonus was 3.57x target bonus 214% of salary for the CEO and 3x target bonus 180% of salary for the CFO.
In the context of a challenging year and an uncertain market, Indivior continued to expand treatment access, strengthen the resilience of the Suboxone Tablet franchise and maintain significant market share whilst making strong progress in respect of the pipeline.
This strong performance resulted in the stretch targets for all three measures being met and the maximum bonus opportunity being awarded.
This resulted in a total bonus pay-out of $1,163,232 for the CEO.
The CFO was awarded a total bonus pay-out of $111,634, which is pro-rated to take account of the time served as an Executive Director since joining the Company in November 2014.
LTI vesting in 2014 The CEO received an LTIP award under the RB LTIP in December 2011 which was subject to compound average annual growth CAAG in adjusted EPS over the three-year period ended on December 31, 2014.
The CEO was treated as a Good Leaver under the rules of the plan, upon completion of the demerger.
His award vested at the end of the performance period in accordance with the plan rules.
