Remuneration Committee Report Annual Statement I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee report for 2014, which consists of two parts.
In my Annual Statement I outline the links between remuneration and the Companys strategy as well as summarising the main decisions made by the Committee during the year.
The Annual Report on Remuneration which consists of the information on page 30 and notes 1 to 16 on pages 82 to 88 incorporates the remuneration disclosures required in respect of the year.
The Companys policy statement was approved by shareholders at last years Annual General Meeting for a period of three years and is not, therefore, presented on this occasion.
The principal terms of the policy together with any planned changes to their implementation in 2015 are, however, set out in notes 1 and 2 on pages 82 and 83.
The full policy statement was set out in last years report and accounts a copy of which is available on the Companys website.
Strategy, Performance and Remuneration The Companys strategy is set out in detail on pages 3 and 4 of the Strategic Report.
The success of this strategy partly is measured by reference to the Companys key performance indicators as detailed on page 6.
The Board also operates a series of annual priorities against which it measures progress.
The key performance indicators include PBTA and conversion of profit to cash.
The only incentive arrangement for the Executive Directors is the RPS Group Plc Bonus Plan in respect of which for 2014, the main performance condition was PBTA and the secondary condition was cash conversion.
By focusing on two of the Groups key performance indicators the Committee has sought to ensure that reward and incentive are linked to and supportive of the Companys strategy as well as being aligned with shareholder interests.
The Companys performance against these indicators in 2014 is repeated below.
2014 2013 PBTA m 66.163.0 Conversion of profit to cash % 89 96 Against the backdrop of this performance the Bonus Plan operated such that the bonus contributions for each of the Executive Directors as a percentage of their salaries were as follows: Executive Director Bonus % salary Alan Hearne 64 Phil Williams 56 Gary Young 48 Part of the bonus earned is deferred in shares for two years with these shares at risk of forfeiture if minimum PBTA thresholds are not met in subsequent years.
This ensures a longer term focus on sustainable performance and alignment with shareholder interests.
Details of the bonus payments are set out in note 3 of the Annual Remuneration Report on pages 83 and 84.
Basic Salaries In March 2014, having consulted with PwC, the Groups remuneration advisers, the Committee initiated a review of the salaries paid to the Executive Directors.
The geographic scale and complexity of the Groups operations have increased significantly over a number of years and has manifested itself in a number of ways.
n The pattern of the Group revenues has changed significantly as the Group has become increasingly international and correspondingly more complex.
Approximately 60% of the Groups revenues are derived from the overseas operating companies and given the international nature of the Energy business approximately 90% of Group revenues are earned from clients based overseas.
The Group does business in over 100 countries throughout the world.
n Growth has and will continue to be significantly driven by the successful implementation of the Groups acquisition strategy.
The Group does not incur the expense of an in-house acquisition team with the result that in addition to their line management responsibilities, the Executive Directors assume direct responsibility for the identification of suitable acquisition targets across a range of jurisdictions, the negotiation of terms and the subsequent integration of acquired companies.
During 2014 the Group invested 58m in the completion of five acquisitions in four jurisdictions.
The Committee is also conscious of the value of a highly experienced and stable executive team and the vital role it plays in ensuring long term performance and delivery of value to shareholders.
The Executive Directors have collective experience of 59 years at Group Board level.
The continued retention of this experience is considered vital to the Groups future performance and smooth succession planning.
In conducting its review the Committee also considered salaries of comparable listed consultancies and Energy companies.
28 Report and Accounts 2014 Management & Governance Having taken account of these factors the Committee concluded that the salaries of the Executive Directors did not fully reflect the extent of their roles in the Group as it has evolved and that a repositioning of their salaries was therefore appropriate.
In making the adjustments shown below the Committee ensured through a benchmarking exercise that the proposed new salaries were within the Remuneration Policy as approved by shareholders.
This review was not completed until the middle of the year with the changes being implemented as at 1 July.
As a result the salaries paid in 2014 were as follows.
Executive Director Salary paid in 2013 Salary paid in 2014 Percentage Changes Alan Hearne 459,400 526,200 14.5% Phil Williams 350,200 392,100 12.0% Gary Young 238,700 264,400 11.0% It is our intention that following this repositioning of base salaries any future rises will, during the Companys current policy period ie for 2015 to 2017, be in line with inflation or increases awarded to employees generally.
In accordance with this the Executive Directors salaries were reviewed as at 1 January 2015 and increased by 2%.
As a result the salaries payable in 2015 will be as follows.
Executive Director Salary payable 2015 Alan Hearne 581,400 Phil Williams 428,400 Gary Young 288,600 The adjustments made to basic salaries need to be placed in the context of the overall remuneration policy which is to provide up to median level of total reward for target performance.
The following table demonstrates the position of the Executive Directors in relation to those companies in the FTSE 250 Support Services Sector that generate more than 50% of their revenues from overseas markets.
Target Total Reward Actual Total Reward Actual Total Reward Median Target Total Reward Executive Director 2014 2013 2014 Comparator 2014 000s 000s 000s 000s Alan Hearne 1,513 863 903 1,604 Phil Williams 1,012 605 620 1,108 Gary Young 622 389 397 1,086 Target total reward is the total of salary, pension contribution, on target bonus and fair value of share incentive grants.
Notwithstanding the increases in salaries awarded during the year, the overall Actual Total Reward Payments for 2014 increased by only 3%.
Malus, Clawback and Vesting During the year the Committee also considered the provisions of the new UK Governance Code relating to the inclusion of malus and clawback provisions into executive incentive arrangements.
It concluded that the introduction of such provisions within the RPS Group Plc Bonus Plan was appropriate and these should apply to all awards made under that plan from 2015 onwards.
The possibility of introducing a post vesting holding period under the Companys incentive arrangements was also considered.
The Committee concluded that it was satisfied with the current provisions of the RPS Group Plc Bonus Plan as approved by shareholders in 2013 and the current shareholding guidelines for Directors.
