The amounts above have been calculated in accordance with Statutory Instrument 2013 No 1981 The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Account and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
The total accrued pension in the defined benefit scheme as at 31 December 2014 is that which would be paid annually on retirement from normal pension age, based on service to 31 December 2014, except for GM Ogden who became a preserved member of the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme on 5 April 2012.
GM Ogdens total benefit as at 31 December 2014 includes deferred revaluation applied to that date.
The value of benefits in the defined benefit pension scheme is based on the increase in accrued pension over the year incorporating an increase for Consumer Prices Index CPI inflation.
GM Ogden became a preserved member of the Scheme as at 5 April 2012 and so did not accrue any additional pension during 2014.
He receives a cash allowance of 44% of basic salary in lieu of this pension benefit, which we have calculated amounted to 90,332 in 2014.
The Pensionable Salary used to calculate benefits in the defined benefit scheme for PI France and JM Davis is restricted to a scheme-specific earnings cap which was 141,000 for 2014.
In consideration of this limitation on their benefits under the scheme they receive a monthly cash sum equal to 22.5% and 18% respectively of their basic salary above the Schemes specific cap.
The figures shown for RH Arnold are in respect of his membership of the Rotork Controls Inc. pension scheme and a supplemental executive retirement plan so that, in aggregate, the pension arrangements for RH Arnold are targeted to provide a pension of at least 60% of uncapped basic salary at age 65.
The valuations of the benefits are affected by movements in the US dollar relative to sterling and are therefore not directly comparable with the directors in the UK scheme.
The accrued pension figures for PI France include a fixed transfer-in pension amount of 5,123 which is payable from his normal retirement date at age 60.
Payments to past directors Audited No payments were made to past directors during the year.
Payments for loss of office Audited No payments for loss of office were made during the year.
