May 2011 Dec 2011 Dec 2012 Dec 2013 Dec 2014 FTSE 350 Mining Index Glencore The UK reporting regulations also require that a TSR performance graph is supported by a table summarising aspects of CEO remuneration, as shown below for the same period as the TSR performance graph: Single figure of Annual variable element Long-term incentive 1 total remuneration award rates against vesting rates against 2 2 US$000 maximum opportunity maximum opportunity 2014 Ivan Glasenberg 1,513 2013 Ivan Glasenberg 1,509 2012 Ivan Glasenberg 1,533 2011 Ivan Glasenberg 1,483 1 The value of benefits and pension provision in the single figure vary as a result of the application of exchange rates although in the relevant local currency Mr Glasenbergs package has not altered since the Companys IPO in May 2011.
In this table the figures are reported in USD, the currency in which Mr Glasenberg received his salary in 2014.
The salary was payable in pounds sterling in the prior years such that those figures have been translated into USD at the exchange rates used for the preparation of the financial statements in those years.
Mr Glasenbergs pension and other benefits are provided to him in Swiss Francs and these amounts are also translated into USD on the same basis.
2 The CEO has elected not to participate in these awards.
Percentage change in pay of Chief Executive Officer 2013 to 2014 The UK Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013, provide for disclosure of percentage changes of the CEOs remuneration against the average percentage change for employees generally or an appropriate group of employees.
Given that the CEO has, since the Companys IPO in May 2011, waived any entitlement to any increase in salary and given that his only other unwaived benefits are those provided to all employees at the Companys head office in Baar no such comparison has been made.
In the event the Executive Director received an increase in salary in future then a suitable disclosure in respect of these regulations will be considered.
