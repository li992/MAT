party Annual report & accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial performance 81 It is the Committees intention to operate the BIP as set out above for the 2015 financial year as stated in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
The Policy also provides the Committee with the following flexibility: The Committee retains discretion in exceptional circumstances to change the performance measures and targets and their respective weightings part way through a performance year if there is a significant and material event which causes the Committee to believe the original measures, weightings and targets are no longer appropriate.
The Committee felt that it was prudent in light of the on-going discussions with a number of interested parties on potential business combinations with bwin.
party to also determine a set of alternative performance conditions for Element B of the BIP 100% and part of Element A 25%.
It was the Committees view that whilst the above flexibility in the Policy would allow them to change the performance measures and targets in exceptional circumstances: it would provide greater clarity and transparency to the Executive Directors to set out some of the potential changes to the performance conditions which might arise as a result of one of these potential business combinations involving bwin.
In addition, the Committee felt that it would protect shareholders interests to have considered some of these potential business combinations in advance and the potential effect on the performance conditions rather than wait until they occur and then consider what if any amendments to the performance conditions were appropriate.
It is the Committees opinion that a number of these potential business combinations involving bwin.
party occurring during the financial year would amount to exceptional circumstances allowing them to consider whether to introduce alternate performance conditions under the shareholder approved Remuneration Policy.
The Committee does not currently envisage a set of circumstances where the Clean EBITDA performance condition for 75% of Element A would not remain relevant.
The maximisation and delivery of the Companys profit targets seem to the Committee to be essential whatever arises.
As these alternate targets are attempting to anticipate potential events which may or may not occur and which may be linked to a possible transaction and the potential value of the Company: the Committee has determined that the nature of these performance conditions and targets are commercially sensitive and any disclosure at this point could have a detrimental impact on the Company and its shareholders.
In circumstances where these alternate performance conditions are used, the Committee will provide full disclosure to shareholders of the nature of the performance conditions, the targets set and their level of satisfaction at the earliest opportunity.

 LLP PwC in London has been retained to provide guidance to the Remuneration Committee on remuneration matters and in particular general practice and developments in executive remuneration.
PwC was appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 2010 following a tender process at which a number of remuneration advisory firms participated.
PwCs performance is evaluated by the Remuneration Committee at least once a year.
During 2014 PwC in France and Italy provided tax advisory and compliance services to the Groups French and Italian subsidiaries.
This work was completely unrelated and segregated from the work performed by PwCs remuneration consultancy business and in the Remuneration Committees judgement did not undermine PwCs independence.
In addition, PwC is a signatory to and follows the provision of the Remuneration Consultants Code.
PwC worked with the Company to implement the Committees policies.
PwCs fees were based on agreed amounts for each of the projects carried out.
The total fees for PwC in relation to advice provided to the Committee during the year being reported on were 64,350.
86 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED G. Impact of the new UK Corporate Governance Code The Committee is comfortable that its Policy is in-line with the new UK Corporate Governance Code applying for financial years beginning on or after 1 October 2014.
The following table sets out the key elements of the revised Code and how the Companys remuneration policy for Executive Directors is in-line with the Governance Code: Code Provision Company Remuneration Policy The BIP contains two Elements: Executive Directors remuneration should be designed to promote Element A provides a rolling deferral in shares and an on-going performance based risk adjustment: and the long-term success of the Company.
Shares earned under Element B cannot be sold for 5 years from the date of award.
It is the Committees view that the BIP provides a holistic approach to ensuring Executive Directors are focused on the long-term success of the Company.
The BIP includes best practice malus and clawback provisions.
The circumstances in which malus and Schemes should include provisions that clawback could apply are as follows: would enable the company to recover sums paid or withhold the payment of discovery of a material mis-statement resulting in an adjustment in the audited consolidated accounts of the Company: any sum, and specify the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to do so.
the assessment of any performance target or condition in respect of an award was based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information: the discovery that any information used to determine the number of shares subject to an award was based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information: action or conduct of an award holder which, in the reasonable opinion of the Board, amounts to employee misbehaviour, fraud or gross misconduct: and events or behaviour of an award holder have led to the censure of the Company by a regulatory authority or have had a significant detrimental impact on the reputation of any Group Company provided that the Board is satisfied that the relevant award holder was responsible for the censure or reputational damage and that the censure or reputational damage is attributable to him.
Malus will apply up to the date of the determination of the award and clawback will apply for 3 years from the date of payment and the vesting of awards.
The Committee is comfortable that the rules of the Plans provide sufficient powers to enforce malus and clawback, if required.
The policy contains the following relevant features: For share-based remuneration, the Remuneration Committee should consider Minimum shareholding requirement for CEO of 500% of salary and for the CFO 200% of salary: requiring directors to hold a minimum number Five-year period from award to sale for Element B of the BIP which continues to apply following cessation of shares and to hold shares for a further period of employment.

party Annual report & accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial performance 87 2014 Remuneration Report For the year ended 31 December 2014, the Groups Policy on remuneration was implemented as set out below.
The amounts relate to the value of the proposed Element B BIP awards to be granted in March 2015 see page 89.
Despite the fact that this is a share award vesting on the third anniversary of grant and the shares only being eligible for sale on the fifth anniversary of grant, the remuneration reporting regulations require the value of this award to be categorised as a bonus.
The basis for this categorisation is that there are no further performance conditions to be satisfied after 2014, the year to which these awards relate.
These awards have been valued using the average share price for the three months ended 31 December 2014 in accordance with the remuneration reporting regulations which was 101.87 pence.
As reported elsewhere in this report, there was no bonus payment for 2014 in respect of Element A of the BIP 2 The amounts shown are the value of the Element B awards under the BIP made on 31 March 2014 at a share price of 122.77 pence 3 The amounts shown are the values of the shares awarded on 1 January 2015 in respect of the final balance of deferred value from BBP contributions in 2011 and 2012 see page 80, no contribution having been earned in 2013.
These awards have been valued using the share price on grant of 101.87 pence 4 The LTIP 2013 values are a part payment of the balance under the BBP in respect of 2013s operation of the Plan and reflect the payment of part of the deferred balance under the Plan B.

In ascertaining the relative importance of each of the six strategic transformational projects, each project was assigned a weighting set out in the table below.
In addition, on-target performance was treated as earning 70% of the maximum contribution, thereby incentivising management to outperform and achieve results above on-target.
Overall the Remuneration Committee concluded that the Executive Directors and senior management team had attained an overall achievement rate of 67.18%.

Despite the fact that this is a share award vesting on the third anniversary of grant and the shares only being eligible for sale on the fifth anniversary of grant, the remuneration reporting regulations require the value of the award to be categorised as a bonus.
There was no cash bonus payment for 2014 under Element A of the BIP.
The maximum opportunity in 2014 was 550% of salary 250% under Element A and 300% under Element B 2 This value represents the Element B BIP award made in respect of 2013.
See note above for recognition timing.
There was no cash bonus payment for 2013 under the BBP.
The maximum opportunity in 2013 was 600% of salary 300% under the BBP and 300% under Element B of the BIP 3 The Company operated the BBP and Value Creation Plan in 2013 and 2012.
The BBP was subject to an annual assessment of performance and therefore, to the extent anything was earned during the year, the total value was accounted for in the Annual bonus pay out column.
Whilst technically part of any value earned under the BBP in the years of operation was deferred and at risk of forfeiture, the Remuneration Committee believes it would be confusing and potentially misleading to show part of the BBP value in the Long-term incentive column in 2013 and 2012.
The Company also operated the Value Creation Plan, which was uncapped, however, the performance conditions were not met and therefore no awards were granted 92 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED I.
Percentage change in remuneration of CEO and average Group employee The following table sets out the percentage changes between 2014 and 2013 in respect of certain aspects of the remuneration of the CEO and an average of the Groups other employees.
Role Salary Change % Benefits % Short-term incentives % CEO 0 0 0 Average employee 3.2 0 -23.0 Note: The CEO did not receive any short-term incentive payment in 2014 or 2013.
The average employee did receive a reduced short-term incentive payment in 2014 as compared with 2013.
It should be noted that for this purpose the Committee does not view the awards made to the Executive Directors under Element B of the BIP as comparable to a cash bonus paid to employees.
Element B awards may technically under the remuneration disclosure regulations be counted as bonus for the single figure of remuneration: however, in practice the shares awarded do not vest for three years and cannot be sold for a further five years.
Relative importance of spend on remuneration and other distributions The following table sets out the total amount spent in 2014 and 2013 on remuneration of the Groups employees and major distributions.

The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that given the commercial sensitivity arising in relation to the detailed financial, operational and strategic targets used for the BIP, disclosing precise targets for the BIP in advance would not be in shareholder interests.
This avoids the risk of the Company inadvertently providing a profit forecast because profit targets are linked to budgets and giving international competitors an unfair advantage because they are not required to report to the same disclosure standard as a UK listed company.
Actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the performance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs under the BIP.
