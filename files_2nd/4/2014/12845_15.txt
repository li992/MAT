40 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Review Report of the Directors Accounts Report on Directors Remuneration Chairmans Statement Introduction On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our 2014 Report on Directors Remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for overseeing the remuneration of the Executive Directors and Chairman.
It is also responsible for the operation of senior management incentive schemes throughout theGroup.
Following the introduction of new Government regulations the report is now divided into twosections: the Directors Remuneration Policy pages 42 to 49 which contains details of our remuneration policy:and the Annual Report on Remuneration pages 50 to 56 which sets out how we implemented our remuneration policy for the year ended 31May 2014 and how we intend to implement it during the year ending 31 May2015.
Both sections will be presented for shareholder approval at our Annual General Meeting on 23 September2014: the Directors Remuneration Policy will be put to a binding shareholder vote:and the Annual Report on Remuneration will be put to an advisory shareholdervote.
Our approach to remuneration for Executives The principal aim of our remuneration policy is to drive the generation of long-term sustainable shareholder value by aligning the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders.
We are committed to rewarding our executives fairly based on their role, performance and contribution to the business.
We also seek, when designing incentive structures, to set challenging targets and reward sustainable performance while avoiding inadvertently encouraging risky or .
Remuneration earned in 2013 14 The Group delivered a strong set of results in 2013 14 with profit before tax and exceptional items of 115 million, 7% ahead of the prior year, despite a significant weakening in currencies which impacted profits by around 12 million.
The Group also performed strongly in respect of the operational efficiency targets established at the beginning of the year and made excellent progress on other non-financial aspects important to the delivery of our longer-term strategic objectives the reorganisation of the Group structure, entry into new export markets and Corporate Social Responsibility CSR performance.
Key aspects of remuneration earned during the year were: 4% salary increases Salaries for the Executive Directors were increased by 4% in 2013 14.
These increases were within the range ofsalary increases provided to other employees elsewhere in the PZ CussonsGroup.
Bonus pay-out of 78% of base salary In 2013 14 we continued to focus the on-target element of the annual bonus on performance against three key financial indicators: profit before tax and exceptional items, net working capital and operating contribution margin.
We focussed part of the stretch element of the bonus against the delivery of non-financial strategic and CSR targets and the remainder against profit before tax and exceptional items.
Strong performance was delivered against all three financial measures.
In addition, the non-financial strategic and CSR stretch objectives were largely achieved.
As a result, the Executive Directors qualified for bonus payments equivalent to 78% of their salaries in respect of theyear.
Long-term incentives No long-term incentives vested in the year Changes in 2014 15 I signalled in last years report that this year the Remuneration Committee would be undertaking a comprehensive review of our executive remuneration policies for the first time in a number of years.
The aim of this process has been to develop a long-term remuneration policy for our executive directors that will help to drive the Groups business strategy and will endure for at least the intended three-year life of the policy.
The review included a benchmarking analysis, a review of the operation of our incentive plans and a discussion of market developments and current best practiceapproaches.
Following this process and consultation with our leading shareholders, we are proposing certain changes to our executive : Increased incentive opportunities subject to increased deferral and new malus provisions Since our last review in 2011 the scope of individual Executive Directors roles has increased and maximum annual bonus and long-term incentive opportunities have fallen behind market levels for senior executives leading companies of similar size and complexity.
The Committee also recognises that over this time investor expectations have moved on in terms of the structure of incentive pay, withbonus deferral, longer time horizons and malus provisions becoming increasingly common.
In this context and with the need to set along-term remuneration policy that will endure for several years, we feel that now is the right time to move closer to market norms both in terms of incentive opportunity and best practice features.
For the year ending 31 May 2015 therefore, the Committee is planning to increase the maximum annual bonus opportunity from 100% to 150% of salary for the CEO and to 125% of salary for other executives.
Any annual bonus award in excess of 100% of salary will be deferred into Company shares for three years with vesting subject both to new malus provisions and to continued employment.
41 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Review Report of the Directors Accounts We also intend to seek shareholder approval at our 2014 Annual General Meeting for a new Performance Share Plan to replace our existing long-term incentive plan.
This will allow us to make regular awards of shares worth 150% of salary we are currently permitted to make such awards only in exceptional circumstances.
Other changes will include the introduction of new malus provisions and compulsory holding periods.
Amendment of the annual bonus plan We concluded that, whilst the future annual bonus structure should continue to recognise theimportance of profit before tax, it should also provide a more effective incentive to deliver other financial targets that are important to the Groups successes and non-financial measures that are important to the delivery of our longer-term strategic goals.
For the year ending 31 May 2015, the Committee has again set challenging net working capital, operating contribution margin and non-financial targets.
The net working capital and operating contribution margin targets will operate on a sliding scalebasis.
Salary increases The Committee has decided, with effect from 1 September 2014, to increase the base salaries of the Executive Directors by 5% in the case of the CEO and by 4% in the case of the other Executive Directors.
These increases are based on individual performance and are in line with the range of salary increases being awarded to the Groups wider UK-based employee population.
I will be retiring from the Board at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting following the expiry of my term of office.
It has been aprivilege to serve on the Board and on this Committee.
I am delighted that the Board has appointed my fellow Non-executive Director, HelenOwers, who has served on the Committee since 2012, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in myplace.
I hope you will find the Report on Directors Remuneration clear, transparent and informative.
As always, we remain committed to ongoing dialogue with our shareholders.
We have given careful consideration to the feedback received during our consultation process with leading shareholders in defining the proposals we are putting to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
We welcome your views and your votes in support of the proposedchanges.

46 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Review Report of the Directors Accounts Report on Directors Remuneration continued Directors Remuneration Policy continued Share-based awards Share-based awards will operate in accordance with the share plan rules governing them adopted by the Board.
Under these rules, theCommittee has discretion in the followingareas: awards may be granted in the form of conditional share awards, nil-cost options or other arrangements having the same economiceffect: awards may incorporate the right to receive in cash or shares the value of dividends on the number of shares that vest under an award in respect of record dates between grant and vesting of awards, which may assume the reinvestment of these dividends in the Companys shares on a cumulativebasis: in the event of a variation of the Companys share capital, demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event which, in the Committees opinion, may affect the value of the Companys shares, the terms of awards may beadjusted: awards may be settled incash: the plan rules allow for the terms of awards to be amended in accordance with the rules at the Committees discretion:and any performance condition applicable to PSP awards may be amended if an event occurs which in the case of awards granted prior to September 2014 reasonably causes the Committee to consider it appropriate, provided that, in the Committees opinion, the amended condition is not materially less difficult to satisfy or in the case of awards granted on or after September 2014 causes the Committee to consider it is no longer appropriate, in which case it may amend or vary the condition in such manner as it determines is reasonable and produces a measure of performance which is more appropriate and materially no easier tosatisfy.
Legacy awards The Remuneration Committee may make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office where the terms of the payment wereagreed: i before the policy came into effect: or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not inconsideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes the term payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Committees discretion includes discretion to determine, in accordance with the rules of the PSP, the extent to which awards under that plan may vest in the event of a change of control or in a good leaver circumstance.
Prior to the adoption by the Company of the PSP in 2008, Executive Directors and certain other senior executives were generally eligible for the grant of options under the PZ Cussons Plc Executive Share Option Scheme.
There have been no grants of options under the Executive Share Option Scheme since the introduction of the Performance Share Plan and it is not expected that any further awards will be made under this scheme but certain options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme have vested and remain capable ofexercise.
The Committee may make minor changes to this policy, which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid in its operation or implementation, taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek shareholderapproval.
Setting Executive Director remuneration When considering how to position the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors, the Committee considers market data from UKlisted companies of a similar size and complexity.
The Committee also receives and takes into account information from the Global HR Director on pay and employment conditions applying to other Group employees when setting Executive Directors remuneration, consistent with the Groups general aim of seeking to reward allemployees fairly according to the nature of their role, their performance and marketforces.
In designing an appropriate incentive structure for the Executive Directors and other senior management, the Committee seeks to set challenging performance criteria which are aligned with the Groups business strategy and the generation of sustained shareholder value.
The Committee is also mindful of the need to avoid inadvertently encouraging risky or irresponsible behaviour including behaviour which could raise environmental, social or governanceissues.
Balance of fixed versus variable remuneration The Committee believes that an appropriate proportion of the executive remuneration package should be variable and performance-related in order to encourage and reward superior corporate and individual performance.
The following charts illustrate executive remuneration inspecific performance scenarios.
For share-based awards no share price growth or dividend payments have been included.

To facilitate the hiring of candidates of the appropriate calibre required, the Committee may make an award to buy-out variable remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors including the form of award, any performance conditions and the time over which the award would have vested.
Recruitment awards will normally be liable to forfeiture or clawback on early departure.
For Executive Directors, early departure is defined as being within the firsttwo years ofemployment.
The maximum level of variable pay which may be awarded to new Executive Directors excluding buy-out arrangements in respect of theirrecruitment will be in line with the maximum level of variable pay that may be awarded under the annual bonus plan and performance share plan, a total face value opportunity of 300% of salary.
The Committee will ensure that such awards are linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance measures and will be forfeited if performance or continued employment conditions are not met.
Appropriate costs and support will be covered if the recruitment requires relocation of theindividual.
Executive Director contracts and loss of office payments Executive Directors have one-year rolling service contracts and no Executive Director has a notice period in excess of one year or containing any provision for pre-determined compensation on termination exceeding one-years salary and benefits inkind.
Upon the termination of an Executive Directors employment, the Committees approach to determining any payment for loss of office will normally be guided by the followingprinciples: The Committee shall seek to find an outcome which is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders as a whole, taking into account the .
Relevant contractual obligations, as set out above, shall be observed or taken into account.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith to satisfy an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of any such obligation or to settle or compromise any claim or costs arising in connection with the employment of an Executive Director or its termination.
The treatment of outstanding variable remuneration shall be as determined by the relevant plan rules, as set outoverleaf.

The Committee may in the circumstances referred to above determine to what extent any bonus should be paid in respect of the financial year in which the relevant event takes place, taking into account of the extent to which the Committee determines the relevant performance metrics have been or would have been met.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company When reviewing and setting Executive Director remuneration, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of all employees of the Group.
The Group-wide pay review budget is one of the key factors when reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors.
Although the Group has not carried out a formal employee consultation regarding Board remuneration, it does comply with local regulations and practices regarding employee consultation more broadly.

Messrs Kanellis and Leigh each elected, with the permission of the Committee, to receive instead a salary supplement equivalent to 20% of base salary: these amounts are included in the column headed Pension.
Mr Davis continues to participate in the defined contribution pension arrangement but as the amount of Company contributions was less than 20% of his salary, the difference between those contributions and 20% of his base salary was paid as a salary supplement.
Both the pensioncontributions and the salary supplement are included in the column headed Pension.

7 Mr Heale retired from the Board on 31 December 2013.
8 Mr Lewis retired from the Board on 19 September 2012.
9 Mrs Silver was appointed to the Board on 1 April 2014 with an annual fee of 52,500.
Individual elements of remuneration Base salary Base salaries for individual Executive Directors are reviewed annually, with effect from 1 September, by the Remuneration Committee and are set with reference to the scope of the role and the markets in which PZ Cussons operates, the performance and experience oftheindividual, pay levels in other organisations of a similar size and complexity and pay increases elsewhere in theGroup.
From 1 September 2014 the base salary of Mr Kanellis will increase by 5% and the base salaries of Messrs Davis and Leigh will increase by 4%, each within the range of salary increases across the Group.
The base salaries for the year ended 31 May 2013 and for the year ended 31 May 2014 are as set outbelow: 1 September 1 September 2013 2014 Increase Base salary Base salary % G A Kanellis 524,160 550,400 5% C G Davis 333,060 346,400 4% B H Leigh 327,600 340,700 4% 51 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Review Report of the Directors Accounts Non-executive Director fees With effect from 1 June 2013, the annual fees payable to Mr Steel and Mr Arnold were increased in each case by 5,000 to 57,500 to reflect their chairmanships of the Remuneration and Audit Committees respectively.
There were no changes in the fees payable to any of the other Non-executive Directors during the year.
Annual bonus In respect of the year ended 31 May 2014, each of the Executive Directors participated in the Senior Executive Annual Bonus Scheme.
Under this scheme, each was eligible to earn a cash bonus of up to 100% of base salary.
The on-target element of the annual bonus representing 60% of maximum opportunity was dependent upon the achievement of profit before taxation, net working capital and operating contribution margin targets.
The latter two elements were only achievable once target profit had been achieved and then on an all or nothing basis.
Subject to achieving target profit levels, the stretch element of the annual bonus representing 40% of maximum opportunity was split equally between the achievement of additional profit before taxation and the delivery of certain non-financial strategic and CSR stretch objectives.
All targets and bonus levels were established by the Committee at the beginning of theyear.
As set out below, Group performance has been strong against all three financial measures and, whilst the stretch profit before taxation targets were not attained, the non-financial strategic and CSR stretch objectives were largely achieved.
As a result, the Executive Directors qualified for total bonus payments equivalent to 78% of their base salaries in respect of the year.
The Directors consider that the Groups bonus targets are commercially sensitive: they could provide our competitors with insights into our business plans and expectations and should therefore remain confidential to the Company.
However, the following table sets out the bonus payout to the Executive Directors for the year ended 31 May 2014 in respect of each of the measures inplace.

2015 annual bonus framework Executive Directors will continue to participate in the Senior Executive Annual Bonus Scheme in respect of the year ending 31 May 2015.
However, following a review of remuneration during 2014, changes have been made to the operation of the scheme to increase the level of opportunity available, enhance its effectiveness and improve its alignment with the Groups strategic priorities and current marketpractice: maximum opportunity has been raised from 100% of salary to 150% of salary for the CEO and 125% of salary for the CFO and COO.
Thisreflects in part the growth of PZ Cussons and in part the expanded scope of individual executive roles since the last review in2011: any bonus awards earned in excess of 100% of base salary will be deferred into Company shares vesting three years after the award is determined, subject to malus provisions and continued employment.
The malus provisions will allow the Committee to reduce or cancel awards prior to vesting in the event of material misstatement, fraud or serious reputationaldamage: the target award will remain at 60% of maximum opportunity.
Annual bonuses will again be based on the achievement of stretching profit before tax, net working capital and operating contribution margin performance targets.
However, the latter two elements will operate on a sliding scale once a minimum financial performance gateway of 90% of target profit before tax has been achieved in order to provide greater incentive to achieve these financialtargets: 16% of maximum opportunity will be available for delivering non-financial objectives subject to achieving the same 90% profit before tax threshold as above:and 24% of maximum opportunity will be available for delivery of a profit before tax stretchtarget.

Awards vesting during the year ended 31 May 2014 The year ended 31 May 2014 represented the final year of the three-year performance period for awards made under the Performance Share Plan in 2011.
Despite delivering strong results this year, the overall performance during the three years was such that the minimum performance threshold was not met.
As a result, none of the awards made to the Executive Directors in 2011 will vest and these awards willnowlapse.

These awards are subject to adjusted earnings per share growth targets measured over the single three year performance period commencing on 1 June 2013.
No proportion of the awards may vest unless the Groups adjusted earnings per share grow by at least 6% per annum compounded over the relevant performance period.
25% of the award will vest where adjusted earnings per share grow by 6% per annum rising on a straight line pro rata basis to 100% vesting where adjusted earnings per share grow by 12% per annum or more, in each case compounded over the performanceperiod.

Awards to be granted in the year ended 31 May 2015 The Committee intends to make awards to Executive Directors during the year ending 31 May 2015.
In line with the Companys Directors Remuneration Policy, as set out on pages 42 to 49, and subject to shareholder approval of the PZ Cussons Plc Performance Share Plan 2014, it is proposed to make awards to the Executive Directors under the new plan over shares with a value equal to 150% of base salary.
The Committee expects the awards to continue to be based on growth in adjusted earnings per share and to be subject to attainment of thesame adjusted earnings per share growth targets as applied to awards made in the year ended 31 May 2014.
The Committee did consider whether to apply additional or alternative performance measures.
However, the Committee continues to believe that growth in adjusted earnings per share remains the most appropriate measure for the Group, being an important indicator of the Groups underlying financial performance and providing a clear line of sight for executives between their performance and potentialreward.
In line with the Companys Directors Remuneration Policy for future awards, any awards earned in excess of 100% of salary on grant willvest not at the end of the three-year performance period but in equal amounts four years and five years after the date of grant.
Legacy arrangements Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme Prior to the introduction of the Senior Executive Annual Bonus Scheme on 1 June 2010, the Executive Directors had participated in theDeferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme.
Under that earlier scheme, awards of deferred shares were made to the Executive Directors following the attainment of pre-determined annual financial targets.
