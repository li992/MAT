Less than 70 per cent of target 0 per cent It was subject to two performance conditions.
The primary measure was operating profit 70 per cent to 80 per cent of target 0 per cent to 80 per cent vesting before transformation costs: straight-line sliding scale 80 per cent to 100 per cent of target 80 per cent to 100 per cent vesting straight-line sliding scale 100 per cent of 120 per cent of target 100 per cent to 140 per cent vesting straight-line sliding scale More than 120 per cent of target 140 per cent vesting i. e. maximum 98 per cent of salary The secondary measure was a downwards only adjustment, based on return on total assets ROTA targets.
If ROTA was greater than 90percent of target, there was no adjustment.
If ROTA was between 75 per cent of target and 90 per cent of target there was a 50percent reduction in the level of pay out.
If ROTA was less than 75 per cent of target, then there was no pay out.
The operating profit before transformation target was 528 million and the ROTA target was 17.0 per cent.
Actual operating profit before 12 transformation for 2013-14 was 670million and ROTA was 24.3 per cent.
Accordingly, the total percentage of LTIP awards for 2013-14 vesting was 140 per cent equivalent to 98percent of salary.
This resulted in the following cash awards to the Executive Directors: Moya Greene, 488,040: Matthew Lester, 419,440: Mark Higson, 419,832.
