48 Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Directors Remuneration Report As Chair of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to present our Directors Remuneration Report for the 53 weeks ended 3 January 2015 Performance in 2014 and incentive payments The Company performed very well against its financial targets as described in the Financial Review on pages 20 and 21.
Against the targets set at the beginning of the year, profit and sales performance resulted in 100 per cent of the maximum potential being payable under these elements of the bonus scheme.
There was an equally strong performance with regards to the strategic objectives that were set.
Our step change programme continues in line with expectation with savings being realised: the implementation of our new IT systems platform has made good progress with key projects delivering significant returns in 2014 and our return on investment in our refit shops delivered significantly above target.
Accordingly there is also a 100 per cent bonus payment against the strategic element.
Overall, annual bonuses representing 125 per cent and 90 per cent of salary will be payable to the Chief Executive and other Annual statement Executive Directors respectively.
The Committee is satisfied that As Chair of the Remuneration Committee and on behalf of your this level of bonus reflects the exceptional financial and strategic Board, I am pleased to present our Directors Remuneration performance during the year.

assumed a threshold vesting under the TSR element, which is reflective of the current level of performance.
Our annual bonus provides a strong link to the operational delivery of the business strategy.
The Performance Share Plan focuses the Executive Directors on the longer-term outputs of that strategy, by rewarding sustained improvements in earnings per share and long-term return on capital employed.
As outlined in the Chairmans Statement and Chief Executives Report, we have had a year of outstanding performance, leading to record-breaking profits.
Despite only being in year one of our change programme these results are very encouraging.
Although 2015 will be a year of further change, we have started the year well and I believe this remuneration policy will support the business in delivering continued progress and good financial results.

Other Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding of 100 per cent of their respective base salaries within a five-year period.
This is achieved through vested awards granted via the PSP and deferred bonus shares.
Executive Share Option Scheme The Committee is responsible for overseeing the operation of all the share-based incentives deployed in the Company.
The 2014 Company Share Option Plan and the 2014 Executive Share Option Scheme were approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
Choice of performance measures and approach to target setting The annual bonus is based on performance against a range of financial and strategic performance measures.
This range of metrics measures achievement of the Companys key operational objectives.
The Committee reviews the Key Performance Indicators KPI each year and varies them as appropriate to reflect the priorities for the business in the year ahead.
A sliding scale of targets is set for each KPI to encourage continuous improvement, or sustained high levels of performance.
The PSP is based on an equal split of EPS and ROCE performance.
EPS, which is a direct measure of profit performance, is our primary long-term KPI.
ROCE is considered to be particularly relevant at the current time as this will focus Executives on re-deploying capital efficiently through the planned investment programme, whilst continuing to create returns well above the WACC.
The relative mix of the performance measures may be altered for future awards.
A sliding scale of challenging performance targets is set for each measure.
The Committee will review the choice of performance measures and the appropriateness of the performance targets prior to each PSP award.
The Committee has discretion to set different targets for future awards.
The targets for awards granted under this remuneration policy are set out for shareholder approval in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Policy discretion The Committee will operate incentive plans in accordance with their respective rules, the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plan rules.
These include but are not limited to the following: who participates: the timing of the grant of award and or payment: the size of an award up to plan policy limits and or a payment: the result indicated by the relative TSR performance condition may be scaled back potentially to zero in the event that the Committee considers that financial performance has been unsatisfactory and or the outcome has been distorted due to the TSR for the Company or any comparator company being considered abnormal: discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction: determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes and the treatment of leavers: adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends : and the ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous Remuneration Reports.
Details of any of these payments to former Directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.
Non-Executive Directors In order to ensure that no Director is involved in deciding his her own remuneration, the fees payable to Non-Executive Directors are set, after consultation with the Chairman, by a committee of the Board consisting only of the Executive Directors.
The fees payable to the Chairman are set by the Remuneration Committee.
These fees are reviewed and set annually in December and implemented from 1 January.

There is no prescribed quality and experienced maximum.
Chairman and Non-Executive Chairman Non-Executives Directors are paid a basic fee and the Chairman of the Main Directors fees and Directors.
Board Committees and the Senior Independent Director SID are paid an additional fee to reflect their additional responsibilities.
Where the SID role is combined with that of chairing a Committee then only one fee is paid.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for pension scheme membership, bonus or incentive arrangements.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed subject to the Companys articles of association, retiring and seeking election at the first AGM after appointment.
Thereafter, every Director will be subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
The Nominations Committee advises the Board as to whether Directors should be nominated for re-election.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to compensation for early termination of their appointments prior to the date on which they would next be due to offer themselves for election or re-election, or if not re-appointed at such time.
The following table shows the effective date of appointment for each Non-Executive Director: Non-Executive Director Original date of appointment Ian Durant 5 October 2011 Allison Kirkby 30 January 2013 Helena Ganczakowski 2 January 2014 Peter McPhillips 10 March 2014 Sandra Turner 1 May 2014 Non-Executive Directors are appointed on an understanding that the appointment will last for six years, but without any commitment by either party.
Difference in remuneration policy across the Group The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is designed having regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole.
There are differences in salary levels and in the levels of potential reward depending upon seniority and responsibility, although a key reference point for executive salary increases is the average increase across the general workforce.
A higher proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration package is delivered through performance-related pay and in share-based form, which provide a good link to long-term Company performance.
All employees, with one years service or more, may participate in the SAYE schemes and in the Share Incentive Plan SIP that are run annually.
Under the SAYE scheme, at the end of a three-year saving period, employees can buy Greggs shares at a discounted rate.
With the SIP, all employees may purchase Company shares from pre-tax salary subject to HMRC limits.
After six months service all employees are eligible to participate in the profit sharing scheme in which all employees share 10 per cent of our profits.
The Committee does not currently consult with employees on Directors pay policy, although the Committee will keep this under review.
Policy on recruitment remuneration The Committee will aim to set a new Executive Directors remuneration package in line with the Companys approved policy at the time of appointment.
The Committee will take into account, in arriving at a total package and in considering the quantum for each element of the package, the skills and experience of the candidate, the market rate for a candidate of that experience as well as the importance of securing the best available candidate.
Annual bonus and PSP awards will not exceed the policy maxima not including any arrangements to replace forfeited deferred pay.
Participation in the annual bonus plan and PSP will normally be pro-rated for the year of joining.
The Committee may make one-off additional cash and or share-based awards as it deems appropriate, and if the circumstances so demand to take account of deferred pay forfeited by an Executive on leaving a previous employer.
Awards to replace deferred pay forfeited would, where possible, reflect the nature of awards forfeited in terms of delivery mechanism cash or shares, time horizons, attributed expected value and performance conditions.
Other payments may be made in relation to relocation expenses and other incidental expenses as appropriate.
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according to its terms and any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment would continue.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy at that time.
Strategic Report Directors Report Accounts Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 53 Service contracts and policy on cessation Executive Directors service contracts contain the following remuneration-related aspects: Provision Detailed terms salary, pension and benefits: Remuneration company car or cash allowance: private medical health care for the Director: permanent health insurance: participation in annual bonus and profit share subject to scheme rules : participation in long-term incentive schemes or similar arrangements subject to scheme rules : and life assurance.
Chief Executives contract is terminable on 12 months notice served by either the Company or the Director: Notice period other Executive Directors service contracts are terminable on 12 months notice served by the Company or by six months notice served by the Director: and any future Executive Directors service contracts will be terminable on 12 months notice served by either party.
Termination payment payment in lieu of notice equal to any unexpired notice of termination given by either party: and payment in lieu shall not include: any bonus payment: any payment in respect of benefits which the Director would have been entitled to receive: and any payment in respect of any holiday entitlement that would have accrued during the period for which the payment in lieu is made.
Details of the circumstances in which the Committee has the ability to exercise discretion with regards to termination payments are set out below.
The Companys policy is that current Executive Directors service contracts do not have a specific duration but may be terminated with 12 months notice from the Company and six months notice from the Executive Director.
Any future Executive Directors service contracts will be terminable on 12 months notice served by either party.
Under their service contracts the Executive Directors are entitled to salary, pension contributions and benefits for their notice period save where a payment in lieu is to be made.
The Company would seek to ensure that any payment is mitigated by use of phased payments and offset against earnings elsewhere in the event that an Executive Director finds alternative employment during his notice period.
There are no contractual provisions in force other than those set out above that impact any termination payment.
Areas where the Committee can exercise discretion with regards to termination payments: annual bonus may be payable pro-rated for that part of the year worked: any unvested awards held under the deferred annual bonus will normally lapse at cessation unless the individual is leaving for certain reasons defined under the plan as death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement, his office or employment being with either a company which ceases to be a Group member or relating to a business or part of a business which is transferred to a person who is not a Group member, a change of control or any other reason the Committee so decides.
In these circumstances unvested awards will normally vest at the cessation unless the Committee decides they should vest at the normal vesting date : any unvested awards held under the PSP will lapse at cessation, unless the individual is leaving in the circumstances set out above for the deferred annual bonus.
In these circumstances, unvested awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date unless the Committee decides they should vest at cessation subject to performance conditions being met and scaling back in respect of actual service as a proportion of the total vesting period unless the Committee decides that scaling back is inappropriate : and the Committee may agree to payment of disbursements such as legal costs and outplacement services if appropriate and depending on the circumstances of cessation.
The table below sets out the details of the Executive Directors service contracts: Director Date of contract Roger Whiteside 4 February 2013 Raymond Reynolds 18 December 2006 Richard Hutton 7 April 2006 The service contracts are available for inspection during normal business hours at the Companys registered office, and are available for inspection at the AGM.

This feedback is then considered as part of the Companys annual review of remuneration policy.
The Committee engages pro-actively with shareholders, and takes their views seriously.
When any material changes are made to the remuneration policy, the Committee Chair will inform major shareholders of these in advance, and will offer to attend a meeting with those shareholders to discuss any concerns they may have.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years Remuneration Report during the year are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
External appointments Executive Directors may take up one Non-Executive Directorship outside of the Company subject to the Boards approval and provided that such an appointment is not likely to lead to a conflict of interest.
It is recognised that this can support a Directors development and enhance experience as well as benefit the Company.
Executive Directors will be entitled to retain the fees of such an appointment.
Annual Report on Remuneration Implementation of our policy in 2015 The section below summarises the implementation of our Remuneration Policy for 2015.
Base salaries The annual base salaries for the Executive Directors are: Salary as at Salary as at 1 January 1 January Director 2014 2015 % Increase Roger Whiteside 495,300 507,187 2.4% Richard Hutton 282,944 289,734 2.4% Raymond Reynolds 252,472 258,531 2.4% Pension contribution The pension contribution rates are: Roger Whiteside 22.5% cash in lieu Raymond Reynolds 14% cash in lieu Richard Hutton 13% Annual bonus For 2015 the performance conditions will provide a strong link between bonus payments and our business strategy.
Bonus metrics Profit Sales Strategic Objectives 50 per cent of total 20 per cent of total 30 per cent of total This will be based on meeting and exceeding Based on own shop like-for-like sales Detailed below budget for the year excluding any additional shops opened during the bonus year The strategic objectives for each bonus cycle will be based on measures which will provide a strong link to future value creation.
For the 2015 bonus the two strategic objectives, relating to 30 per cent of the bonus opportunity, will be: i 10 per cent based on the successful execution of the 2015 shop refit programme measured by refit cash return on investment: and ii 20 per cent based on cost savings achieved through combined operational efficiencies and the process and systems change project.
Sliding scales will be set where possible.
There will be an underpin to the sales and strategic objectives elements of the bonus whereby any payment under these elements may be scaled back potentially to zero at the discretion of the Committee, in the event that the profit performance for the year is judged to be running significantly below that required for the achievement of the long-term strategy.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include items which the Committee considers to be commercially sensitive.
Retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be made in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
56 Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Directors Remuneration Report continued 2015 PSP Award Performance conditions will be based on an equal split of two different financial measures, EPS and ROCE for discrete parts of an award.
Targets have been set for each metric which reflect the strategic plan and business outlook over the performance period.
Both the EPS and ROCE ranges have been increased for 2015 to ensure that they remain appropriately stretching, without encouraging undue risk taking.
For 2015 awards the Committee has considered the Companys business plan and the target ranges will be as follows: The EPS performance condition will require average annual growth of RPI 1 per cent to 7 per cent over three years from the 2014 financial year end.
The ROCE condition will require average annual ROCE over the three-year performance period 2015, 2016 and 2017 to be in the range 19.0 per cent to 21.5 per cent.
In both cases 25 per cent of an award will vest on achieving threshold performance and thereafter straight-line sliding scales will apply until stretch performance is achieved.
In order to improve alignment of interest between Executives and shareholders further, a holding period will be attached to vested PSP awards granted in the policy period, requiring the vested shares to be held net of tax for a further two years.
EPS and ROCE are measured excluding exceptional items.
Non-Executive Directors fees The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the fee level for the Chairman, as planned following his appointment.
Following this review the Chairmans fee for 2015 has been increased from 131,405 to 155,000.
This is considered to be broadly a mid-market level of fee and recognises the strong performance of the business and the Chairmans strong contribution since joining.
The Non-Executive Directors are paid an annual base fee which is currently 41,231 and additional responsibility fees of 6,130 for the role of Senior Independent Director SID or for chairing a Board Committee.
Where the SID role is combined with the role of chairing a Committee then only one fee of 47,361 will be paid.
Details of the fees being paid to Non-Executive Directors in 2015 are set out below: Ian Durant 155,000 Chairman Allison Kirkby 47,361 Chair of the Audit Committee Helena Ganczakowski 41,231 Non-Executive Director Peter McPhillips 41,231 Non-Executive Director Sandra Turner 47,361 SID & Chair of the Remuneration Committee Remuneration payable for 2014 for each Executive Director Audited The following table presents the remuneration payable for 2014 showing the equivalent figures for 2013 for the Executive Directors.

3 Includes salary paid in lieu of pension contributions.
4 Following further review of the legislation regarding preparation of this report it was identified that the value of the shares awarded to Roger Whiteside on appointment should be recognised at the time of grant rather than on exercise as the only condition relates to service.
As a result the 2013 figure has been increased by 284,100.
Should the service condition not be met the charge would be reversed in this table in a future year.
