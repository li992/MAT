However, the Remuneration Committee maintains the discretion to make adjustments to the measure if this is considered to be appropriate.
Any adjustments will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

Summary of Shareholder voting at the 2014 AGm The following table shows the results of the resolutions regarding remuneration at the 2014 AGM: Votes Votes for For % Votes against Against % Total withheld Approve the Directors Remuneration Policy 406,176,557 80.15% 100,609,327 19.85% 506,785,884 13,393,177 Approve the 2013 Directors Remuneration Report 296,189,941 68.54% 135,982,036 31.46% 432,171,977 86,005,715 The level of support for the Remuneration Policy was broadly similar to that received at the 2013 AGM in respect of the advisory vote on the Remuneration Report 81.77%.
However, the Committee was disappointed with the level of votes in favour of the 2013 Directors Remuneration Report.
Having had discussions with Shareholders, the Committee understands that the main reason for the relatively low level of support was due to the lack of disclosure of the annual bonus targets in the context of the maximum payout in respect of 2013.
Following consultation with Shareholders, we have enhanced the level of our disclosure in this years Report, including the bonus outcomes for 2014, as can be seen on page 55.
We are grateful for the feedback from our Shareholders and trust that you find this a clear and comprehensive Report that clearly articulates RBs link between pay and performance.
In addition, the Committee has had ongoing dialogue with Shareholders over a number of years regarding our remuneration structure.
The Committee believes our existing incentive arrangements are simple, reinforce our remuneration principles and align executives closely with the interests of our Shareholders.
The requirement for Senior Executives to build up significant shareholdings in the Company further supports our policy of executive alignment with Shareholders interests.
The Committee will continue to review the incentive arrangements in the lead up to the next vote of the Policy Report at the 2017 AGM.
