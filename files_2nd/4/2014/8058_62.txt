Indivior Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 59 Corporate Governance and Remuneration Directors Remuneration Report Performance related annual bonus In line with Indiviors remuneration policy going forward, for 2015 the CEO and CFO will have a maximum bonus opportunity of 2x and 1.2x of salary respectively, with 1x of salary paid for on-target performance for the CEO and 0.6x of salary for the CFO.
The annual bonus for 2015 will be based on the following measures and weightings: Measure Weighting Net revenue 1 3 EBIT 1 3 Pipeline milestones 1 3 As an additional underpin, if the Company violates its debt covenants, no award will be received in respect of the EBIT portion of the annual bonus.
We have not disclosed the actual performance targets for 2015 as we consider them to be commercially sensitive.
However, we commit to disclosing the financial targets retrospectively in the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ending December 2015.
In respect of the pipeline milestones, these are strategic milestones that span all R&D pipeline projects and are based on objective measures that are expected to be achieved in the calendar year, such as: Patient enrolment randomization in clinical studies Completion of Clinical Study Reports Completion of required briefing packages and meetings with regulatory agencies e. g. pre-IND meetings, IND submissions, Type B and C meetings, pre-NDA meetings.
Achievement of these key milestones by the stated date is critical to move our R&D pipleline projects towards regulatory submission and approval dates that are aligned with the strategic plan.
Indivior LTIP In line with Indiviors remuneration policy going forward, the CEO and CFO will be eligible to receive awards, subject to a three-year performance period, of 3x and 2.5x of base salary respectively at target.
Both directors can receive up to 2x of the target award at maximum for achieving stretching targets.
The LTIP award granted in 2015 will be based on the following performance measures: Measure Weighting Absolute TSR 50% Key pipeline strategy milestones 50% The pipeline milestones are tied to the achievement of certain key mid-to long-term R&D pipeline advancement milestones.
These strategic milestones also span multiple R&D projects that are based on two key objective measures that are expected to be achieved during the three-year performance period.
These two key metrics are: Submission of applications to regulatory bodies e. g. NDA MAA submission to FDA CFDA EMA : and Regulatory approval of these submissions.
For the initial performance period 2015 2017 and aligned with the strategic plan, it is anticipated that achievement of these targets will help lead to both long-term market growth in the US and geographic expansion outside the US, which are both key drivers for the future success of the Company and creating long-term Shareholder value.
The actual targets relating to the pipeline milestones will not be disclosed prospectively as the Committee believes that these details are commercially sensitive.
The milestones are integral to the development of the business and competitors may gain a distinct advantage if these targets are disclosed on a prospective basis.
We will disclose the actual targets and the level of performance achieved against them following the completion of the performance period in three years time, at which point the targets will no longer be commercially sensitive.
We will also provide an indication of the progress against the milestones on an annual basis.
Absolute TSR has been chosen as a performance metric as it is directly aligned to the value that is created for Shareholders.
This will be measured over three financial years with the base TSR, in this first year, being a 30-day average from listing December 23, 2014 and the end TSR being a 30-day average to December 31, 2017.
Absolute TSR achievement Three-year TSR growth % of maximum award vesting Threshold 25% 10% Target 50% 50% Maximum 100% 100% Vesting will be on a straight-line basis between threshold and target and between target and maximum.
