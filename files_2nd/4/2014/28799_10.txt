234436 RIT R&A pp023-pp044 26 02 2015 11:49 Page 34 Directors Remuneration Report Introduction from Remuneration Committee Chairman On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The objective of our remuneration policy is to retain and incentivise talented individuals to deliver sustained superior returns for our shareholders.
The Committee is responsible for the operation of an Annual Incentive Scheme AIS and a Share Appreciation Rights SAR Plan.
These are designed to measure our achievements and reward Directors and senior management accordingly.
We rigorously measure performance and are always mindful of shareholder expectations.
Above all, our remuneration policy must align executive reward with shareholder value creation.
The AIS is designed to reward investment performance against dual benchmarks as well as rewarding wider firm achievements.
Individual allocations from the bonus pool are made following rigorous performance appraisals.
The cap for total payments under the AIS is 0.75% of NAV, reducing to 0.25% in circumstances where the Groups NAV has reduced.
This reinforces the capital preservation aspect of our Corporate Objective.
In relation to individual payments, 60% of any excess above 100,000 is deferred into shares of the Company, which will vest in equal portions over a three-year period subject to continued employment.
The Company continues to view long-term incentives as a critical way of aligning individual rewards with RITs longer term performance.
Hence, the SAR Plan remains an important part of our overall remuneration policy.
Following the expiry of a three-year vesting period, and if performance exceeds a hurdle, participants in the SAR Plan are entitled to exercise their SARs and receive a payment in shares equal to the growth in value of the notional shares over their holding period.
This remuneration report, in accordance with the regulations governing disclosure and approval of remuneration, is in two parts: 1 The policy on Directors remuneration as approved by a binding shareholder resolution at the 30 April 2014 AGM.
2 An annual report on remuneration which provides information on how the policy has been applied during the year: subject to an advisory vote at the upcoming AGM.
We believe that this remuneration report provides a clear explanation of the Committees policies and their alignment with shareholders interests.
As a result, we do hope that you will feel able to support the resolution submitted for the approval of the annual report on remuneration.

This policy took effect from that date and will remain in place for a maximum of three years.
This report has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
The Committee determines, on behalf of the Board, the Groups policy on the remuneration of the Chairman as well as senior executives of JRCM.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Groups website.
In setting the remuneration policy the Committee takes into account: the need to attract, retain and motivate talented individuals: the alignment of remuneration policy with our Corporate Objective and the interests of our shareholders: and best practice within the marketplace.

SARs at any time thereafter up to the ten-year anniversary, and receive a payment in shares equal to the growth in value of the notional shares over the holding period.
However, the exercise of a SAR is ordinarily subject to the participants continued service over the vesting period and whether the performance condition applying to the SAR is satisfied.
The Committee determines the metric for the SAR performance condition.
The current metric applied to the awards requires that the Companys total shareholder return TSR exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index plus three percentage points per annum over the threeyear performance period.
In the event that the performance condition is met the award vests in full.
The performance condition was chosen as a good measure of above-inflation returns to shareholders and is subject to ongoing review by the Committee.
The SAR Plan uses ordinary shares of the Company to settle the share appreciation amount for existing and future awards granted under the SAR Plan.
The Group seeks to hedge its exposure under the SAR Plan by using an Employee Benefit Trust to acquire shares to meet the estimated future liability.
As noted on page 36, LTIP awards are subject to clawback.
While the binding vote on remuneration policy only applies to remuneration awarded to Directors, we normally apply the same principles to the remuneration of employees.
Eligibility for annual incentive payments based on investment performance and other criteria, along with access to long-term incentive components, is focused on the JRCM Executive Committee and those senior employees of JRCM who are able to influence the long-term performance 1 and strategy of the Group.
The Remuneration Committee retains the ability to structure specific incentive arrangements as it considers necessary and appropriate for senior management within JRCM.
The Remuneration Committee receives regular feedback on the Groups remuneration policy from management and staff.

RIT Capital Partners plc Report and Accounts December 2014 37 234436 RIT R&A pp023-pp044 26 02 2015 08:35 Page 38 Directors Remuneration Report Key Performance Indicators KPIs As we set out in our Strategic Report, we have established three KPIs which accurately reflect our Corporate Objective: 1.
Absolute Outperformance: NAV total return in excess of RPI plus 3% per annum: 2.
Relative Outperformance: NAV total return in excess of the ACWI: and 3.
These KPIs are incorporated into our incentive structure in the following way: Our first KPI is designed to measure the effectiveness of our aim to produce absolute returns with a meaningful premium above inflation, while preserving capital.
This will assess performance based on the growth in NAV above a hurdle and a high water mark.
Payments under this component of the AIS will be made only on the portion of NAV growth measured on a total return basis, above a hurdle of RPI plus a 3 percentage point premium per annum and subject to a rolling three-year high water mark.
The latter means that the NAV at the relevant year end needs to have increased above the NAV three years earlier before any payment is possible.
Our second KPI measures performance against the ACWI.
This index has a broad geographical remit which accurately reflects our unconstrained investment policy.
In addition, we use a blended index consisting of 50% of the ACWI measured in Sterling and 50% of the ACWI measured in local currencies.
The third KPI, our TSR, is taken into account when rewarding wider firm achievements and is explicitly reflected in the performance condition for the SARs.
It is further reinforced through the use of deferred shares which will vest over three years as part of AIS payments.
Consulting with shareholders The Committee engages proactively with major shareholders and shareholder representatives.
The Committee Chairman consulted with major shareholders and appropriate industry bodies on the proposed amendments to the AIS prior to the Companys AGM in April last year.
It is anticipated that any future changes to remuneration policy would involve a similar level of shareholder consultation.
Executive shareholdings Executive Directors are expected to build and retain a substantial personal shareholding in the Companys shares.
As at 31 December 2014, these beneficial holdings represented a very significant multiple of base salary for Lord Rothschild.
External non-executive directorships Where a directorship is accepted in furtherance of the Groups business, any fees received are remitted to the Group.
If the appointment is not connected to the Groups business, the Director is permitted to retain any fees received.
No other fees are paid to the Chairman in respect of external non-executive directorships.
Fees are received by the Chairman for advisory and other roles.
Executive directors service contracts and loss of office Lord Rothschild has a service agreement with JRCM, dated 29 April 1996.
This can be terminated on not less than 12 months written notice.
It provides for benefits-in-kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
The agreement does not specify compensation payable in the event of early termination.
Contracts are available for inspection at the Companys registered office shown on page 120.
In appointing a new executive Director, the Company would seek to impose a contract which required the Director to provide 12 months written notice.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, such as illness.

The variable remuneration for a new executive Director would be determined following the same principles used to determine variable remuneration for existing executive Directors.
The Committee may also offer additional cash and or share-based elements if it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and shareholders, to replace variable remuneration awards or arrangements that an individual has foregone in order to join the Company.
The Company may also consider meeting certain relocation expenses as appropriate.
Non-executive Directors remuneration The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole.
Non-executive remuneration for the year was in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Association, which currently limit the total base fees payable to non-executive Directors to 400,000 per annum.
The Board applied the following structure for the determination of the annual fees of the non-executive Directors throughout the year ended 31 December 2014: Basic fee 25,000 Senior Independent Director fee 7,500 Committee membership fees: Audit and Risk Committee 6,000 Conflicts Committee 3,000 Nominations Committee 4,000 Remuneration Committee 4,000 Valuation Committee 6,000 Committee Chairmanship fee per committee 7,500 The non-executive Directors each have letters of appointment that are subject to termination upon one months written notice on either side.
The policy of the Committee is to maintain the structure of non-executive Directors fees in line with those of comparable organisations, subject to the aggregate cap approved by shareholders.

Following the Committees review for the year ended 31 December 2013, the base salary of the Chairman was set at 350,000 per annum.
At his own suggestion, the Chairmans salary was amended to 300,000 in August 2014 and was set by the Remuneration Committee at the same level for 2015.
This is to reflect his continued leadership of the Investment Committee and involvement in key investment decisions whilst, at the same time being less involved in the day-to-day administration of the Company.
Bonus payments The NAV total return of 9.5% exceeded the absolute return hurdle of 4.6% and narrowly missed the relative return hurdle of 10.0%.
The TSR was 13.3% and the Companys net assets finished the year at an all-time high.
The bonus granted to the Chairman from the Annual Incentive Scheme is shown on page 40.
Aggregate payments made under the scheme for the year were significantly below the 0.5% cap.
The following table shows the percentage change in the base salary, benefits and annual bonus of the Chairman between the current and previous financial year compared to the average for all employees of the Group.

This is calculated by reference to the Companys share price, including dividend reinvestment.
The Committee considers the ACWI to be the most suitable index for this purpose.

As required by the legislation the total remuneration figure includes the value of SAR awards which vested in each period even if these were not exercised.
This figure does not therefore represent cash payments made to the Chairman in the periods.
As the Company applies a cap to the overall cost of incentives to the Group, rather than on an individual basis, disclosure showing each payment as a percentage of the maximum payment has not been shown.
