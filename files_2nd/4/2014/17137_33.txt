2014 Annual Bonus 1 2014 was a record year for William Hill with an 11% increase in operating profit.
The Company will therefore pay 29.8m including National Insurance in annual bonus cash payments across the William Hill Group, which includes 7.7m including National Insurance in annual bonus to UK Retail employees.
The 2014 Annual Bonus Plan for the CEO, Group Finance Director and previous Chief Executive was primarily based upon the annual profit before interest and taxes and exceptional items PBIT performance of the Group measured against annual PBIT targets as approved by the Committee.
The 2014 Group PBIT performance targets were set, as they are annually, taking into account business expectations for the year and relevant external factors.
The 2014 PBIT threshold and target were set at a level, which represented stretching performance.
As shown in the table below, actual Group PBIT pre-bonus spend of 393.0m or 104.1% of target resulted in performance just below the maximum.
2014 Group PBIT Target 2014 Group PBIT Performance Pre-bonus spend Actual Pre-bonus spend Threshold 358.5m Target 377.4m 393.0m Maximum 396.3m 75% of the potential bonus award was based on the above Group financial measure.
The remaining 25% of the potential bonus award was based on individual performance against key business objectives, which the Committee decided for 2014, would be subject to and capped to the extent the financial element of the bonus is payable.
For example, if the financial element falls short of its maximum award, the award under the individual performance award is reduced accordingly.
Therefore, as the 2014 PBIT performance resulted in a payout of c91% of maximum for the financial element, the potential award payable for the individual performance element was reduced to c91% of the maximum opportunity.
James Hendersons individual objectives related to developing a leadership plan in his role as CEO.
This included: the communication of William Hills developing strategy around international diversification and growth: increasing co-ordination of content and customer management across the Retail and Online channels Omni-channel and reducing reliance on third-party technology suppliers: and finally, to ensure that William Hill remained at the forefront of creating a responsible gambling environment, an important objective was to help create and launch the Senet Group.
As the financial award was less than the maximum, the maximum payable for James Hendersons individual element was reduced from 31.25% to 28.3% of his pro-rated salary for the CEO Designate role and from 43.7% to 39.7% of his pro-rated salary for the period as CEO.
The Committee agreed that James Henderson had met the majority of his individual objectives for the period as CEO Designate and his first five months as CEO and accordingly agreed a bonus of 90% against his individual objectives, resulting in a bonus for this element of 34.2% of salary.
Neil Coopers individual objectives related to corporate finance planning and analysis and upgrading the financial accounting systems.
He was also responsible for delivering a range of internal audit, tax and treasury projects.
During 2014, the Group Finance Director role took on increased importance with Neil Cooper playing a key part in the induction of the new CEO and in helping to maintain business continuity and good investor relations against the backdrop of regulatory and senior personnel change in the sector.
As the financial award was less than the maximum, the maximum payable for Neil Coopers individual element was reduced from 37.5% to 33.9% of salary.
The CEO advised the Committee that the Group Finance Director had met the majority of his individual objectives for the year and the Committee agreed, based on the CEOs recommendation, an individual bonus of 90% against Neil Coopers individual objectives resulting in a bonus for this element of 30.5% of salary.
Arrangements for Ralph Toppings annual bonus were summarised when the Company announced that he would be leaving the Board.
In accordance with the rules of the bonus plan and in line with the Remuneration Policy, the Committee agreed to treat Mr Topping as a good leaver in recognition of his distinguished service with the Company.
As such, Mr Topping participated in the bonus plan up to 31 July 2014 and all of his bonus will be paid in cash.
Mr Topping played an important role in the development of James Henderson as his successor and then in the handover to James as CEO, which were critical objectives for the Company.
Mr Topping continued to have a leading role in the industry during 2014 through the promotion of responsible gambling and met the majority of his personal objectives in his seven months as Chief Executive.
As the financial award was less than the maximum, the maximum payable for Mr Toppings individual element was reduced from 43.7% to 39.9% of salary.
The Committee agreed an individual bonus of 75% against Mr Toppings individual objectives resulting in a bonus for this element of 29.9% of salary.

Including the bonus paid in respect of his time as Group Director, Operations prior to joining the Board, his total bonus for the year was596,987.
In accordance with the policy on annual bonuses, 50% of James Hendersons and Neil Coopers bonuses will be paid in cash and the other 50% will be deferred in shares for three years under the EBMS.
In line with the approved policy and as disclosed at the time of the announcement that Ralph Toppings was leaving the Group, his bonus will be paid in cash.
Long-term incentives vesting in relation to performance ending in 2014 In 2012, the Committee awarded James Henderson i. e. prior to him joining the Board, Neil Cooper and Ralph Topping shares to the value of 100% of their respective salaries at the time off grant 2012 PSP awards.
The vesting of one half of the 2012 PSP awards depended on the aggregate adjusted EPS the EPS tranche over the three year period: 2012 to 2014.
The aggregate EPS range for 2012 to 2014 was 71.7p to 86.4p.
These targets were adjusted for the 2013 rights issue by the theoretical ex-right price adjustment factor.
No shares vest if aggregate EPS is below 71.7p: for aggregate EPS at the threshold of 71.7p, 25% of the EPS tranche vests: for aggregate EPS of 86.4p or above, the full EPS tranche vests: a sliding scale applies for performance between threshold and maximum.
The Groups aggregate EPS over the three year performance period was 85.9p which is between the threshold and maximum of the range 97.4% of the EPS tranche will vest.
The vesting of the remaining half of the 2012 PSP awards the TSR tranche depended on the Companys relative TSR performance over the three year performance period 2012 to 2014 against a comparator group of 16 gambling and leisure companies.
For a ranking below median, none of the TSR tranche vests: for a median ranking 25% of the TSR tranche vests, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for a ranking at or above upper quartile.
The Companys TSR performance ranking was 4.32 relative to the comparator group of 14 remaining live companies after two companies delisted over the three year performance period 93.2% of the TSR tranche therefore vests.
Overall, 95.3% of the 2012 PSP awards will vest.
James Henderson will receive 120,118 shares comprised of the original PSP award plus an additional 11,911 shares in lieu of dividends paid over the performance period.

The PSP award was granted on 19 May 2014 in the form of nil cost options and is subject to three performance conditions, relative TSR, EPS growth and BPMs.
The relative TSR performance condition, which accounts for 50% of the overall award, measures the Companys TSR performance against the comparator group of 17 gaming and leisure companies, as constructed at the grant date and measured over a four-year performance period.
For a ranking below median, none of this element of the award will vest.
For a median ranking 25% of this element of the award will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting of this element for a ranking at or above upper quartile.
The EPS measure, which accounts for 25% of the award, is based on EPS compound annual growth as measured on a point-to-point basis by comparing the EPS for 2017 against 2013.
