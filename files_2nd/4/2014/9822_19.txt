Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration Committee Chairman Annual Statement Dear Shareholder On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 4 October 2014, which sets out the remuneration policy for the Directors of Marstons and the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 4 October 2014.
Shareholder engagement In my first report as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to report on the strong level of support and engagement from shareholders.
This is evidenced by the voting outcomes at the 2014 Annual General Meeting.
The resolutions seeking approval of the new 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Directors Remuneration Policy and Implementation Report were supported by over 97% of the votes cast.
Before introducing the new LTIP we consulted extensively with our major shareholders and will continue to do so as the Remuneration Policy is reviewed and developed in future years.
2013 14 key decisions and incentive pay-outs The Remuneration Committee remains committed to a responsible approach to executive pay, particularly given the continuing challenges of the economic environment.
Key decisions on executive pay, including increases to salary and bonus payments, are calculated after consideration of similar decisions affecting all employees, consistent with the Companys ethos of operating with Fairness, Integrity and Transparency.
Base salary increases awarded to the Executive Directors in 2014 were 2.6%, in line with average salary increases across the Group.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to adjust performance metrics impacting on bonus or LTIP awards where there is a material consequence of strategic decisions.
In considering bonus awards for the 2014 financial year the Committee took into account the portfolio disposal of 202 pubs in November 2013.
Whilst the immediate financial impact of this disposal was to reduce profit and earnings in 2014, it will improve the quality of our pub estate and earnings in the longer term.
Having adjusted for the 2013 reported profit before taxation for the impact of the 53rd week and the portfolio disposal, Marstons underlying earnings increased by 11% during the year and the Executive Directors will receive 25% of their maximum annual bonus entitlements.
As disclosed on page 33, a formulaic application of the performance metrics applying to the annual bonus would have resulted in bonus awards of 40% of salary but, taking into account the economic environment, the Committee exercised restraint and awarded bonuses of 25% of salary.
In addition, as a result of EPS growth from 2011 to 2013, the 2011 LTIP award vested at 44.2% during the year.
Further details are included on page 34.
The Committee retains discretion to reduce or withhold awards but not to increase them subject to noting the potential for adjustments to performance metrics as described above.
In exercising that discretion, the Committee has regard to the financial performance of the business in the financial year in which the award vests.
The fact that the awards usually vest in June means that the Committee takes into account a further nine months of performance in determining whether an award will vest and the Committee believes that this provides additional assurance that the award is appropriate.
2014 15 The performance metrics for variable pay are unchanged.
In relation to bonus payments it is a combination of underlying profit before taxation and return on capital employed: and for the LTIP it is a combination of CROCCE, FCF and relative TSR.
Further details are included on pages 33 and 34.
Last year the Company adopted a malus provision into the 2014 LTIP rules and the deferred bonus plan.
The Committee is aware of the changes in the 2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code and, specifically with reference to clawback provisions for variable pay, is reviewing the adjustments required.
We will take note of emerging practice before a decision is made and reported to you next year.
We recognise the expectations of our shareholders on executive pay and our history should demonstrate clearly that the Remuneration Committee approaches such issues with caution and sensitivity.
Neil Goulden Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Notes This Report has been prepared on behalf of the Board and has been approved by the Board.
The Report complies with the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013, the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code the Code and the Financial Conduct Authority Listing Rules.
To reflect the requirements of the revised remuneration reporting regulations this Report is presented in two sections: The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details on the amounts earned in respect of the period and how the policy will be operated for the period ended 3 October 2015: and The Directors Remuneration Policy sets out the current remuneration policy as approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting.
Marston's PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 31 Directors Remuneration Report continued Annual Report on Remuneration Remuneration principles To align the remuneration of the Executive Directors with the Groups strategic objectives and the interests of shareholders, our strategic priorities are reflected in our remuneration principles: Key focus Remuneration principles Sustainable growth Ensure that remuneration arrangements support sustainable growth and the long-term objectives of the Company.
Shareholder interests Substantial part of the incentive package for Executive Directors is delivered in the Companys shares to ensure interests are aligned with shareholders.
Minimum shareholding expectations for Executive Directors and senior management.
Bonuses earned in excess of 40% of the maximum opportunity are payable in shares in the Company, which will be deferred for a period of three years.
Employee engagement Ensure Director and senior management salaries are set with reference to the wider workforce.
Offer an HMRC approved SAYE scheme to all eligible employees.
The policy is designed to ensure that Executive Directors are provided with sufficient remuneration to motivate each individual, together with appropriate incentives that are aligned to strategy and encourage enhanced performance.
The Committee undertakes an annual review of market practices and commentary and remuneration levels of Directors in similar roles in companies of comparable sizes and complexity.
In addition, they review the levels of remuneration for other employees and the pay increases awarded throughout the Group: the aim being to reward all employees fairly according to their role, performance, the economic environment and the financial performance of the Group.
The following parts of the Remuneration Report are subject to audit, other than the elements explaining the application of the Remuneration Policy for 2014 15.
Single total figure of remuneration Executive Directors The table below reports the total remuneration receivable in respect of qualifying services by each Executive Director during the year.
Details of the figures in the table are provided overleaf.
Total salary and Taxable Annual Long term Pension related fees benefits bonus incentives benefits Total Period ended 4 October 2014 Andrew Andrea 317,000 14,438 79,250 204,770 63,425 678,883 Peter Dalzell 282,000 14,438 70,500 142,668 323,916 833,522 Ralph Findlay 508,000 17,138 127,000 324,680 127,045 1,103,863 Long term Total salary Taxable Annual incentives Pension related 1 and fees benefits bonus restated benefits Total Period ended 5 October 2013 Andrew Andrea 309,000 14,630 185,629 61,800 571,059 Peter Dalzell 275,000 14,419 32,207 300,553 622,179 Ralph Findlay 495,000 17,330 301,232 123,750 937,312 1 In the Directors Remuneration Report for the period ended 5 October 2013, the long term incentives figures for the period ended 5 October 2013 assumed that the LTIP awards granted in June 2011 would lapse.
The awards vested in June 2014 at 44.2% and in the above table for the period ended 5 October 2013 the long term incentives figures have been updated to reflect that vesting.
The value has been calculated by multiplying the number of shares in respect of which the award vested by 1.429 being the market value of a share on 24 June 2014, the date of vesting.
In the case of Andrew Andrea, the long term incentives figure for the period ended 5 October 2013 also includes 1,005 in respect of an SAYE option granted in that period, as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report for the period ended 5 October 2013.
Figures in the single figure table are derived from the following: Total salary and fees The amount of salary fees received in the period.
Taxable benefits The taxable value of benefits received in the period.
These are car allowance, private medical insurance and life assurance.
Annual bonus The annual bonus earned in the period ended 4 October 2014.
A description of Group performance against which the bonus pay-out was determined is provided on page 33.
No Executive Director has elected to defer any of the bonus earned into shares.
32 Marston's PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Long term incentives The value of LTIP awards that vest in respect of the financial period and the value of SAYE options granted in the financial period.
LTIP: The 2011 LTIP award vested at 44.2% during the year.
In the single total figure of remuneration table for the period ended 5 October 2013, the relevant value is calculated as disclosed in the footnote to that table.
The original estimate disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report for the period ended 5 October 2013 was that 0% of the 2011 LTIP would vest.
As awards vest nine months after the end of the financial year and then only subject to the Committee being satisfied that the underlying performance of the award supports the formulaic output of the award, the best estimate at that time was that the awards would lapse.
In June 2014 the Committee were satisfied that financial performance supported the vesting of the awards based on EPS performance over the previous three years, at 44.2%.
LTIP: The 2012 LTIP award will vest in June 2015.
For the purposes of the single total figure of remuneration table for the period ended 4 October 2014, it has been estimated that the 2012 LTIP will vest at 36%, and the value included in the table has been calculated by multiplying the number of shares in respect of which the 2012 LTIP is estimated to vest by the average market value of a share over the last quarter of the period ended 4 October 2014.
SAYE: For the year ended 4 October 2014 the long term incentive value includes the value of SAYE options granted based on the fair value of the options at grant.
Pension related benefits The pension figure represents the cash value of pension contributions received by the Executive Directors.
This includes the Companys contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme and any salary supplement in lieu of a Company pension contribution and for individuals in the Companys defined benefit pension scheme, it also includes the additional value achieved in the period calculated using the HMRC method using a multiplier of 20.
Further details of pension benefits are set out on page 35.
Individual elements of remuneration Executive Directors Base salary Base salaries for individual Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are set with reference to individual performance, experience and responsibilities within the Group as well as with reference to similar roles in comparable companies.
For 2013 14, Ralph Findlay, Andrew Andrea and Peter Dalzell received a 2.6% salary increase, which was in line with the average salary increases across the Group.
For 2014 15, the average salary increase for Executive Directors is 2.5%, which is in line with the average salary increases across the Group.
The base salaries for 2013 14 and 2014 15 are as set out below: 2014 15 2013 14 Name base salary base salary Increase Andrew Andrea 325,000 317,000 2.5% Peter Dalzell 289,000 282,000 2.5% Ralph Findlay 521,000 508,000 2.6% Annual bonus With the exception of our pub managers and field-based sales teams, all bonus arrangements within the Group have the same structure and pay-out mechanism, though the maximum potential award, expressed as a percentage of salary, varies between different employee groups.
Payments are calculated based upon achieving or exceeding pre-set targets for both Group profit and return on capital.
2013 14 For 2013 14, Executive Directors could earn a bonus equivalent to 50% of base salary for hitting on-target performance and this increases on a linear basis for performance above the set targets up to a maximum of 100% of base salary.
For Executive Directors, the bonus agreement includes two additional conditions: Any bonus earned in excess of 40% of the maximum opportunity is payable in shares in the Company, which will be deferred for a period of three years: and A malus provision is operated which gives the Remuneration Committee the discretion to reduce lapse unvested deferred shares if an act or omission of the participant contributes to a material misstatement of the Groups financial statements or results in material loss or reputational damage for the Company.
The Directors consider that the future Group profit and return on capital targets are matters which are commercially sensitive: they provide our competitors with insight into our business plans and expectations and should therefore remain confidential to the Company.
However, the following table sets out the bonus pay-out to the Executive Directors for 2013 14 and Marstons target and actual Group profit and return on capital performance for the year.
Executive Director Target return Actual return bonus as a percentage Group profit target Group profit actual on capital on capital of salary 2013 14 85.0m 83.0m 10.6% 10.5% 25% before non-underlying items Excluding the impact of disposals and the 53rd trading week, the underlying profit before tax for 2012 13 was 75 million.
The 2013 14 profit therefore represents an 11% increase on the previous year the threshold level at which a bonus will vest.
On a straight-line vesting a bonus level of 40% would be payable.
Taking into account the continuing challenges of the economic environment the Remuneration Committee considers it appropriate to exercise restraint and have therefore approved an award of 25%.
2014 15 No changes are proposed in respect of the annual bonus scheme for 2014 15 with awards based on Group profit two thirds and return on capital one third.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to disclose how the bonus pay-out delivered relates to performance against the targets on a retrospective basis.
Marston's PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 33 Directors Remuneration Report continued Long Term Incentive Plan Awards vesting in respect of the financial period LTIP awards granted in 2012 were subject to the achievement of an EPS growth performance condition over a three year period.
Awards vest on a sliding scale with 35% becoming exercisable if annual EPS growth exceeds RPI by 3%.
For 100% of an award to vest EPS growth must exceed RPI by 9% per annum.
The extent to which the LTIP awards granted in June 2012 will vest will not be determined by the Remuneration Committee until June 2015, therefore an estimate of the level of vesting has been made.
During the year the Remuneration Committee noted that the historical EPS figure will be restated to reflect the new pension accounting standard.
The Committee also discussed the impact of the portfolio and other strategic disposal activity on the remaining awards made under the 2004 LTIP scheme.
Given the short term effect on earnings it was agreed that the 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards should be measured against an adjusted EPS figure.
It is estimated that the 2012 LTIP will vest at 36%.
The awards will only vest if the prevailing performance of the Company at the time of vesting supports it.
This decision is at the discretion of the Committee.
Awards granted during 2013 14 In respect of the year ended 4 October 2014 the following awards were granted under the 2014 LTIP: % of award Percentage of Number of Face value at vesting at 1 Type of award salary shares grant threshold Performance period Andrew Andrea LTIP 125% 275,748 396,250 25% Financial years Peter Dalzell LTIP 125% 245,302 352,499 25% 2013 14 to 2015 16 Ralph Findlay LTIP 125% 441,892 634,999 25% inclusive 1 The awards granted in respect of the year ended 4 October 2014 were granted as Approved Performance Share Plan APSP awards, with each award comprising of the following three elements: i a tax advantaged option with an exercise price of 1.437 per share over shares with a total value at the date of grant of 30,000, ii a Linked Award which is, principally, a funding award in the form of a nil-cost option to acquire such number of shares whose value at exercise equals 30,000: and iii an LTIP award in the form of a nil cost option over shares to the value of the remainder of the APSP award.
The number of shares referred to in the table above is the aggregate of the number of shares subject to the tax advantaged option and the LTIP award, each person was also granted a Linked Award over a maximum of 20,876 shares.
The performance metrics for these LTIP awards are as follows: Threshold vesting Vesting Maximum vesting % linked at 25% of the at 50% of the at 100% of the to award Base maximum award maximum award maximum award CROCCE 40% 10.8% Base 0.25% Base 0.5% Base 1.0% Base 7.5% Base 15% Base 30% FCF 40% 300m average growth average growth average growth Relative TSR 20% Median Upper quintile Each award, other than the APSP element, is also subject to a further underpinning performance condition and will only vest if, at the discretion of the Committee, the prevailing financial performance of the Company at the time of vesting supports it.
There will be straight-line vesting between the points and no reward below threshold performance.
The base amounts will be set at a level that is considered stretching but without encouraging undue risk.
CROCCE: Cash Return On Cash Capital Employed.
The use of CROCCE as opposed to an EBIT return on book value removes potential distortions from subjective decisions on depreciation policy and asset revaluation.
CROCCE will be based on the budget target for 2015.
Threshold vesting for this measure would only be earned if this target is exceeded by 0.25% over the three year period.
This reflects the operating cash flow of the business after tax and interest which is available to return to shareholders as dividends: to reinvest to increase returns: or to pay down debt.
It is more closely aligned to operating performance than a simple leverage ratio.
FCF in 2015 will be set as a three year cumulative amount based on the budget for 2015, 2016 and 2017 projections.
Awards will only be earned if FCF exceeds that cumulative level at the end of three years by at least 7.5%.
Relative TSR: Total Shareholder Return compared against the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
The Remuneration Committee believe that a wider comparator group is a more robust and realistic way of measuring how shareholders value the Company and, furthermore, have set the maximum reward at upper quintile performance recognising our commitment to ensuring there are demanding performance targets.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee will require that the element of the award associated with TSR performance will only be earned if underlying financial performance supports it.
The weightings for each measure have been set to balance what the Remuneration Committee consider to be the direction of focus for management in its day to day direction of the business with its ultimate responsibility to shareholders.
In order to maintain transparency the Remuneration Committee will disclose how the Company has performed against each of the performance metrics following the end of the performance period.
2014 15 Awards It is intended to make awards under the LTIP in 2014 15 based on the same performance metrics.
Base numbers will be finalised and disclosed next year.
34 Marston's PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Total pension entitlements Defined benefit schemes The defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants from 29 September 1997.
The scheme closed to future accrual on 30 September 2014.
Ralph Findlay became a deferred member of the Marstons Scheme on 5 April 2012 and takes a salary supplement of 25% of base salary in lieu of future pension provision.
The details of pensions accrued in the defined benefit scheme are shown in the table below: Accrued pension Accrued pension Normal at 30.09.14 at 30.09.13 retirement age Peter Dalzell 79,693 61,828 65 Ralph Findlay 108,655 105,793 60 Early retirement can be taken from age 55 provided the Group gives its consent.
The accrued pension will then be reduced to take account of its early payment.
On death before retirement, if still employed by Marston's, a spouses pension is payable equal to one-third of the members pension for Peter Dalzell and 50% for Ralph Findlay plus a lump sum equal to the Directors contributions including those made via salary sacrifice.
On death after retirement the spouses pension payable is 60% of the members pre-commutation pension, for both Peter Dalzell and Ralph Findlay.
Defined contribution scheme The Group makes contributions into the Group Personal Pension Plan GPPP on behalf of Andrew Andrea.
A rate of 20% of base salary paid partly as a GPPP contribution and partly as a taxable cash supplement is payable in return for a minimum personal contribution of 7.5%.
For the year ended 4 October 2014, the Group contribution for Andrew Andrea was 63,425, being 16,170 pension contribution and a salary supplement of 47,255.
In 2013 14 Ralph Findlay received a taxable cash supplement of 25% of basic salary in lieu of pension contributions.

As noted on page 34, those LTIP awards vested in June 2014 at 44.2% and in the table above the total remuneration figure and vesting percentage for 2012 13 has been updated accordingly.
Percentage change in Chief Executive Officer remuneration The table below sets out in relation to salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus the percentage increase in remuneration for Ralph Findlay versus the prior year compared to the wider workforce.
For these purposes, this includes head office and supply chain employees but excludes pub based staff as the majority of these employees have their remuneration rate set by statute rather than the market.
Wider CEO workforce Salary 2.63% 2.7% Taxable benefits 1.1% 0.89% 1 Annual bonus 1 With the exception of a small number of sales employees within the wider workforce, no bonuses were payable last year based on Group performance.
Therefore the percentage change in bonus compared to the prior year is not a meaningful comparison.

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors remuneration The Remuneration Committee is responsible for: Setting the framework and policy for Executive Directors remuneration: Determining the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and Chairman: Monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management and approving bonus payments: and Noting any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Group and ensuring that Executive Director remuneration practice is consistent with any such changes.
Advisers During the period the Committee received advice from a number of sources to ensure its decision making was informed and took account of pay and conditions in the Group as a whole and wider market conditions.
These sources comprise: Deloitte LLP Deloitte.
Appointed by the Committee in 2003, Deloitte is retained to provide independent advice to the Committee as required and has confirmed it remains independent.
During the period, Deloitte has also provided advice on various tax issues and internal audit services to the Company.
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
Deloittes fees for providing advice to the Remuneration Committee amounted to 15,100 2013: 6,950.
Ralph Findlay, Chief Executive Officer, provided advice in respect of the remuneration of the other Executive Directors but was not in attendance when his own remuneration was discussed.
Anne-Marie Brennan, Company Secretary, provides general advice and support on governance and best practice, as secretary to the Committee.

Whilst Executive Directors are contractually entitled to an annual review of their salary, there is no entitlement to an increase as a result of this review.
Salary levels are determined by the Committee taking into account a range of factors including: role, experience and performance: alignment with workforce: prevailing market conditions: and external benchmarks for similar roles at comparable companies.
Opportunity Salary increases are reviewed in the context of salary increases across the wider Group.
The Committee considers any increase which is out of line with these very carefully and such increases may be awarded where there is a reason to do so taking into account relevant factors.
These circumstances may include but are not limited to: increase in scope and responsibility: promotional increase to Executive Director: or a salary falling significantly below market positioning.
Performance metrics Not applicable, although the individuals contribution and overall performance is one of the considerations in determining the level of any salary increase.
Benefits Purpose and link Ensures the overall package is competitive.
Participation in the Save As You Earn scheme SAYE creates staff alignment with the Group and promotes a sense of ownership.
Operation Executive Directors receive benefits in line with market practice which include a car allowance, private medical insurance and life assurance.
The SAYE is an HMRC approved monthly savings scheme facilitating the purchase of shares at a discount.
Other benefits may be provided based on the role and individual circumstances.
These may include, for example, relocation and travel allowances.
Opportunity Set at a level which the Committee considers appropriate against the market and provides a sufficient level of benefit based on individual circumstances.
SAYE contribution as permitted in accordance with the relevant tax legislation.
38 Marston's PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Annual bonus and deferred bonus plan Purpose and link Rewards performance against annual targets which support the strategic direction of the Company.
to strategy Compulsory deferral into shares aligns Executive Directors with shareholder interests and provides a retention element.
Operation Targets are set annually and any pay-out is determined by the Committee after the period end, based on performance against those targets.
The Committee has discretion to vary the bonus pay-out should any formulaic output not reflect the Committees assessment of overall business performance.
Any bonus earned in excess of 40% of the maximum award is usually payable in shares in the Company which will be deferred for a period of three years.
Executive Directors can opt to defer a greater proportion if they wish.
Deferral of any bonus earned is subject to a fide minimis limit of 5,000.
A claw-back malus provision gives the Committee the right to cancel unvested shares if an act or omission of the participant contributes to a material misstatement of the Groups financial statements or results in material loss or reputational damage for the Company.
As with all Company bonuses, they remain discretionary and can be adjusted or removed at the Companys discretion.
In the case of Executive Directors this discretion lies with the Committee.
Opportunity Maximum bonus opportunity is 100% of base salary.
Performance metrics Financial targets are set each year reflecting the business priorities that underpin Group strategy and align to financial key performance indicators which may include Group profit and return on capital measures.
At least 50% of the award will be based on Group profit.
Payments range between 0% and 100% of base salary with 50% of the maximum entitlement for each measure payable for on-target performance.
For achievement of the maximum performance level the highest level of performance that results in any additional payment 100% of the maximum opportunity will vest.
There is usually straight-line vesting between the threshold and target performance levels and between target and maximum performance levels.
The Committee has the discretion to vary the vesting schedules by reducing the percentage that vests at each performance level but not by increasing the percentage that vests.
Long term incentive plan LTIP Purpose and link Incentivises Executive Directors to deliver against the Companys strategy over the longer term.
to strategy Long term performance targets and share-based remuneration support the creation of sustainable shareholder value.
Operation The Committee makes long term incentive awards under the 2014 LTIP which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
Under the 2014 LTIP, awards of conditional shares, restricted stock or nil cost options or similar cash equivalent can be made with vesting dependent on the achievement of performance conditions, normally over a three year performance period.
Awards may vest early on a change of control or other relevant event subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions and pro-rating for time, although the Committee has discretion to increase the extent of vesting having due regard to performance over the period to vesting.
As described on page 43, LTIP awards may also vest early in good leaver circumstances.
Under the new LTIP the Committee has the right to reduce any LTIP awards which have not yet vested i. e. a malus provision if an act or omission contributes to a material misstatement of the Groups financial statements or results in material loss or reputational damage for the Company.
The Committee may at its discretion structure awards as Approved Performance Share Plan APSP awards.
APSP awards enable the participant and company to benefit from HMRC approved option tax treatment in respect of part of the award, without increasing the pre-tax value delivered to participants.
APSP awards may be structured either as an approved option for the part of the award up to the HMRC limit currently 30,000 with an unapproved option for the balance and a linked award to fund the exercise price of the approved option, or as an approved option and an LTIP award, with the vesting of the LTIP award scaled back to take account of any gain made on exercise of the approved option.
Opportunity The normal maximum award size will be 125% of base salary in respect of any financial year.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee reserves the right to award up to 200% of base salary in respect of any financial year.
These limits do not include the value of shares subject to any approved option granted as part of an APSP award.
Marston's PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 39 Directors Remuneration Report continued Long term incentive plan LTIP continued Performance metrics The vesting of LTIP awards is subject to the satisfaction of performance targets set by the Committee.
The performance measures are reviewed regularly to ensure they remain relevant but will be based on financial measures and or share price growth related measures, including but not exclusively : free cash flow: return on capital employed: and relative total shareholder return.
The relevant metrics and the respective weightings may vary each year based upon Company strategic priorities.
For 2015, the performance measures and weightings will be: 40% free cash flow: 40% cash return on cash capital employed: and 20% relative total shareholder return.
For the achievement of threshold performance no more than 25% of each respective element of the award will vest.
For the achievement of maximum performance 100% of each respective element will vest.
There will be straight-line vesting between threshold and maximum performance.
The Committee will regularly review the performance conditions and targets to ensure they are aligned to Marstons strategy and remain challenging and reflective of commercial expectations.
Retirement benefits Purpose and link To recruit and retain Directors of the calibre required for the business.
to strategy Provides market competitive post-employment or cash equivalent benefits.
Operation Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the defined contribution pension scheme or such other pension plan as may be deemed appropriate and, if a member before closure of the scheme, the defined benefit scheme.
The defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants from 29 September 1997.
Executive Directors who are members of the closed scheme can continue to receive benefits in accordance with the terms of this scheme.
In appropriate circumstances, Executive Directors may take a salary supplement instead of contributions into a pension plan.
Opportunity Ralph Findlay, who was previously a member of the defined benefit scheme has opted to no longer accrue future benefits and instead receives 25% of base salary as a salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions.
All the other Executive Directors including any new appointments may receive contributions of up to 20% of base salary under the defined contribution pension scheme, an equivalent cash allowance or a combination of the two up to 20% of base salary.
Active members of the defined benefit pension scheme continued to accrue benefits under this scheme until 30 September 2014.
Non-executive Director fees Purpose and link Sole element of Non-executive Director remuneration set at a level that reflects market conditions and is sufficient to attract to strategy individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience.
Operation Fees are reviewed every two years and amended to reflect market positioning and any change in responsibilities.
The Committee recommends the remuneration of the Chairman to the Board.
Fees paid to Non-executive Directors are determined and approved by the Board as a whole.
The Non-executive Directors do not participate in the annual bonus plan, any of the Groups share incentive plans nor do they receive any benefits or pension contributions.
Opportunity Fees are based on the level of fees paid to Non-executive Directors serving on Boards of similar-sized UK-listed companies and the time commitment and contribution expected for the role.
Non-executive Directors receive a basic fee and an additional fee for further duties for example chairmanship of a committee or senior independent director responsibilities.
40 Marston's PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed: i before the Policy came into effect: or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes the term payments includes the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Remuneration Committees discretion includes discretion to determine, in accordance with the rules of the current LTIP, the extent to which awards under that plan may vest in the event of a change of control or in a good leaver circumstance.
The Committee may make minor changes to this Policy, which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid in its operation or implementation taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek shareholder approval.
Explanation of performance metrics chosen Performance measures are selected that are aligned to the Companys strategy.
Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual bonus and long term incentive awards.
In setting these stretching performance targets the Committee will take into account a number of different reference points which may include the Companys business plans and strategy and the market environment.
Where relative total shareholder return is used there will be no payment for performance below median compared to the comparator group.
The annual bonus performance targets reflect key financial objectives of the Company and reward for delivery against these.
The LTIP performance targets reflect the Companys strategic objectives and therefore the financial and strategic decisions which ultimately determine the success of the Company.
The LTIP performance measures are based on financial measures and or share price growth related measures, including but not exclusively : Cash Return On Cash Capital Employed this is a key driver of shareholder value and reflects Marstons investment disposal plans and the balance sheet.
Free Cash Flow this reflects the operating cash flow of the business after tax and interest which is available to return to shareholders as dividends: to reinvest to increase returns: or to pay down debt.
Relative Total Shareholder Return aligns managements objectives with those of shareholders and is a broad measure of the extent to which Company strategy is considered appropriate by the market as well as the extent to which it is being well implemented.
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust the performance targets and measures where it considers it appropriate to do so for example, to reflect changes in the structure of the business and to assess performance on a fair and consistent basis from year to year.
Illustration of application of Remuneration Policy The charts below show the relative split of remuneration between fixed pay base salary, benefits and pension and variable pay annual bonus, deferred bonus plan DBP and LTIP for each Executive Director on the basis of minimum remuneration, remuneration receivable for performance in line with the Companys expectations and maximum remuneration not allowing for any share price appreciation.

performance measures attached to the LTIP awards.
Awards under the LTIP and deferred shares vesting under the DBP are included at face value with no share price movement included.
Differences in policy from the wider employee population The Company aims to provide a remuneration package that is market competitive, complies with any statutory requirements and is applied fairly and equitably across the wider employee population.
Where remuneration is not determined by statutory regulation, the Company operates the same core principles as it does for Executive Directors namely: We remunerate people in a manner that allows for stability of the business and the opportunity for sustainable long-term growth.
We seek to remunerate fairly and consistently for each role with due regard to the marketplace, internal consistency and the Companys ability to pay.
With the exception of our pub managers and field-based sales teams, all bonus arrangements within the Group normally have the same structure and pay-out mechanism as those for Executive Directors.
Participation in the DBP and LTIP is extended to the senior management team at the discretion of the Board and, in line with the policy for Executive Directors, share ownership is encouraged and LTIP participants are expected to build and maintain a minimum level of shareholding.
We also encourage long term employee engagement through the offer of SAYE to all employees of the Group who meet a minimum service requirement.
Recruitment Remuneration Policy When hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee will typically seek to use the Policy detailed in the table above to determine the Executive Directors ongoing remuneration package.
To facilitate the hiring of candidates of the appropriate calibre required to implement the Groups strategy, the Committee also retains the discretion to include any other remuneration component or award which is outside the Policy.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including the quantum and nature of remuneration to ensure the arrangements are in the best interests of Marstons and its shareholders.
The Committee may make an award to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors including the form of award, any performance conditions attached to these awards and the time over which they would have vested.
The Committee would seek to incorporate buy-out awards in line with the Companys remuneration framework as far as is practical.
The Committee may consider other components for structuring the buy-out, including cash or shares awards, restricted stock awards and share options where there is a commercial rationale for doing so.
Appropriate costs and support will be covered if the recruitment requires relocation of the individual.
All recruitment awards will normally be liable to forfeiture or clawback on early departure.
For Executive Directors, early departure is defined as being within the first two years of employment.
The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted excluding buy-out arrangements is three times salary.
The Committee will ensure that such awards are linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance measures and will be forfeited if performance or continued employment conditions are not met.
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office Executive Directors contracts are on a rolling 12 month basis and are subject to 12 months notice when terminated by the Company and six months notice when terminated by the Director.
The Committee may, in exceptional circumstances, in order to attract and retain suitable executives, offer service contracts with up to an initial 24 month notice period which then reduce to 12 months at the end of this initial period.
The current Non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, do not have a service contract and their appointments, whilst for a term of three years, may be terminated without compensation at any time.
All Non-executive Directors have letters of appointment and their appointment and subsequent re-appointment is subject to annual approval by shareholders.
42 Marston's PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 The principles on which the determination of payments of loss of office will be approached are summarised below: Provision Treatment upon loss of office Payment in lieu Payments to Executive Directors upon termination of their contracts will be equal to base salary plus the value of core benefits of notice for the duration of the notional notice period.
Benefits may also include, but are not limited to, outplacement and legal fees.
They will also be entitled to pension contributions for the duration of the notional notice period or the requisition cash allowance equivalent.
Annual bonus This will be at the discretion of the Committee on an individual basis and the decision whether or not to award a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon a number of factors including the circumstances of their departure and their contribution to the business during the bonus period in question.
Any bonus amounts paid as estimated by the Committee will typically be prorated for time in service to termination and will, subject to performance, be paid at the usual time.
Deferred bonus Any deferred award under the deferred bonus plan will be determined based on the leaver provisions contained within the deferred bonus plan rules.
For participants leaving before the first anniversary of the date of grant deferred awards will lapse unless the participant is considered a good leaver.
For a good leaver the deferred award will vest in full.
Good leavers are participants who leave as a result of redundancy, death, ill-health, injury or disability, the sale of his employer out of the Group or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee.
For a participant leaving after the first anniversary of the date of grant the award will vest in full unless employment is terminated for reasons of misconduct in which case the award will lapse.
2014 LTIP Any award under the 2014 LTIP would be determined based on the leaver provisions contained within the 2014 LTIP plan rules.
For good leavers LTIP awards will usually vest at the ordinary vesting point, be subject to performance conditions and pro-rated for time.
Good leavers are participants who leave as a result of death, ill-health, injury or disability, the sale of his employer out of the Group or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee.
In other circumstances LTIP awards will lapse upon the cessation of employment.
The Committee retains the discretion to accelerate vesting and to waive pro-rating for time.
Change of control Upon a change of control incentive awards will usually vest and be subject to performance conditions and pro-rated for time.
The Committee retains the discretion to waive pro-rating for time.
Mitigation Ralph Findlays service contract is formed under a model which was approved by the Committee in 2001 and there is no reduction in payments for mitigation or for early payment as the Remuneration Committee has taken the view that as a long-standing employee of the Group, full compensation would be merited in the event of unilateral termination of his employment by the Group.
Andrew Andrea and Peter Dalzells service contracts were formed under a new model approved in 2009 and provide that, subject to formal notice being given by either party, any payment during the notice period will be reduced by any amount earned in that period from alternative employment as a result of being released to work for another employer prior to the conclusion of their notice period.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company Salary, benefits and performance related rewards provided to employees are taken into account when setting policy for Executive Directors remuneration.
Although employees are not actively consulted on Directors remuneration the Company has regular contact with union bodies on matters of pay and remuneration for employees covered by collective bargaining or consultation arrangements.
In October of each year a paper is submitted to the Remuneration Committee by the Group Human Resources Director summarising the outcome of any annual reviews made to the wider workforce including head office and supply chain employees but excluding pub based staff as the majority of these employees have their remuneration rate set by statute rather than the market.
This paper is taken into account when setting Executive Directors remuneration effective from the start of October for the following 12 months.
In addition, and where relevant, a similar paper is submitted in October covering the decisions taken by the Executive Committee relating to bonus payments for employees within the wider workforce.
This is taken into consideration by the Remuneration Committee when approving bonus awards for Executive Directors.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views The Committee is committed to open and transparent dialogue with shareholders and welcomes feedback on Executive and Non-executive Directors remuneration.
Prior to the 2014 LTIP being formally put to shareholders, the Committee held an open dialogue with major shareholders and institutional investor bodies setting out the proposals and the detailed thinking and planning behind them.
This report was approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by Neil Goulden Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 27 November 2014 Marston's PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 43
