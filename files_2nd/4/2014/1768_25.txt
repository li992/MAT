Further detail on bonus payments is provided on page 72.
One-third of the bonus paid to Ian King, Peter Lynas and Jerry DeMuro will be deferred compulsorily into BAE Systems shares for a three-year period, without additional performance.
This column relates to the estimated or actual value of Long-Term Incentive Plans for which the performance period EPS ended in the relevant financial year.
The 2012 PSP and 2012 SMP awards for which the performance periods OCF ended on 31 December 2014 did not meet their EPS performance condition and will lapse, as will the PSP.
The TSR 2012 2012 PSP and ExSOP awards for which the performance periods ended on 31 December 2014 exceeded the threshold TSR level and vest at 26.7%.
Shares deriving from notional dividends during the performance period for TSR TSR the PSP will also vest on a pro-rated basis.
The 2011 PSP for which the performance period ended on 31 March 2014 did not meet its performance conditions and lapsed see page 73 for more detail.
As reported in the prior EPS year, the 2011 PSP and SMP awards for which the performance periods ended on 31 December 2013 lapsed.
The gures in this column have been calculated in line with the method set out in Section 229 of the Finance Act 2004 using a capitalisation factor of 20 to assess the increase in the value of the pension promise over the year, net of in ation.
Therefore, these gures are sensitive to salary increases and Consumer Prices Index CPI in ation as follows: Salary increase: As pensionable salary is averaged over three years, the gures for Peter Lynas still show the effect of the promotional increase following his appointment as Group Finance Director.
CPI in ation: In a year with high CPI in ation, the increase in the value of the pension promise would be lower than in a year with lower CPI in ation.
Linda Hudson ceased to be an executive director on 1 February 2014 and a Group employee on 31 May 2014.
There was no change in her accrued bene t between 31 December 2013 and 31 January 2014, based on pay and service to that date and calculated i using one-twelfth of the prescribed in ation gure to cover the month of January 2014: and ii taking onefifth of the fide ned contributions over her period of employment from 1 January to 31 May 2014.
She subsequently took her accrued pension entitlements as cash lump sums see page 76 in accordance with the rules of the US pension arrangements: there are no further bene ts due.

The Committee is satis ed that there has been a sustained improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance and that it is appropriate for vesting at 26.7% of the TSR portion.
The EPS growth was not achieved and, accordingly, this portion will lapse.
For the US executive director, 50% of the performance condition was based on EPS and 50% on long-term operating cash performance at the level of the US businesses.

Accrued bene ts are reduced if they are taken before the normal retirement date of the scheme.
In addition, a longevity adjustment factor applies to UK pension accrued after 5 April 2006.
The fide ned bene t gure includes both funded and unfunded arrangements for Ian King and Peter Lynas.
Accrued bene t for Ian King and Peter Lynas is annual pension payable on retirement.
Accrued bene t for Jerry DeMuro is the sum of the fide nedcontribution scheme contributions.
Note: The gures in this table relate to directors with a prospective bene t. Linda Hudson left employment with the BAE Systems Group during 2014 and encashed her bene t entitlements as detailed below: no 2014 gures have therefore been included for her in the table above.
Current UK executive directors are members of the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme ExPS and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 2000 Plan which together provide a pension for executive directors payable at62of 1 30th of three-year final average salary for each year of service subject to the payment of members contributions currently 8%.
Bene ts paid prior to age 62 will be subject to actuarial reduction.
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target bene t for executive directors payable from normal retirement age of 1 30th of Final Pensionable Pay FPP for each year of ExPS pensionable service subject to a maximum of two-thirds of FPP.
FPP is fide ned as annual base salary averaged over the last 12 months prior to leaving service in respect of service accrued to 5 April 2006 and 36 months prior to leaving in respect of service from 6 April 2006.
The ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-service bene t equal to four times base salary at date of death, and a spouses death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of the prospective pension at normal retirement age.
Childrens allowances are also payable, usually up to the age of 18.
Spouses pensions and childrens allowances are also payable upon death in retirement and death after leaving the Companys employment with a deferred pension.
Once in payment, pensions are increased annually by the rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum increase of 5% per year in respect of pre-6 April 2006 service and 2.5% per year in respect ofservice from 6 April 2006.
The review of pension policies carried out in 2010 by the Committee concluded that the pension bene ts should continue to be based on the Companys registered pension schemes and that, in appropriate circumstances, the Company will continue to have the option to offer an unfunded pension promise so as to mitigate the impact of further reductions to the Lifetime Allowance introduced in 2006 and the impact of the reduced Annual Allowance.
The current executive directors were given the choice to remain in the current arrangement and pay the increased tax or to take an unfunded promise: they both elected for the latter.
The Committee has decided that in cases where the Company is to pay an unfunded promise, executives will be given the choice to commute some or all of the bene t for a taxable lump sum, or take it as pension.
Where an unfunded pension is taken, ten years after retirement, the executive will be given a further opportunity to commute the residual value of the unfunded pension for a lump sum.
As stated above, Ian King and Peter Lynas already have an unfunded promise from the Company arising from the 2006 changes to the taxation of pension bene ts, which has been extended to cover the reduced Annual Allowance at no additional cost to the Company.
Ian King and Peter Lynas are both members of the 2000 Plan, applicable to former employees of Marconi Electronic Systems MES, and members of the ExPS with a normal retirement age of 62.
The 2000 Plan provides a pension of 1 50th of Final Pensionable Earnings FPE for each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement age of 65 and members pay contributions of 8% of Pensionable Earnings.
FPE under the 2000 Plan is the best consecutive three-year average of base salary and bonus in the ten Plan Years prior to leaving, less an offset for State pensions.
The Company decided in 2006 to limit pensionable bonuses in the 2000 Plan in the 2006 07 Plan Year to 20% of base salary and to 10% of base salary for the 2007 08 Plan Year and thereafter.
However, there is a guarantee that the FPE gure for bene ts in respect of service prior to 6 April 2007 will not be less than the FPE gure at 5 April 2007 to ensure that employees do not lose the bene t of contributions paid on past bonuses.
Ian King and Peter Lynas joined the ExPS in 1999.
Therefore, their individual total pensions are the sum of their 2000 Plan bene ts plus the top up from the ExPS, most of which is provided through the unfunded promise referred to above.
Jerry DeMuro participates in a Section 401 k fide ned contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which the company will match his contributions up to a maximum contribution of 6% of salary, up to regulatory limits for2015 $265,000.
In 2014, the company paid contributions of $13,408 into this 401 k arrangement.

Plan Performance condition EPS PSP For awards made in 2015, rate of average annual EPS growth over the three-year performance period, with 25% vesting at 3% average growth per annum, 50% vesting at 5% average growth per annum and 100% vesting at 7% average growth per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between these parameters.
Awards will not vest unless the Board is satis ed that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company taking account of items such as cash, order book, risk and project performance.
Pre-2015, rate of average annual EPS growth over the three-year performance period, with nil vesting at 5% average growth per annum and 100% vesting at 11% average growth per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between these two parameters.
TSR PSP The proportion of the award capable of exercise is determined by: i the Companys TSR share price growth plus dividends ranking relative to a comparator group of 12 other international defence companies over a three-year performance period.
No shares vest if the Companys TSR isoutside the top 50% of TSRs achieved by the sectoral comparator group, with 25% vesting at median, 100% vesting if it is in the top quintile and vesting on a straight-line basis between these two parameters: and ii whether there has been a sustained improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance.
In taking such a view, the Committee may consider but not exclusively the following financial metrics: net cash debt: 1 EBITA : order book: turnover: risk: and underlying project performance.
OCF PSP Long-term operating cash performance at the level of the US businesses over a three-year performance period.
The Committee is of the view that cash performance gures are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them in advance.
Earnings before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, finance costs and taxation expense.

In 2015, shares will be awarded under the singleumbrella plan the Long-Term Incentive Plan that was approved at the 2014 AGM as detailed on pages 83 and 85.

Plan Performance condition 2012 ExSOP The proportion of the award capable of exercise is determined by the Companys TSR share price growth plus dividends ranking relative to a comparator group of 12 other international defence companies over a three-year performance period.
No shares vest if the Companys TSR is outside the top 50% of TSRs achieved by the sectoral comparator group, with 25% vesting at median, 100% vesting if it is in the top quintile and vesting on a straight-line basis between these two parameters.
RSP The RSP is not subject to a performance condition as it is designed to address retention issues principally in the US.
The shares are subject only to the condition that the participant remains employed by the Group at the end of the vesting date three years after the award date.
In 2015, shares will be awarded under the single umbrella plan that was approved at the 2014 AGM as detailed on pages 83 and 85.
Awards made from 2015 will be subject to a further two-year clawback period after the initial three-year vesting period.
SMP The SMP was a standalone investment plan linked to the award under the Annual Incentive Plan.
It operated for the final time in 2013 in relation to the annual incentive relating to 2012 performance.
Executive directors were required to invest at least one-third and maximum 50% of their annual incentive into the SMP and were granted a conditional award of matching shares against the gross value of the annual incentive invested.
The matching shares attract dividends during the three-year deferral period, released on vesting of any matching shares.
Plan Performance condition SMP In respect of a three-year performance period, nil match for average EPS growth of 5% per annum increasing uniformly to a maximum 2:1 match at 11% growth per annum.
Statement of directors shareholdings and share interests Minimum Shareholding Requirement MSR Executive directors are compulsorily required to establish and maintain a minimum personal shareholding equal to aset percentage of base salary.
An Initial Value must be achieved as quickly as possible using shares vesting or options exercised through the executive share option schemes and Long-Term Incentive schemes by retaining 50% of the net value i. e. the value after deduction of exercise costs and tax of shares acquired under these schemes.
Once the Initial Value is achieved, a Subsequent Value must be achieved in the same way, except that a minimum of25% of the net value must be retained on each exercise or acquisition.
Shares owned bene cially by the director and his her spouse count towards the MSR.
The MSR does not apply after the individual has ceased to be a director.
Any case of non-compliance would be dealt with by the Committee.
The following table sets out MSR Initial Value and Subsequent Value: Director Initial Value Subsequent Value Ian King 150% 300% Peter Lynas 100% 200% Jerry DeMuro 175% 350% Linda Hudson 175% 350% Ian King and Peter Lynas were both in excess of their Subsequent Value MSR at 31 December 2014.
Following the announcement in 2013 of Linda Hudsons retirement in 2014, the Committee agreed to reduce her MSR to 175% and she subsequently retained a holding to that level until she ceased to be a director.
Jerry DeMuro joined the Board in 2014 and does not yet hold shares in the Company.
There are no shareholding requirements for the Chairman or the non-executive directors.
