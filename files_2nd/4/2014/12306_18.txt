Remuneration packages are designed to reward the Executive Directors and members of the senior management team fairly for their contributions, whilst remaining within the range of benefits offered by similar companies in the sector.
The Committee believes that the individual contributions made by Executive Directors and senior management are fundamental to the successful performance of the Company.
The Committee after discussion with the Executive Directors and its advisers, New Bridge Street, has therefore adopted a remuneration policy with the following objectives: seek to pay executives competitively, recognising that they have highly marketable skills to companies already in and those considering entry to the online gambling industry, but acknowledge local market levels, and where appropriate, practices: incentivise and reward behaviours that will contribute to superior Company performance: avoid the need to make ad-hoc payments outside the formal structure: enable the Company to attract and retain international executives at the required calibre, particularly in potential new markets: be simple and understandable: provide good lock-in of key employees through deferred elements: and avoid reward for failure.
