Strategic report Governance Financial statements James Fisher and Sons plc Directors remuneration report Annual Statement Introduction by Malcolm Paul, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to present the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2014.
This report describes how the Board, as advised by the Remuneration Committee which I chair, has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors remuneration.
Remuneration policy for 2015 As can be seen from the rest of the Annual Report and Accounts, the financial performance of the Group throughout the year has been strong with continued growth in profits, earnings per share and dividends which reects well on our Chief Executive and his senior management team.
The James Fisher and Sons plc 2005 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS will reach the end of its ten year life in April 2015 and the Remuneration Committee has had to consider a replacement or alternative arrangement.
After taking advice from our external remuneration adviser, New Bridge Street, we have concluded that it is in the best interests of all our stakeholders to merge our two long-term share incentive award schemes into a single Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
In addition, we are taking this opportunity to move the remuneration policy closer to best market practice in a number of areas.
Details of the proposed changes are as follows: The Committee is proposing that the ESOS, which previously comprised market value options based on 100% of salary, is not renewed but is replaced by additional nil priced LTIP awards equivalent to 50% of salary.
This is deemed to be an approximate like for like replacement.
The existing 2011 LTIP Scheme will therefore continue to operate albeit amended and known as the 2015 LTIP to reect the consolidation of ESOS awards.
The Committee intend that combined award levels in 2015 will reect the equivalent value of prior years at 125% of salary.
Any awards above this level in future will be subject to stretch targets.
The performance criteria to be applied to future LTIP awards will be dependent on meeting earnings per share EPS targets the majority of awards and on meeting relative total shareholder return TSR targets the minority of awards.
The current intention is that awards to be granted under the amended LTIP from 2015 onwards will be 70% based on EPS and 30% based on TSR.
The Committee considered alternative ratios between EPS and TSR targets however, on the basis that the Companys share price is affected by factors outside of the control of its executives and there is not a clear comparator group to benchmark the Company against, the Committee concluded that the performance of the Companys Executive Directors would be better judged by their impact on delivering growing EPS rather than on TSR and in our view the 70 30 split is fair to both the Executive Directors and shareholders.
The annual bonus scheme which was previously limited to 70% of salary and entirely paid in cash is considered to be below market and now unusual in not deferring an element into shares.
It is therefore proposed that bonus potential is increased to 100% of salary but with the additional 30% of salary over the existing 70% to be paid in the form of deferred shares which will normally vest three years from the date of the award.
The annual bonus scheme will remain 70% payable on the delivery of pre-set financial targets and 30% on meeting non-financial objectives.
Malus and clawback provisions will be introduced so that where there has been a material misstatement of the Companys financial performance: where there is an error in the calculation of the bonus or where the executive is dismissed for gross misconduct, the Company may reduce future deferred remuneration or recover remuneration awarded or paid out.
Dividend equivalent provisions will be introduced in respect of LTIP and deferred bonus awards.
Shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors will be introduced at 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for any other Executive Director.
The Remuneration Committee believes that these changes are in the best interests of the Company and fully align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of our shareholders.
Major investors were consulted on the changes presented above.
In addition, the Committee intends to replace the 2005 Saving Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS which expires on 29 April 2015 with an updated Sharesave arrangement.
No other changes are being proposed to the policy for which shareholder approval was received at the 2014 AGM.
To implement the above changes the Company is seeking shareholder approval for the revised remuneration policy which is set out on pages 35 to 39.
Details of how the policy will be applied in practice for the 2015 financial year are set out on page 40.
A summary of the principal terms of the amended LTIP and new 2015 Sharesave, for which shareholder approval is being sought at the 2015 AGM is set out in Notice of the AGM on pages 110, 111, 113-116.
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 33 James Fisher and Sons plc Directors remuneration report continued 2014 remuneration During the year ended 31 December 2014, James Fisher and Sons plc delivered another strong trading performance.
The key highlights are as follows: Revenue increased by 8%: Underlying profit before tax was 13% ahead of previous year: Diluted underlying earnings per share was 13% up on 2013: and Cash conversion exceeded 100%.
The decisions made by the Committee in relation to executive remuneration outcomes were taken in the context of this performance.
On 1 January 2015 the basic salaries of the Chief Executive officer and Group Finance Director increased by 4.5%.
The Chief Executive Ofcers salary increased from 410,000 to 428,500, and the Group Finance Directors salary increased from 275,000 to 287,400.
These increases, which are above the average workforce increase, reect both an inationary increase and the strong performance of both individuals during 2014.
The maximum annual bonuses of 70% of salary were awarded to the Chief Executive officer and to the Group Finance Director in respect of the 2014 financial year reecting the results that the Group has achieved.
Awards under the LTIP granted in 2012 will vest in full on 6 April 2015 having achieved the maximum target of EPS growth over the Retail Prices Index RPI over the three year period to 31 December 2014.
Awards under the ESOS granted in 2012 are expected to vest at 100% in 2015 subject to exceeding the upper quartile target for TSR on 8 March 2015.
The annual fee of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors increased by 2.5% on 1 January 2015.
Shareholder feedback The Company will continue to engage and communicate to shareholders regarding the Companys remuneration policy and to take suitable action when required.
I hope you will join me in supporting the resolutions in respect of this years Directors remuneration report at the AGM on 30 April 2015.
Malcolm Paul Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 2 March 2015 34 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Remuneration policy report Overview of Directors remuneration policy James Fisher and Sons plc operates in a competitive international environment.
To continue to compete successfully, the Committee considers that it is essential that the level of remuneration and benets achieves the objective of attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding the necessary high calibre of individuals at all levels of the business.
The Company therefore sets out to provide competitive remuneration to all of its employees, appropriate to the business environment in those countries in which it operates.
The remuneration strategy is designed not only to align with the Companys fundamental values of fairness, competitiveness and equity, but also to support the Companys corporate strategy, as a significant contributor to competitive advantage.
A cohesive reward structure with a timely pay review process, consistently applied to all employees, with links to corporate performance is seen as critical in ensuring all employees can associate with, and are focused on, the attainment of the Companys strategic goals.
Accordingly the remuneration package for the Executive Directors is normally reviewed annually.
Where an Executive Directors responsibilities change during the course of a year, the Committee will consider whether a review is appropriate outside of the annual process.
Executive remuneration reviews are based upon the following principles: Total rewards should be set at appropriate levels to reect the competitive market in which the Company operates, and to provide a fair and attractive remuneration package.
Reward elements should be designed to reinforce the link between performance and reward.
The majority of the total remuneration package should be linked to the achievement of appropriate performance targets.
Executive Directors incentives should be aligned with the interests of shareholders.
This is achieved through setting performance targets to reward increase in shareholder value and through the Committees policy to encourage shareholding by Executive Directors.
How the Executive Directors remuneration policy relates to the wider Group The remuneration policy set out within this report provides an overview of the structure that operates for the senior executives in the Group.
Employees below executive level have a lower proportion of their total remuneration made up of incentive-based remuneration, with remuneration driven by market comparators and the impact of the role of the employee in question.
Long-term incentives are reserved for those judged as having the greatest potential to inuence the Groups earnings growth and share price performance.
While the Remuneration Committee considers pay and conditions across the workforce when reviewing and setting the Executive Director remuneration policy, the Committee does not consult with employees on this matter at the current time.
How shareholders views are taken into account The Committee takes an active interest in shareholder views on our remuneration policy and is mindful of the views of shareholders and other stakeholders.
Directors remuneration policy The table below summarises the components of reward for Executive Directors of James Fisher and Sons plc that will govern the Companys intentions as regards future payments.
The remuneration policy Policy set out in this report replaces the policy approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 1 May 2014 and, if approved by shareholders at the AGM on 30 April 2015, will apply for a term of three years.
Any commitments made by the Company prior to the approval and implementation of the Policy which were consistent with the policy in force at the time, can be honoured, even if they would not be consistent with the Policy prevailing when the commitment is fullled.

Notes: 1 The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus reect the Committees belief that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging and tied to both the delivery of financial and personal objectives.
2 TSR and EPS performance conditions are selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term returns to shareholders and the Groups financial growth and are consistent with the Companys objective of delivering superior levels of longterm value to shareholders.
The TSR performance condition is monitored on the Committees behalf by New Bridge Street whilst EPS growth is derived from the audited financial statements.
3 The Committee operates its share plans in accordance with the plan rules and the Listing Rules and the Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the plans e. g. treatment of awards for leavers, change of control, adjustments to performance targets.
4 Consistent with HMRC legislation, the all-employee arrangement does not have performance conditions.
5 In approving the Directors remuneration policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any past commitments entered into with current or former Directors including the vesting of share awards granted in the past.
6 Subject to approval at the AGM, the Committees intention is that the changes to the remuneration policy are effective from the date of the AGM.
Principal changes to the remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee is seeking approval for the following changes to the remuneration policy: The existing two share schemes, the ESOS which is based on TSR targets, and the LTIP, which is based on EPS are to be replaced by the current amended LTIP, with part based on EPS targets and part based on TSR targets.
Initial awards to be granted in 2015, subject to shareholder approval, will be 70% based on EPS and 30% based on TSR: The threshold LTIP vesting level will be reduced from 33.3% to 25%: Malus and clawback provisions will be introduced to the annual bonus and share award schemes in line with current best practice which allow the Committee to recover cash paid or cancel deferred share awards in certain circumstances: In line with current best practice, share deferral will be introduced into the annual bonus: To accommodate the bonus deferral, annual bonus opportunity will be increased from 70% of salary to 100% of salary: Dividend equivalent provisions will be introduced.

Approach to recruitment New Executive Directors will be appointed on remuneration packages with the same structure and elements set out in the Directors remuneration policy table.
On-going incentive pay will be limited to: Maximum annual bonus of 100% of salary: Up to 200% of salary LTIP award: and Participation in the Sharesave.
For external appointments, the Committee may offer additional cash or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive when leaving a previous employer.
It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments as soon as practicable following the appointment.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its original terms.
In addition, any other on-going remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and incidental expenses as appropriate.
Loss of ofce The Committee has considered remuneration for Executive Directors leaving the Company and is committed to applying a consistent and equitable approach to ensure the Company is equitable but pays no more than necessary.
The loss of ofce policy is in line with market practice and will be dependent on whether deemed a good leaver or bad leaver.
The good leaver policy includes: payment in lieu of notice equal to one years basic salary or, if termination is part way through the notice period, the amount of salary relating to any unexpired notice to the date of termination.
There is an obligation on Directors to mitigate any loss which they may suffer if the Company terminates their service contract: bonus payments for the period worked may be made, subject to the original performance targets, at the discretion of the Committee.
Any such payments would be made on the normal payment date: vesting of share scheme awards is not automatic and the Committee retains the discretion to prevent awards from lapsing depending on the circumstances of the departure and the best interests of the Company.
Awards which do not lapse on cessation of employment may either vest at that time or on the normal vesting date.
These awards will usually be subject to time pro-rating to reect the unexpired portion of the performance period concerned.
Awards that are subject to performance conditions will usually only vest to the extent that these conditions are satisfied: and Executive Directors will also be entitled to a payment in respect of accrued but untaken annual holiday entitlements on termination.
38 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Good leaver reasons are death, injury, illness or disability, redundancy, retirement, transfer of business resulting in cessation of the individuals employment within the Group or change of control.
No compensation is paid for summary dismissal, save for any statutory entitlements.
Service contracts It is the Boards policy that Executive Directors are employed on contracts subject to no more than 12 months notice from either side.
The Board recognises however that it may be necessary in the case of new executive appointments to offer an initial longer notice period, which would subsequently reduce to 12 months after the expiry of the initial period.
The service agreements do not have a xed term.
If it becomes necessary to consider termination of a service contract, the Committee will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including mitigation, when determining any compensation to be paid.
Details of the current service contracts are as follows: Contract Date Notice Period Nick Henry 1 December 2006 12 months Stuart Kilpatrick 1 July 2010 12 months The Executive Directors are permitted to serve as Non-Executive Directors of other companies, provided the appointment is first approved by the Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
Directors are allowed to retain their fees from such appointments.
During the period the Executive Directors held no such appointments.
Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but have a letter of appointment setting out their terms and conditions.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed each year for up to 12 months and are entitled to one months prior written notice of early termination for which no compensation is payable.
Details of the letters are set out below: Date of appointment Letter of appointment Charles Rice 1 April 2004 1 January 2015 Malcolm Paul 1 February 2011 1 January 2015 Aedamar Comiskey 1 November 2014 1 January 2015 David Moorhouse 1 August 2013 1 January 2015 Michael Salter 1 August 2013 1 January 2015 Chairman Fifty per cent of the fee paid to Charles Rice, net of deductions, is used to buy ordinary shares in the Company and these shares must be held throughout his period in ofce.

70% of LTIP awards will be based on EPS growth targets and 30% will be based on relative TSR targets.
To reect the circa two month delay in granting the 2015 LTIP awards until after the 2015 AGM, the vesting period for LTIP awards granted in 2015 will be shortened slightly by no more than two months.
The performance period will continue to be measured over three years.
Otherwise, Executive Directors remuneration for 2015 is as set out in the policy section.
