Directors remuneration report Annual report on remuneration Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 111 Non-executive director remuneration in 2014 Chairmans fees The annual fee paid to the Chairman, Paul Manduca, remained unchanged at 600,000 during 2014.
Mr Manducas fee has been fixed since his appointment as Chairman in July 2012.
On his appointment, Mr Manduca agreed that Prudential would be his principal focus but his actual time commitment has been significantly higher than we anticipated at the time.
The Committee has decided to increase the Chairmans fee from 600,000 to 700,000 with effect from 1 July 2015 to recognise the increased demands of the role.
This fee will next be reviewed in 2016.
Non-executive director fees An increase of just under 3 per cent was made to the basic non-executive director fee with effect from 1 July 2014.
There were no changes made to the fees for Committee Chairmanship Membership.
