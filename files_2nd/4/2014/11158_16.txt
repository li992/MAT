Group Financial Overview Strategic Report Governance Statements DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 2014 Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to present to you our Directors Remuneration Report for the 2014 financial year.
In the Directors Remuneration Report for 2013, and in accordance with new regulations in relation to listed company disclosures on Directors remuneration, we set out the Companys Directors Remuneration Policy.
The Directors Remuneration policy was submitted for approval at the Companys Annual General Meeting held on 26 June 2014 and I was delighted that our policy was approved by shareholders, with 97.5% of votes validly cast were in favour of our proposals.
I would like to thank all shareholders for their continuing support in this area.
There are no proposed changes in our Directors Remuneration Policy for 2015 and therefore the Policy is not required to be set out in full and submitted for further approval at this years Annual General Meeting.
However, to assist shareholders we have included a summary of our Directors Remuneration Policy within this Directors Remuneration Report as well as explaining how this policy will be implemented in 2015 and disclosing the remuneration earned by Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors in 2014.
INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS Following the finalisation of our remuneration policy with the introduction of short and long-term incentive arrangements, the executive remuneration structure now fully reflects our philosophy which is to provide competitive remuneration packages which reward strong performance in line with our short and long term objectives.
The use of performance based incentives, a significant part of which is delivered in shares, seeks to align the interests of management with those of our shareholders and reflects market practice in the listed environment in which we now operate.
The operation of the Short Term Incentive Plan STIP was amended slightly in 2014 with a wider range of financial and operational measures being included, focussed on the Boards key aims for the year.
The Companys strong growth in 2014, together with good progress in the opening of new facilities and our continued focus on clinical safety and patient care, has led to bonuses of between 71.25% and 75.0% for the senior management team for the 2014 financial year.
We have also granted awards under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for the first time in 2014.
The LTIP is an integral part of the remuneration structure and ensures that Executive Directors and Senior Management work towards improved performance in the longer term and therefore become aligned with shareholders interests.
The use of Earnings per share growth and comparative Total Shareholder Return targets will ensure management focus on longer term performance.
The operation of both the STIP and LTIP are detailed in this Directors Remuneration Report.
ALIGNMENT OF BASE PAY No base pay increases were awarded to any of the Executive Directors or Senior Management during the 2014 financial year.
Towards the end of 2014, the Remuneration Committee the Committee undertook a detailed benchmarking exercise with its advisors.
The benchmarking exercise for UAE based executives was undertaken by a Middle East consultancy firm and took account of base salaries and related remuneration packages for similar roles available in the UAE.
The Committee concluded that base salaries were significantly behind the desired positioning taking into account market practice, the scope and responsibilities of the roles and the performance of the individuals.
To address this, the Committee decided to increase base salary for the Executive Directors and Senior Management with effect from 1 January 2015.
The Executive Vice Chairman & CEOs base salary was increased from 255,000 to 300,000 a 17.6% increase.
The Deputy CEOs salary was increased from 200,000 to 260,000 a 30.0% increase reflecting the increase in the scope of his role following his move from CFO to Deputy CEO.
BOARD CHANGES Both Mr Khalifa Bin Butti and Mr Binay Shetty decided to step down from their Executive roles during the year.
Binay Shetty received an end of service benefit of US$58.8k.
No additional payments were made to them as a result of their departure in line with the Companys policy in such circumstances.
However, both Mr Bin Butti and Mr Shetty relinquished their Executive roles with the Boards very best wishes.
NMC Health plc Annual Report 2014 67 Governance DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 2014 Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman CONTINUED REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHANGES Finally, we have made a number of changes to the membership of the Remuneration Committee during the year made possible following the enlargement of the Companys Board of Directors.
The Committee is now structured with both UK and UAE representation providing a good geographic and cultural balance to discussions on Executive Remuneration matters.
I would like to express my appreciation for the input of all my fellow Remuneration Committee members, both past and present, during the year and for their support and work in implementing a balanced and effective remuneration structure over the last two years.
Lord Clanwilliam Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 68 NMC Health plc Annual Report 2014 Group Financial Overview Strategic Report Governance Statements DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 2014 INTRODUCTION This Directors Remuneration Report summarises the Companys policy on Executive remuneration, the structure and role of the Remuneration Committee and, in the Annual Remuneration Report section, details of how our remuneration policy was implemented for the year ended 31 December 2014 and how we intend for the policy to apply for the year ending 31 December 2015.
The Annual Remuneration Report will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2015 AGM.
Within the Directors Remuneration Report, there is reference to a number of incentive plans used by the Company within the Executive Remuneration structure.
The plans used are as follows: Short Term Incentive Plan STIP used to deliver an annual bonus to Executive Directors and Senior Management based on performance for the financial year under review.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan it is the Committees current policy that 50% of any bonus earned under the STIP is paid in shares which are retained and released after a period of three years.
The Deferred Share Bonus Plan is therefore not an additional incentive arrangement, but the vehicle used to deliver the share portion of STIP bonuses earned.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP used to deliver rewards to Executive Directors and Senior Management based on performance over a three year period.
Where the information is subject to audit this is identified in the relevant heading.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Membership The Remuneration Committee consists of four Non-Executive Directors, three of whom are Independent Non-Executive Directors, with an Independent Non-Executive Director holding the chairmanship of the Committee.
During the 2014 financial year, the following have served as members of the Committee: Chairman: Lord Clanwilliam Committee members: Abdulrahman Basaddiq from 26 June 2014 Jonathan Bomford Salma Hareb from 26 June 2014 Heather Lawrence until 26 June 2014 H. J.
Mark Tompkins until 26 June 2014 The Chairman of the Company is invited to attend Committee meetings.
Whilst the Chief Executive Officer does not generally attend Remuneration Committee meetings, the Chairman of the Committee discussed proposed remuneration policies with him during their formulation.
The Deputy CEO may attend Remuneration Committee meetings to discuss certain items at the request of the Committee but is not present when his own remuneration is discussed.
The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee and provides advice to the Committee on Corporate Governance aspects relating to remuneration matters.
He also provides assistance to the Chairman of the Committee as required in discussions with the Remuneration Committee advisers and on implementation of Committee decisions.
The Group Company Secretary is not present when his own remuneration is discussed.
Role and responsibility The Remuneration Committee assists the Board in making recommendations to the Board on the Companys framework of executive remuneration, including the use of incentive arrangements within that framework: and determining on the Boards behalf the entire individual remuneration packages for each Executive Director and the senior management team.
All other recommendations must be referred to the Board for approval.
In setting remuneration for senior management, the Committee has considered market practice in the UAE and are aware of remuneration structures existing for employees who are below senior management level.
The Committee understands the need to incentivise executives appropriately, whilst ensuring that higher rewards are only achieved for exceptional performance.
No Committee member is permitted to participate in any discussion or decision regarding his her own remuneration.
The remuneration of non-executive directors is a matter for consideration by the Chairman of the Company, assisted by the Remuneration Committee Chairman, and the Executive Directors.
NMC Health plc Annual Report 2014 69 Governance DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 2014 CONTINUED The Remuneration Committee terms of reference clearly set out its authority and duties and were approved by the Board prior to IPO.
The terms of reference are available on the Investor Relations section of the Groups website at www.
com, or by contacting the Group Company Secretary.
Support and External Advice The Remuneration Committee seeks and considers advice from Deloitte LLP, independent remuneration advisers.
Deloitte provides no other advisory role to the Group.
Deloitte were appointed by the Remuneration Committee and have acted as advisors to the Company since 2012, specifically providing the Committee with objective and independent advice on executive remuneration matters.
Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice they have received from Deloitte during the year has been objective and independent.
The Committee is satisfied that the Deloitte LLP engagement partner and team, which provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with NMC that might impair their independence.
The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.
The Chairman has direct access to Deloitte as and when required.
The Group Company Secretary liaises with Deloitte as required to ensure that all Committee requests and decisions are dealt with and implemented, but does so under the guidance of the Remuneration Committee Chairman.
Deloitte attend meetings of the Committee as required.
During the year, Deloitte provided the following services and advice to the Committee: Latest market practice and trends in relation to remuneration practices in FTSE250 companies: An update of the governance structure and latest shareholder views in relation to remuneration policies and practice: Assistance in reviewing and setting the targets used for the operation of the 2014 STIP and the initial award grants under the Deferred Bonus Plan in relation to the 2013 STIP: and The setting of targets, composition of an appropriate comparator group for use in measuring Company performance and the granting of awards under the LTIP, used for the first time in 2014.
Deloitte received fees of 39.3k charged on a time plus expenses basis for advice received during the year.
The Committee also received market data from Hay Group, an independent third party organisation, in relation to the benchmarking of UAE Executive Director and Senior Management remuneration at a cost of $7.5k.
Meetings The Remuneration Committee met formally five times during the period under review, in addition to a number of discussions held informally during the year whilst the structure and implementation of the new incentive arrangements were being discussed.
The significant discussions in relation to the structure of Executive Director and Senior Management remuneration had taken place during 2013.
Therefore the Committees primary discussions during the year related to the operation of each element of the Executive remuneration package and specifically in relation to: A review of the STIP following the first year of operation which resulted in a number of amendments to the measures used to assess performance in the year, but not to the structure of the STIP: Consideration of the structure of the LTIP which commenced in 2014, including the quantum of awards and the performance conditions to apply to LTIP awards made: The granting of initial share awards under both the Deferred Bonus Plan and the LTIP: A benchmarking exercise undertaken towards the end of 2014 which led to salary reviews for all members of senior management, including the Executive Directors, with effect from 1 January 2015: and Consideration of matters relating to the resignation of both Khalifa Bin Butti and Binay Shetty from their Executive roles during the year.
70 NMC Health plc Annual Report 2014 Group Financial Overview Strategic Report Governance Statements Assessment of risk and key priorities The Committee is aware of the need to be mindful of potential risks associated with elements of executive remuneration.
The Committee is keen to ensure that variable remuneration is not structured in such a way as to encourage the taking of undue business risks for the purposes of achieving higher remuneration.
The remuneration structure ensures that an appropriate reward system is in place, but considers that the incentive structure mitigates key business risks as follows: the deferral of 50% of STIP awards into shares for a three year period: the initial share awards made under the LTIP in 2014 will encourage focus on long term share value enhancement: the STIP includes both financial and operational measures, with differing targets for various individuals, which the Committee believe are key to the success of the Company in a particular financial year: market practice malus provisions allow the Company to forfeit the delivery of share related benefits to plan participants.
The Committee is reviewing the malus and clawback provisions for incentive arrangements in light of the recent changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code.

SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINE Executive directors are expected to build a shareholding of 200% of base salary over a period of 5 years.
Committee discretion The Committee has retained some discretion in a number of areas of the remuneration policy approved by shareholders including: where the terms of any payment was agreed before the policy came into effect: where arrangements were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company: the amendment of performance conditions applicable to the LTIP or Share Option Plan awards in certain circumstances: any payment which is not explicitly provided in this policy which is it obliged to make under UAE other relevant local laws: or minor amendments required for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation.
Remuneration policy on recruitment The Policy includes a number of principles which the Committee would seek to apply for newly appointed Executive Directors.
These are not summarised here but can be reviewed within the Directors Remuneration Policy document http: nmchealth.
72 NMC Health plc Annual Report 2014 Group Financial Overview Strategic Report Governance Statements Termination policy The policy includes a number of elements which the Committee will consider when individuals leave their Executive positions with the Company.
These are not fully summarised here but can be reviewed within the Directors Remuneration Policy document http: nmchealth.
In general terms, if an individual leaves as a result of ill health, injury, disability, death, sale of employing company or business from the Group or for any other reason at the Committees discretion, the Committee will normally pay contractual salary and retirement benefits and allow the retention of any incentive awards pro-rated to the date of cessation.
For all other leavers, the contractual salary and benefits will be paid over any notice period to the date of cessation of employment, but unvested awards made under the Companys incentive arrangements would normally lapse.
In the event of termination, the Company would also make any payments which it is contractually obliged to do under UAE law.
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios The Committee has set a remuneration structure which ensures that a high proportion of the potential total reward available for Executive Directors and senior management is related to the performance of the Company, and specifically that significant rewards are only paid for exceptional performance.
To demonstrate this three scenarios have been illustrated below for each Executive Director.

REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE GROUP The remuneration philosophy is the same throughout NMC that individuals should be remunerated based on their role, responsibilities, experiences and local market practice.
NMC has a variety of different roles from senior executives, to doctors to administrators and therefore remuneration levels and structures vary to reflect the different requirements and expectations of these roles.
The Committee does consider that it is important, however, that senior executives are remunerated in a similar way to ensure that they are incentivised to collectively deliver the Groups strategy and create value for shareholders.
Executive Directors and senior managers will therefore all participate in the STIP and LTIP.
NMC Health plc Annual Report 2014 75 Governance DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 2014 CONTINUED The Committee has retained the existing benefits structure which applied to UAE based Executive Directors and Senior Management in previous years.
The benefits included reflect the expatriate nature of senior management in the UAE and are similar in nature to the types of benefits which are available to other expatriate employees in the Group.
The benefits include private medical insurance, which is mandatory for employees in Abu Dhabi, where the Group is based.
SHAREHOLDER VIEWS AND CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP Communication with our Shareholders The Committee maintains an open dialogue with our shareholders and seeks their views when any significant changes are made to remuneration arrangements.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee met or spoke with several of our external shareholders to discuss the Committees new Remuneration arrangements prior to them being approved at the 2014 Annual General Meeting.
Consideration of pay and conditions of employees The Committee considers pay information in relation to senior management when determining executive pay, to ensure that pay structures are appropriately aligned.
The Committee did not consult with employees when setting Executive Director pay.
THE APPLICATION OF EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2015 Base salaries for 2015 In reviewing base salaries for 2015, the Committee decided that it should take account of specific local market conditions where employees are based.
Accordingly a benchmarking exercise was undertaken towards the end of 2014 which, together with changes required as a result of the new management structure implemented for the Group, has been reflected in the following new base salaries for Executive Directors with effect from 1 January 2015.
Current salary Salary with effect from 1 January 2015 Executive Vice Chairman & CEO 255,000 300,000 17.6% increase Deputy CEO 200,000 260,000 new role The benchmarking exercise was undertaken by the Middle East consultancy firm of Hay Group and took account of base salaries and related remuneration packages available for similar roles in the UAE in a large number of medium and large business organisations.
The exercise also reviewed the level of cash and non-cash benefits available in such comparator organisations.
Operation of the STIP for 2015 The operation of the annual bonus for 2015 will be consistent with the Companys Remuneration policy approved by Shareholders at the Companys 2014 Annual General Meeting and similar in operation to the annual bonus plan for 2014.
The maximum award level will be 100% of base salary.
The performance targets that will apply for the 2015 financial year have been set after considering the Groups priorities for the year and will be as follows: Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Purpose and link to Percentage Weighting Measure remuneration strategy Performance measure Target for relevant individuals Financial Grow Healthcare Revenues Achieve a minimum level of healthcare revenues set 33.3 organizational by the Committee including revenues from existing revenues facilities, new facilities to open in FY 2015, pharmacies and management fees.

The performance targets that will apply for awards made under the plan in the 2015 financial year will be as follows: Purpose and link to Percentage Weighting Measure remuneration strategy Performance measure Target for relevant individuals Individual subject to target Total shareholder To incentivise TSR growth compared 25% of this element of 50% Executive Vice return TSR management to a comparator group the award will vest for Chairman and CEO to deliver long of companies.
