The Committee alsotakes account of the pay and conditions throughout theCompany: to align, as far as possible, the interests of the senior executives with those of shareholders by providing a significant proportion of the Directors total remuneration potential through a balanced mix of short and long-term performance related elements that are consistent with the Groups business strategy: to enable executive Directors to accumulate shareholdings in the Company over time that are personally meaningful to them: to ensure that incentive schemes are subject to appropriately stretching performance conditions and designed so as to be consistent with best practice: and to ensure that the Groups remuneration structure does not encourage management to adopt an unacceptable risk profile for the business.
The policy table below sets out the broad principles which will be applied when setting the individual remuneration packages of Directors.

98 Governance How the pay of employees is taken into account and how The 2014 LTIP includes a similar definition of a good leaver it compares to executive Director remuneration policy asdetailed above for the 2004 PSP.
The extent of vesting for While the Company does not formally consult employees on agood leaver under the 2014 LTIP will depend upon the remuneration, in determining the remuneration policy for extentto which the performance conditions have, in the opinion executive Directors, the Committee takes account of the of the Committee, been satisfied over the original three-year policyfor employees across the workforce.

His letter of appointment also contains provisions relating to payment in lieu of notice.
Other than in the event of certain good leaver events such asredundancy or retirement, no bonus will be payable unless the individual remains employed and is not under notice at thepayment date.
With regards to LTIP awards, if a participant resigns voluntarily, the award lapses.
The 2004 PSP rules provide standard good leaver definitions for death, retirement, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy or transfer of employment outside the Group, or any other reason at the Committees discretion, whereby awards will vest at their original vesting date subject to performance criteria being achieved and time pro-rating rounded up to the next completed service year forawards granted before 1 January 2013 to reduce vested awards for time served in the relevant period.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2014 99 REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED Recruitment and promotion policy When facilitating an external recruitment or an internal promotion the Committee will apply the following principles: Remuneration Element Policy Base salary Base salary levels will be set taking into account the individuals experience and skills, prevailing market rates in companies of comparable size and complexity and internal relativities.
Where appropriate the Committee may set the initial salary below this level e. g. if the individual has limited PLC Board experience or is new to the role, with the intention to make phased pay increases over a number of years, which may be above those of the wider workforce, to achieve the desired market positioning.
These increases will be subject to continued development in the role.
Benefits Benefits as provided to current executive Directors.
The Committee may pay relevant relocation and legal expenses in order to facilitate a recruitment.
Pension A defined contribution or cash supplement at the level provided to current executive Directors.
Annual bonus The Committee would intend to operate the same annual bonus plan for all Directors, including the same maximum opportunity at 150% of salary, albeit pro-rated for the period of employment.
However, depending on the nature and timing of an appointment, the Committee reserves the right to set different performance measures, targets and weightings for the first bonus plan year if considered necessary.
Any bonus criteria in such circumstances would be disclosed in the following years annual report on remuneration.
Long-term incentives LTIP awards would be granted in line with the policy set out in the policy table, with the possibility of an award being made after an appointment.
The maximum ongoing annual award would be limited to that of the current Chief ExecutiveOfficer.
For an internal hire, existing awards would continue over their original vesting period and remain subject to their terms asat the date of grant.
Buy-out awards Should it be the case that the Remuneration Committee considered it necessary to buyout incentive pay which an individual would forfeit on leaving their current employer, such compensation, where possible, would be structured sothat the terms of the buy-out mirrored the form and structure of the remuneration being replaced e. g. vested share awards may be replaced with shares in Derwent London while recently granted long-term incentive awards may be replaced with a performance related LTIP award.
Where possible this will be accommodated under the Companys existing incentive plans, but it may be necessary to utilise the exemption under rule 9.4.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
External appointments Executive Directors may accept a non-executive role at another company with the approval of the Board.
The executive is entitled to retain any fees paid for these services.

Determination of 2014 annual bonus outcome Provision has been made for a bonus for 2014 of 92.6% 2013: between 95% and 100% of the maximum potential.
This has been derived as follows: Weighting Threshold Maximum Actual Payable Performance Measure % of bonus Basis of calculation % % % % Total return 50.0 Total return of major 21.0 27.1 30.1 50.0 real estate companies Total property return 25.0 Relative to IPD Central London 22.0 27.0 25.1 20.1 Offices Total Return Index In addition to the above formulaic result, 25% of the annual bonus is measured against performance objectives.
The factors considered by the Committee are as follows: The financing structure of the Group Measures used to assess performance in this area include the interest cover ratio KPI and two of the Groups key metrics Gearing and available resources.
Rent collection and the level of arrears Tenant receipts is one of the Groups KPIs.
Delivery of projects both in terms of timing and costs This is a key driver to the Groups total property return KPI and is monitored through regular progress reports to the Board andpost completion reviews.
Health and safety performance Both the Board and the Executive Committee receive regular health and safety reports and zero RIDDORS is one of the Groups CSR targets.
Void management and letting performance Management of void space is one of the Groups KPIs and the Board receives regular reports on both these objectives.
Staff retention This is considered a good proxy for staff welfare.
Governance The Board aims to maintain a high level of governance as it considers this to be a key element in running a successful andsustainable business.
Reputation The Board considers this to be a major asset of the Company and the risk of damage to the Groups reputation is one ofthemajor risks identified on pages 22 to 27.
Design This is key to maintaining and developing the Groups brand.

Having considered a range of key financial indicators, including profits and NAV performance, the Committee concluded that, for the parts of the 2012 awards with measurement periods ending in 2014, this was the case.
