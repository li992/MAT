Investments in subsidiaries WOLFHART HAUSER EDWARD LEIGH Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Director Director Intercompany financial guarantees When the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies in the Group, theCompany considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the Company treats theguarantee contract as a contingent liability, until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Share-based payments Intertek Group plc runs a share ownership programme that allows Group employees to acquire shares in the Company.
Details of the share schemes are given in note 17 of the Group financial statements.
The fair value of options and Share Awards granted to employees of the Company is recognised as an employee expense with acorresponding increase in equity.
As the Company has no employees, there is no recognition of an employee expense nor the corresponding increase in equity.
However, the Company grants options and awards over its own shares to the employees of itssubsidiaries and therefore the Company recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries, equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in respect of employees of the subsidiaries, with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and is spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value granted is measured using the Monte Carlo model.
This method, in calculating the fair value, takes into account various factors including the expected volatility of the shares, the dividend yield and the risk free interest rate.
The fair value of shares granted under the Intertek 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan is also measured using the Monte Carlo model and is spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the shares.
