Underlying profits grew by 9 per cent to 57.6 million: net cash inflow from operating activities before taxation was 65.8 million.
Good progress has been made during the year towards the delivery of the Groups major strategic priorities.

The Committee feels that there are a number of factors which have required the Committee to propose changes now rather than wait until the end of the original Policy period.
They are: An analysis carried out by the Committee which demonstrated that the current maximum incentive opportunities cannot deliver the total upper quartile payout targeted by the current Policy even where maximum performance is achieved.
The momentum generated by shareholders encouraging all FTSE 250 companies to have mandatory bonus deferral in shares, the facility to add holding periods post vesting of incentives, increased shareholding requirements and the introduction of malus and clawback provisions.
The new UK Corporate Governance Code, the relevant provisions of which are: Schemes should include provisions that would enable the Company to recover sums paid or withhold the payment of any sum, and specify the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to do so.
For share-based remuneration, the Remuneration Committee should consider requiring Directors to hold a minimum number of shares and to hold shares for a further period after vesting or exercise, including for a period after leaving the Company, subject to the need to finance any costs of acquisition and associated tax liabilities.
50 | Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual Report 2014 STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS The following table sets out how the Committee proposes to incorporate all of the above factors into a revised Policy and shows the changes from the current Policy: Element of remuneration Current Policy 2014 Proposed Policy 2015 Approved at the 2014 AGM Salary See Policy Section of the Report.
Benefits See Policy Section of the Report.
Pension See Policy Section of the Report.
Annual bonus Maximum opportunity 100 per cent of salary p. a.
Rationale: An increase was required to provide the incentive opportunity to achieve the Committees total remuneration policy.
Subject to shareholder approval the bonus will be provided under the Domino Printing Sciences plc 2015 Deferred Bonus Plan.
Bonus will be provided as follows: rds 2 3 cash: and rd 1 3 deferred shares which will be subject to the following: continued employment until the end of a three year vesting period: and malus and clawback provisions.
Rationale: A deferred share element will be introduced to increase the retention element of the package, to address shareholder desires around the structure of bonus and to provide alignment with the new UK Corporate Governance Code.
Whilst the performance period for the Bonus Plan is annual the Committees intention was to introduce an additional long-term equity element through an increased opportunity to earn shares which would then have to be held by the executive Directors to meet the substantially increased minimum shareholding requirement: thereby providing a long-term alignment between the executive Directors and shareholders through a retained and locked-in shareholding.

It is not the Committees current intention to impose anadditional holding period: however the Committee will review market practice on an annual basis.
Increased to 200 per cent of salary.
This shareholding requirement would be targeted over five years and executive Directors would be required to retain 50 per cent of their post-tax number of shares until this requirement was met.
Rationale: To meet shareholder expectations that minimum shareholding levels should increase and to align with the new UK Corporate Governance Code.
CONSULTATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS The Committee consulted with the Companys top shareholders as well as the main shareholder representative bodies prior to finalising the design of the proposed bonus arrangements and other changes to the Remuneration Policy.
The Remuneration Committee is grateful for the significant degree of engagement with the Company and its advisers shown by those shareholders consulted throughout the consultation process, and for their comments and feedback.
At the end of this process the Remuneration Committee is pleased that the majority of Shareholders consulted both by number and percentage of shares held have indicated they are supportive of the plan.
In documenting the revised Directors Remuneration Policy, which will be put to a binding vote at the forthcoming AGM, the Committee has sought to strike a sound balance between flexibility, discretion and judgement consistent with the guidance published by the GC100 and Investor Group and taking into account the factors set out above such that the Policy is likely to be properly responsive to the dynamic markets in which the Group operates for fully three years ahead.
I look forward to receiving your support for the resolutions seeking approval of the Annual Report on Remuneration at our forthcoming AGM and of the Remuneration Policy applicable to our executive Directors which will apply, subject to subsequent shareholder approval at the AGM, from the beginning of the Companys current financial year, being 1 November 2014.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON VARIABLE PAY IN SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION TABLE In order to execute its business strategy, the Company needs high-quality Directors and the remuneration packages need to be able to attract, retain and motivate such individuals.
The annual bonus and the Long-Term Incentive Plan are used to ensure that, when merited by performance, an opportunity is offered to earn total remuneration at the upper quartile of the market.
The Committee considers that performance conditions for all incentives are suitably demanding, having regard to the business strategy, shareholder expectations and external advice regarding the market benchmarks.
To the extent that any performance condition is not met, the relevant part of the award will lapse.
There is no retesting of performance.
The main components of the Remuneration Policy, and how they are linked to and support the Companys business strategy, are summarised in each of the following sections.
ANNUAL BONUS PLAN AWARDS In respect of the year under review, the executive Directors performance was carefully reviewed by the Committee, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer in respect of the other executive Directors, and performance as against the annual bonus plan measures in relation to Nigel Bond and Andrew Herbert was as follows: Threshold Maximum Annual bonus value Actual performance Annual bonus value achieved performance performance for threshold and max Performance condition Weighting required required performance % salary N Bond A Herbert N Bond A Herbert 1 Group profit 30% 56.0m 75.0m 0%30% 64.8m 64.8m 18% 18% 2 Group cash 20% 57.0m 67.0m 0%20% 67.9m 67.9m 20% 20% 50% Personal objectives Minimum 0% 91% 91% 35% 35% Personal in the year were Maximum is 100% a combination of of the total % divisional sales and achieved under profit targets, business Group profit process improvement and Group cash targets and strategic performance objectives.

73% of 73% of Total 100% salary salary Total 000 314 197 1 Group profit is defined as underlying pre-tax profit before discretionary bonus charges.
2 Group cash is defined as net cash inflow from operating activities before taxation as adjusted to eliminate the cash effect if any of any one-off items included in the reconciliation between pre-tax profit and underlying pre-tax profit.
The Group profit and cash components operate separately and payments are made on a straight-line basis between the threshold and maximum levels.
If an executive Director achieves his personal objectives, a multiplier is applied to the amount earned under the financial conditions.
The value of the multiplier is dependent on the level of achievement, with the maximum that can be earned under this element being 50 per cent of salary by means of a multiplier of 2.
However, the personal objectives multiplier will only be applied if the executive Director has reached and maintained his shareholding requirement, as set by the Committee.
If the executive Director meets his personal objectives but the financial conditions are not achieved, then no bonus payment will be made.
The Committee reviewed the structure of the annual bonus this year on the basis of its appropriateness both in terms of the Companys strategy as well as market practice and corporate governance principles.
At the end of this review the Committee felt that a new bonus arrangement should be implemented for the 2015 financial year the Domino Printing Sciences plc 2015 Deferred Bonus Plan.

RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SPEND ON PAY CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY IN COMING YEAR The Chairmans Annual Statement sets out an amended policy for the forthcoming financial year subject to shareholder approval at the 2015 AGM.
Full details of the proposed Domino Printing Sciences plc 2015 Deferred Bonus Plan are set out in the Notice of AGM.
The Remuneration Policy and its implementation for the forthcoming financial year is summarised below: Package structure The main elements of executive remuneration effective from 18 March 2015 being the date of the AGM at which shareholder approval for this report will be sought are: Base salary Nigel Bonds and Andrew Herberts salary for the coming year are 430,000 and 270,000 respectively.
An average salary increase of 2.97 per cent was awarded to the Groups UK employees and managers in July2014.
Fees Following advice from our Remuneration Consultants and having regard for benchmarks and more usual practices in the FTSE 250, the Board has made changes to the fee structure to create committee chair fees 5,000 per annum and adjusted the non-executive Director fees for 2015 to 45,000.
The Chairmans fee has not changed.
The fees for 2015 for individual Directors are therefore as follows: Peter Byrom 172,000 Sir Mark Wrightson 50,000 Sir David Brown 50,000 Chris Brinsmead 45,000 Sucheta Govil 45,000 Bonus See Chairmans Annual Statement and Notice of AGM.
Long-Term Incentive Plan with maximum opportunity of 100 per cent of base salary delivered in shares based on EPS growth 50 per cent and relative Total Shareholder Return 50 per cent.
Under the EPS growth element, 25 per cent of the element 12.5 per cent of the total award vests for EPS growth of RPI 12 per cent over the performance period, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting 50 per cent of the total award for EPS growth of RPI 30 per cent.
Under the Relative Total Shareholder Return element performance is measured against the FTSE 250.
25per cent of the element 12.5 per cent of the total award vests at median performance of the index, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting 50 per cent of the total award for upper quartile performance.
Pay for performance Key principle for the shortand long-term incentives is to provide a strong link between reward and individual and Group performance to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders.
When merited by performance, an opportunity is offered to earn total remuneration at the upper quartile levels of remuneration paid, against companies of a similar market capitalisation and with similar revenues to the Company.
The details of the targets applicable to the bonus for the coming year are considered by the Committee to be commercially sensitive as they are the key metrics which are critical to the operation of the Company, so they have not been disclosed as the Committee feels it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to do so.
However, details of the targets and the extent to which they have been satisfied will be disclosed in the 2015 annual report on remuneration.
