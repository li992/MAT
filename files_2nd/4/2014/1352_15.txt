The Committee intends to review the comparator group each year, to ensure this remains appropriate, and any changes would be disclosed to shareholders in setting out the operation of the remuneration policy for the subsequent year.
Individuals who are recruited or promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the policy level until they become established in their role.
In such cases subsequent increases in salary may be higher until the target positioning is achieved.

The Committee has discretion to increase the shareholding requirement.
There were no changes to the remuneration policy during the year.
Notes to the policy table 1 In relation to the DBP, individual awards to directors are dependent on the most relevant measure of profit for the role which they perform, and thus over which they have the most direct influence.
Profit is a key component of earnings per share, one of the Companys key performance indicators and is considered the primary measure which aligns with shareholders interests.
Total shareholder return measures the relative return from Ashtead against an appropriate comparator group, providing alignment with shareholders interests.
Earnings per share is also a key measure ensuring sustainable profit generation over the longer term and is a measure which is aligned with shareholders interests.
c. Return on investment is a key internal measure to ensure the effective use of capital in the business which is highly cyclical and with high capital requirements.
d. The use of leverage alongside the other performance measures ensures there is an appropriate dynamic tension and balance in maintaining leverage discipline in a capital-intensive business.
50 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT cOnTInUEd Share-based incentives and dilution limits The Company observes an overall dilution limit of 10% in 10 years for all company share schemes, together with a limit of 5% in 10 years for discretionary schemes.
REMUNERATION POLICY ON NEW HIRES When hiring a new executive director, the Committee will seek to align the remuneration package with the remuneration policy summarised above.
In addition, where the executive has to relocate, the level of relocation package will be assessed on a case by case basis.
Although it is not the Committees policy to buy-out former incentive arrangements as a matter of course, it will consider compensating an incoming executive with like-kind incentive arrangements for foregone incentives with their previous employer, taking into account the length of the period they were held and an assessment of the likely vesting value.
The Committee will ensure that such arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company and the shareholders without paying more than is necessary.
TOTAL REMUNERATION OPPORTUNITY Our remuneration arrangements are designed so that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of short and long-term objectives designed to create shareholder value.
The graphs below illustrate the potential future reward opportunity for each of the executive directors, based on the remuneration policy set out on pages 47 to 49 and the base salary at 1 May 2014.

SERvICE CONTRACTS The Companys policy is that executive directors have rolling contracts which are terminable by either party giving the other 12 months notice, which are available for inspection at the Companys registered office.
The service contracts for each of the executive directors all contain non-compete provisions appropriate to their roles.
POLICY ON PAYMENT FOR LOSS OF OFFICE Upon the termination of employment of any executive director, any compensation will be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of the directors employment contract and the rules of any incentive scheme which are summarised opposite.

52 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT cOnTInUEd There is no agreement between the Company and its directors or employees, providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation : or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an executive directors office or employment.
When determining any loss of office payment for a departing individual the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the Company whilst seeking to address the circumstances at the time.
CONSIDERATION OF CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE COMPANY The constituent parts of the senior management teams remuneration package mirror those of the executives.
The performance conditions attaching to PSP awards are common throughout the Company.
When considering executive compensation, the Committee is advised of, and takes into account, changes to the remuneration of employees elsewhere within the Company.
The Committee does not consider it appropriate to consult with employees when determining executive remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR NON-ExECUTIvE DIRECTORS The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
None of the non-executive directors has a service contract with the Company and their appointment is therefore terminable by the Board at any time.
When recruiting a non-executive director, the remuneration arrangements offered will be in line with the policy table below: APPROACH TO FEES BASIS OF FEES Fees are set at a level to attract and retain high calibre Each non-executive director is paid a basic fee for undertaking non-executive directors.

Fees are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they reflect Additional fees are paid to the chairman and the chairs of the audit the time commitment required and practice in companies of and remuneration committees and the senior independent director.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER vIEWS The Committee believes that it is important to maintain an open and transparent dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters.
The Committee last consulted formally with major shareholders during 2011 12 with regards to the introduction of the Deferred Bonus Plan and the balanced scorecard approach for the Performance Share Plan.
The views of shareholders were integral to the changes introduced.
The Committee sought the views of its major shareholders on the changes made to the base salary of the chief executive with effect from 1 May 2014 and the deferred element under the DBP.
The views expressed by the shareholders will be taken into account in any future decisions on base pay.
The Committee will be consulting with shareholders before implementing any increased awards to executives under the new PSP which is subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Looking forward, the Committee will continue to engage with shareholders regarding material changes to the application of the approved policy or proposed changes to the policy.
Other taxable allowances include car, travel and accommodation allowances.
ii Sat Dhaiwal was a contributory member of the Ashtead Group Retirement Benefits Plan until 31 March 2014.
The Company has agreed a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions at 20% of salary.
The amount shown above represents the increase in his accrued pension benefit calculated on the basis of the Regulations, plus one months payment in lieu of pension contributions.
This methodology differs from that prescribed by the occupational transfer value regulations and so the figure differs from that shown in the pension section on page 53.
The amount for Geoff Drabble represents a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions at 40% of salary.
The amounts included for Brendan Horgan and Suzanne Wood represent the co-match under Sunbelts 401K defined contribution pension plan and 409A deferred compensation plan.
iii Deferred Bonus Plan includes the cash received by each director from the DBP for 2013 14 performance as explained on page 48.
This includes 100% of this years bonus and 100% of the brought forward deferred share equivalents for Geoff Drabble, Brendan Horgan and Suzanne Wood.
iv Annual Performance Bonus represents the cash award under the Annual Performance Bonus plan for 2013 14 performance.
v The PSP value is calculated as the number of shares vesting, valued at the market value of those shares, plus the payment in lieu of dividends paid during the vesting period.
Market value is the market value on the day the awards vest if they vest before the date the financial statements are approved or the average market value for the last three months of the financial year if the awards vest after the date the financial statements are approved.
The 2011 award is expected to vest fully on 26 July 2014 and has been valued at an average market value of 891p for the three months ended 30 April 2014, plus 15.3p per share in lieu of dividends paid during the vesting period.
vi Suzanne Wood was appointed a director on 16 July 2012 and her salary, benefits and pension are included from that date.

DIRECTORS PENSION BENEFITS AUDITED INFORMATION In advance of the reduction in the lifetime allowance, the Company and Sat Dhaiwal agreed that his contributory membership of the Ashtead Group plc Retirement Benefits Plan Retirement Benefits Plan would cease at the end of March 2014 and that the Company would, from April 2014, make a payment to him of 20% of base salary in lieu of the Company making any further pension contributions.
The accrued benefits at 30 April 2014 were a pension of 73,000 per annum 2013: 70,000, payable from the age of 65.
The Company makes a payment of 40% of Geoff Drabbles base salary in lieu of providing him with any pension arrangements.
This was agreed prior to his joining the Company in 2006 and reflected the fact that he was leaving a generous defined benefit arrangement at his previous employer.
Brendan Horgan and Suzanne Wood are members of the Sunbelt 401K defined contribution pension plan and the 409A deferred compensation plan.
They are entitled to a company co-match conditional on contributing into the 401K plan or deferring into the 409A plan.
The co-match is limited to amounts permitted by regulatory agencies and is effected either by a company payment into the 401K plan or an enhanced deferral into the 409A plan and was $17,570 for Brendan Horgan and $23,490 for Suzanne Wood in 2013 14.
At 30 April 2014, the total amount available to Brendan Horgan but deferred under the Sunbelt deferred compensation plan was $338,988 or 200,751.
This includes an allocated investment return of $34,337 or 21,435 2013: 19,663.

This includes an allocated investment return of $25,894 or 16,165 2013: 12,289.
THE DEFERRED BONUS PLAN AUDITED INFORMATION The performance targets for the Deferred Bonus Plan for the year were as follows: Group pre-tax profit Sunbelt operating profit Bonus potential Forfeiture 200m $375m Loss of 50% of previously deferred bonus Threshold 277m $495m 10% Target 310m $550m 50% Maximum 340m $585m 100% Actual 362m $631m 100% Underlying profit.
The performance targets for Geoff Drabble and Suzanne Wood for the year to 30 April 2014 related directly to the underlying pre-tax profits of the Group and for Brendan Horgan, the underlying operating profit of Sunbelt.
The Group target set by the Committee for full entitlement under the DBP was significantly ahead of both prior year 245m and consensus market expectation of 293m when the target was set.
The target for Sunbelt was significantly ahead of the prior year $453m.
For the year to 30 April 2014, the underlying pre-tax profit for the Group was 362m and underlying operating profit for Sunbelt was $631m.
As a result, the maximum bonus entitlements were earned and were equivalent to 200% of base salary for Geoff Drabble and 150% of base salary for Suzanne Wood and Brendan Horgan.
The first three-year period of the Deferred Bonus Plan ended on 30 April 2014.
Under the terms of the DBP, there was no forfeiture of brought forward share equivalent awards and accordingly, the brought forward share equivalent awards and the bonus for 2013 14 were released to the executives in full on 16 June 2014 when the share price was 887p.
The share equivalent awards are summarised below: Number of share equivalent awards Value of Brought Carried released awards forward Released forward 000 Geoff Drabble 172,049 172,049 1,526 Brendan Horgan 43,175 43,175 383 Suzanne Wood 39,426 39,426 350 54 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 REMUNERATION REPORT cOnTInUEd THE ANNUAL PERFORMANCE BONUS The performance targets for the annual performance bonus were as follows: A-Plant operating profit Bonus potential Threshold 17m 20% Target 20m 50% Maximum 22m 100% Actual 25m 100% Underlying profit.
The maximum bonus entitlement for Sat Dhaiwal was 100% of base salary and related directly to the profitability of A-Plant.
The target for maximum pay-out was significantly ahead of the prior year profit of 12m.
A-Plants underlying operating profit was 25m and, as a result, the maximum bonus entitlement was earned equivalent to 100% of base salary.
THE PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN The performance criteria have varied in prior years.
Following consultation with shareholders in 2011 12, a balanced and holistic approach was adopted involving four performance measures selected because delivery of them through the cycle is a significant challenge and the achievement of them will deliver optimum sustainable performance over the long term.
The performance criteria are as follows: Performance criteria measured over three years Award date Financial year TSR % of award EPS % of award Status 29 6 10 2010 11 From date of grant versus FTSE 250 Index 2012 13 EPS between 1p 12.5% vested Vested in full in June 2013 12.5% at median: 50% at upper quartile and 2.5p 50% vested 27 7 11 2011 12 From date of grant versus FTSE 250 Index 2013 14 EPS between 8p 12.5% vested Expected to vest fully in 12.5% at median: 50% at upper quartile and 12p 50% vested July 2014 Performance criteria measured over three years Award date Financial year TSR 40% EPS 25% RoI 25% Leverage 10% Status 19 9 12 2012 13 From date of grant 25% of this element 25% of this element 100% of this 2012 award versus FTSE 250 of the award will of the award will element of the TSR performance is in the Index 25% of this vest if EPS vest at an RoI of award will vest if upper quartile, EPS growth element of the compound growth 10% with 100% the ratio of net debt of 64%, RoI of 19% and award will vest at for the three years vesting with an to EBITDA is equal leverage of 1.8 times median: 100% at ending 30 April RoI of 15% to, or is less than, upper quartile immediately prior 2.5 times to the vesting date is 6% per annum, rising to 100% 2013 award 1 7 13 2013 14 vesting if EPS TSR performance is in the compound growth upper quartile, EPS growth is equal to, or of 48%, RoI of 19% and exceeds, 12% leverage of 1.8 times per annum For performance between the lower and upper target ranges, vesting of the award is scaled on a straight-line basis.
The 2010 PSP award vested in full on 28 June 2013 with EPS for 2012 13 of 31.6p exceeding the upper target of 2.5p and the Companys TSR performance ranked it first within the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
The 2011 PSP award, for which the performance period completes on 26 July 2014, is expected to vest in full.
EPS for 2013 14 of 46.6p exceeds the upper target of 12p and at 13 June 2014, the Companys TSR performance ranked it first within the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts at the date of this report.
EPS is based on the profit before exceptional items, fair value remeasurements and amortisation of acquired intangibles less the tax charge included in the accounts.
Historically TSR performance has been measured relative to the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts rather than a specific comparator group of companies because there are few direct comparators to the Company listed in London and because the Company was a FTSE 250 company.
The Companys TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts is shown on page 56.
For the 2014 15 award the comparator group will be comprised of those companies in the FTSE 350 ranked 75th to 125th by market capitalisation excluding investment trusts.
The executive directors are required to retain at least 50% of shares that vest under the PSP until such time as they have achieved the shareholding guideline detailed on page 49.
