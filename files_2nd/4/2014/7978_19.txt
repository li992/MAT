Directors Report on Remuneration DRIVE PERFORMANCE AND REWARD RESULTS DEAR SHAREHOLDER As chair of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2014.
I am also pleased to welcome Coline McConville as a member of the Committee.
Coline joined the Board in June 2014 and became a member of the Committee at the same time.
At the 2014 AGM we received a vote of 96.45% in favour of our remuneration policy and we continue to believe that the policy is structured to align with and support the Groups strategy and to encourage the right behaviours, drive performance and reward results.
The Group has delivered another record set of results in 2014.
Sales increased by 2.7%, profit before tax and exceptional items was up 10.4% and adjusted earnings per share rose by 15.4%.
As a result of the exceptional performance the long-term incentive awards vested at 84.4% and the Executive Directors received an annual bonus of 150.0%.
Further information on the amounts payable are given on pages 66 to 67.
Key developments during the year There were no changes to the remuneration policy during the year.
As part of the normal annual process, the Committee reviews the performance targets at the start Key activities during 2014: of each award cycle.
The Group has performed well since the downturn of 2009 Review of performance measures with a strong EPS growth.
As you would expect after a period of strong recovery, the Shareholder consultation Company is entering a new cycle of lower albeit still strong EPS growth, and the Adoption of new reporting principles Committee believed that the EPS vesting scale should be reviewed in this context.
Following consultation with several major shareholders during the year, the Committee Appointment of a new established a range of 5% to 13% EPS growth for normal performance share plan awards Committee member and 13% to 18% for enhanced performance share plan awards.
The Committee believes that these growth targets still represent the top quartile level of stretch for normal awards, Committee membership and top decile for enhanced awards relative to global comparators.
At the same Nigel Northridge Chairman time, the Committee felt it would be appropriate to reduce the number of shares Ken Hanna in the enhanced awards by 50%.
Details of performance targets for awards granted in Coline McConville 2014 are given on page 69 and the performance targets for prior years on page 68.
Till Vestring The Committee believes the changes are important to motivate the executive team to deliver the Companys strategic plan and are therefore in the interests of shareholders.
Coline McConville joined on 1 June 2014.
Shareholder support was positive and the Committee implemented the changes for Committee meetings the 2014 awards.

Annual bonus In 2014, as for 2013, the Executive Directors annual bonuses were assessed against a financial performance matrix.
This matrix was designed to reward stretching targets of revenue and operating profit, whilst maintaining exceptional levels of customer service.
During the year, the Group delivered sales of 6.7bn and operating profit before exceptional items of 318.4m, reflecting annual growth of 2.7% and 11.0% respectively.
The Committee reviewed the performance against the targets and rules of the scheme and determined that revenue performance was at stretch and operating profit was at stretch.
The Group also achieved the NPS targets.
Taking into account all relevant factors, the Committee determined that both the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director received a bonus of 150.0% of salary for 2014.
As stated last year, given the close link between performance measures and longer-term strategy, the targets remain commercially sensitive and will not be published until such time as the Committee is confident there will be no adverse impact on the Company of such disclosure.
We stated in 2013 that we anticipate that this will be no longer than three years from the date of payment.
The Committee will keep this policy under review.
The Groups performance in relation to the annual bonus matrix is shown below: Annual bonus for 2015 30% 90% 150% Stretch The maximum annual bonus opportunity in 2015 will remain unchanged from previous years and will be 150% of salary 20% 60% 120% including for the new Chief Executive whose bonus payout Target NPS multiplier will be pro-rated to reflect the proportion of performance year X 0.8 -1.0 served 1 April 2015 to 31 December 2015.
15% 45% 90% Threshold Bonuses will be based on the same financial performance matrix, linked to revenue and operating profit, and customer service.
Note: In this way, All of Andr Lacroixs annual bonus in respect of 2014 will be Threshold Target Stretch 20% of total bonus paid in cash with no investment in shares, as Andr is not is based on NPS Operating profit the customer measure eligible to receive a match under the CIP on account of his leaving the Company.
com 67 Revenue Directors Report on Remuneration continued Awards vesting during the year In 2012, the Executive Directors were granted awards under the PSP and CIP schemes.

There was no retest provision.

The PSP awards were granted as a number of shares as the Committee feels this provides a strong alignment with shareholders as the face value of awards will fall if the share price falls and the face value of the awards will rise if the share price rises.
During 2014, under the CIP, John McConnell invested 31% of net salary 17% of gross salary and received an award of 63% of salary.

The awards granted to Andr Lacroix in 2014 will automatically lapse on the date of leaving.
Long-term incentives for 2015 For 2015, the new Group Chief Executive will receive a fixed number of PSP awards, both normal and enhanced, worth 200% of salary at date of grant.
The number of shares for PSP participants has been reviewed and, in line with our agreed policy, have been reduced by c. 10%-20%.
This reduction reflects the strong share price performance by the Group over the last four years since the implementation of the PSP.
Award sizes, being set as a fixed number of shares, have therefore increased in value over this period.
For 2015, the award size for the Group Finance Director will also be rebased to c. 200% of salary.
The exact number of shares is yet to be determined as well as the ratio of normal to enhanced shares.
Following a review of targets in 2015, the Committee determined that the EPS growth targets in respect of the normal and enhanced PSP and CIP awards continued to be appropriately stretching, and will remain 5% to 13% p. a. in respect of the normal PSP and CIP, and 13% to 18% p. a. in respect of the enhanced PSP.
The Committee has approved an increase to the ROCE targets in respect of PSP CIP awards in 2015, which will be 21% to 25% as compared with 18% to 21% for the 2014 awards.
The performance measures and targets in respect of future awards will be reviewed on an annual basis in accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy, subject to a minimum of 50% of the total award based on EPS growth.
Stefan Bomhard will receive an award in lieu of forfeited incentives from his previous employer when he joins the Group on 1 April 2015.
The award will be made in accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy.
Full details will be given in the 2015 Directors Report on Remuneration.
