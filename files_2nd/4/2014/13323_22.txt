The links between the strategy and the elements of remuneration for Directors remain unchanged and are described in the Remuneration Policy Report.
For the wider management and colleague population, sales effectiveness and customer retention and growth remain two key levers where remuneration issues are critical.
Incentivisation of colleagues throughout the business is now looked at in the context ofboth the business units strategic positioning in the quadrants and the operational levers to drive growth.

Link to strategy As articulated in the Strategic Report, our strategy is focused on Review of Advisors to the Committee delivering significant medium-term improvements in revenue and profit and an immediate improvement in free cash flow.
It calls an During the year the Committee conducted a review of the provision end to the restructuring era of the business and uses a quadrantof professional advice to the Committee, and looked in detail at three based approach to focus resources on delivering improved levels potential sources of such advice.
As a result of the review, Deloitte of growth and to prioritise capital allocation for restructuring, capex LLP has been re-appointed as advisors to the Committee.
As a consequence annual bonus plans incentivise management todeliver short-term profit growth and revenue growth which, using the quadrant-based approach, will set the foundations for longerterm profitable growth.
In 2014 co-efficients were introduced to adjust revenue targets in line with the quadrants.
This approach hasworked well and will be continued in 2015.
