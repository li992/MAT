Dear Shareholder, The Board has delegated to the On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our report on Directors remuneration, being my first report as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee responsibility Remuneration Committee.

The approval of the Directors remuneration policy is valid for three years provided the Company does not intend to make changes to the policy within this period and therefore shareholder approval of the policy is not required at the AGM scheduled for 14 May 2015.
A key element of the Melrose remuneration framework is the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which had already been approved by special resolution of shareholders at a general meeting held in April 2012.
Our remuneration structure for executive Directors Melroses remuneration philosophy is that executive remuneration should be simple and transparent, support the delivery of the business strategy and pay for performance.
This philosophy is reflected in our remuneration structure.
The Remuneration Committee feels strongly that rewards should be linked to generation and delivery of real returns to shareholders.
Base salary: Base salaries are paid at the lower end of a market competitive range compared to companies of similar size and complexity.
Since flotation in 2003 all current executive Directors have received the same annual increases to base salary: in the last five years these increases have averaged 3%.
Pension: Pension contributions salary supplements for executive Directors are payable at the level of 15% of base salary, which is considered modest for a business of the size and complexity of Melrose.
No executive Director participates in, or has ever participated in, any Melrose defined benefit pension scheme.

The formula by which growth is calculated, as set out in the Companys articles of association, takes account of every change to the capital structure and dividend payment.
In this way, the participants will only receive a share of returns over and above that adjusted level.
Under the 2012 Incentive Plan, the initial invested shareholder capital needs to grow by RPI 2% per annum before LTIP participants receive anything at all.
After that return, shareholders will also receive 92.5% of any total value gain.
We have included on pages 81 to 82 further information in relation to the 2012 Incentive Plan, including an illustration of how any increase in value would be shared between shareholders and participants in the plan.

Non-executive Directors basic fees for 2015 have also been increased by 3%.
The overall framework for the executive Directors annual bonus arrangements for 2015 will remain the same as in 2014, with a maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of salary, 80% of which is based on financial performance metrics and 20% of which is based on strategic performance metrics.

The difference arises due to the by participants in that plan.
It is important to note that the following requirements of IAS 33 which stipulate that un-recognised future service costs for LTIPs illustration is theoretical only and the value derived under the 2012 calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 should be deducted from the calculation of diluted shares for the purposes of Earnings per Share calculations.

The Remuneration Committee considers the FTSE 100 Index, the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE All Share Index to be appropriate indices for the purposes of this comparison because of the comparable size of the companies which comprise the FTSE 100 Index and the FTSE 250 index and the broad nature of companies which comprise the FTSE All Share Index.
The source data for the graph below assumes that all cash returns to shareholders made by the Company during this period are reinvested in Ordinary Shares.

This means that the full value of the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan on 11 April 2012 is shown for the year ending 31 December 2012 and no value will be reflected in the total figure of remuneration for the 2012 Incentive Plan until the trigger date which will be May 2017 or an earlier trigger date determined in accordance with the arrangements.
The value of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan was earned over a period of approximately five years.
Therefore, in the view of the Remuneration Committee, inclusion of this value in respect of the year ended 31 December 2012 does not give a fair representation of the Chief Executive Officers yearly remuneration over each of the previous five years.
Therefore, an additional column has been added to the table below to show total remuneration excluding the value received on the maturity in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan.
No other long-term incentive plan vested in favour of any executive Director in any of the other years.
The amount of that value shown in respect of David Roper and Simon Peckham for 2012 reflects the proportion of 2012 for which each was the Chief Executive Officer.

In the table above: i the Total remuneration figure shows, in respect of David Roper, his total remuneration in respect of his service in the period 1 January 2012 to 9 May 2012 and in respect of Simon Peckham his total remuneration in respect of his service in the period from 9 May 2012 to 31 December 2012.
Included in this figure for each of David Roper and Simon Peckham is the value of the long-term incentives vesting in the year pro-rated to reflect the portion of the year for which he was Chief Executive Officer: and ii the Total remuneration excluding the long-term incentive value shows in respect of each of David Roper and Simon Peckham total remuneration in respect of the period for which he was Chief Executive Officer excluding any value received on the maturity in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan.
2 On the crystallisation in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Shares awarded in 2009, participants in the 2009 Incentive Share Plan as a whole were entitled to 10% of the increase in shareholder value from 18 July 2007 to 23 March 2012.
Because the value derived on the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Shares depended upon the shareholder value created over the relevant period, it is not possible to express the value derived as a percentage of the maximum opportunity.
The crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Shares was satisfied by the conversion of those shares into Ordinary Shares.
3 The value derived in 2012 from the 2009 Incentive Shares represents the Chief Executives share, determined in accordance with the terms of those shares, of the shareholder value created over a period of circa five years.

This group of senior management was considered an appropriate comparator group because of their level of seniority and the structure of their remuneration package: the spread of the Companys operations across various countries and industries means that remuneration policies vary to take account of geography and industry such that the Remuneration Committee considers that selecting a wider group of employees would not provide a meaningful comparison.

Explanation of performance metrics chosen Performance measures are chosen which are aligned to the Companys strategy.
Annual Bonus Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual bonus, to reflect the key financial and strategic objectives of the Company, and reward for delivery against these targets.
When setting the targets, the Remuneration Committee will take into account a number of different reference points including its plans and strategy and the market environment.
2012 Incentive Plan Value delivered under the 2012 Incentive Plan is determined by reference to the growth in the value of the Company, such that the performance metric is the level of such growth that is delivered to shareholders.
This arrangement was considered appropriate by the Remuneration Committee which considers that the previous, and similar, Incentive Shares arrangements introduced in 2009, and which crystallised in 2012, have been very effective in incentivising management to deliver real value to shareholders over the applicable performance period.
The Companys articles of association provide that the Remuneration Committee may make adjustments to the calculation of the amount to which the holders of the 2012 Incentive Shares shall be entitled in certain circumstances.
These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the Companys articles of association or a change in the capital structure of the Company otherwise producing an anomalous result.
Any such adjustment shall be such as the Remuneration Committee considers fair and reasonable and as an investment bank shall have confirmed is fair and reasonable so far as the ordinary shareholders are concerned.
Differences between the Companys policy on Directors remuneration and its policy on remuneration for other employees Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group are determined based on the same principle that reward should be sufficient as is necessary to attract and retain high calibre talent, without paying more than is necessary and should be achieved for delivery of the Companys strategy.
The Company has operations in various countries and across various industries, with Group employees of differing levels of seniority.
Accordingly, though based on the overarching principle above, reward policies vary to take account of these factors.
On the introduction of the 2012 Incentive Plan, the Remuneration Committee considered it appropriate to recognise the required growth of the senior management team beyond the executive Directors necessary to further develop the business, and participation includes certain non-director employees.
The Company has also implemented divisional long-term incentive plans for senior managers of certain businesses within the Group to incentivise them to create value for the Company and its shareholders.
Melrose Industries PLC 92 Annual Report 2014 Governance Directors remuneration report continued Recruitment remuneration policy When agreeing a remuneration package for the appointment of a new executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will apply the following principles: the package will be sufficient to attract the calibre of Director required to deliver the Companys strategy: the Remuneration Committee will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary: and in the next Annual Report on Remuneration after an appointment, the Remuneration Committee will explain to shareholders the rationale for the arrangements implemented.
In addition to the policy elements set out in the table on pages 88 to 91, the Remuneration Committee retains discretion to make appropriate remuneration decisions outside the standard policy to meet the individual circumstances of the recruitment, including discretion to include any other remuneration component or award.
The Remuneration Committee does not intend to use this discretion to make a non-performance related incentive payment for example a golden hello.
In this regard, elements that the Remuneration Committee may consider for the purposes of a remuneration package for the recruitment of a new executive Director include, but are not limited to, the following.
Approach Element Incentive remuneration The Remuneration Committees intention is that a new executive Directors incentive remuneration opportunity will opportunity consist of: an annual bonus up to a maximum of 100% of salary i. e. as applies for existing executive Directors : and an award of options over 2012 Incentive Shares, with the number of such shares awarded being equal to the number of such shares over which an existing executive Director was granted an option in April 2012, as reduced to take into account the proportion of the 2012 Incentive Plans life that has elapsed at the time of the new executive Directors appointment.
The Remuneration Committees intention is that a new executive Director would only participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan on this basis if he she had a similar level of experience and responsibility as the existing executive Directors.
If a new executive Director did not participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan, the Remuneration Committee may award a maximum annual bonus opportunity of up to 300% of salary until such time as a new long-term incentive arrangement is put in place for the executive Directors in which that new executive Director could participate.
Compensation for forfeited Whilst considered unlikely the Remuneration Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buy out remuneration arrangements remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will have regard to relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to such arrangements, the form of those awards e. g. cash or shares and the timeframe of such awards.
While such awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to below, the Remuneration Committees intention is that the value awarded as determined by the Remuneration Committee on a fair and reasonable basis would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements.
Where considered appropriate, buy-out awards will be subject to forfeiture or clawback on early departure.
Notice period The notice period will be the same as the Companys ordinary policy of 12 months.
Relocation costs Where necessary, the Company will pay appropriate relocation costs.
The Remuneration Committee will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary.
Retirement benefits The maximum contribution of 15% of salary referred to in the policy table on page 90 will apply to any new executive Director.
However, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to pay the contribution into any pension arrangement or to pay the amount as a supplement to base salary in lieu of a pension arrangement.
Governance Melrose Industries PLC 93 Annual Report 2014 Governance Under the new reporting regulations, the Company is required to set out the maximum level of variable remuneration that may be granted when agreeing the components of a remuneration package for the appointment of Directors, excluding any remuneration constituting compensation for the forfeiture of any variable remuneration award with a previous employer.
In order to provide sufficient flexibility in recruitment scenarios, and to reflect the fact that the value of participation in the 2012 Incentive Plan depends on shareholder value created and so cannot be expressed as a multiple of salary, the Remuneration Committee has set this level as maximum variable remuneration of: If the Director participates in the 2012 Incentive Plan: one times salary: plus an award of options over a number of 2012 Incentive Shares equal to the number of such shares over which an existing executive Director was granted an option in April 2012, as reduced to take into account the proportion of the 2012 Incentive Plans life that has elapsed at the time of the new executive Directors appointment: and If the Director does not participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan, three times salary.
While long-term incentive awards and buy out awards may be granted under the 2012 Incentive Plan, if necessary and subject, where relevant, to the limits referred to above, awards may be granted outside this plan as permitted under the Listing Rules which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of a Director.
Where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue according to their subsisting terms.
The remuneration package for a newly appointed non-executive Director would normally be in line with the structure set out in the policy table for non-executive Directors.
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office The Companys policy is for executive Directors to be employed on the terms of service agreements which may be terminated by either the Director or the Company on the giving of not less than 12 months written notice subject to certain exceptions.
Each of the executive Directors had entered into a service agreement with Melrose PLC which was novated on exactly the same terms to the Company with effect from 27 November 2012 when the Company became the new parent company of the Group.

This may include base salary, pension contributions and benefits.
Annual Bonus This will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an individual basis and the decision whether or not to award a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon a number of factors including the circumstances of the executive Directors departure and their contribution to the business during the bonus period in question.
Typically, bonus amounts will be pro-rated for time in service to termination.
2012 Incentive Plan If an executive Director holding 2012 Incentive Shares ceases employment in circumstances in which he is a good leaver, the Remuneration Committee may other than if he is a good leaver as a result of his resignation in connection with a change of control of the Company require that he transfer some or all of the unvested proportion of his 2012 Incentive Shares for their nominal value.
