This increases on a straight line basis to fullvesting for ranking atorabove the 80th percentile.
In addition to the TSR measure, the Committee introduced individual strategic objectives for awards made in 2014.
Given the journey that Informa is on and the Growth Acceleration Plan mentioned in both the Chairmans Statement and the Report, the Committee felt itimportant to incentivise and reward Executive Directors for key achievements in areas tied to the long-term success of this plan.
The strategic objectives against which performance will be measured relate to: portfolio evaluation and performance intheBusiness Intelligence Division: operational fitness across the Group: strengthening management talent across the Group:  and geo-cloning with respect to the Global Exhibitions and Knowledge & Networking Divisions.
TheCommittee will disclose details oftheir assessment of performance following the conclusion of the performance period.
SHAREMATCH SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN Prior to June 2014, the Company offered eligible employees, including Executive Directors, the opportunity to participate in aUKtax qualifying SIP, Informa Invest, under which employees could invest up to 125 per month out ofgross salary in the Companys shares.
This scheme did not include a matching share element.
In June 2014, the Company launched ShareMatch, a global SIP tax qualifying in the UK, under which eligible employees can invest up to the limit of 1,800 per annum out of net salary gross salary in the UK in the Companys shares.
The scheme includes a matching element, whereby for every two shares purchased, the Company will award the participant one matching share.
Matching shares are subject to forfeiture if the purchased shares are withdrawn from the scheme within three years of purchase.
Inaddition, both the purchased and matching shares are eligible to receive any dividends payable by the Company, which are reinvested in more shares.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTORS PAY POLICY IN 2015 The Committee can confirm that the fixed pay for the Chairman, Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors in 2015 hasincreased by 2% effective 1 January 2015 in line with other Group employees.
The pay policy for 2015 falls within the previously approved Policy but as a direct consequence of the re-domicile in 2014, we arerequired to seek shareholder approval of the same Policy at the 2015 AGM.
However, following the review and shareholder consultation in late 2014, the Committee intends to amend the performance measures used for the LTIP awards in 2015, asfollows: Compound EPS growth, as a new measure, weighted at 50%, replacing the individual strategic measures applied in 2014.
Thebalance of awards 50% will continue tobebasedonrelative TSR performance against a refreshed peer group of select companies ranked in the FTSE 51150.
The introduction of these new measures provides a clear line of sight to the priorities set out in the Growth Acceleration Plan seepage 15 and aligns incentive awards with success in delivering against the plan.
In summary, these measures seek to balance sustainable and efficient growth, while continuing to deliver against EPS expectations and driving long-term shareholder value.
TheBoard is currently developing the 2015 budget and long-term financial plan.
Following this process, performance measure targets and ranges will be set and communicated to participants.
The Committee will set appropriately stretching targets for each performance cycle, taking into account these internal goals as well as analyst expectations, cost of capital and peer performance.
In addition, in accordance with regulatory body recommendations, the Company will introduce malus and clawback provisions from 2015 onwards.
The Committee will have the option to exercise the provisions if it sees fit using malus during the vesting period for the deferred element of the annual bonus or in relation to an LTIP award during the performance period and clawback post-vesting.
