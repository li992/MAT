Salaries Current Executive Director salary levels are as follows: 2015 2014 Salary Salary Increase 000 000 % R. Sharma 522 474 10 M. Waldner 317 302 5 M. Anderson 248 225 10 Consistent with its policy of moving base salary levels for recent appointments towards market levels over time, Rakesh Sharmas salary was increased to 522,000 and Mark Andersons salary was increased to 248,000 from 1 January 2015.
Reflecting Mary Waldners performance in the year, her base salary was increased to 317,000 from the same date.
Following the award of these increases, the Committee is satisfied that the base salary levels are now within the relevant competitive ranges.
Directors pension entitlements The Group will continue to operate a defined benefit pension scheme for Rakesh Sharma.
Mary Waldner and Mark Anderson will continue to participate in the defined contribution scheme, receiving annual company contributions of up to 18% of their salary.
Non-Executive Directors fees A minor amendment to the fee structure for Non-Executive Directors is proposed in the Remuneration Policy table.
There will be an additional fee paid to the Senior Independent Director equivalent to the additional fees paid to the Chairs of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
Annual bonus for 2015 The maximum bonus for Executive Directors in 2015 will continue to be 100% of base salary.
However, reflecting a comprehensive review, the Committee considers it timely to introduce selected non-financial incentive measures within the Directors annual bonus plan.
For 2015, a maximum 20% of salary will be payable for the achievement of strategic non-financial measures assuming shareholder approval is obtained to amend the Remuneration Policy.
No bonus will be paid in respect of the non-financial element of the bonus if the Committee considers the Companys financial performance to be unsatisfactory or there is an exceptional negative event during or just after the relevant financial year.
A maximum of 20% of salary will be payable for the achievement of an agreed profit target and a maximum of 60% payable for achievement of an agreed operating cash flow target.
As the Committee considers that commercial sensitivities restrict the disclosure of forward-looking annual bonus targets, full retrospective disclosure of the targets will be provided in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
Long term awards to be granted in 2015 Consistent with the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee intends to grant annual LTIP awards to Executive Directors in the form of shares worth 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for other Executive Directors during 2015.
As per last years grant, 20% of awards will vest at median TSR ranking, increasing to 100% vesting for an upper quartile TSR ranking, measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
In addition to the TSR target, there is an underpin requiring an average growth of EPS after adjustments to exclude gains or losses on financial instruments and the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition of 15% over the three year performance period.

Annual bonus for year under review Audited Annual bonuses in relation to 2014 were based upon the achievement of a sliding scale of underlying profit before tax and operating cash flow targets.
These targets were derived from the annual budgets approved by the Board.
They were adjusted where appropriate to provide an appropriate degree of stretch challenge and incentive to outperform.
Profit and cash are two of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured.
Please refer to pages 24 and 25 for details.
The bonus targets set by the Committee for 2014 were a maximum of 25% of salary subject to the achievement of 120.5m profit before tax and loss on fair value movements on derivatives and amortisation of intangibles on acquisition, and a maximum of 75% of salary subject to achieving an operating cash flow of 137m after capitalised development costs, capital expenditure, purchase of long-term incentive plan shares and taking account of movements in working capital.
The Committee assessed the achievement of performance against each target as follows: Actual Bonus 1 Threshold Maximum Achieved Payable 000 000 000 % Underlying profit before tax 108,450 120,500 112,034 - Operating cash flow 72,540 137,020 83,072 - 1 No bonus was payable in 2014 because in accordance with the bonus scheme rules, the operating cash flow was negatively adjusted to reflect working capital performance throughout the year.
In order for a bonus to be payable both profit and cash bonus criteria are required to be met.
LTIP vesting for year under review Audited The LTIP award granted in March 2012 was based on performance to the year ended 31 December 2014.
As disclosed in previous annual reports, the performance condition for this award was as follows: Threshold Stretch % Metric Performance condition target target Actual Vesting Total TSR against the constituents of a comparator group.
