Difference between remuneration policy for Executive Directors and other employees The Remuneration Committee considers remuneration across Alent when setting remuneration policy for Executive Directors and the same principles apply to all employees when determining salary increases.
In addition, the Annual Incentive and Alent Share Plan are operated for employees who are not Executive Directors.
The key difference in policy is that variable remuneration represents a greater proportion of Executive Directors total package than it does for other employees.
Choice of performance measures and target setting For the Annual Incentive and Alent Share Plan, our policy is to choose performance measures which help drive and reward the achievement of the Alent strategy, and also provide alignment between employees and shareholders.
Further detail on performance measures and targets is disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

Annual Incentive In 2014 Annual Incentive payments for the Chief Executive and Finance Director were based on the achievement of anadjusted EPS target, return on NSV margin and personal objectives.
EPS targets for 2014 were set on the basis of considerable stretch on the 2013 results and the NSV targets were also set to show further growth over 2013.
Directors were also set measurable performance objectives in order to ensure delivery of operational and strategic goals.
For both EPS and NSV, the 2014 outturn showed improvement over 2013 as can be seen in the 2014 Group results.
For the adjusted EPS, the Group achieved above target but below maximum and for the return on NSV, the Group achieved below target performance.
For the Personal Objectives, the Committee assessed performance of both the Chief Executive and Finance Director in alignment with the 2014 objectives for the Group that determined achievement, respectively, at just below Stretch and at Superior performance levels.
The maximum bonus opportunities for the Chief Executive and Finance Director in 2014 were 150% of salary and 125% ofsalary respectively.

The awards continued to be subject to the terms and conditions of the existing Cookson LTIP, save that the relevant company and relevant remuneration committee was Alent instead of Cookson.

Further detail on the performance conditions isset out below.
Performance conditions relating to awards made under the Alent Share Plan In the case of Alent Share Plan grants for which the performance period ends on 31 December 2014, these represent the grants made to Executive Directors in 2012 under the Cookson LTIP.
These awards over Cookson shares were rolled over to become awards over Alent shares of equivalent value.
Performance was measured over a three-year period, but by reference to Cookson performance up to the demerger effective time and by reference to Alent performance thereafter to the end of the period.
The vesting of the awards, when originally granted, was based on Cooksons performance against specified performance conditions measured over a three-year period.
Vesting of 50% of shares awarded was based upon Cooksons three-year TSR performance relative to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 250, excluding Investment Trusts, and 50% on EPS growth over the three-year period.
The two measures operated independently.
The new Alent targets for measuring performance for the 2012 Cookson LTIP awards, following the demerger, were determined as follows: as regards the EPS target, the Cookson headline EPS threshold and maximum vesting targets for the final year of the relevant three-year performance period were split between Alent and Vesuvius by reference to their respective trading profit contributions to Cooksons total 2012 trading profit such that the new Alent and Vesuvius targets aggregated to the relevant Cookson targets.
The respective Alent adjusted EPS values as reported for the final year ofthe three-year performance period were compared with these replacement threshold and maximum targets to determine the vesting outcome: and as regards the TSR target, Cooksons TSR growth from the start of the relevant three-year performance period up to the time of the demerger were determined and added to the TSR growth of Alent from the demerger date to the end of the three-year performance period.
This aggregate TSR growth was ranked against the TSR of the relevant comparator group and the resulting vesting outcome was calculated against the TSR performance schedule in the Cookson LTIP.
