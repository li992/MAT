68 Governance Directors remuneration report continued Annual report on remuneration This section of the report deals with the operation of the Groups remuneration policies in the course of 2014 and how the Committee intends to apply the Directors remuneration policy in 2015.
On listing, the Committee decided to adopt aremuneration structure for Executive Directors comprising the TSB Award with an ontarget annual award of 10% of basic salary and the SPA with an ontarget annual award of 62.5% of annual basic salary.
TheCommittee believes that this combination significantly reduces the risk of incentivising short term gain at the expense of longer term sustainability.
Executive Directors variable pay awards in aggregate are limited to 100% of fixed pay calculated in accordance with the applicable Remuneration Code provisions which further reduces the risk of over incentivising short term gain.
However, overall compensation needs to remain competitive and the Committee therefore decided to increase the basic salary for the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer at listing, as astep towards reflecting the new remuneration structure and their additional responsibilities as Main Board Directors of alisted Company.
Upon careful consideration and as afurther step to ensuring acompetitive total compensation package, afurther increase will be implemented for the Chief Financial Officer from 1 April 2015 as set out in the section Implementation of remuneration policy in 2015.
As part of this transition the TSB Award is based on service from the date of listing, whilst the Legacy LBG Award, although determined by the Committee and payable by TSB, is based on the variable pay structure and basic salary in place in 2014 prior to listing.
