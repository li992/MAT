Directors remuneration report Dear Shareholder On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our directors remuneration report, prepared in accordance with the new reporting regulations which came into effect on 1 October 2013.
The report is divided into two sections: a policy report which sets out our approach to remuneration and an annual report on remuneration which details what has been paid to the directors during the 2013 14 financial year.
Each report will be proposed as a separate resolution at the AGM, with a binding vote on the policy report.
Subject to shareholder approval the remuneration policy will become effective on 19 September 2014 following the AGM.
At a time of considerable growth and a number of acquisitions within the Group, our remuneration policy has been modified to support our strategy and align the interests of directors with those of our shareholders.
This has been achieved through the introduction of two new plans: an annual cash bonus plan and a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, providing appropriate short and long-term incentive opportunities.
As a Committee we endeavour to take a proactive interest in shareholder views on the Groups remuneration policy, and as such we consulted with our largest shareholders and advisory bodies prior to implementing these changes last year.
Those consulted were both supportive of the proposals and understanding of the need to make such changes.
This was reflected in the high level of support at the AGM in 2013, with 97.5% of shareholders voting in favour of the remuneration report.
Following the changes approved at the 2013 AGM, we are satisfied that the existing remuneration arrangements continue to align with the Groups strategy and there are no plans to change the current arrangements significantly.
The Committee will continue to monitor the market competitiveness of the remuneration policy, in order to ensure we are able to retain and attract the best talent.
Annual bonus outcome The annual bonus plan measures both in-year business performance targets and progress against personal and strategic objectives.
An important principle of the annual bonus plan is that no bonus can be paid unless the entire Group has achieved a base level of business performance.
The Group did not achieve the required base level of performance this year, and as such no payment will be made to the executives.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP outcome The LTIP takes into consideration the performance of both the Group and its share price, and is designed to act as an incentive to motivate executives to achieve the long-term growth plans of the Group.
Under the LTIP the performance period is three years and executives are required to retain a percentage of shares after vesting in order to build up a shareholding value worth more than their annual salaries.
The new LTIP will be tested on the third anniversary of grant which will be October 2016, and so no payments will be made to the executives under the LTIP in this financial year.
Executive director salaries In order to retain the calibre of management necessary to deliver the Groups strategy, our policy is to ensure that base pay for executive directors is competitive with the market, and recognizes personal performance.
The Committee reviewed the salaries of both executive directors during the last year.
The CEOs salary was increased in line with the average employee increase in the UK of 4.32%.
Following a review of the CFOs performance and remuneration relative to the market, it was felt appropriate by the Board to increase his salary by 10% more detail is given on page 64 of this report.
Activities of the Remuneration Committee during 2013 14 During the last financial year, amongst other things, the Committee: considered the potential outcome for the cash bonus for 2012 13 financial year: recommended the approval of the 2012 13 remuneration report to the Board: consulted with shareholders and advisory bodies on the review of executive remuneration, including base-salary, short-term incentives and long-term incentives: with the support of shareholders, put in place the new executive director remuneration policy, including the implementation of a new annual cash bonus plan and long-term incentive plan: set 2013 14 annual bonus targets and performance targets for the LTIP 2014 2016: considered a benchmarking report in support of the executive salary review: Strategic report Directors report Financial report 55 reviewed executive directors base salary levels and approved increases as detailed in the report: advised on salary adjustments and share awards to the EMB: reviewed appropriateness of current all employee share schemes: considered the new BIS regulations in respect of executive remuneration policy and in drafting the remuneration report: considered the projected out-turns for the 2013 14 annual bonus: and reviewed its own terms of reference.
We believe our current remuneration practices are set out in line with the new reporting regulations and we welcome the structure and transparency this brings.
Overall we believe that our remuneration policy is aligned with delivering the Groups strategy and long-term value to shareholders.
I look forward to the on-going support of the Imagination shareholders on both the advisory vote for the executive remuneration arrangements as they were operated this past year, as well as the forward-looking remuneration policy which is the subject of the binding vote at the AGM.
Yours sincerely Andrew Heath Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 24 June 2014 56 Remuneration Policy The Directors Remuneration Policy below will be put to shareholders for approval at the next Annual General Meeting on 19 September 2014 and is intended to apply for three years from that date.

Each year the Committee considers the most appropriate metrics to apply for the following financial year.
These metrics are currently Group revenue budget and adjusted operating profit.
A performance multiplier is then applied related to the achievement of the financial elements.
The annual bonus also includes a 25% element based on personal performance.
Each executive director is set a number of personal objectives in relation to clear strategic, operational, or relationship imperatives aligned to the Groups overall strategy.
The Committee is of the opinion that the financial targets and personal objectives for the Annual Bonus Plan are commercially sensitive and as such it would be detrimental to the Group to disclose them in advance of or during the relevant performance period.
Business targets are set as predefined ranges around budget and individual targets are set taking account of strategic priorities under the control of the executive.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Performance measures for the LTIP were selected after careful consideration and following consultation with larger shareholders and advisory bodies.
The Committee believes that the use of both TSR and EPS measures provides the best measure of the success of the execution of the Groups strategy and encourages, reinforces and rewards the delivery of sustainable shareholder value.
The TSR element which accounts for 50% of awards considers Imaginations performance against two relevant comparator groups sector and size-based to reward sustainable shareholder value creation relative to alternative investment opportunities for our shareholders.
Targets are in line with typical market practice, requiring ranking at median to deliver threshold vesting increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for ranking within the upper quartile.
The normalized EPS growth performance condition which accounts for 50% of awards, has been set following independent analysis by the Groups advisors and brokers.
Based on this analysis, the compound annual growth in EPS targets were set for 2013 14 as follows: 0% pay out below 10% growth: 25% pay out at 10% growth: 100% pay out at 20% growth or greater: and Linear progression between 25% and 100% thresholds.
The Committee intends to review the targets annually.
Changes will be made only if the targets become inappropriate due to changing market conditions.
60 Illustration of remuneration policy for 2014 The graph below illustrates the level of remuneration that could be achieved by the CEO and CFO through the operation of our remuneration policy for 2014 2015.
The graph show the proportion of total remuneration made up of fixed pay salary, pension and other benefits, annual bonus and the LTIP and the pay outcomes for three performance scenarios.
In accordance with the regulations, share price appreciation and dividend accrual are not taken into account.
SAYE awards are also excluded.
Target: this represents fixed remuneration as detailed above, plus 50% of the maximum bonus opportunity and vesting of 50% of the maximum LTIP award.
Maximum: this represents fixed remuneration together with the maximum annual bonus opportunity and vesting of 100% of LTIP award.
Strategic report Directors report Financial report 61 Development of the Group remuneration policy Consideration of executive remuneration with the wider Group When making remuneration decisions for Executive Directors the Committee considers the wider economic environment and conditions within the Group.
In particular, the Committee considers pay and employment conditions across the wider workforce and carefully considers the broader employee salary increase budget when making reward decisions for executive directors.
The Committee considers wider industry benchmarking material in the context of monitoring its overall position on director and employee pay.
Consideration of shareholders views The Committee welcomes an open and transparent dialogue with shareholders and seeks the views of significant shareholders when any major changes are being made to remuneration arrangements.
The Committee will continue to engage with shareholders going forward and will aim to consult on any material changes to the application of the approved remuneration policy or proposed changes to the policy itself.
Recruitment remuneration arrangements When determining the appropriate remuneration package for a new appointment, the Committee will take a number of factors into account.
These typically include the candidates experience and calibre, their personal circumstances, external market influences and arrangements for existing executive directors.
The on-going remuneration package offered to new directors will only include those elements listed within the policy table, which may include specific relocation benefits.
On-going variable pay awards will be subject to the limits as set out in the policy table.
Full details of the recruitment package for any new executive directors will be set out in the next Annual Report on Remuneration.
In addition to the on-going elements of the remuneration package, the Committee reserves the right to buy-out awards being forfeited elsewhere through accepting a role at Imagination.
The Committee will give consideration to any relevant factors when determining the value of such awards, including the form of the award e. g. cash or shares, the proportion of the performance vesting period outstanding and the potential value of the forfeited remuneration, including performance conditions attached to the awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, and the timing of any potential payments.
It is the intention that such buy-out awards will be made through use of the exceptional LTIP limit.
However, the Committee may rely on the relevant Listing Rule exemption if necessary for the purpose of making a buy-out award in the event that the Group hire an executive director and need to match or pay-off shares they held with their previous company.
Where an executive director is appointed from within the organization, the Committee has the power to honour legacy arrangements in line with the original terms and conditions.
In the event of the appointment of a new non-executive director, remuneration arrangements will be in line with those detailed on page 67.
Service contracts Our policy is for notice periods for executive directors to be six months duration and each of the executive directors service contracts reflect this.
These agreements also contain restrictive covenants for periods of three to six months following termination of employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Groups customers, no-dealing with customers, and non-solicitation of the Groups suppliers and employees.
In addition, each service contract has an express obligation of confidentiality in respect of the Groups trade secrets and confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by the directors in the course of their employment.
The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as an executive director during the financial year are as follows: Contract Date Notice period Geoff Shingles 1 November 1995 6 months notice by director or Company Sir Hossein Yassaie 31 March 1998 6 months notice by director or Company Richard Smith 3 May 2011 6 months notice by director or Company In October 2013 the Chairman changed from an Executive Chairman to a non-executive Chairman.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts and are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive arrangements.
Their service does not qualify for pension purposes or other benefits, and no element of their fees is performance related.
No payments are due on loss of office.
62 Service contracts for the executive directors and Chairman, and appointment letters for the non-executive directors are available to view at the office of the Company Secretary at the registered office address.
It is the Groups policy to allow executive directors to hold non-executive positions at other companies and to receive remuneration for their services.
The Board believes that experience of the operations of other companies and their Boards and Committees is valuable to the development of the executive directors.
Termination of employment The Committee maintains a discretionary approach to the treatment of leavers, on the basis that the facts and circumstances of each case are unique.
When considering a departure event, there are a number of factors which the Committee takes into account in determining appropriate treatment for outstanding incentive awards.
These include: the position under the relevant plan documentation: the individual circumstances of the departure: any mitigating factors that might be relevant: the appropriate statutory and contractual position: the performance of the Company individual during the year to date: the nature of the handover process: and the requirements of the business for speed of change.
In some cases, the treatment is formally prescribed under the rules of the relevant plan.
Where there are good-leaver circumstances, awards which would otherwise lapse by default, will vest either on the normal vesting date or on cessation of employment.
These circumstances include death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy or sale of the Company or business.
If the executive dies or leaves due to ill health or injury, awards which have less than 12 months of the performance period remaining or LTIP awards which have less than 12 months of the deferred period to run, vest automatically on leaving.
In other leaver circumstances the Committee has discretion to determine when, and to what extent, awards vest.
The Committee considers the leaver circumstances along a continuum, ranging from bad leaver scenarios such as termination of employment for gross misconduct or resignation, through to the good leaver scenarios outlined above.
Accordingly the Committee may apply or dis-apply such performance conditions or time pro-rating awards vesting in these circumstances, as it considers appropriate.
Annual bonus In a departure event, the Committee will typically consider whether any element of annual bonus should be paid for the financial year.
Any bonus, if paid, will be limited to the period served during the financial year in which the departure occurs.
Long-Term Incentive Plans The default position is that an unvested ESP or LTIP award lapses on cessation of employment, unless the Committee applies discretion to preserve some or all of the awards.
This provides the Committee with the maximum flexibility to review the facts and circumstances of each case, allowing differentiation between good and bad leavers and avoiding payment for failure.
Compensation for loss of office and past director payments No payments were made during 2013 14 to former executive directors by way of compensation for loss of office, or pay in lieu of notice.
There are no payments to be disclosed in respect of past directors.
Relative importance of pay spend The following table summarizes the major cash distributions during the year as set out in the notes to the financial statements on page 91, compared to the total pay spend for the Group.
Dividends and share buybacks The Company has not paid any dividends or performed any share buybacks in either financial year.
Strategic report Directors report Financial report 63 The Remuneration Committee Composition Andrew Heath chairs the Remuneration Committee, made up of independent non-executive directors, which met six times during the year.
Our membership and meeting attendance are set out below.
In addition to the Committee members the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may be invited to attend meetings, except in instances where their own remuneration is discussed, or other circumstances where their attendance would not be appropriate.
Committee members Meetings Eligible to attend Attended Andrew Heath Chair 6 6 David Anderson 6 6 Gilles Delfassy 6 5 Given their diverse business experience, the independent non-executive directors who made up the Committee in 2013 14 offer a fair and balanced view in relation to remuneration matters for the Group.
Responsibility The Committee determines the remuneration policy and rewards for the executive directors and, in his absence the Chairman.
The Committee also reviews the remuneration packages of those at the next most senior level of management and has regard to levels of pay across the Group.
Salaries and fees Our policy is to set salaries in line with market median, when comparing similarly sized companies, and individual performance.
The Committee is of the view that the salary of the CEO is consistent with this policy.
Sir Hossein Yassaie consequently received a salary increase of 4.32% in April 2014, which mirrored the average employee increase across the Group.
However, in the case of our CFO, his basic salary is in the lower quartile compared to the market and the Committee will be taking steps in the coming years to bring this in line with market median.
When Richard Smith joined Imagination Technologies in 2011, a conscious decision was taken to set his salary lower than his predecessor, to reflect that he was new to the role.
Since Richard joined three years ago the Committee and the Board are pleased with his performance during a time where the Group has expanded considerably.
Taking these factors into account the Committee has increased Richards salary by 10% with effect from 1 April 2014.
External Committee advisers The Committee has access to independent professional advice on remuneration matters, Towers Watson were appointed by the Committee in 2012, and Committee members continue to be satisfied that their advice is objective and independent and their fees are in line with market practice.
Access to their global database and expertise is an important factor in considering remuneration matters across the EMB.
Work undertaken by Towers Watson in 2013 14 included advice on the structure and targets for the new LTIP and annual cash bonus plan and assistance in formally drafting the remuneration policy, for which total fees of 25,000 were paid.
The Committee also receive advice from JPMC who provided independent verification of the Total Shareholder Return TSR calculations for the LTIP.
Voting comes at the 2013 Annual General Meeting The key activities of the Committee during the year are set out in the letter to shareholders on pages 55 to 56 of this report.
As previously noted, shareholder support at the 2013 AGM was high, with 97.5% of shareholders voting in favour of the remuneration report.
The following table summarizes the details of votes cast in respect of the resolution to approve the Directors Remuneration Report at the 2013 Annual General Meeting.

TSR for the Companys shares was 53.78 % over the financial year compared with 12.35% for the FTSE All-World technology Index for the same period.
The Committee considers the FTSE All-World Technology Index to be an appropriate choice as the index contains companies from the US, Asia and Europe and therefore reflects the global environment in which the group operates.
In addition, the Index includes many companies that are currently the Groups customers, as well as companies that use Imagination technology in their products.

Share dilution It is proposed that the Group will continue to manage dilution within the context of maintaining award levels within a 15% limit over 10 years, the limit has applied since it was approved in 2006 and will expire in 2016.
The Committee will continue to keep below the 15% upper limit.
Dilution over the past five years has been 7.42%.

Pensions The Group does not operate its own pension schedule but makes payments into a group personal pension plan with defined contributions.
For executive directors, the Group match the executive contribution maximum 4.5% and contribute an extra 1.2% and after two years of membership the 1.2% is increased by another 1.8% to a maximum of 7.5%.
Benefits For executive directors the Group provides the following benefits: Car Allowance Private Medical Sir Hossein Yassaie 15,000 1,059 Richard Smith 11,000 883 Annual Bonus Plan Performance measures for the Annual Bonus Plan are set annually.
These metrics are currently a Group revenue budget and adjusted operating profit.
The Committee is of the opinion that the numerical values of targets for the Annual Bonus Plan are commercially sensitive because they include budgeted numbers within the range of outcomes and it would be detrimental to the Group to disclose them in advance of or during the relevant performance period.
The Committee retains discretion to adjust bonus targets for any financial year to reflect intervening events including acquisitions or disposals.
No such adjustments were made during the financial year.
The bonus targets set by the Committee for each year are intended to be stretching but motivational and average bonus paid to the CEO over the past five years was 18% of salary and to the CFO over the past three years was 17% of salary.
Graph illustrating the bonuses paid over the last five years to current CEO and CFO are shown below.

These include key strategic, operational or relationship objectives relating to each directors role and responsibilities.
The plan is self-funding and will only pay out when targets have been achieved.
In spite of a number of strategic achievements during the past year, there have been no payments in 2013 2014 for executives under the annual bonus plan, due to the Group not achieving the threshold financial targets.

Strategic report Directors report Financial report 69 Share Incentive Plans For 2013 14 there were three key incentive schemes in operations across the workforce as a whole.
They are as follows: For executives: LTIP SAYE For all other employees: Employee Share Plan SAYE Option grants to executive directors ceased in 2006.
The move away from options to restricted shares for all employees in 2006 has reduced potential dilution and has simplified remuneration arrangements.
Shares earned are satisfied through the issue of new shares and some shares have been purchased to satisfy share awards made under the new LTIP for executives.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP 2013 14 The new LTIP was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2013 and is currently only offered to executives of the Group.
The LTIP is subject to performance conditions.

The reason for these percentage limits is largely due to the Group operating and competing for high calibre executives and to act as an incentive to retain executives to achieve the long-term growth plans of the Group.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee wants to be able to make share awards of 600% of base salary.
This facility was established primarily to facilitate global recruitment of executives, and especially to attract key executives from the US.
70 Linkage of Long-Term Incentive Plan targets to business strategy The new Long-Term Incentive Plan has a number of targets, as described above, which are relevant to the long term strategy of the Group.
Our intent is to review these targets on an annual basis, taking into account market conditions and any other relevant factors to ensure that they remain appropriate in the context of the factors set out above.
The Committee will review their applicability on an annual basis, so that in the event that exceptional circumstances arise, such as material corporate activity or substantial changes in market conditions, their impact can be considered against subsequent annual awards.
If changes are to be proposed for any prospective LTIP award, it would be the Committees intention to confirm any such change to shareholders in advance.
Former share option schemes The executives have no legacy share options.
Shareholding requirements Under the new LTIP approved at the AGM in 2013 executives are required to build up and retain shares to a specified percentage of salary, 250% for the CEO and 175% for the CFO.
Until these targets have been reached, the executives must retain at least half of any shares acquired under the new LTIP but not taking into account, for these purposes, any shares sold to meet any tax liabilities arising in connection with the new LTIP.
