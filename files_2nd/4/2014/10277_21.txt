Strategic report Governance Financial statements Further information Overview 55 Remuneration Committee Report Dear Shareholders, 2014 has remained an extremely busy year for the Remuneration Committee the Committee as we finalised and gained shareholder approval for our Directors Remuneration Policy, and approved the remuneration arrangements for our outgoing and incoming Group Chief Executive Officers.
The Remuneration Policy was approved at our annual general meeting in May with an extremely positive 99% of shareholder votes cast in favour.
In the lead up to the meeting and following feedback from various proxy advisor agencies, the Committee took the opportunity to clarify that the provision of discretion under Listing Rule 9.4.
2 2 referred to on page 60 under the Policy Table would be used only to compensate a newly-appointed Executive Director for long-term incentive scheme awards forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Any such buyout awards will have a fair value no greater than the awards forfeited.
The Policy that exists for current Executive Directors, as set out in the Policy Table, would then apply to the balance of the individuals remuneration package.
Other than this point of clarification, the Remuneration Policy remains unchanged and therefore, in line with best practice, will not be put to shareholders for re-approval at the 2015 annual general meeting.
After taking into account the performance of the Company and considering Mr Wongs personal achievements, the Committee has awarded a bonus of 609,364 2013: 649,838 which represents 62% of the maximum opportunity.
Turning to our Long-Term Incentive Plan, the performance measures of total shareholder return and earnings per share for the threeyear period ended on 31 December 2014 did not meet the minimum thresholds required and, therefore, the awards granted in 2012 will lapse.
In addition to its annual agenda, the Committee has also been closely involved in determining the remuneration arrangements relating to the change of Group Chief Executive Officer.
The outgoing Group Chief Executive Officer, Wong Hong Ren, has made an outstanding contribution to the Group over the past fourteen years, especially the last three leading the Company.
We took this into account when determining the arrangements in connection with his leaving his post.
These arrangements, which are within the approved Remuneration Policy and the discretions available to the Committee, are disclosed fully on pages 63 and 64 of this Report and on the Companys website at www.
In the competitive recruitment environment that exists, the Committee has been acutely aware of balancing the need to create an attractive package for the new Group Chief Executive Officer that would incentivise him and remain within the Companys Remuneration Policy.
I am very pleased that Aloysius Lee Tse Sang will be leading the Company through its next chapter and, on joining, his salary will be 500,000 per annum, with other elements of the package aligned to our existing Remuneration Policy.
This package has been designed to reflect his experience and to ensure through the variable elements of remuneration that he will be appropriately incentivised and rewarded for bringing success to the Company.
Sean Collins stepped down from the Board during December 2014 and left the Committee and I would like to record my thanks for the dedication and wise counsel that he brought to our meetings.
I would also like to take the opportunity to reiterate that the Committees continued commitment to focus on pay for performance and rewarding the leadership team in a way which aligns them with the interests of our shareholders, while staying true to the Companys values.
The Directors Remuneration Report, consisting of this Annual Statement, the Directors Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration, is compliant with the reporting requirements, and the Committee welcomes any feedback from our shareholders and trust that you will support the policies and practices outlined in this report.
Yours faithfully Alexander Waugh Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 9 February 2015 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2014 56 Governance Remuneration Committee Report continued Membership Alexander Waugh chairs the Remuneration Committee which comprises all of the current independent Non-Executive Directors except Gervase MacGregor.
All Committee members served throughout the full year and both Ian Batey and Sean Collins served for the period they were Directors of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee held five scheduled meetings in 2014 and a number of ad hoc meetings as required.
Attendance of the scheduled meetings is shown on page 48.
The Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer are invited to attend meetings as appropriate but they are excluded when their own performance and remuneration are being discussed.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder of the Company, in the matters to be decided by the Committee or involvement in the day-to-day management of the business of the Group.
Our role The Remuneration Committee has delegated authority from the Board to determine the total remuneration arrangements of the Chairman, Executive Directors and, in consultation with the Group Chief Executive Officer, executive management.
It also oversees the Groups share-based incentive arrangements.
In practice, the Committee agrees: the policy for cash remuneration, executiveshare plans, service contracts and termination arrangements: the framework for the remuneration of the Chairman, the Executive Directors and, in consultation with the Group Chief Executive Officer, executive management: the actual reward packages of Executive Directors, executive management and any new senior hires: actual termination arrangements for any Executive Directors: recommendations to the Board concerning any new executive share plans or changes to existing schemes which require shareholders approval: and the basis on which awards are granted to executives under the LTIP.
The Remuneration Committees terms of reference are available at www.
Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Further information Overview 57 Directors remuneration policy Remuneration Policy The Companys Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting held on 1 May 2014 and remains unchanged.
In April 2014, following feedback from various proxy advisor agencies, the Remuneration Committee clarified its discretion to use 9.4.
2 2 of the UK Listing Rules issued by the UKLA Listing Rule 9.4.
2 2 and this is now disclosed within the Policy.
The Remuneration Policy set out below is as disclosed in the 2013 Remuneration Report save for the pay scenario chart on page 61 which has been updated for Aloysius Lee Tse Sangs package as Group Chief Executive Officer and the clarification mentioned above on the use of Listing Rule 9.4.
Policy for Executive Directors: Presently there is only one Executive Director, the Group Chief Executive Officer, but a similar policy would be applied to any other Executive Directors appointed to the Board.
Base salary Purpose and link to strategy Salaries are a key component of the reward package in attracting, motivating and retaining executives.
Operation Salaries in the Group are based on the value of the individual, the level of responsibility, experience and market conditions.
Salaries are reviewed at least annually but are not necessarily increased.
In reviewing salaries, account is taken of market conditions, significant changes in role, pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group, inflation and budgets.
Maximum The maximum salary payable is the amount agreed by the Remuneration Committee for the period.
The Committee does not prescribe a maximum salary for any employee in the Group as it wishes to retain the flexibility to set levels of pay appropriate to roles and market conditions.
The establishment of maximum salaries could result in unrealistic expectations of employees and weaken the Companys negotiating position.
Annual bonus Purpose and link to strategy Executive Directors are eligible to participate in an annual bonus scheme to: incentivise executives to drive Group strategy and performance over the short term: and ensure that a significant proportion of the total reward of executives packages is linked to performance during the year.
Operation The performance period for annual bonuses corresponds with the financial year.
Bonus measures, weightings and targets are set annually at the start of the financial year by the Committee which retains discretion to revise any calculated bonus downwards, but not upwards, if it is felt to have become misaligned with the Groups performance.
Payment of the annual bonus is contingent on the employee still being employed by the Group at the time of vesting and not having served notice.
Annual bonus is not pensionable.
The Committee may defer and pay a proportion up to 100% of the annual bonus in shares which must be held for three years before vesting.
No performance conditions apply to such deferred bonus shares other than a requirement for continuous employment but such deferred bonus share awards would be eligible for a dividend equivalent.
In the event that annual bonuses are found to have been paid on the basis of any material misstatement of financial performance, the rules of the scheme provide for appropriate means of redress, including the adjustment of future 1 bonuses and any unvested long-term incentive awards.
Maximum The level of bonus opportunity for Executive Directors is: Group Chief Other Executive Directors Executive Officer Bonus as a % of base salary Threshold 0% 0% Target 75% 50% Maximum 150% 100% The maximum value of a deferred bonus share award is the value of the cash bonus that would otherwise have been paid.
1 Performance 70% of bonus potential will be linked to financial performance, with the remainder linked to personal objectives and individual contribution.
However, the Committee has discretion to vary those percentages by plus or minus 10% for any performance period to reflect particular corporate objectives.
Financial measures may include, but are not limited to, operating profit, profit before tax, revenue and revenue per available room.
1 The Remuneration Committee wish to clarify that a clawback of paid bonuses has and will continue to exist within its Remuneration Policy.
Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2014 58 Governance Remuneration Committee Report continued Long-Term Incentive Plan Purpose and link to strategy The Company adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP in 2006 which forms the long-term variable element of executive remuneration.
The Plan allows for the award of performance shares, nil cost share options and deferred bonus shares.
Performance share awards aim to drive and reward sustained performance over the long term, align the interests of executives and shareholders and support retention.
Operation Performance share awards are made annually and vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant subject to the achievement of performance conditions over three years and continued employment with the Group, subject to the rules of the plan.
The Plan provides for dividends or their equivalent to be paid.
In the event that performance shares are found to have vested on the basis of any material misstatement of financial performance, the rules of the scheme provide for appropriate means of redress, including the adjustment of future bonuses and any unvested long-term incentive awards.
Maximum The maximum value of an award of performance shares and nil cost share options is 150% of base salary, though 200% may be awarded in exceptional circumstances included but not limited to the recruitment of new Executive Directors.
The level of awards is otherwise determined by the Committee at the time of grant.
2 Performance The performance measures are Earnings per Share EPS, Relative Total Shareholder Return TSR and Net Asset Value plus dividends NAV.
The weightings applying to each performance measure may vary year-on-year reflecting strategic priorities.
Whilst a number of performance measures are applied, weighting for any one measure is expected to range between 10% and 60%.
Under each measure, entry level performance will result in 25% of maximum vesting for that element, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting.
Pension Purpose and link to strategy The provision of retirement benefits is an important element of executive reward packages in attracting and retaining executives and promoting long-term retirement planning.
Operation A defined cash contribution may be made into either a Company sponsored pension plan or a private pension plan or as cash in lieu of pension.
Maximum 20% of base salary and by exception up to 30% of base salary.
Other benefits Purpose and link to strategy Help recruit and retain through the provision of cost effective benefits consistent with market practice.
Operation Benefits are determined to ensure they are competitive with market practice by location and the responsibilities of the individual.
These may comprise although are not limited to a motor vehicle and driver or an appropriate allowance, insurances for life, personal accident, disability and family medical cover.
Additional benefits such as relocation, removal, tax equalisation, house purchase rental and childrens education may need to be offered to attract the right candidate in the event that an Executive Director is appointed on expatriate or international assignment terms.
Maximum There is no maximum.
The value of other benefits is consistent with market practice and is kept under review by the Committee but would not be expected to exceed more than the equivalent of a months salary, other than in exceptional circumstances such as a relocation requirement.
Notes: 1 The Committee determines bonus performance measures, weightings and targets annually which are closely aligned with the Groups short-term strategic priorities.
Targets for financial measures are set by reference to the Groups budget, while the personal element of the bonus is driven by personal KPIs set at the start of the year.
2 The Committee determines the level of LTIP awards and the associated performance measures, targets and weightings annually.
The performance measures of EPS and relative TSR ensure that executives are aligned with shareholder interests and are consistent with FTSE market practice.
The introduction in 2014 of a third measure, NAV plus dividends, improves the alignment with the Groups strategic priorities by capturing a balance sheet measure.
The targets for the financial measures are set by reference to the Groups budget and strategic plans as well as taking account of broker forecasts for both the Group and other sector peers.
The TSR target measures comparative performance against a relevant benchmark which for 2015 will be split equally between the FTSE250 market index and an index of peer companies.
3 The Committee retains discretion to use Listing Rule 9.4.
2 2, within the remit confirmed on page 60, to make awards in exceptional circumstances.
4 The Committee retains discretion to make non-significant changes to the Remuneration policy without reverting to shareholders.

Remuneration on recruitment Reward packages for new Executive Directors will be consistent with the policy set out on pages 57 and 58, which describes each component of remuneration for the Executive Directors of the Company.
Fixed remuneration elements would be paid only from the date of employment and any bonus will be pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year.
The maximum level of variable remuneration is as stated in the policy table above.
If, consequent to joining the Group, a new director forfeits elements of variable reward linked to their previous employment, the Committee reserves the right to make compensatory awards up to the maximum amount of the individuals loss.
Any such awards would be made taking into account the performance conditions and time horizon of the forfeited awards.
In the event that an internal candidate is appointed as an Executive Director, any contractual obligation in respect of a previous role will be honoured even if it is inconsistent with this policy at the time the obligation is fulfilled.

2 2 will only be used to compensate an Executive Director for long-term incentive scheme awards forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Such buyout awards will have a fair value no greater than the awards forfeited.

Change in Group Chief Executive Officer and remuneration arrangements As detailed in the announcement made on 7 November 2014, Wong Hong Ren will step down as Group Chief Executive Officer on 28February 2015 and Aloysius Lee Tse Sang will replace him.
The Remuneration Committee has been actively involved in agreeing the terms of Wong Hong Rens remuneration in connection with his departure and in setting the arrangements for the new Group Chief Executive Officer.
Terms of Wong Hong Rens departure The Remuneration Committee has determined the following treatment for Wong Hong Rens remuneration in connection with his departure.
He will: receive a cash payment equal to one years salary which will be paid in 12 equal instalments until the end of February 2016 as provided for under his service agreement: be eligible for an annual bonus for both the full year ended 2014 and for the proportion of 2015 that he remains as an employee of the Company: act in a consultancy capacity as Senior Adviser to the Group for a period from 1 March 2015.
He will not earn additional fees for any transition assistance that may be required.
Fees payable under the consultancy arrangement in relation to special projects will be determined and agreed by Mr Wong and the Board of Directors in the future for each such project and will not be deducted from his monthly base salary instalments: be permitted to retain any fees or other compensation payable to him by any associate or non-controlled joint venture of the Company or by any third party company.
Any fees payable to him for continuing to serve as a director of any subsidiary of the Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2014 64 Governance Remuneration Committee Report continued Company will be payable to the Company: not receive an LTIP award in 2015: not be entitled to an acceleration of vesting for any existing share awards: retain his interest in the 2013 and 2014 LTIP awards, which will not be time pro-rated and will vest at the normal date, subject to the agreed performance conditions being met: and be entitled to receive a lump sum payment for up to five days of accrued, but unused holiday, and up to 5,000 for reimbursement of legal fees related to his review of these arrangements.
The above arrangements ensure that any remaining payments from employment e. g. bonus and any LTIP vesting beyond contractual entitlements to Wong Hong Ren are aligned with the performance of the Company following his departure and are a sign of his confidence in the new management and the businesss continuing prospects.
From 1 January 2015 to 28 February 2015, Wong Hong Rens remuneration will remain at a rate paid during the year ended 31December 2014.
Wong Hong Rens base salary has not increased since his appointment as Group Chief Executive Officer on 27 June 2011.
Appointment of Aloysius Lee Tse Sang as Group Chief Executive Officer Aloysius Lee Tse Sang will be appointed as Group Chief Executive Officer and an Executive Director on 1 March 2015, after serving as Group Chief Executive Officer designate from 1 February 2015.

The Committee considered Aloysius Lee Tse Sangs package in light of the role, the individual and relative market positioning.

No buy-out arrangements were entered into as part of Aloysius Lee Tse Sangs recruitment.
