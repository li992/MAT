2 UK statutory basis columns d, f and h : These gures are calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in the BIS Regulations.
They include, for performance-related Share based awards, the value attributable to share price appreciation since the date the award was granted.
In the case of the CEOs gures, the amount included that relates to share price appreciation is 1.5m for 2013 and 7.6m for 2014.
3 Dutch Civil Code basis columns e, g and i : These gures comply with the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code.
The gures for Share based awards comprise the multi-year incentive charges in accordance with IFRS2 Share based Payment.
These IFRS2 charges do not reect the actual value received on vesting.
The gures for pensions reect the cost of pension provision which comprises i for dened benefit schemes, the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension during the year net of ination, Directors contributions and participation fee based on the factors and basis applicable prior to the introduction of the new UK statutory basis in 2013 and ii for dened contribution schemes, payments made to the scheme or to the Executive Director in lieu of pension.
4 Share based awards for Erik Engstrom columns d and e : The gure for 2013 in column d was based on an estimate and has been restated in this Report to reect the amount vested and the share prices and foreign exchange rates on the vesting dates of the 2011-13 cycle of BIP and ESOS.
The vesting percentages under these plans were determined on 28 February 2014 and were in line with those disclosed on page 87 in the 2013 Remuneration Report.
Using the share prices and exchange rates on the vesting dates increased the 2013 disclosed gure by 5,651 from 2,466,655 to 2,472,306.
The 2014 gures reect the vesting of the matching shares under the final tranche of the REGP measured over the 2010-14 period and the 2012-14 cycle of BIP and ESOS, both measured over the 2012-14 period.
As the REGP matching shares and BIP vest after the approval date of the Report and ESOS vests in May 2015, the average share prices and foreign exchange rates for the last quarter of 2014 have been used to arrive at an estimated gure under the UK statutory basis in respect of these awards.
The amount attributable to the vesting of the final tranche of the REGP in the UK statutory basis 2014 Share based awards gure is 9m.
The Share based awards gure includes the dividend equivalent payments paid out in cash in 2015 on the REGP matching shares and the BIP.
The proportion of the value of the CEOs Share based awards under the UK statutory basis that relates to share price appreciation between the dates of grant and vesting is 59% or 1.5m for 2013 and 57% or 7.6m for 2014 using, as required, the average share prices for the last quarter of 2014.
5 Benets: Each Executive Director receives a car allowance, private medical dental insurance and the company meets the cost of tax return preparation.
In respect of Duncan Palmer, the gure also includes a cash adjustment payment of 162,906 that was contractually due to him on termination relating to the pro-rated restricted share award released to him and legal expenses of 2,760 met by Reed Elsevier in connection with his loss of ofce arrangement.

The 2013 benets gure for Duncan Palmer included estimated amounts in respect of the relocation benets and has been restated in this Report to reect actuals.

1 The face value of the LTIP and ESOS awards is calculated using 1 the middle market quotation of PLC ordinary shares: 2 the closing price of NV ordinary shares: and 3 the exchange rate on the day before grant.
In respect of grants made to Erik Engstrom on 7 April 2014, 1 was 9.245 and 2 was 15.82.
In respect of Nick Luff, who joined the Group on 1 September 2014, and whose grants were made on 2 September 2014, 1 was 9.90 and 2 was 17.50.
These share prices are used to determine the number of awards granted, as well as to set option exercise prices.
The face value of the ESOS options shown in this column has not been reduced to reect the fact that the aggregate option price is payable on exercise.
The face value of the BIP awards is calculated using the average price of participants investment shares purchased by the trustee.
In respect of the matching award to Erik Engstrom on 7 April 2014, who invested in NV ADRs, the price per NV ADR was $42.951.
In respect of the matching award to Nick Luff on 2 September 2014, who invested in PLC and NV ordinary shares, the price per PLC ordinary share was 9.96 and the price per NV ordinary share was 17.614.
The face values for BIP and LTIP do not take into account the dividend equivalents relating to those awards.
2 For BIP, LTIP and ESOS, vesting in line with expectations is as per the performance scenario chart disclosed on page 83 of the 2013 Remuneration Report, i. e. 67% for BIP, 50% for LTIP and 80% for ESOS.
For options vesting in line with expectations, a valuation factor of 20% of the face value of the award at grant has been applied.
Vesting in line with expectations for the performance share awards granted to Nick Luff, assumes, in respect of the award with a performance period ended 31 December 2014, that the thresholds for EPS and ROIC are met which results in 100% vesting.
In respect of the award with the performance period ending 31 December 2015, which mirrors the performance conditions applicable to the 2013 LTIP award, vesting in line with expectations is 50%.
3 Threshold payout levels for each measure have been included.
Where there are multiple measures, it is possible to achieve threshold, and hence payout, in respect of just one of the measures or, for TSR, in respect of one of the three TSR comparator groups.
The performance measures and targets for awards granted in 2014 under each of the plans and for the performance share awards granted to Nick Luff are set out on page 81.
4 The performance share awards granted to Nick Luff on 2 September 2014 were essential to facilitate his recruitment and were disclosed in the notices of the 2014 annual general meetings of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV.
The awards were split evenly between ordinary shares in Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV.
The awards of Reed Elsevier PLC ordinary shares fall within paragraph 9.4.
2 2 R of the UK Listing Rules and the awards of Reed Elsevier NV ordinary shares were approved by shareholders at the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting of Reed Elsevier NV on 23 April 2014.
The awards are not pensionable and lapse on resignation or dismissal for cause although in the case of a resignation, if an award has already vested and the date of resignation is within two years of Mr Luff joining the Group, then time pro-ration clawback provisions will apply to such award.
In all other circumstances of termination, the share awards will vest subject to performance at the end of the applicable performance period with pro-ration for service applied, except in the case of a company initiated termination in which event the award will not be pro-rated.
