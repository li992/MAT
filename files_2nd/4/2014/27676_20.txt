The policy is also displayed on the Companys website.
The committee will consider the Directors Remuneration Policy annually, to ensure that it remains aligned with business needs and is appropriately positioned relative to the market.
The Directors Remuneraton Policy must be put before shareholders for approval at least every three years.
Market benchmarks We benchmark total potential remuneration against remuneration packages paid by peer group companies.
Two peer groups are used for this purpose, namely: i FTSE 100 companies of a similar size by market capitalisation: and ii large European insurers.
The peer groups are kept under review to take into account different companies that enter the market or those that change their size or the main characteristics of their business.
We also look at remuneration arrangements in other types of UK-based financial sector companies.
Balancing shortand long-term remuneration Based on our view of current market practice and our remuneration principles, we have established the remuneration policy set out in this report.
Fixed annual elements, including base pay and benefits, recognise the status of our executives and ensure current and future market competitiveness.
STI and LTI arrangements are designed to motivate and reward them for making the Company successful on a sustainable basis.
Executive directors are also expected to retain sufficient of the vested shares from LTI and deferred STI share incentive awards, over a five-year period from the time of their appointment, to meet their respective shareholding requirements.
The shareholding linkage cements the relationship between the executive directors personal returns and those of the Companys investors.
The committee has discretion to amend the weighting of STI and LTI measures from year to year, in order to ensure that the executive directors are incentivised to drive performance in line with the Companys core strategic objectives.

Malus provision All LTI and deferred STI awards contain a malus provision, which gives the committee the power to reduce awards if the results on which they were based were misleading or materially incorrect or were subsequently found to have relied on poor risk management or material misrepresentation of performance.
100 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Governance Notes to the Directors Remuneration Policy table executive directors Performance measures and targets The committee selects performance measures that are central to the Companys overall strategy and are used by the executive directors and Board in overseeing the operation of the business.
The performance targets for STI are determined annually by the committee and are set in a range around the business plan for the year, as agreed by the Board.
External directorships Executive directors are, subject to prior clearance by the Board, permitted to hold one external non-executive directorship of a listed company and are entitled to retain the fees payable to them for doing so.
Treatment of incentive awards on termination or change of control For all deferred shortand long-term incentives, the share incentive plan rules provide for automatic Good Leaver status on termination of employment in the event of: i death: ii retirement: iii injury or disability: iv redundancy: v the employing company or business ceasing to be a subsidiary or business of Old Mutual plc: and vi certain takeovers and other corporate events.
In addition, the committee has discretion to award Good Leaver status for any other reason discretionary Good Leavers.
In these circumstances, the committee has discretion to apply less generous terms than would apply under the automatic Good Leaver reasons.

Anyone who is not a Good Leaver or a discretionary Good Leaver Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Companys approach to executive director and wider employee remuneration is based on a common set of remuneration principles and a governance structure, which have been implemented across all major subsidiaries.
This includes subsidiary remuneration committees with agreed terms of reference, who have oversight over local matters and ensure that the remuneration principles and policies are implemented consistently.
Although the committee does not consult directly with employees on executive director remuneration policy, it reviews proposals in the context of a detailed understanding of remuneration for the broader employee population.
The structure of total remuneration packages for executive directors, and for the broader employee population, is similar, comprising base pay, pension and benefits and eligibility for a discretionary STI based on performance in the financial year.
The level of STI and the portion deferred are determined by role and responsibility.
The Group LTI plan applies to executive directors and senior executives based at the Groups head office in London, and other LTI plans are in place for senior executives in subsidiary companies.
Annual base pay increases for the executive directors are limited to the average pay increase for employees in their home country, unless there has been a change in role or salary progression for a newly appointed director.
Old Mutual plc 101 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued Approach to remuneration in connection with recruitment The committees approach to remuneration in connection with recruitment is to pay no more than is necessary to attract appropriate candidates to the role.
It should be noted that the Company operates in a specialised sector and many of its competitors for talent are from outside the UK.
Remuneration terms for any new executive directors will be based on the approved remuneration policy and would include the same elements, and be subject to the same constraints, as those of the existing executive directors as shown below: Element of remuneration Maximum percentage of base pay Base pay Benefit allowance for retirement, elective benefits or in cash 35% Other benefits Dependent on circumstances and location STI 150% LTI 250% 400% in exceptional circumstances When it is necessary to buy out an individuals unvested awards from a previous employer, the committee will seek to match the expected value of the awards by granting awards that vest over a time frame similar to those given up, with a commensurate reduction in quantum where the new awards will be subject to performance conditions that are not as stretching as those applicable to the awards given up.
Existing annual incentive given up may be bought out on an expected value basis or, at the discretion of the committee, through a guaranteed STI award for the first performance year only.
Where appropriate, the committee will agree reasonable costs of relocation in line with the Groups mobility policy which, based on individual circumstances, provides for a settling-in allowance and costs incurred such as travel, shipping, immigration and tax advice, temporary housing, transaction costs on home sale purchase, home school search and school fees and, if in relation to a temporary assignment, tax equalisation and a housing allowance.
All of these costs will be covered gross of tax incurred by the executive, where applicable.
Service agreements and payment for loss of office Executive directors service agreements are designed to provide an appropriate level of protection for the executive and the Company by: i setting out individual entitlements to elements of remuneration consistent with policy: ii summarising notice periods and compensation on termination of employment by the Company: and iii describing the obligations in relation to confidentiality, data protection, intellectual property and restraint on certain activities.
Service agreements for the current executive directors are available on the Companys website www.
In the event that the employment of an executive director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with the terms of the service agreement between the Company and the executive director, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
The Companys policy is to make payments in accordance with pre-established contractual arrangements, but with consideration of individual circumstances.
These circumstances may include the reason for termination and, for deferred STI and LTI share incentive awards, some discretion in the determination of Good Leaver status for vesting of such awards.
The policy in this respect is set out in the following table: Standard provision Policy Details Other provisions in contract Notice Policy is to provide a maximum of In certain cases, executive directors will not be Current contractual terms 12 months notice.

Figures represent remuneration paid for the period up to that date Element Explanation Taxable benefits These amounts represent the gross value of benefits that are paid for by the Company and are chargeable to UK income tax.
They cover such items as spouses travel, use of a car and driver and, for Ingrid Johnson, relocation costs.
In order for Ingrid Johnson to take up the role of Group Finance Director, she was required to relocate from South Africa to the UK.
In accordance with the approved Directors Remuneration Policy, the Company paid for certain costs of relocating, such as relocation agents costs, moving costs, transport of household items, temporary housing and transaction costs, and indirect costs of purchasing a house in London.
The total value of the costs covered was 709,338.
The Company accounted for the tax due on these costs directly, resulting in a gross cost of 1,272,793.
It is this value that is included in the single total figure.
STI STI awarded in relation to performance in the year, including 50% that is deferred for three years in the form of a share incentive award.
In accordance with the payment structure agreed when Ingrid Johnson was appointed Group Finance Director, an amount equal to 50% of her total STI, inclusive of the amount paid for service with Nedbank up to 30 June 2014, will be deferred for three years in the form of a share incentive award.
Vesting of the share incentive award is not subject to the achievement of performance targets, but requires the director to remain in employment with the Group during the vesting period.
Malus applies to the shares held under award prior to vesting.
LTI The 2013 Directors Remuneration Report reflected the value of LTI vesting based on the average Old Mutual plc share price over the final quarter of 2013 194.3p as the options granted in 2011 had not vested at the time of publication.
The figures have been updated to reflect the actual market value of 50% of the award that vested in April 2014, namely 198.93p per share, while the balance of 50% which vests in April 2015 remains valued as it was in 2013.
In addition, Philip Broadleys LTI for 2013 has been updated to reflect the actual pro-rating of his award in relation to his service with the Group during the vesting period.
The 2014 LTI values have been calculated using the average share price over the final quarter of 2014 188.3p and, for the 50% of the options granted in 2012 that will vest in April 2015, will be restated in the 2015 Directors Remuneration Report.
Malus applies to the shares held under option prior to vesting.
In respect of Ingrid Johnson, the LTI figure represents the value of her Nedbank awards which are due to vest in 2015, calculated using the average Nedbank share price over the final quarter of 2014 R232.85, converted to sterling at a rate of R17.8712 to 1.

The committee concluded that no such adjustments were necessary In respect of the STI, the targets were adjusted positively negatively for corporate transactions that were not envisaged when they were set.
This was in order to preserve the stretch in the original targets.

In regard to Philip Broadleys unvested deferred STI and LTI awards, the committee exercised its discretion to treat him under Good Leaver provisions on the basis of his: Agreement not to join a competitor of the Old Mutual Group: Agreement to work with the Board to achieve an effective succession and transition process: and Strong performance in his role for over five years, which greatly contributed to the Groups recovery, rationalisation and improved financial position.
It was agreed that: Vesting of deferred STI awards and LTI awards would not be accelerated and awards would vest at the same time as would have applied if he had remained in employment All share incentive awards would be subject to forfeiture provisions for malus, on the same basis as if he had remained in employment LTI awards would vest only to the extent that the performance conditions had been met, and pro-rata for service He would not take up employment with or become a director of a competitor and, should he do so without the committees express permission, he would be deemed to have waived his rights to any unvested share incentive awards at that time.
The committee has considered whether the above conditions have been met in respect of deferred STI and LTI awards due to vest in 2015 and has concluded that the awards should vest.
Details of the value of the LTI award will be disclosed in the 2015 Directors Remuneration Report.
Outcomes for LTI awards over Nedbank shares granted in 2012 for the performance period 2012 2014 Restricted share awards over 49,418 Nedbank shares were granted to Ingrid Johnson in March 2012.

The committee will apply its discretion in determining the final outcomes in relation to the 2014 LTI, and in this regard: It will receive a report from the Chief Risk Officer to confirm that the performance of the Group has been achieved within the stated risk appetite.
Where the risk appetite has been breached, the committee will have discretion to reduce the level of vesting accordingly.
It will exercise its discretion to make adjustments where there is a significant negative impact on underlying financial performance which is not adequately reflected in AOP results for example, where LTIR adjustments create any inconsistency between AOP and IFRS basic earnings.
Where the Group undergoes a significant change, such as a large disposal, acquisition or restructuring, the committee will review the targets to assess whether they need to be adjusted to reflect the change, or whether they should be replaced altogether.

Shares in trust and shareholder dilution At 31 December 2014, there were 121,102,176 shares held in employee share ownership trusts ESOTs for the purposes of collaterising some of the obligations under the Groups employee share incentive schemes.
The strategy is to ensure that, with the exception of Black Economic Empowerment-related ESOTs, at least sufficient shares are held to satisfy restricted share forfeitable shares awards.
In calculating dilution limits, any awards that are satisfied by transfer of pre-existing issued shares such as shares acquired by market purchase through ESOTs and any shares comprised in any share option or share award that has lapsed or has been cash-settled are disregarded.
At 31 December 2014, the Company had 2.24% of share capital available under the 5%-in-10-years limit applicable to discretionary share incentive schemes and 6.46% of share capital available under the 10%-in-10-years limit applicable to all share incentive schemes.
The Company has complied with these limits at all times.

The split in financial metrics and personal scorecard objectives is 75% and 25% respectively for Julian Roberts, and 60% and 40% respectively for Paul Hanratty and Ingrid Johnson.
The agreed financial measures for 2015 are EPS in constant currency and RoE.
These have been used as the core measures of financial performance for a number of years, as they are the most meaningful central measures of the effective use of capital and annual profit as the Group executes its strategy to grow the business through investment, integration and collaboration initiatives.
The committee will disclose the STI targets retrospectively in the 2015 Directors Remuneration Report as the committee believes that the STI targets are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the Companys interests to disclose them at the start of the performance period.
The committee considers corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues, to the extent relevant, when setting executive directors remuneration.
