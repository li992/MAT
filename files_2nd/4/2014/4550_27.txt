However, higher increases may be awarded in certain circumstances, such as: on promotion or in the event of an increase in scope of the role or the individuals responsibilities: where an individual has been appointed to the Board at a lower than typical market salary to allow for growth in the role in which case larger increases may be awarded to move salary positioning to a typical market level as the individual gains experience: change in size and complexity of the Group: and or significant market movement.
Such increases may be implemented over such time period as the Committee deems appropriate.

Explanation of Performance Metrics Performance measures for the LTIP and annual bonus are selected to reflect the Companys strategy.
Stretching performance targets are set each year by the Committee taking into account a number of different factors.
The Committee considers that the underlying profit before tax is closely aligned to the Groups key performance metrics: together with annual personal objectives linked to the achievement of strategic milestones, we consider that this encourages sustainable growth year by year.
The application of EPS and TSR targets to the LTIP aligns managements objectives with those of shareholders for the longer term.
The Committee may vary any performance measure if an event occurs which causes it to determine that it would be appropriate to do so, provided that any such variation is fair and reasonable and in the opinion of the Committee the change would not make the measure less demanding.
If the Committee were to make such a variation, an explanation would be given in the next Remuneration Report.

Recruitment Remuneration Policy When hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee will typically align the remuneration package with the above Policy.
When determining appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Committee may include other elements of pay which it considers are appropriate.
However, this discretion is capped and is subject to the principles set out on page 87 and the limits referred to below.
Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the experience of the Director being appointed.
This may include agreement on future increases up to a market rate, in line with increased experience and or responsibilities, subject to good performance, where it is considered appropriate.
Pension and benefits will only be provided in line with the above Policy.
The Committee will not offer non-performance related incentive payments for example a guaranteed sign-on bonus.
Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2014 92 Total remuneration 000 Total remuneration 000 Total remuneration 000 Our Governance 93 Other elements may be included in the following circumstances: o an interim appointment being made to fill an Executive Director role on a short term basis: o if exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a Non-Executive Director takes on an executive function on a short term basis: o if an Executive Director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or long term incentive award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance.
Subject to the limit on variable remuneration set out below, the quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may be transferred to the subsequent year so that reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis: o if the Director will be required to relocate in order to take up the position, it is the Companys policy to allow reasonable relocation, travel and subsistence payments.
Any such payments will be at the discretion of the Committee.
The Committee may also alter the performance measures, performance period and vesting period of the annual bonus or LTIP, subject to the rules of the LTIP, if the Committee determines that the circumstances of the recruitment merit such alteration.
The rationale will be clearly explained in the next Directors Remuneration Report.
The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted excluding buyout awards as referred to below is 300% of salary.
The Committee may make payments or awards in respect of hiring an employee to buyout remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to the forfeited arrangements and the time over which they would have vested.
The Committee will generally seek to structure buyout awards or payments on a comparable basis to the remuneration arrangements forfeited.
Any such payments or awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above.
Buyout awards will ordinarily be granted on the basis that they are subject to forfeiture or clawback in the event of departure within 12 months of joining Dechra, although the Committee will retain discretion not to apply forfeiture or clawback in appropriate circumstances.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under Dechras existing share plans.
If necessary and subject to the limits referred to above, recruitment awards may be granted outside of these plans as permitted under the Listing Rules which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of an Executive Director.
Where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue in accordance with their terms.
Fees payable to a newly appointed Chairman or Non-Executive Director will be in line with the policy in place at the time of appointment.
Policy on Service Contracts: Details of the Executive Directors service contracts Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment are set out below.

Such a payment would consist of basic salary for the unexpired period of notice and may also include benefits for that period.
Annual Bonus This will be reviewed on an individual basis and the decision whether or not to award a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon a number of factors including the circumstances of their departure and their contribution to the business during the bonus period in question.
Any bonus payment would typically be pro-rated for time in service to termination and paid at the usual time although the Committee retains discretion to pay the bonus earlier in appropriate circumstances.
LTIP If an Executive Director ceases employment with the Group for any reason within the first 12 months of the performance period relating to an award under the LTIP, that award will lapse.
If an Executive Director ceases employment with the Group before the end of the performance period relating to an award under the LTIP as a result of retirement, ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, death, transfer of his employing entity out of the Group or any other reason, at the discretion of the Committee, the award will usually vest on the normal vesting date, although the Committee has discretion to permit the award to vest on cessation.
In either case, the award will vest to the extent determined by reference to the relevant performance conditions and as reduced to reflect the period of time from the start of the performance period to the date of cessation.
If an Executive Director ceases employment for any reason after the end of the performance period relating to an award under the LTIP, that award will continue to subsist in accordance with the rules of the LTIP.
Pension This would be taken into account as part of the payment referred to in the base salary section.
Recruitment Awards Anne-Francoise Nesmes was granted two recruitment awards, as referred to in the Companys Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 June 2013.
The first of those Awards vested on 30 June 2014 and may be exercised until 30 December 2014.
If Anne-Francoise Nesmes ceases employment with the Group before exercise as a result of ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, death, transfer of her employing entity out of the Group or any other reason, at the discretion of the Committee, the award will continue to subsist subject to its terms.

Other than as described above, there are no express provisions within the Directors service contracts for the payment of compensation or liquidated damages on termination of employment.
Where a buyout or other award is made outside Dechras existing share plan, as permitted under the Listing Rules as referred to above, the leaver provisions would be determined at the time of the award.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Directors office or employment.
Consideration of Employment Conditions Elsewhere in the Group The Committee does not formally consult with employees as part of its process when determining Executive Director pay.
However, as noted in the Policy table on page 87, the level of salary increases of employees within the wider Group is considered when setting base salary for Executive Directors.
The Committee is also kept informed of general decisions made in relation to employee pay and related issues.
Consideration of Shareholders Views The Committee believes that ongoing dialogue with major shareholders is of key importance.
During the year, the Committee consulted with major shareholders in relation to proposed changes to the LTIP performance conditions following the disposal of the Services Segment, and took account of comments received during that consultation in finalising its approach to the adjustments.
Legacy Remuneration Arrangements The Committee reserves the right to make remuneration payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above where the terms of payments were agreed: i before the Policy came into effect: or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes, payments includes the satisfaction of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.

Employees outside the UK were not included in the comparator group since country specific differences could distort the comparison.
The difference reflects an increase in Ian Pages salary as of 1 January 2013, details of which can be found on page 97.
Ian Page elected to waive his salary increase for the 2014 and 2015 financial years.

Long Term Incentive Arrangements and Share Schemes: LTIP Awards Vesting in Respect of the Year Ended 30 June 2014 Ian Page and Ed Torr were granted LTIP Awards on 7 September 2011, the performance targets for which are as follows: 1. an underpin condition based on Group underlying diluted earnings per share performance: no awards would vest if the Companys underlying diluted earnings per share has not grown by at least RPI 3% per annum over the performance period: 2. the Companys TSR performance: assuming that the underpin is achieved, vesting of the awards was determined by the Companys TSR performance compared to the constituents of the FTSE Small Cap Index over the period of three financial years ended on 30 June 2014.
Vesting is on the following basis: TSR Performance Vesting Percentage Below median 0% Median 25% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata vesting based on the Companys ranking in the comparator group Upper quartile 100% Ed Torr ceased to be employed by the Company part way through the performance period and, in line with the LTIP Scheme rules, was treated as a good leaver in respect of this Award.
In accordance with the terms of the Award, the TSR performance was measured up to the date of cessation of employment, 31 January 2014.
The Companys TSR performance was 67% compared with a 65% TSR for live companies in the top quartile comparator group.
The EPS underpin was measured on the basis of whether, in the opinion of the Committee, the EPS underpin was on course to be satisfied at the end of the original Performance Period.
The Committee, after taking advice in relation to this element, considered that the EPS underpin was satisfied and that the Award would have vested as to 100%.
A time pro-rating reduction was then applied to reflect Ed Torrs reduced length of service in the performance period, resulting in 86.1% of the shares vesting.
In the single figure table on page 96, the value attributable to this Award is calculated by multiplying the number of shares in respect of which the Award vested 47,946 by 7.015 being the mid market quotation of a share on 31 January 2014.
Ian Pages Award vested on 7 September 2014.
In respect of the performance conditions, the Companys TSR performance was over 68% compared with a 65% TSR for all companies in the top quartile of the comparator group.
In addition, the Groups underlying diluted EPS increased by 19.25% over the performance period.
As a result Ian Pages Award vested in full.
In the single figure table on page 96, the value attributable to this Award is calculated by multiplying the number of shares in respect of which the Award vested 92,811 by 6.95 being the average market value of a share over the last quarter of the Companys financial period ending on 30 June 2014.
The aggregate gain made by the Executive Directors on share options exercised during 2014 was 883,249 2013: 5,187.
In addition Ed Torr exercised his outstanding SAYE options and LTIP option granted on 7 September 2011.

Based on the Chief Executive Officers assessment of her performance over this period, the Award vested as to 100% on 30 June 2014.
In the single figure table on page 96 the value attributable to this Award is calculated by multiplying the number of shares in respect of which the Award vested 41,739 by 7.235 being the mid market value of a share on 30 June 2014.
The details of the LTIP Awards granted during the year ended 30 June 2014 are set out below.
The Committees approach to Executive Directors LTIP Awards for the year ending 30 June 2015 is summarised on page 104.
LTIP Awards Made During the Year Ended 30 June 2014 Awards were granted to the Executive Directors on 27 November 2013, on the following basis: % of award Maximum Number of Face value at vesting at Performance 1 Type of award opportunity shares grant threshold period Ian Page Nil cost option under the LTIP 200% of salary 129,221 879,995 25% 1 July 2013 30 June 2016 Anne-Francoise Nesmes Nil cost option under the LTIP 150% of salary 66,079 449,998 25% 1 July 2013 30 June 2016 Tony Griffin Nil cost option under the LTIP 100% of salary 34,129 232,418 25% 1 July 2013 30 June 2016 2 Ed Torr Nil cost option under the LTIP 100% of salary 33,706 229,538 25% 1 July 2013 30 June 2016 1.
For these purposes, the face value of the Award is calculated by multiplying the number of shares by 6.81 being the average share price used to determine the number of shares comprised in the Awards.
Lapsed on Ed Torrs cessation of employment on 31 January 2014.
50% of each Award is subject to a performance condition based on the Companys TSR performance over the performance period relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts over the performance period as follows: TSR Performance Vesting Percentage Below median 0% Median 25% of the TSR portion will vest Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata vesting between 25% and 100% based on the Companys ranking in the comparator group Upper quartile 100% of the TSR portion will vest 50% of each Award is subject to a performance condition based on the growth in the Companys EPS over the performance period as follows: EPS compound annual growth rate Vesting Percentage 8% CAGR 0% 8% CAGR 25% of the EPS portion will vest CAGR between 8% and 13% Pro-rata vesting between 25% and 100% 13% CAGR 100% of the EPS portion will vest Each of the TSR element and the EPS element is subject to an additional ROCE performance measure.
Unless the Companys ROCE is 10% or more in the final year of the performance period, the Awards will lapse in full regardless of TSR and EPS performance.
The percentage vesting will be reduced by 10% by every 1% that ROCE falls below 15%.

Salary and Fees Excluding Ian Page, Executive Directors base salaries have been increased by 3% with effect from 1 July 2014.
This is broadly in line with the average increase awarded to employees in the wider Group.
Ian Page has elected to waive a review of his salary for the year ended 30 June 2015.
In respect of the Chairman, following the benchmarking exercise that was undertaken during the 2013 financial year, it was agreed to award him an increase over a two year period.
The second increase will take effect from 1 July 2014, taking his fee to 126,000 per annum an increase of 18%.
It is considered that this now brings the Chairmans fee to a level more commensurate with his experience, performance and overall contribution to the business together with that paid for chairmen of companies of a similar size and complexity to Dechra.
In terms of the remaining Non-Executive Directors, it has been agreed to increase their base fee to 40,000 per annum an increase of 2.56%.
A review was also undertaken in respect of the fees paid for the Chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committees.
The additional fee was increased from 3,000 to 5,000 per annum.
It is considered that Dechra remains in the lower quartile in respect of such payments and it has been agreed to increase these additional fees over the medium term to bring them in line with the median of FTSE 250 companies.
In addition, it was agreed that a fee should be introduced for the Senior Independent Director role, at the rate of 3,000 per annum.
Annual Bonus No changes have been made to the bonus structure.
