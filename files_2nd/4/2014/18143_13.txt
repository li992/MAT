Performance linked A significant part of the Executive Directors reward is determined by the Companys success.
Failure to achieve threshold levels of performance may result in both no bonus under the PIP and partial forfeiture of earned deferred elements from previous years.
Shareholder aligned A considerable part of the reward is paid in shares that have to be retained until minimum shareholding requirements have been met.
Simple and transparent By operating only one executive incentive plan all aspects of the remuneration structure are clear to participants and openly communicable.

The Committee believes that its Policy is in line with the new UK Corporate Governance Code applying for financial years beginning on or after 1 October 2014, as set out below: Code Provision Company Remuneration Policy Executive Directors remuneration The PIP includes a rolling deferral in shares and an ongoing performance-based risk should be designed to promote the adjustment.
It is the Committees view that the PIP provides a holistic approach to ensuring long-term success of the Company.
Executive Directors are focused on the long-term success of the Company.
Schemes should include provisions For 2015 the PIP includes best practice malus and clawback provisions.
The circumstances that would enable the company to in which malus and clawback could apply are as follows: recover sums paid or withhold the discovery of a material misstatement resulting in an adjustment in the audited consolidated payment of any sum, and specify the accounts of the Company: circumstances in which it would be the assessment of any performance target or condition where an award was based on appropriate to do so.
error, or inaccurate or misleading information: the discovery that any information used to determine the number of shares subject to an award was based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information: action or conduct of an award holder which, in the reasonable opinion of the Board, amounts to employee misbehaviour, fraud or gross misconduct: events or behaviour of an award holder have led to the censure of the Company by a regulatory authority or have had a significant detrimental impact on the reputation of any Group company provided that the Board is satisfied that the relevant award holder was responsible for the censure or reputational damage and that the censure or reputational damage is attributable to him.
Malus will apply up to the date of the determination of the award and clawback will apply for 3 years from the date of payment and the vesting of awards.
The Committee is comfortable that the rules of the Plan provide sufficient powers to enforce malus and clawback if required.
For share-based remuneration, the The Committee has introduced a minimum shareholding requirement of 100% of salary for the Committee should consider requiring CEO and 75% of salary for the CFO.
The Committee as stated in this Report is reviewing the directors to hold a minimum number of appropriateness of introducing a new long-term incentive element of remuneration for the shares and to hold shares for a further Executive Directors.
Any such element will take into account holding periods as part of its period after vesting or exercise, including consideration on any design.
for a period after leaving the Company, subject to the need to finance any costs of acquisition and associated tax liabilities.

It is expected that within five years of becoming an Executive Director, the Executive Vice Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer should build a holding with a value of at least 100% of salary, and the Chief Financial Officer at least 75%.
This further aligns the interests of Directors to those of shareholders.
At the year end, the Executive Directors beneficial shareholdings represented the following percentages of salary: Henry Klotz: 336% 2013: 439% Fredrik Widlund: 0% 2013: n a John Whiteley: 84% 2013: 84% The Executive Chairman, Sten Mortstedt, has an interest in shares which is substantially in excess of the minimum requirement.

Further, the existing CSOP and USOS schemes have now lapsed therefore no further awards can be made under these schemes.
The highest mid-market share price in the year was 1,548.0 pence, the lowest 1,257.5 pence, and the average was 1,348.6 pence.

Shareholder Voting The following table represents the voting at the 2014 Annual General Meeting Directors Remuneration Policy Directors Remuneration Report Number of votes % of votes cast Number of votes % of votes cast In Favour 32,260,368 82.4 35,849,420 91.1 Against 6,900,471 17.6 3,500,453 8.9 Total votes cast 39,160,839 39,349,873 Votes withheld 194,020 4,986 The Committee noted that 17.6% of votes were cast against the resolution to approve the Directors Remuneration Policy in 2014.
Through feedback and meetings with institutional shareholders the Committee understands that the reasons were primarily due to the benchmarking of Executive Directors salaries, which were increased with a one-off increment so as to bring them in line with the market, and the maximum share options that could be granted.
The Committee notes these comments and the fact that share option schemes have now lapsed.
