L. C. 49 Annual Report 2014 Governance Nominations Committee report continued Key initiatives during the year October 2013 meeting In order to accommodate the Companys proposed corporate restructuring and the internalisation of the management function, an extensive review of the Boards composition was undertaken at the beginning of the financial year, to ensure the Board reflected its proposed new status as a UK tax resident company under the UKREIT regime.
The Nomination Committee consulted with the lawyers and brokers and set itself an agenda: to appoint executives to the Board, for the first time, with an appropriate balance of Nonexecutive Directors taking into account that the Company at this time was regarded as a small company in accordance with the Code : to appoint nonexecutives with an appropriate mix of experience and independence to effectively govern a dual listed property REIT and chair and populate UKbased Board committees: to encourage applications from female nonexecutives in order to create a more diverse board: and to ensure executives had the right combination of experience and competence to manage a property company and also provide depth for CEO succession.
For the executives, the Nominations Committee proposed that members of the high quality management team, who already had a valuable and unique understanding of the Companys assets, be appointed as the CEO, deputy CEO and CFO.
Itwas further recommended that a property director be appointed to complete the team, a search was initiated and a number of suitable external candidates identified.
After interviews were undertaken by the CEO and Nominations Committee, AdrianHorsburgh was deemed to be the most suitable of these candidates, recommended to the Board and appointed on31 March 2014.
For the nonexecutives, the Committee required a balance of Directors with experience of listings in the UK and South Africa and a mix of skills in property, finance and international business.
As Ita McArdle and Mark Taylor had both served on the Board in excess of six years, they proposed to retire at the 2014 AGM and a new UK Nonexecutive Director would therefore need to be appointed.
Sue Ford, who was due to retire from LondonMetric, was identified as a result of an external search, interviewed by the Committee and recommended to the Board.
It was further agreed that, as a major shareholder of the Company, two nonexecutives namely Marc Wainer and Bernard Nackan, were to represent Redefine Properties Limited on the Board.
The resultant Board provided a good mix of skills and knowledge of UK and South African markets and was compliant with the Code for small companies.
May 2014 meeting As part of executive development and succession planning it was agreed that selected NEDs would participate in developing the senior executive succession pool.
Greg Clarke is working with Stephen Oakenfull, Gavin Tipper with Andrew Rowell and Richard Melhuish with Adrian Horsburgh.
Initial meetings have taken place and development plans have been agreed.
August 2014 meeting With the Companys inclusion in the FTSE 250, the Board configuration became noncompliant with the Code and needed to regain a balance of independent and nonindependent Directors.
The Nominations Committee began the process to select a recruitment consultant to search for two additional independent Nonexecutive Directors, who would preferably improve the diversity of the Board and would have, amongst other attributes, international property expertise.
Post year end, the Committee shortlisted two external search companies and a further meeting was held in order to appoint an agency.
Russell Reynolds, which is independent of the Company, was subsequently appointed and it is hoped that two suitable NED candidates will be selected by early 2015.
Greg Clarke Chairman of the Nominations Committee Redefine International P. L. C. 50 Annual Report 2014 Governance Governance Directors remuneration report Annual statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee RemCo For the year ended 31 August 2014 not subject to audit Introduction On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the remuneration report for the year ended 31 August 2014.
This year has been extremely busy for the RemCo following the Companys conversion to a UKREIT and internalisation of management on 4 December 2013.
Prior to the internalisation, the Board consisted purely of Nonexecutive Directors, therefore the Companys remuneration policy only related to the payment of Nonexecutive Directors fees.
Since internalisation, and the appointment of Executive Directors to the Board, the Company has established a comprehensive remuneration policy whilst adopting bestpractice.
Furthermore, this is the first time that the Company has reported under Schedule 8 of The Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008, as amended in August 2013, and as such, the RemCo Michael farrow report will comprise the following sections: Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 1. a report covering the Companys policy on remuneration for the next and subsequent financial years.
The policy will be a matter for a binding shareholder vote at the 2015 Annual General Meeting and at least every three years thereafter.
If approved by shareholders, the policy will take immediate effect and payments to Directors will only be permissible within the limits defined in the policy: Since internalisation, and and the appointment 2. an annual report on remuneration which will detail how the remuneration policy has been implemented of Executive Directors during the year.
This report, together with this annual statement, will be subject to an advisory shareholder to the Board, the vote at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.
Please note that as an IOM company, Redefine International Company has established is voluntarily reporting on these matters, and therefore, neither of the above reports has been audited.
a comprehensive During the reporting year the RemCo met formally on three remuneration policy whilst occasions and members who have served on the Committee are shown in the table below.

Redefine International P. L. C. 51 Annual Report 2014 Governance Directors remuneration report continued Annual statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee RemCo Key initiatives during the year In anticipation of the Companys conversion to a UKREIT and internalisation of management, the RemCo was responsible for designing and implementing motivational remuneration packages for the executive officers.
The intention in doing so was to design a relatively simple and transparent package, which could be applied to both current and future executives, and would attract and retain high calibre personnel who would be rewarded for delivering the Companys business strategy from time to time.
In establishing the remuneration packages the RemCo was assisted by Towers Watson, leading global experts in such matters, who advised on the three main aspects of the remuneration: fixed element: basic salaries and benefits that are market competitive and will attract and retain suitable executives: short term incentive: a bonus to be awarded subject to the executives performance meeting personal KPIs and financial KPI targets for earnings and net asset value, thus aligning awards with shareholder returns: and long term incentive: under a performance share plan PSP executives will receive rolling annual share awards subject to a threeyear performance period.
The Companys strategy is to increase shareholder returns in the long term, subject to market conditions, and therefore awards will only be given to executives if the Companys TSR lies between the median and upper quartile of the TSRs for EPRA NAREIT Developed Europe index and a bespoke UK listed comparator group over a threeyear period.
The executive Remuneration Policy for the Company has been based on the same three elements.
For the year ending 31 August 2014, a bonus of 55% of base salary has been awarded to the executives, as the results for the financial KPIs were on target and the results for the personal KPIs were considered slightly ahead of the target set.
These payments are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Although contingent awards have been made under the PSP in 2013, shares will only vest in 2016, subject to the necessary performance conditions being met.
With regards to the nonexecutives, a remuneration policy is already in place, which limits the total amount of fees payable to nonexecutives, as set out in the Articles of Association, to a maximum of 350,000 to include the Chairman and six Nonexecutive Directors.
In line with the policy, the RemCo reviewed the fees paid in the year to 31 August 2013 against comparable data from a remuneration survey conducted by MM&K describing fees paid to chairmen and Nonexecutive Directors for UK quoted companies with a turnover of between 30100m.
Fees shown in the survey were linked to the time spent, company size, ownership, sector, risk and other company specific factors.
Taking these factors into account, and in light of the extra work involved for the Board during the internalisation process, the RemCo recommended that the fees be increased by 5,000 p. a. for a nonexecutive and 10,000 p. a. for the Chairman.
The Board approved the increases and the new fees became effective from December 2013.
Although it is not intended to increase individual fees this year it is proposed that the maximum aggregate fee be increased to 420,000 at the AGM, to allow for an additional two nonexecutives and a possible fee increase in the next few years.
Annual General Meeting During the financial year the Board has completed a number of initiatives and delivered significant results to shareholders.
The RemCo considers that the Board should be rewarded accordingly, in line with the proposed policy, and hopes that shareholders will support this policy and remuneration report at the AGM on 29 January 2015.

Redefine International P. L. C. 52 Annual Report 2014 Governance Governance Directors remuneration report Policy report on remuneration In compiling the policies and setting the current levels of remuneration the RemCo considered peer group data and the size, diversity and geographical breadth of the business.
The current remuneration level for the nonexecutives was last approved by shareholders in January 2012.
Executives were appointed to the Board following the internalisation of management, which was approved by shareholders at the EGM of the Company held on 29 November 2013, at which shareholders also approved the Performance Share Plan PSP and authorised Directors to allot shares for the purposes of the PSP up to a maximum number of 23,000,000 ordinary shares.
Both remuneration policies, which are presented below, will be subject to a binding shareholder vote at the 2015 Annual General Meeting and, if approved, will take immediate effect.
Remuneration Policy for the Chairman and Nonexecutive Directors Remuneration comprises an annual fee for the Chairman and for Nonexecutive Directors.

7.1 requirement, all the Directors will be subject to reelection by shareholders at the January 2015 AGM.
In the event that an Executive Director is not reelected, it should be noted the Executive Directors service contracts all require a notice period of one year, and any PSP awards which have not yet vested would be subject to the RemCos discretion.
There is no such provision in the Nonexecutive Directors letters of appointment.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company All employees have contracts with terms in line with standard market practice.
Remuneration is similar in structure to the executive pay structures, containing the same three elements: fixed element: all employees are offered a base salary.
These are reviewed annually with changes effective 1September and increases are in line with those offered to executives.
However, as with the executives, the Company is under no obligation to award an increase following the review.
Benefits offered vary with the level of seniority: short term incentive: bonuses are based on the Groups performance and that of the individual and are awarded on similar principles as those given to the executive, but are subject to the discretion of the executive.
Payment of the bonus is conditional upon the employee being employed by the Group and notice not having been served on the date the bonus ispaid: and Long term incentive: employees are eligible to participate in the Restricted Share Plan RSP at the discretion of the RemCo.
Under the RSP share awards may be given as either a nil cost option award or as a contingent award.
Such awards may carry award dividends entitling the employee to dividends which would have been received on the shares during the vesting period, payable either in cash or ordinary shares.
RSP awards are subject to performance targets set by the RemCo at the time the awards are made.
Shareholders approved both the PSP for the executives and the RSP for the employees at the EGM held on 29 November2013 and authorised Directors to allot shares for the purposes of the PSP and the RSP up to a maximum number of 23,000,000 ordinaryshares.
notice of termination: for most employees, a notice period of three months is required to terminate the contract and payment in lieu of notice will be given in appropriate circumstances.
Employees of the European portfolio are paid in Euros, all others are paid in Sterling.
Redefine International P. L. C. 56 Annual Report 2014 Governance Statement of shareholder views The Company meets regularly with its major shareholders and any feedback on remuneration has been taken into consideration during the establishment of this policy.
