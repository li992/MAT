Governance review Directors remuneration report are due to vest later in 2015.
The performance period in respect of the RoTE element of these awards has now been completed.
Subject to final determination by the Committee at the time of vesting, the RoTE delivered in 2013 and 2014 has resulted in achievement of 82% of the maximum opportunity for this element.
These shares will not be delivered to Executive Directors until November 2015, when the Committee will also assess performance under the TSR element of the award.
Awards will only vest to the extent that the Committee is satisfied at that time that the outcome reflects the Groups underlying financial performance and there have been no material risk failings.
Separately, this year also saw the completion of the performance period for the last legacy awards under the RBS Group long-term incentive plan RBS Group LTIP.

The Company also complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to remuneration.
Annual remuneration report Remuneration Committee members and governance The following list details members of the Remuneration Committee during 2014.
You can find information about each members attendance at meetings in the Remuneration Committee report on page 69.
Their biographies can be found on pages 52 to 53.
Committee Chair Priscilla Vacassin Non-Executive Directors Mike Biggs Sebastian James appointed to Committee on 30 September 2014 Andrew Palmer Clare Thompson retired from Committee on 30 September 2014 Advisers to the Committee The Committee consults with the Chief Executive Officer, the Human Resources Director and senior representatives of the HR function on matters relating to the appropriateness of all remuneration elements for Executive Directors and Executive Committee members.
The Chief Executive Officer and the Human Resources Director are not present when their own remuneration is discussed.
The Committee works closely with the Chairs of the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee.
The Committee retains FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP FIT, who are signatories to the Remuneration Consultants Groups Code of Conduct, as its independent adviser.
This appointment was made by the Committee in preparation for the IPO and following consideration of the firms experience in this sector.
FIT was reappointed by the Committee during the year following a review of its performance.
During the year, FIT provided advice on market practice, corporate governance, incentive plan design, regulatory and other matters under consideration by the Committee.
FIT does not provide any other services to the Company, and accordingly the Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by FIT is objective and independent.
FITs total fees for remuneration-related advice in 2014 were 175,332 exclusive of VAT.
FIT charged its fees on the basis of its standard terms of business for providing advice.
Allen & Overy LLP, one of the Groups legal advisers, also provided legal advice relating to the Groups executive remuneration arrangements, and provided the Group with other legal services.
Statement of implementation of policy in 2015 Executive Directors salaries in 2015 The current base salaries paid to the Executive Directors were set before the IPO.
The Committee has considered the current level of salaries and decided to award an increase of 2% from 1 April 2015, in line with the average increase awarded to UK employees.
2015 base salary 2014 base salary Annual change in base Director Position 000 000 salary Paul Geddes Chief Executive Officer 775 760 2% John Reizenstein Chief Financial Officer 469 460 2% Annual Incentive Plan 2015 The maximum annual incentive awards which may be payable to Executive Directors in respect of 2015 are shown below and have remained unchanged since the IPO.

The review concluded that, overall, the framework worked well in linking the variable pay of Executive Directors with the performance of the Group.
However, as part of the review, the Committee decided to adopt the following changes aimed at simplifying the plan and further strengthening that link: In 2014, ongoing operating profit was adjusted to exclude movements in prior-year reserves.
This adjustment will no longer be made in 2015 although the Committee will assess the impact of prior-year reserving on performance as part of its overall judgement.
The weighting of ongoing operating profit has increased to 50% To remove the specific weighting for cost targets and lead indicators, but consider these factors as part of its overall exercise of judgement around the quality and sustainability of earnings To broaden the basket of customer measures and double the weighting of this element to 20%, reflecting the specific business priorities for the year ahead Measures Weighting for 2015 Weighting for 2014 Financial Ongoing operating profit no longer adjusted for prior-year reserving from 2015 50% 40% Other financial measures not reflected in the definition of profit, primarily the performance of the Run-off segment and restructuring costs 10% 10% Cost targets 10% No specific Strategic A mix of financial and non-financial lead indicators weighting, but including market share, retention, quote to conversion ratio, considered as part scored loss ratio, progress with technology and strategic of the overall projects and others judgement 10% Based on a basket of customer measures including Net Promoter Score and complaints 20% 10% Personal objectives Defined objectives for each Executive Director, including shared objectives across the Executive Committee 20% 20% In line with previous years, all AIP outcomes will continue to be determined after the Committee determines a payment gateway.
This requires the Committee to be satisfied that it is appropriate to permit a bonus award, at all or at a given level.
The gateway necessarily involves some subjective judgement of performance.
This may result in positive or negative moderation of each AIP performance measure or the overall bonus outcome.
The table below sets out the gateway criteria for the AIP for 2015.
Gateway criteria for the Annual Incentive Plan for 2015 outcomes for Executive Directors Quality and sustainability of earnings, referring to reserving, gross written premium, costs and loss ratio, and relevant lead indicators Additional customer context, for example, conduct, experience, brand and franchise health Affordability Risk management within risk appetite The Groups relative performance to that of its peers The wider economic environment Exceptional events, such as abnormal weather Any regulatory breaches and or reputational damage to the Group Committee satisfaction that paying the bonus does not cause major reputational concerns The Committee may also use its discretion to take into account additional factors.
These include the quality of financial results, the direction of travel of all measures and a wider consideration of reputation, risk and audit.
Performance conditions for Long-Term Incentive Plan awards LTIP awards to be granted in 2015 will continue to be subject to performance against the following performance conditions: 60% based on RoTE over a three-year performance period 2015, 2016 and 2017 40% based on relative TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts over a three-year performance period starting on the date of grant.
The starting TSR and closing TSR will both be averaged over a three-month period Version 10.1 Draft and Secret www.
com 75 Directors remuneration report continued For these purposes, we use the Groups standard definition for RoTE, see page 170, subject to other adjustments which the Committee may consider appropriate.
Following the year end, the Committee reviewed the performance targets and, in line with its commitment to ensure that awards to Executive Directors would only be payable if significant value has been created for shareholders, decided to increase the RoTE target range as follows: Performance required for threshold vesting Performance required for maximum vesting Vesting for threshold Awards made Awards made Performance measure performance Awards for 2015 prior to 2015 Awards for 2015 prior to 2015 RoTE Average annual Average annual Average annual Average annual 20% of this element RoTE performance of RoTE performance of RoTE performance of RoTE performance of of the award 14.5% 14.0% 17.5% 17.0% Relative TSR 20% of this element of the award Median Upper quintile For the TSR and RoTE elements, 20% of the award vests for threshold performance with 100% vesting for maximum performance.
There is a straight-line interpolation between these points for the TSR element on a ranked basis.
For the RoTE element, 40% of the award will vest for RoTE of 15.5% for awards to be made in 2015 previously 15%.
Otherwise, similar to TSR, a straight-line interpolation occurs from threshold to target then from target to maximum performance.
The LTIP awards will also vest only to the extent that the Committee is satisfied that the outcome of the TSR and RoTE performance conditions reflects the Groups underlying financial performance from the date of grant until vesting.
When considering these matters, the Committee will consider whether there have been any material risk failings.
Pension and benefits A pension contribution of 25% of base salary will continue to be paid to both Executive Directors in 2015.
This is shown in the table below.
Director Position Pension contribution % base salary Paul Geddes Chief Executive Officer 25% John Reizenstein Chief Financial Officer 25% Benefits comprise the provision of a company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, life assurance, income protection and health screening.
The Executive Directors are also eligible for certain discounted Group products in line with the approach for all employees.
Non-Executive Director fees The current fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors were set in 2012 and have not been changed to date.
Fees for 2015 Position 000 Board Chairman fee 400 Basic Non-Executive Director fee 70 Additional fees Senior Independent Director fee 30 Chair of Audit, Risk and Remuneration Committees 30 Chair of CSR Committee 10 Member of Board Committee Audit, Risk or Remuneration 10 Member of Board Committee CSR or Nomination 5 No additional fees are paid for membership or chairmanship of the Investment Committee.
External directorships The Company encourages Executive Directors to accept, subject to the approval of the Chairman, an invitation to join the board of another company outside the Group in a non-executive capacity.
This recognises the value of such wider experience.
In these circumstances, they can retain any remuneration from the non-executive appointment.
Executive Directors are generally limited to accepting one external directorship.
John Reizenstein is a trustee and director of Farm Africa, for which he receives no fees, otherwise the Executive Directors do not hold any external directorships.

All figures in the table are rounded to the nearest thousand.
Includes amounts earned for performance during the year, but deferred for three years under the Deferred Annual Incentive Plan DAIP, see page 81.
These deferred awards are not subject to any conditions except continuous employment although awards remain available for malus clawback.
Long-term incentives in 2013 and 2014 represent the vesting of the RBS Group LTIP awards granted in 2011 and 2012 respectively.
The expected vesting outcome figures for the RBS Group LTIP awards granted in 2011 reported in 2013 have been updated based on the actual vesting share price of 2.652 on 7 March 2014, compared to the three month average share price of 2.2658 used in reporting this figure in the 2013 remuneration report.
This results in an adjusted reportable increase of approximately 106,000 for Paul Geddes and 23,000 for John Reizenstein, with a corresponding increase by the same amounts of the single figure for 2013.
For the RBS Group LTIP awards granted in 2012, the vesting outcome is calculated at 90% of shares under award resulting in a value of 2,028,470 for Paul Geddes and 456,403 for John Reizenstein.
Details of the performance measures applicable to the vesting of RBS Group LTIP awards are shown on page 83.
The long-term incentive figures for 2014 also include the estimated vesting outcome for the RoTE portion of the awards made under the Direct Line Group LTIP in November 2012.
In line with the criteria set at the time of grant, this has been assessed by reference to RoTE performance during 2013 and 2014 at 49.2% of shares under award 82% of the maximum in relation to the RoTE element.
The corresponding values under long-term incentives, including the value of dividends accrued, are 617,636 for Paul Geddes and 373,826 for John Reizenstein.
These shares will be delivered to Executive Directors in November 2015.
The values shown under long-term incentives for 2014 are based on the three month average Company share price to 31 December 2014.
The LTIP figure for 2014 for Paul Geddes also includes the value on exercise of 4,206 dividend shares on his DAIP award for 2012 in March 2014 of 10,157.
Benefits include a company car or allowance, and private medical and income protection insurance.
Includes the value of matching shares under the SIP.
Each Executive Director has confirmed that they have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration, other than those already disclosed in the single figure table.
Annual Incentive Plan outcomes for 2014 The table below shows outcomes against the specific measures during the year: Weight Achievement against performance measures as a % of Measures maximum Threshold Target Maximum award 10% vesting 60% vesting 100% vesting Financial Adjusted ongoing operating profit 90% 40% Other financial measures not reected in 10% 1 80% the denition of ongoing operating profit Cost reduction targets 10% 60% Strategic A mix of financial and non-financial 10% 60% 2 lead indicators 10% Customer experience 60% Personal Personal objectives Paul Geddes 20% 66% including shared John Reizenstein objectives amongst all 20% 65% Executive Committee members Notes: 1.

Including market share, retention, quote to conversion ratio, scored loss ratio, progress with technology and strategic projects As reported in last years report, at the start of the year, the Committee did not set a formal threshold to maximum range for performance measures.
Instead, the Committee believed it was more appropriate to consider performance relative to targets, those numbers being commercially sensitive and likely to remain so, and assess over or underperformance by judging overall performance at the year end.
The outcomes shown above, therefore, reflect the strong performance during the year, particularly in terms of the financial measures, as highlighted in the Group highlights and Chairmans statement on pages 4 to 5 and 10 to 11 respectively.
com 77 Directors remuneration report continued Consequently, the annual incentive awards payable to the Executive Directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2014 are as follows: Actual annual incentive award for 2014 including cash and Maximum annual incentive Actual annual incentive award deferred element Director Position award % of base salary for 2014 % of base salary 000 Paul Geddes Chief Executive Officer 175% 132% 1,000 John Reizenstein Chief Financial Officer 150% 113% 518 Non-Executive Directors Remuneration for the Non-Executive Directors for the year ended 31 December 2014 is shown in the table below.
Fees were the only remuneration paid to the Non-Executive Directors in 2013 and 2014.
Non-Executive Directors may also claim for reasonable travel expenses in accordance with the Groups travel and expenses policy.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Group's bonus or share incentive schemes or join any Group pension scheme.
Jane Hanson remained a member of the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee through 2014, but stood down as Chair from 1 October 2014.
Sebastian James was appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 28 August 2014.
The fees for membership of the Remuneration Committee and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee applied from 30 September 2014.
Clare Thompson stood down from the Remuneration Committee from 30 September 2014.
Mark Catton, a Director nominated by RBS Group, resigned as a Director of Direct Line Insurance Group plc on 26 April 2013, following the reduction in the shareholding of RBS Group in Direct Line Insurance Group plc to less than 50% on 13 March 2013.
He was reappointed as a Director on 1 October 2013 following Bruce Van Sauns resignation.
He later resigned on 7 March 2014.
During their appointment as Non-Executive Directors, Bruce Van Saun and Mark Catton were RBS Group employees with any fees received payable to RBS Group.
A lump sum payment in respect of Directors fees for Mark Catton and Bruce Van Saun for the years 2012 to 2014 inclusive of 133,579 was paid in January 2015.
Percentage change in pay of Chief Executive Officer 2013 to 2014 The table below shows the year-on-year percentage change in salary, taxable benefits and bonus for the Chief Executive Officer compared to the average remuneration of all other UK employees.
The Committee considers that it is appropriate to compare against all UK employees, but to exclude those based outside the UK.
This helps ensure consistent comparisons with the Chief Executive Officer.
Bonus including 1 2 3 Salary Benefits deferred amount Chief Executive Officer Nil -26% 20% All UK employees 2.6% -6% 20% Notes: 1.
Based on the change in average pay for UK employees employed in both the year ended 31 December 2014 and the year ended 31 December 2013.
There were no changes in benefit provision between 2013 and 2014.
The decrease in value shown is due to a decrease in the cost associated with the provision of certain benefits.
Includes average amounts earned under the Annual Incentive Plan and, for employees other than the Chief Executive Officer, other variable incentive schemes, including monthly and quarterly incentive schemes operated in certain parts of the Group.
When determining Directors remuneration, the Committee considers employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
The Committee particularly reviews overall pay and bonus decisions in aggregate for the wider Group.
Through the Chief Executive Officer, Paul Geddes, and other senior management, the Committee may receive input provided by employee groups, such as the Employee Representative Body as required.

Consistent with market practice, the overall expenditure on pay has been taken from note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
Therefore it has not been calculated in a manner consistent with the single figure in this report.

The Committee takes into account the approval levels of remuneration related matters at the AGM to determine whether the current Directors remuneration policy remains appropriate.
The Committee aims to build an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance generally and changes to the Companys executive pay arrangements in particular.
The Committee is satisfied that no element of the Directors remuneration policy conflicts with the Groups approach to environmental, social or corporate governance matters.
Shareholdings The Executive Directors are subject to Share Ownership Guidelines.
As such they are expected to retain all of the Ordinary Shares that they obtain from any of the Companys share incentive plans until they have achieved the required shareholding level.
This is after any disposals necessary to pay personal taxes on acquiring such Ordinary Shares.
For these purposes, the holding of Ordinary Shares will be treated as including all vested but unexercised awards, valued on a basis that is net of applicable personal taxes.
During the year, and in accordance with the power conferred to it by the Directors remuneration policy, the Committee reviewed the level of Share Ownership Guidelines for both Executive Directors and aligned the guideline for the Chief Financial Officer previously 150% of salary to that of the Chief Executive Officer 200% of salary.
The extent to which Executive Directors achieved the guideline requirements by 31 December 2014 is: Share Ownership Value of shares held at Guideline 31 December 2014 Position % of salary % of salary Chief Executive Officer 200% 104.1% Chief Financial Officer 200% 61.6% 80 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Version 10.1 Draft and Secret 80 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance review The table below shows the total share interests of each Executive Director.

These awards take the form of nil-cost options over the Companys shares and are subject to performance conditions to be assessed by the Committee.
Awards granted prior to 2014 accrue dividend entitlements until the date of transfer of shares.
Awards granted from 2014 accrue dividend entitlement from grant date to date on which an award vests.
The RoTE targets for awards up to 2014, applying to 60% of the award, were 14% for 20% vesting, 15% for 40% vesting and 17% for full vesting.
A straight-line interpolation occurs from threshold to target and then from target to maximum performance.
The remaining 40% of each award is based on TSR performance conditions which are the same as noted on page 76 for awards in 2015.
These figures do not include those RBS Group LTIP awards held by the Executive Directors.
They are included in the table on page 83.
The Companys policy is to make awards twice a year following the announcement of the Groups full and half-year results.
The value of each grant of awards is set at 50% of the normal annual policy level.
This means the total face value of awards to each Executive Director during the year equates to 200% of base salary, measured using a three-day average share price prior to the date of grant.
Direct Line Group 2012 Share Incentive Plan During 2014 all employees, including Executive Directors, were eligible to invest from 10 up to 125 per month from their pretax pay into the SIP and receive one matching share for every two shares purchased.
The limit of 125 per month was subsequently increased to 150 per month in January 2015 following legislation changes in 2014.

Both Executive Directors subscribed for this offer.
They were similarly eligible to participate in the award of approximately 400 worth of free shares due to be made in March 2015 as referred to in the Committee Chairs letter but have both waived their eligibility to this award.
Dilution The Company complies with the dilution levels recommended by the ABI guidelines, of 10% in 10 years for all share plans and 5% in 10 years for discretionary plans, consistent with the rules of the Companys share plans.

It was agreed with RBS Group that participants now employed by Direct Line Group holding awards under the RBS Group LTIP granted in 2011 and 2012 would be given the opportunity to have those awards satisfied by the transfer of Direct Line Insurance Group plc shares from RBS Group on vesting.
The conversion rate applied to these awards was the average price of RBS Group shares over the five business day period prior to 11 October 2012 divided by the Direct Line Insurance Group plc share offer price 1.75.
This conversion equated to 1.487 Direct Line Insurance Group plc shares for every RBS Group share under grant.
Both Executive Directors took up this offer.
As disclosed in the single figure table on page 77, 90% of the shares granted under the RBS Group LTIP in 2012 are expected to vest on the dates shown above.
For single figure purposes this results in an estimated value of 2,028,470 for Paul Geddes and 456,403 for John Reizenstein.
RBS Group deferred awards Awards which were originally awarded under the RBS Group Deferral Plan will continue to be delivered in RBS Group shares.

Any changes will be explained in future annual remuneration reports and, if appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Companys major shareholders.
com 87 Directors remuneration report continued Adjustment to number of shares under deferred bonus and LTIP The number of shares subject to deferred bonus and LTIP awards may be increased to reflect the value of dividends that would have been paid in respect of any dates falling between the grant of awards and the date of vesting of awards the date of transfer of shares for awards made prior to 2014.
The terms of incentive plan awards may be adjusted in the event of a variation of the Companys share capital, demerger or a similar event that materially affects the price of the shares or otherwise in accordance with the plan rules.
Remuneration payments agreed prior to appointment to the Board The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including, where relevant, exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Direct Line Insurance Group plc and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes payments include pension arrangements, the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
RBS Legacy arrangements Both Executive Directors continue to hold unvested awards previously granted to them under the RBS Group LTIP in 2012.
These awards were granted to Paul Geddes and John Reizenstein at a time when they were divisional directors of RBS Group and will now be satisfied by the transfer of Direct Line Insurance Group plc shares from RBS Group on vesting.
The performance conditions for these awards relate to financial and operational performance against the strategic plan for Direct Line Group, effective risk management and measures based on employee and customer satisfaction.
In addition, both Executive Directors continue to hold awards originally awarded under the RBS Group Deferral Plan and these will continue to be delivered in RBS Group shares.
These awards are not subject to any performance conditions on vesting.
Selection of performance measures Annual Incentive Plan The AIP performance measures have been selected by the Committee to incentivise Executive Directors to achieve financial targets for the year as well as specific strategic and personal objectives.
These measures are aligned with the key performance indicators that we use as a business to monitor performance against our strategic priorities, as shown on pages 26 to 27 of the Annual Report & Accounts.
The relevant targets are set at or following the start of each year to ensure that Executive Directors are appropriately focused on the key objectives for the next 12 months.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The ultimate goal of our strategy is to provide long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders.
For 2015, awards under the LTIP will therefore continue to be subject to performance against both RoTE and relative TSR targets, which are important KPIs for the business.
The Committee believes that this combination provides a balanced approach to the measurement of Group performance over the longer term by using both a stated financial KPI that incentivises individuals to keep growing the business in an efficient way and a measure based on relative shareholder return.
This combination of measures achieves an appropriate balance of absolute and relative returns.
Differences in remuneration policy from broader employee population When determining Executive Directors remuneration, the Committee takes into account pay throughout the Group to ensure that the arrangements in place remain appropriate.
The Group has one consistent reward policy for all levels of employees.
Therefore, the same reward principles guide reward decisions for all Group employees, including Executive Directors, although remuneration packages differ to take into account appropriate factors in different areas of the business: AIP approximately 3,900 employees participate in the AIP and the corporate performance measures for all employees are consistent with those used for Executive Directors although the weighting attributable to those factors may differ.
The Groups strategic leaders also receive part of their bonus in Company shares deferred for a period of three years LTIP our strategic leaders participate in the LTIP currently based on the same performance conditions as those for Executive Directors, although the Committee reserves the discretion to vary the performance conditions for awards made to employees below the Board for future awards All employee share plans the Committee considers it is important for all employees to have the opportunity to become shareholders in the Company.
The HMRC-approved Buy-As-You-Earn Share Incentive Plan in the UK and an International plan mirroring the UK plan for Italy were both launched during 2013.

Principles for recruitment remuneration In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new Executive Director, the starting point for the Committee will be to look to the policy for Executive Directors as set out in the policy table and structure a package in accordance with that policy.
Consistent with the Regulations, the caps contained within the policy table for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, although the Committee would not envisage exceeding these caps in practice For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment, as appropriate For external and internal appointments including a major change in role, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses, legal and other fees involved in negotiating any recruitment or pay expatriate benefits in line with the Groups international assignment policy, as appropriate Buy-out awards Where it is necessary to make a recruitment-related pay award to an external candidate, the Company will not pay more than is necessary, in the view of the Committee, and will in all cases seek, in the first instance, to deliver any such awards under the terms of the existing incentive pay structure All such awards for external appointments, whether under the AIP, LTIP or otherwise, to compensate for awards forfeited on leaving their previous employer will be capped at the commercial value of the amount forfeited and will take account of the nature, time horizons and performance requirements of those awards.
In particular, the Committees starting point will be to ensure that any awards being forfeited which remain subject to outstanding performance requirements other than where substantially complete are bought out with replacement requirements and any awards with service requirements are bought out with similar terms.
However, exceptionally the Committee may relax those obligations where it considers it to be in the interests of shareholders and those factors are, in the view of the Committee, equally reflected in some other way, for example through a significant discount to the face value of the awards forfeited.
It will only include guaranteed or non-prorated amounts under the AIP where the Committee considers that it is necessary to secure the recruitment Version 10.1 Draft and Secret www.
com 89 Directors remuneration report continued The elements of any package for a new recruit, including the maximum level of variable pay, but excluding buy-outs, and the approach taken by the Committee in relation to setting each element of the package will be consistent with the Executive Directors remuneration policy described in this report, as modified by the above statement of principles where appropriate.
The Committee reserves the right to avail itself of the current Listing Rule 9.4.
2 if needed in order to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, the recruitment of an Executive Director.
Awards granted under this provision will only be used for buy-out awards.
Any commitments made before promotion to the Board except when made in connection with the appointment to the Board can continue to be honoured under the policy even if they are not consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled.
In exceptional circumstances, the initial notice period may be longer than the Companys 12 month policy up to a maximum of 24 months.
However, this will reduce by one month for every month served, until it has reduced to 12 months in line with the Companys policy position.
The remuneration policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors as set out earlier in this report will apply in relation to any recruitments to those positions.
Service contracts Subject to the discretion noted above for new recruits, it is the Companys policy to set notice periods for Executive Directors of no more than 12 months both by the Director or Company.
The Executive Directors service agreements summary is as follows: Notice period by Director or Director Effective date of contract Company Exit payment policy Paul Geddes 1 September 2012 12 months Base salary only for unexpired portion of notice period and to be paid in a lump sum or monthly instalments, in which case instalments are subject to mitigation if an alternative role is found.
John Reizenstein 1 September 2012 12 months Base salary only for unexpired portion of notice period and to be paid in a lump sum or monthly instalments, in which case instalments are subject to mitigation if an alternative role is found.
There are no further obligations which could give rise to a remuneration or loss of office payment other than those set out in the remuneration policy table and termination policy summary.
Termination policy summary It is appropriate for the Committee to retain discretion to consider the termination terms of any Executive Director, having regard to all the relevant facts and circumstances available to them at the time.
A Director is deemed a good leaver if the following circumstances are met: Annual Incentive Plan and Long-Term Incentive Plan death, injury, ill-health, redundancy, retirement, the sale of the individuals employing company or business out of the Group, or in such other circumstances as the Committee determines Deferred Annual Incentive Plan for any reason other than summary dismissal or resignation unless, in the case of resignation only, the Committee determines otherwise The table overleaf sets out the general position although it should be noted that the Committee, consistent with most other companies, has reserved a broad discretion to determine whether an Executive Director should be categorised as a good leaver and that discretion forms part of the approved policy.
Similarly, while the policy is generally to reduce AIP and LTIP awards on a pro-rata basis, the Committee has reserved discretion to disapply such reduction if, in the circumstances, it considers that to be appropriate taking into account the performance of the departing executive and the circumstances of leaving.

Service agreements for Executive Directors provide that Paul Geddes and John Reizenstein are not eligible to receive any enhanced redundancy terms which may be offered by the Group from time to time.
Their rights to a statutory redundancy payment are not affected.
Depending on the circumstances of departure, an Executive Director may have additional claims under relevant employment protection laws and the Company may contribute to any legal fees involved in agreeing a termination.
It may also agree to incur certain other expenses such as the provision of outplacement services.
Any such fees would be disclosed as part of the detail of any termination arrangements.
Non-Executive Director letters of appointment Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three-year term which may be renewed by mutual agreement.
In common with the Executive Directors, all Non-Executives are subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
The Directors may appoint additional members to join the Board during the year.
Directors appointed in this way will be subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment.
In subsequent years the Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at each AGM.
Terms and conditions of appointment of all of the Directors are available for inspection by any person at the Companys registered office and at the AGM.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have notice periods of three months from either party, which do not apply in the case of a Director not being re-elected by shareholders or retiring from office under the articles of association.
Other than fees for this notice period, the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any compensation on exit.
External directorships The Company encourages Executive Directors to accept, subject to the approval of the Chairman, an invitation to join the board of another company outside the Group in a non-executive capacity, recognising the value of such wider experience.
In these circumstances, they are permitted to retain any remuneration from the non-executive appointment.
com 91 Directors remuneration report continued Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group As explained elsewhere in the Directors remuneration report, the Committee reviews the overall pay and bonus decisions in aggregate for the wider Group and therefore takes account of pay and conditions in the wider Group in determining the Directors remuneration policy and the remuneration payable to Directors.
Through the Chief Executive Officer, Paul Geddes, and other senior management the Committee may receive input provided by employee groups within the Group, such as the Employee Representative Body, as required.
In accordance with prevailing commercial practice, the Committee did not consult with employees in preparing the Directors remuneration policy.
Consideration of shareholders views The Committee takes into account the approval levels of remuneration related matters at the AGM in determining whether the current Directors remuneration policy remains appropriate.
The Committee, consistent with its approach of operating within the highest standards of corporate governance, takes significant account of guidelines issued by the ABI and shareholder bodies such as the National Association of Pension Funds when setting the remuneration policy.
The Committee will also seek to build an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance generally and any changes to the Companys executive pay arrangements in particular.
Performance scenarios The Directors remuneration policy has been designed to ensure that a significant proportion of total remuneration is delivered in the form of variable pay and is therefore dependent on performance against our strategic objectives.
The Committee has considered the level of remuneration that may be paid under different performance scenarios to ensure that it would be appropriate in each situation in the context of the performance delivered and the value created for shareholders.
The following charts show the potential remuneration that may be earned by Executive Directors under three assumed performance scenarios as follows: CEO Paul Geddes CFO John Reizenstein 000 000 Minimum Minimum 100% 986 100% 602 On-target On-target 47% 38% 15% 2,110 50% 35% 15% 1,211 Maximum Maximum 0m 1m 2m 3m 4m 0m 1m 2m 3m 4m Total xed pay AIP LTIP Total xed pay AIP LTIP 92 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Version 10.1 Draft and Secret 92 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2014 25% 35% 40% 3,893 27% 31% 42% 2,244 Governance review The elements of remuneration included in each scenario are as follows.
