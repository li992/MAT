Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 65 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT The policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 15 May 2014.
Although there is no requirement to include the Policy Report this year, it has been included for ease of reference.
Policy overview The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the Companys remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of the executive Directors of the Company and the Chairman.
In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account a number of factors, including: general trends in pay and conditions throughout the Group the positioning of remuneration levels against the external market the balance between fixed and variable pay more specifically, variable pay should form a significant but not disproportionately high level of potential remuneration the strategy of the business.
In setting the overall remuneration policy, general trends and average increases throughout the Group are taken into account when setting executive Directors reward packages.
A key feature for the executive Directors is that a higher proportion of their remuneration package is delivered through performance-related pay, which has a greater linkage to the results of the Group.
The areas covered in this Policy Report comprise: Consideration of shareholders views p65 Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group p65 Summary of executive Directors remuneration policy p66 Remuneration scenarios for executive Directors p68 Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors p68 Service agreements and payments for loss of office for executive Directors p69 External appointments of executive Directors p69 Appointment of non-executive Directors p69 Consideration of shareholders views The Committee considers feedback from shareholders received at each AGM, and any feedback from additional meetings, as part of any review of executive remuneration.
In addition, the Committee engages proactively with shareholders and will ensure that shareholders are consulted in advance, where any material changes to the remuneration policy are proposed.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group In determining the remuneration of the Companys Directors, the Committee takes into account the general trends in pay and conditions across the Group as a whole.
Whilst employees have not been consulted formally on executive pay, due in part to the diverse geographic disposition of the Group, the Committee seeks to ensure that the underlying principles which form the basis for decisions on Directors pay are consistent with those on which pay decisions for the rest of the workforce are taken.
These are focused for the most part on market competitiveness, business performance and personal performance.
In practice, the remuneration policy for executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees, so that a significant proportion of their remuneration is dependent on Company performance.
For employees below Board level, variable pay represents a lower proportion of their total remuneration, which is driven by market comparators and general performance.

com AR2014 68 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Remuneration scenarios for executive Directors The charts below provide estimates for the potential future remuneration based on the current remuneration policy for the three executive Directors.
Potential outcomes are based on three performance scenarios: minimum, on-target and maximum.
S alary levels are based on those applying from 1 July 2014 for Duncan Magrath and Peter Zinkin and 1 January 2015 for Leo Quinn.
The salary for Duncan Magrath does not include his 20% of salary responsibility allowance as this is not part of the ongoing remuneration policy and will cease on 31 March 2015.
The value of benefits receivable for 2015 has been estimated.
T he on-target level of AIP is taken to be 50% of the maximum AIP opportunity 120% of salary for all executive Directors, of which 50% is paid in cash and 50% is deferred in shares under the DBP.
T he on-target level of vesting under the PSP is taken to be 50% of the face value of the award at grant 200% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and 150% of salary for the other executive Directors.
The Group Chief Executives buyout awards, as agreed as part of his joining arrangements, are not reflected in the above chart as these are not part of the ongoing remuneration policy.
The maximum level of AIP and vesting under the PSP is taken to be 100% of the AIP opportunity and 100% of the face value of the PSP awards at grant.
No share price appreciation or dividend awards have been assumed for the DBP shares and PSP awards.
Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors To ensure the ongoing leadership continuity of the Group, the appointment of high-calibre executives may be necessary, either by external appointment or internal promotion.
The remuneration package for a new executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Companys remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the scope and complexity of the role, the experience of the individual, the prevailing market rate for that experience and the importance and immediacy of securing that candidate.
The salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract the most appropriate candidate.
The AIP potential would be limited to 120% of salary, and grants under the PSP may be up to the plan maximum of 200% of salary.
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer.
It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards were consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal executive Director appointment, any remuneration awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and or incidental expenses as appropriate.
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2014 000 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 69 Service agreements and payments for loss of office for executive Directors It is the Companys policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term, which are subject to one years notice by the Company and six months notice by the executive Director.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all executive Directors submit themselves for re-election at the AGM.
In the event of early termination, the executive Directors contracts provide for compensation in line with their contractual notice period.
In summary, the contractual provisions are to provide the following: Provision Detailed terms Notice period 12 months by the Company, six months by the executive Director.
There are no contractual compensation provisions for termination of employment.
However, other non-contractual considerations are as follows: Notice payments If any existing contract were breached by the Company, it would be liable to pay an amount approximating to the net loss of salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period, subject to mitigation and phased payments where appropriate.
Remuneration entitlements Pro rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with vesting for outstanding share awards in certain circumstances see below.
In all cases, performance targets would apply.
Change of control No executive Directors contract contains additional provisions in respect of change ofcontrol.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive Director under the Companys share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment under the PSP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, good leaver status may be applied.
For good leavers, awards will not be forfeited on cessation of employment and, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions, will vest under the normal vesting schedule, being reduced pro rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.
However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine that PSP awards vest at cessation and or to amend time pro rating.
Outstanding DBP awards will lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain good leaver circumstances, DBP awards will vest in full on the date of cessation.
External appointments of executive Directors The Committee recognises that benefits can arise from allowing executive Directors to take a non-executive directorship elsewhere.
Executive Directors are permitted to have one external appointment, from which fees may be retained with the approval of the Board.
Appointment of non-executive Directors Non-executive Directors are appointed by the full Board following recommendations from the Nomination Committee.
All non-executive Directors are appointed for a term of three years.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all non-executive Directors submit themselves for re-election at the AGM.

Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 73 AIP awards for the year ended 31 December 2014 The AIP awards for the year under review were based on performance against profit before tax and non-underlying items and Groupbased performance metrics linked to the business strategy.
As a result of the trading statement issued on 6 May 2014, the departure of Andrew McNaughton, with Steve Marshall stepping in as Executive Chairman and a significant revision of the Groups strategic objectives, the three Group-based strategic metrics were amended and, to reflect the in-period changes, the Committee considered it appropriate to scale back the maximum payout by 25% ie, rather than reflecting 30% of the bonus potential, this was reduced to 22.5%.
The profit before tax and non-underlying items target was not amended.
The revised Group-based strategic metrics were as set out in the table below.
The Committee concluded that Andrew McNaughtons departure from the Board in May 2014 should preclude him from receiving any award under the AIP in respect of 2014.
The Committees assessment was that the AIP business strategy objectives had been partially achieved.
Notwithstanding this, Duncan Magrath and Peter Zinkin agreed with the Committee that they would waive any entitlement under the AIP in respect of 2014 given overall business performance.
