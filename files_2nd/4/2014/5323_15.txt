com Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2014 69 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY Directors Remuneration Policy This section of the report sets out the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors, and will be subject to a binding vote at the 2014 AGM.
If approved at the AGM, the Policy will come into effect on 24 July 2014.
Executive Director remuneration policy table This Policy has been designed to support the principal objective of enabling the Company to attract, motivate and retain the people it needs to maximise the value of the business.
Component: Base salary Objective To provide broadly market median levels of fixed pay over the longer term, with increases reflecting Company and individual performance.
Operation Generally reviewed each year, with increases effective 1 June with reference to salary levels at other FTSE 250 companies of broadly similar size, sector and international scope to Electrocomponents.
The Committee also considers the salary increases applying across the rest of the UK business when determining increases.
Opportunity Salaries in respect of the year under review and for the following year are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Base salary increases are applied in line with the outcome of the annual review.
Factors that are considered include: increases for other employees, changes in role and responsibilities, market levels, and individual and Company performance.
In circumstances where an Executive Directors salary is already consistent with policy, salary increases will not normally be materially different to those given to other senior managers in the Group.
Component: Pension Objective To provide a level of retirement benefit that is competitive in the relevant market.
Operation Existing Directors, who previously participated in the Defined Benefit section of the Company Pension Scheme Scheme, now receive cash in lieu reflecting the prior arrangement on a cost neutral basis to the Company.
The Defined Benefit section of the Scheme is now closed to new entrants.
Opportunity For current Executive Directors CEO: 30% of base salary CFO: 43.5% of base salary For future external hires, the level of pension contribution will be determined in the context of market norms.
Base salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable.
ELECTROCOMPONENTS PLC LSE Stock Code: ECM Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2014 70 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY Component: Benefits Objective Provision of benefits in line with the market.
Operation Executive Directors are provided with a company car or a cash allowance in lieu thereof, mobile phone, fuel allowance and medical insurance.
Other benefits may be introduced from time to time to ensure the benefits package is appropriately competitive and reflects the circumstances of the individual Director.
Opportunity None of the existing Executive Directors received total taxable benefits exceeding 10% of salary during any of the last three financial years, and it is not anticipated that the cost of benefits provided will exceed this level in the financial years over which this policy will apply.
The Committee retains the discretion to approve a higher cost in exceptional circumstances for example relocation expenses or expatriation allowance or in circumstances where factors outside the Companys control have changed materially e. g. market increases in insurance costs.
Benefits in respect of the year under review are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Component: Annual bonus Objective To focus Executive Directors on achieving demanding annual targets relating to Company performance.
Operation Performance targets are set at the start of the year and aligned with the annual budget agreed by the Board.
At the end of the year, the Remuneration Committee determines the extent to which these targets have been achieved.
For threshold performance, the bonus payout will normally be nil, but in no circumstances will exceed 10% of the maximum opportunity.
Two-thirds of the total bonus payment is paid in cash.
One-third of the total bonus payment is converted into Electrocomponents shares under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
These shares vest after two years, subject to continued employment and forfeiture in instances of misconduct or misstatement.
Opportunity Maximum opportunity: 150% of base salary Target opportunity: 75% of base salary Performance measures t Sales growth t Profit before tax and reorganisation costs PBTR t Cash flow The weightings for these performance conditions are agreed by the Committee at the start of each year, according to annual business priorities.
No one element will be weighted less than 15%, or more than 50% of the total opportunity.
The Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic bonus outcomes including down to zero to ensure alignment of pay with performance and fairness to shareholders and participants.
Any such discretion will be within the limits of the scheme, and will be fully disclosed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
Further details, including the performance targets attached to the bonus for the year under review, are given on page 81 of the Annual Report on Remuneration.
com Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2014 71 Component: LTIP Objective To incentivise Executive Directors and senior managers to deliver long-term performance by aligning their performance with shareholders interests and reflect best practice.
Operation A conditional award of shares Award is made annually.
The LTIP performance period is three years.
The Award is subject both to a performance condition and, normally, on continued employment with the Group until the determination of the performance condition.
Threshold performance results in nil vesting.
Additionally, for the Award to vest the Committee must be satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance.
The Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic LTIP outcomes to ensure the pay outcome is aligned with value creation for shareholders and that the outcome is a fair reflection of the Companys performance.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of the relevant performance period, awards lapse.
There will be a further holding period of at least six months following vesting.
Opportunity Maximum opportunity: 150% of basic salary In normal circumstances, however, the Committee would grant awards with a value below this level.
Details of actual LTIP awards in respect of each year will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
A payment equivalent to the dividends that would have accrued on the number of shares that vest will be made to participants on vesting.
Performance measures Vesting of one half of the Awards made to Executive Directors is dependent upon Electrocomponents three-year total shareholder return TSR percentage outperformance of a benchmark.
Vesting of the other half of the Award is conditional on growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS.
Further details, including the performance targets attached to the LTIP in respect of each year, will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Component: Save As You Earn SAYE Objective To encourage the ownership of Electrocomponents plc shares.
Operation An HMRC approved scheme where employees including Executive Directors may save an agreed amount up to the individual monthly limit set by HMRC from time to time over three or five years.
Options are normally granted at a discount of up to 20%.
Opportunity Savings are capped at an agreed amount up to the individual monthly limit set by HMRC from time to time.
ELECTROCOMPONENTS PLC LSE Stock Code: ECM Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2014 72 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY Component: Share ownership Objective To align Executive Director and shareholder interests and reinforce long-term decision-making.
Operation Executive Directors are expected to retain at least 50% of any share awards that vest net of tax in order to help build up the following required personal holdings of Electrocomponents plc shares: CEO: 200% of salary CFO: 100% of salary Only shares that are held beneficially count in the assessment of whether an Executive Director has met the required ownership level.
Notes to the policy table Payments from previous awards The Company will honour any commitment entered into, and Executive Directors will be eligible to receive payment from any award made, prior to the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report, i. e. before 24 July 2014.
Details of these awards are, and will be, disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting The annual bonus performance measures have been selected to directly reinforce our medium-term performance framework of 1 higher sales growth, 2 improved profitability, and 3 strong free cash flow see pages 12 and 13 for further details of our strategy.
The LTIP vests based on three-year TSR outperformance of the FTSE 250 index and achievement of three-year EPS growth targets.
The Committee selected TSR and EPS as performance measures because it felt this would provide a good balance between external and internal measures of performance, as well as absolute and relative performance.
TSR aligns performance with shareholders interests.
EPS is a measure of the profitability of the Company that directly reflects management performance, and is a measure used by investors in deciding whether to invest in the Company.
EPS is measured on a fully diluted basis, as shown in the Groups financial statements, as this provides an independently verifiable measure of performance.
Targets applying to the bonus and LTIP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points.
Bonus targets are aligned with the annual budget agreed by the Board.
LTIP targets reflect industry context, expectations of what will constitute appropriately challenging performance levels, and factors specific to the Company.
Differences from remuneration policy for other employees The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as described above.
Annual salary reviews across the Group take into account Company performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in comparable companies.
All executives and senior managers are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes.
Opportunities and performance measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individuals role.
Other members of the Group Executive Committee participate in the DSBP and LTIP on similar terms as the Executive Directors, although award sizes may vary.
Below this level, senior managers are eligible to participate in the LTIP.
Grants are based on personal performance and vest after three years subject to continued employment.
All UK-based employees are eligible to participate in the Companys HMRC approved savings-related share scheme on identical terms.
Employees based outside the UK are eligible to participate in a cash-based alternative on similar terms.

For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for 2014 15.
It should be noted that any awards granted under the DSBP do not normally vest until the second anniversary of the date of grant, and LTIP awards do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant.
This illustration is intended to show the relationship between executive pay and performance.
Please note, however, that actual pay delivered will be further influenced by changes in the Companys share price and dividends paid.
Valuation assumptions The Minimum scenario reflects base salary, pension and benefits i. e. fixed remuneration, being the only elements of the Executive Directors remuneration package not linked to performance.
Pension contributions are 30% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 43.5% for the Group Finance Director.
The On-Target scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target bonus payout 75% of salary and LTIP threshold vesting at 0%of the maximum award level.
The Maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus full payout under all incentives 150% of salary under the annual bonus, and 100% and 80% of salary under the LTIP for the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, respectively.
The value of LTIP assumes no increase in the underlying value of the shares.
ELECTROCOMPONENTS PLC LSE Stock Code: ECM Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2014 74 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY Approach to Executive Director recruitment remuneration External appointment In cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director from outside the Company, the Remuneration Committee may make use of all existing components of remuneration, as follows: Approach to Executive Director recruitment remuneration The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and the current salary of the incumbent in the role.
Where a new appointee has an initial base salary set below market, the Committee may make above-market phased increases over a period of two or three years, subject to the individuals development and performance in the role.
New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may include but are not limited to the provision of a company car or car allowance, medical insurance, company mobile phone, expatriation allowances and any necessary expenses relating to an executives relocation.
New appointees will receive pension contributions into a defined contribution pension arrangement or an equivalent cash supplement, or a combination of both.
New appointees will be eligible to participate on identical terms to all other employees.
The bonus structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees.
The maximum opportunity will be 150% of salary, pro-rated in the year of joining to reflect the proportion of that year employed.
One-third of any bonus earned will be deferred into the DSBP on the same terms as other Executive Directors.
New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP with a face value of up to 150% of salary.
Other features of the Awards will be as described in the policy table.
In determining the appropriate remuneration structure and level for the appointee, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of our shareholders.
The Committee may also need to make an award of shares or cash payment in respect of a new appointment to buy-out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, over and above the approach and award limits outlined in the table above, availing itself of Listing Rule 9.4.
In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to the awards being bought out, and the likelihood of those conditions being met.
Any such buy-out will have a fair value no greater than the fair value of the awards forfeited, and details will be fully disclosed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
Internal promotion to the Board In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the policy will be consistent with that for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to Executive Director level, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements even if there are instances where they would not otherwise be consistent with the prevailing Executive Director remuneration policy at the time of promotion.

com Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2014 75 Service contracts and policy for payment for loss of office Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee.
Executive Directors have service agreements that operate on a 12-month rolling basis.
In line with the Committees policy, these service agreements provide for 12 months notice by the Company and by the Executive Directors.
The Company entered into an updated service agreement with Ian Mason on 1March2001.
This agreement replaced all prior arrangements and was amended on 24 March 2014.
The Company entered into a service agreement with Simon Boddie on 25May2005.
Copies of Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.
The Committees policy for Directors termination payments is to provide only what would normally be due to Directors had they remained in employment in respect of the relevant notice period, and not to go beyond their normal contractual entitlements.
Any incentive arrangements will be dealt with subject to the relevant rules, with any discretion exercised by the Committee on a case-by-case basis taking into account the circumstances of the termination.
Termination payments will also take into account any statutory entitlement at the appropriate level, to be considered by the Committee on the same basis.
The Committee will monitor and where appropriate enforce the Directors duty to mitigate loss.
When the Committee believes that it is essential to protect the Companys interests, additional arrangements may be entered into for example post-termination protections above and beyond those in the contract of employment on appropriate terms.
Simon Boddies service agreement provides for base salary in lieu of notice.
Ian Masons service agreement provides for base salary and contractual benefits in lieu of notice.

The Executive Director may retain any fees payable in relation to such an appointment.
Details of external appointments and the associated fees received are included in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company The Company seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodies including trade unions and works councils as part of its broader employee engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

Total pension entitlements audited The current Executive Directors are able to participate in the defined benefits section of the Electrocomponents Group Pension Scheme Scheme.
However, as their pension benefits are greater than or equal to the lifetime allowance, they elected to opt out of the pension scheme with effect from 5 April 2012, and receive a cash supplement in lieu of pension no greater than the cost of pension benefits previously provided.
The single cash supplement, which replaced all historic cash supplements and pension benefits, will be paid until the earlier of i the date employment with the Company terminates and ii the date the Executive Director reaches age 60 the normal retirement age.
The Committee recognises that the level of pension contribution is above market norms for FTSE 250 companies of similar size.
However, these levels of cash supplement reflect legacy defined benefit arrangements from which the Executive Directors opted out.
The cash supplement rates for the current Executive Directors are summarised in the policy table on page 69, and the cash supplement paid during the year under review is captured in the single figure for total remuneration on page 80.
ELECTROCOMPONENTS PLC LSE Stock Code: ECM Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2014 84 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION The accrued defined benefit pensions of the Executive Directors at 31 March 2014 were as follows, including revaluation from the date they opted out of the Scheme: Ian Mason: 55,568 p. a. Simon Boddie: 29,042 p. a.
These pensions are payable from age 60 their normal retirement age under the Scheme.
If the Directors leave service before age 60, they may elect to start receiving their pension at any time between age 55 and age 60, in which case the pension will be actuarially reduced to reflect the longer period for which it is expected to be paid.
Payments to past directors No payments were made to past directors during the year under review.
Exit payments made in the year No exit payments to directors were made during the year under review.
External appointments in the year During the financial year, Simon Boddie was a Non-Executive Director of PageGroup.
The fee payable for this appointment is 58,000 per annum.
Until the end of November 2013, Ian Mason was a Non-Executive Director at Sage Group plc, for which he received a fee of 60,000 per annum.
During the year he received 40,000 in total.
Both Executive Directors are permitted to retain the fees relating to these appointments.
Percentage change in CEO remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in the CEO annual cash remuneration comprising base salary, the value of taxable benefits and earned annual bonus, as disclosed in the single figure of remuneration table on page 80 from the prior year compared with the average percentage change for the 320 members of our Global Management Team GMT.
This group is considered more representative of the geographical footprint of the Company than a UK comparator group, and similarity of remuneration structures facilitates a more meaningful comparision than considering all employees as a whole.
The difference in percentage change in the CEOs annual bonus and total cash remuneration compared with that of other senior employees reflects differences in annual bonus design: the annual bonus for the CEO is based 100% on financial performance, whereas for the GMT it comprises an element based on personal performance and contribution.

Salaries were reviewed in early 2014 against a remuneration comparator group comprising UK-based FTSE250 companies: t With a majority of their revenues outside the UK t In sectors such as support services, distribution and manufacturing and other similar classifications, but not financial services t Of similar size in terms of revenue, number of employees and market capitalisation This review identified that the current Executive Directors base salaries remain above the chosen benchmark.
It is the Committees policy to align Executive Director base salaries with the market over time, and therefore the Committee approved the following base salary increases with effect from 1June 2014: Base salary Base salary from 1 June from 1 June Percentage Executive Director 2013 2014 increase Ian Mason 579,160 590,000 1.9% Simon Boddie 386,110 393,832 2.0% A salary increase averaging 2% across the Group was awarded at the annual pay review, effective 1 June 2014.
