The introduction of clawback provisions is the only change that has been made to the remuneration policy this year.
As this change is a restriction to the scope of the existing policy, we have not sought another binding shareholder vote this year.
Set appropriate remuneration In 2014, the Committee set remuneration levels for Tim Cobbold as the incoming CEO, as disclosed in the 2013 remuneration report.
Dame Helen Alexander was appointed Executive Chairman to cover the period between David Levins departure on 1 March 2014 and Tims start date on 6 May 2014.
In recognition of the increased responsibilities and time commitment required, Dame Helen received an additional cash payment of 51,187, calculated pro-rata on the difference between her normal fees as Chairman and the base salary for the CEO.
The remuneration levels for both Tim Cobbold and Dame Helen Alexander are within the remuneration policy as approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.

All sharebased payments which had yet to vest for David Levin lapsed on the date of his stepping down on 1 March 2014.
Dame Helen Alexander received no share-based incentives in respect of her role as Executive Chairman.
BIP matching awards were based on Group adjusted EPS performance.
No matching shares would vest for EPS growth of 5% per annum RPI or less with 100% vesting for EPS growth of at least 9% per annum RPI straight-line vesting between these points.
UBMs Group adjusted EPS growth over the period was below 5% per annum RPI meaning that none of the awards will vest.
The PSP awards for the performance period 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014 were based on relative TSR performance.
Full vesting is achieved if UBMs relative TSR performance outperformed that of the median of the peer group by 10% per annum.
None of the award would vest for performance less than the median of the peer group, while 25% of shares would vest if UBMs TSR performance was in line with the median of the peer group.
UBMs TSR did not reach the median of the group, meaning that none of the awards will vest.

The profit contribution from the odd-year biennials leads to an annual distortion in the reported growth rate and profitability of the events business and an increase in EPS in odd years To give a fairer reflection of underlying performance, a two-year average of Group adjusted EPS of odd and even years will be applied, with the two-year average prior to the performance period used as the base year, and the two-year average at the end of the performance period used to determine growth For PSP awards made in 2014 with a three-year performance period of 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 the twoyear average for the base year is based on EPS for 2012 and 2013 adjusted for the Rights Issue, ie 43.9 pence, and the two-year average at the end will be based on EPS for 2015 and 2016 Return on Average Capital Employed Performance metrics The target is the weighted average of the following: 1.
Existing capital Returns on existing capital i. e. ROACE at the start of the performance period must maintain or exceed current levels by the end of the three-year period.
