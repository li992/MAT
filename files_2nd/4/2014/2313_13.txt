Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT Chairmans Introduction to the Remuneration Report I am pleased to present the Report of the Remuneration Committee for 2014, which sets out the remuneration paid to the Directors in the financial year ended 28 March 2014 and the policy for the forthcoming year.
This year sees the introduction of a binding shareholder vote on the Directors Remuneration Policy see pages 34 to 42 in addition to the advisory vote on the Annual Report on Directors Remuneration see pages 43 to 48.
The format of the Remuneration Report is broadly the same as last year, the Remuneration Committee having agreed to adopt some of the key requirements of the then draft new rules in advance of the formal regulations coming into force this year.
Our Remuneration Policy remains largely unchanged from last year.
In presenting the policy, the Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration policies of the Company are in line with the new regulations, whereby: Directors should not be rewarded for failure and incentives for Directors and executives should be closely linked to performance, thus aligning the interests of Directors, executives and shareholders: and Directors rewards should be correlated with those received by other employees of the business.
The Committee believes that the Companys remuneration system conforms with these objectives whilst retaining and attracting individuals capable of promoting the success of the business.
Alignment between the Directors, executives and shareholders is also significantly increased by personal shareholdings.
Directors, executives and colleagues own in aggregate over 7% of the issued share capital of the Company outright.
The Committee is of the view that we have a structure of reasonable base pay, bonuses and long term incentives which are aligned to the creation of shareholder value.
We are satisfied that the outcomes have reflected business performance.
The Committee believes that this remuneration system has a proven track record of encouraging strong performance, does not reward failure and reflects the Companys overall goal of creating value for shareholders.
Moreover, we believe that the remuneration policy and incentive framework in place is working well to support the Companys strategy, is helping to retain and motivate our management team and is helping to drive strong returns for our shareholders.
The Board recommends this Directors Remuneration Policy to shareholders.
It will provide the framework to allow us to recruit, motivate and retain the talent the Company needs and to ensure the alignment of executive remuneration with the creation of value for shareholders.
We look forward to hearing your views in the future and hope to receive your continued support at this years AGM.
This Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 21 May 2014.
Karen Jones Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 21 May 2014 32 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance Governance Role of the Committee The Remuneration Committee has defined Terms of Reference which were reviewed in November 2013 and can be found in the Investor Relations Investor Centre Legal Documents section of the Groups website.
A copy may be obtained from the Company Secretary.
The Remuneration Committee advises the Board and makes recommendations to it: on the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and executives including remuneration, share incentives and other benefits: on the terms of service contracts with Executive Directors and executives and any compensation arrangements resulting from the termination of an Executive Director or executives service contract: and concerning the grant and vesting of awards under the PSP.
Membership The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Karen Jones and also comprises Lord Bilimoria and Andrew Cripps, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors.
Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors biographies on pages 18 and 19.
Their remuneration is set out later in this Report.
The quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two, each of whom must be a Non-Executive Director.
Only members of the Committee have the right to attend committee meetings, however, during the year, Richard Rose Chairman, Charles Wilson Chief Executive, Jonathan Prentis Group Finance Director and the Group Human Resources director were invited to attend meetings although never during the discussion of any item affecting their own remuneration or employment.
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
Meeting Frequency and Main Activities in the Year The Remuneration Committee met five times during the year ended 28 March 2014 to: Approve the 2013 bonus: Review and approve the Remuneration Report for 2013: Consider the 2014 Pay Award Strategy: Review Executive Directors and other executives remuneration packages: Consider auto-enrolment for employees in the Groups pension scheme: Consider, approve and adopt the performance conditions for 2013 16 and future PSP awards: Provide an update upon the Committee Chairmans meetings and conference calls with shareholders: Consider the Remuneration Report for 2014: and Consider the bonus scheme for 2015.
Since 28 March 2014, the Remuneration Committee met twice to: Approve the 2014 bonus: Review and approve the Remuneration Report for 2014: Consider and approve the 2015 Pay Award Strategy: Approve the 2015 bonus scheme: and Approve salary increases of 2% for the Executive Directors.
Attendance Committee member Number of meetings attended Percentage attendance Karen Jones Chairman 5 100% Lord Bilimoria 5 100% Andrew Cripps 5 100% Key Remuneration Principles The principles supporting the Executive Directors reward packages are reviewed each year to ensure that they continue to underpin the Groups strategy.
The Committees overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages.
The Company wishes to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and executives of the requisite quality.
Accordingly, the Committees policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward Executive Directors and executives fairly for their contribution.
The Committee will take into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when determining Executive Directors remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases.
33 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Directors Remuneration Policy The policy for Executive Directors, set out below, will apply from the date of the 2014 AGM subject to approval, and is available to view in the Investor Relations Investor Centre Legal Documents section of the Groups website.
The Committee will consider the remuneration policy annually to ensure that it continues to underpin the Groups strategy.
It is, however, intended that the policy set out below will apply for three years from the 2014 AGM.
Shareholders will be asked to approve any amendments to the policy during that three year period.

Notes to Future Policy Table Bonus The Earnings before interest and tax EBIT bonus scheme, which is consistent with the FY14 bonus scheme, covers Executive Directors, executives, branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 1,700 colleagues of the Group.
The aggregate bonus pool is determined each year by the level of improvement in Group EBIT year on year and no bonus is paid unless there is an improvement.
The maximum bonus achievable for an Executive Director is 100% of basic salary.
Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, does not participate in this bonus scheme.
The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arise from his significant shareholding in the Company.
Payments to Executive Directors are based upon a percentage of basic salary and do not form part of pensionable earnings.
The proportion of the bonus pool accruing to Executive Directors is less than 15%.
PSP The PSP scheme allows Executive Directors and approximately 1,000 employees to receive share awards, subject to the achievement of performance targets set by the Committee, measured over a three year period.
Awards are made annually and, other than in exceptional circumstances, will not be more than 150% of annual salary for Executive Directors.
For the 2011 14 PSP cycle, the performance measures were share price based.
Details of structure and outcome are set out on page 44.
For the 2012 15 and 2013 16 PSP cycle, the Committee resolved to grant maximum awards at 150% of base salary for the Executive Directors.
Vesting for points between Threshold and Maximum will be calculated on a straight line basis, as follows: 50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting at 8% growth per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting for 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 years from the award date.
36 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance 50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving Absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as measured between March 2012 and March 2015 and March 2013 and March 2016.
In setting the TSR performance target, the Committee has taken into account the TSR returns achieved by companies in the FTSE350 commencing with the three year period to May 2002 and then walking forward on a weekly basis with the last data point being the returns of each company through to July 2012.
There is no re-testing of performance targets under the PSP, and awards lapse if they are not met.
The performance measures for the 2014 17 cycle for the Executive Directors excluding Charles Wilson are expected to be similar to the 2013 16 PSP cycle.
Fixed and Variable Pay Mix Individual reward elements for all Executive Directors excluding Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, who does not participate in any incentive schemes are designed to provide a balance between fixed remuneration and variable at risk reward, linked to the performance of the Company.
Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen from the outset not to participate in the bonus scheme.
The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arises from his significant shareholding in the Company.

The benefit values included are estimates.
The amounts shown in relation to Bonus and PSP do not take account of any share price appreciation or depreciation: and the PSP vesting is calculated using a share price of 166.7p being the closing share price on 28 March 2014.

This feature helps ensure alignment between executive rewards and shareholder returns.
Other Uses of Discretion The Committee will operate the Companys incentive plans according to their respective rules, the policy set out in the table above and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
The Committee retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the incentive plans.
These include, but are not limited to, determining who participates in the incentive plans, the time and size of awards, measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction and the adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends.
The discretions that can be applied in the case of leavers under the Bonus and PSP are set out in the section on Policy on Payment for Loss of Office on page 39.
Any exercises of discretion by the Committee will be fully disclosed and explained in the relevant years Remuneration Report.
The Committee will also use its judgement as to what is appropriate within the terms of the Directors Remuneration Policy, to make decisions that do not involve the exercise of discretion.
Approach to Recruitment Remuneration The remuneration of any new Executive Director will be determined in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Policy and the elements that would be considered by the Company for inclusion are: salary and benefits, including defined contribution pension participation and relocation costs, where appropriate: participation in the Bonus: pro-rated for the year of recruitment to reflect the proportion of the year remaining after the date of commencement of employment.
participation in the PSP: awards would be granted on the same terms and subject to the same performance conditions as those which apply to PSP awards granted to existing Executive Directors in the year of recruitment.
The maximum annual level of variable remuneration that may be granted to a newly recruited Executive Director excluding any awards to compensate for incentives forgone on recruitment would be in line with that of the existing Executive Directors: Bonus award: maximum 100% of salary: and PSP award: maximum 400% of salary for a full PSP cycle commencing after appointment, plus pro-rated awards in relation to PSP cycles outstanding at the time of recruitment up to a further 150% of salary.
In addition, the Committee may, in its discretion, compensate a newly recruited Executive Director for incentives forgone from a previous employment as a result of their resignation.
The Committee would seek validation of the value of any potential incentives forgone.
Awards made by way of compensation for incentives forgone would be made on a comparable basis, taking account of performance achieved or likely to be achieved, the proportion of the performance period remaining and the form of the award.
Compensation would, as far as possible, be in the form of awards under the PSP in order to immediately align a new Executive Director with Company performance.
38 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance Policy on Payment for Loss of Office Contractual Notice Period and Pay in Lieu All current Executive Directors have a rolling service contract with a notice period from the company of 12 months.
As an alternative, the Company may, at its discretion, pay in lieu of that notice.
Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
Payment in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months pension contributions, and other contractual benefits.
Where possible, the Company will seek to ensure that where a leaver mitigates their losses by, for example, finding new employment, there will be a corresponding reduction in compensation payable for loss of office.
The Companys approach to the termination of contracts of service of Executive Directors is dictated by the relevant events, bearing in mind the circumstances of termination and the interests of the Company.
A bonus element is not normally included in the termination payment, however, if the Company enforces the non-compete clause, up to 12 months on target bonus will be payable.
An Executive Director may have an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under relevant employment legislation in the UK.
Under Charles Wilsons contract, in the event of a change of control of the Company, Charles Wilson has the right to terminate his employment on 30 days notice and to receive a payment equal to his gross salary for his contractual notice period.
Termination by Mutual Agreement In certain circumstances it can be in the best interests of the Company for the Board to proactively manage succession planning and the development of the senior talent pipeline.
In such circumstances, the Board may agree that an executives departure will be by mutual agreement.
In order for this to apply, the Committee will need to be satisfied that the executive has demonstrated performance in line with expectations and where required they should have contributed to an orderly succession.
The Companys experience is that this approach is successful and has previously enabled the Company to recruit a former Executive Director to lead Makro on an interim basis immediately after its acquisition.
An Executive Director terminated by mutual agreement will be treated as a good leaver for the purposes of the Bonus and PSP plans.
If the termination date falls during the financial year, they will be eligible to be paid a pro-rated on target bonus and if they are employed at the end of the financial year, the bonus payable would be based on actual results.
Other than as set out above, the Committee does not anticipate using the discretion provided by the Bonus and PSP plan rules in respect of termination payments.
There may, however, be unforeseen circumstances where this is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Where such discretion is exercised, explanations will be provided in the next Remuneration Report.

The Committee would only exercise the discretions available in the Bonus and PSP plan rules relating to: whether an award is made or an unvested award forfeited: and the extent and timing of any such award or forfeiture in exceptional circumstances, for example permanent disablement.
Notice periods would not usually be included when calculating the pro-rata amount of Bonus and PSP awards that vest.
The Committee would only exercise its discretion to include some or all of the notice period in such calculation in exceptional circumstances, such as ill health, and would not do so in circumstances of poor performance.
The Committee has the discretion to determine that an individual should be treated as a Good Leaver for the purposes of the PSP.
In exercising such discretion the Committee will consider factors such as personal performance and conduct, overall Group performance and the specific circumstances of the Executive Directors departure including, but not restricted to, whether the Executive Director is leaving by mutual agreement with the Company.
If an individual is not a Good Leaver then they will be treated as an Other Leaver, as set out above.
Committee Interaction with Stakeholders The Committee engages with shareholders on remuneration matters.
Discussions were held with a number of shareholders and with shareholder representative organisations over the year.
Legacy Arrangements The Committee reserves the right to honour any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of those payments were i entered into with current or former directors before this policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant executive was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes payments of variable remuneration under the Bonus scheme and the PSP in line with the terms of the payment agreed at the time the award was granted.
The Committee may make minor changes to this policy, which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid its operation or implementation taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek shareholder approval.
40 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance Consideration of Employment Conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group when determining remuneration for its Executive Directors.
Salary increases for Executive Directors will broadly increase in line with the general workforce other than when there is a change in role or responsibility, or a significant variance to the market arises, warranting a larger increase.
Newly promoted or recruited Executive Directors to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the benchmark policy level while they become established in role.
In such cases, salary increases may be higher than the general workforce until the target positioning is achieved.
Group employees salaries are compared to cross-industry standards to ensure fair pay for that job.
The Company does not directly consult with employees as part of the process of determining Directors remuneration.
While formal comparison measurements were not used in determining Executive Director remuneration, the Committee made decisions in the knowledge of incentive arrangements of the rest of the Group, upon which the Committee is briefed regularly.
Remuneration Policy for Other Employees The Companys policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors is consistent with that of other senior employees.
This group of approximately 1,700 people also participates in and receives payments under the EBIT Bonus scheme.
Eligibility to participate in the PSP extends to a similar set of around 1,000 employees in total.
Outside the senior employees group, the composition of remuneration differs.
Of the Groups average 13,000 employees, over 9,000 employees are eligible for a bonus payment based on customer satisfaction.
Customer satisfaction is measured independently by calling 10,000 customers selected at random covering retailers, caterers, delivered and collect across our 202 branches each quarter to ask them to rate key areas of service.
Around 1,300 logistics employees are eligible for a quarterly bonus payment based on achieving productivity and efficiency targets at the site at which they are employed.
In addition from time to time certain incentive arrangements may be introduced for executives and colleagues in order to achieve particular objectives.
Eligibility for, and participation in, benefits and incentive plans differs depending on location, seniority, length of service and other factors.
Service Contracts and Notice Periods for Executive Directors The Committees policy is for all Executive Directors to have rolling service contracts with a notice period of 12 months.
All new appointments will have 12-month notice periods, unless, on an exceptional basis to complete an external recruitment successfully, a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months is used.
This is in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
All Executive Directors appointments and subsequent re-appointments are subject to election and annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM.
Details of Current Executive Directors Contracts The table below summarises the service contracts of the Executive Directors.
Copies of the service contracts will be available for inspection at the Companys registered office during business hours and at the 2014 Annual General Meeting.

Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors The policy for Non-Executive Directors will apply for three years from the date of the 2014 AGM subject to approval, and is available to view in the Investor Relations Legal Documents section of the Groups website.
Shareholders will be asked to approve any changes to the policy during that three year period.

The time commitment for Non-Executive Directors is set out in the relevant Non-Executive Directors letter of appointment.
Non-Executive Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties as Directors of the Company.
Details of Letters of Appointment and Notice Periods for Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of 3 years subject to termination on one months notice.
In addition, the UK Corporate Governance Code requires that all Non-Executive Directors stand for re-election annually.
Non-Executive Director appointments are also subject to the Articles of Association of the Company.

The notes to the single figure table provide further detail, including measures and outcomes for 2013 where relevant, for each of the elements that make up the total single figure of remuneration in respect of each of the Executive Directors.
This report is subject to an advisory vote at the 2014 AGM.
Taxable benefits all taxable benefits in kind arising from the individuals employment in 2013.
Bonus the bonus relating to the Companys performance in 2013, paid in 2014.
PSP Based on the share price at the date of actual vesting.
No PSP options were awarded to Directors in 2009.
This was considered and reflected in determining the value of the award granted in the following year.

45 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Annual Report on Directors Remuneration continued Participation As well as the Executive Directors, approximately 1,000 employees have been granted PSP options.
In addition 3,449 employees participate in the 2013 SAYE scheme, 1,751 employees participate in the 2012 SAYE scheme and 2,136 participate in the 2011 SAYE scheme.

Since 2007, when the reverse takeover of Blueheath was completed and the Company became admitted to trading on AIM, the equity value of the Company has increased from approximately 300m to over 2.6bn as at 21 May.
The value of the PSP options awarded has been equivalent to 2% of the value generated.
Statement of Directors Shareholdings audited information Alignment to shareholder interests is a key element of the Groups remuneration policy which maintains commitment over the long term and ensures that the interests of the Executive Directors are aligned with those of shareholders.

The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal and or spousal holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least the Executive Directors annual base salary.
All of the Executive Directors currently meet these guidelines.
Details of the share interests of all Executive Directors are shown below.
