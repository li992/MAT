Remuneration arrangements should be designed to provide executive directors with the opportunity to receive a share in the future growth and development of the Group which is regarded as fair by both other employees and shareholders.

Annual bonus An annual bonus would operate in the same manner as outlined for the current executives as described above and in the Annual Report on Remuneration, although it would be pro-rated to reflect the employment period during the bonus year.
The bonus maximum potential would not exceed 125% of base salary.
It would be expected that the bonus for a new appointment would be assessed on the same performance metrics as that for the current executives on an ongoing basis.
However, depending on the timing and nature of appointment it may be necessary to set tailored performance criteria for their first bonus plan.

Share awards may be granted shortly after an appointment subject to the Company not being in a close period and would be measured against the same performance criteria as the current executives.
The ongoing award maximum would not exceed 200% of base salary.
For an internal hire, existing awards would continue over their original vesting period and remain subject to their terms as at the date of grant.
The new appointment would be eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plan under the same terms as all other employees.
Buy-out awards To facilitate an external recruitment, it may be necessary to buy-out remuneration which would be forfeited on leaving their previous employer.
When determining the quantum and structure of any buy-out awards the Committee will, as a minimum, take into account the following factors: the form of remuneration cash or shares : timing of expected payment vesting: and expected value i. e. taking into account the likelihood of achieving the existing performance criteria.
Buy-out awards, if used, will be granted using the Companys existing share plans to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.

Annual bonus plan The incentive for the financial year ended 31 December 2014 was in the form of a cash bonus of up to 50% of salary and a DSP bonus of up to 75% of salary i. e. 125% in total.
The bonus both cash and DSP elements was determined by a mixture of underlying operating profit performance 70% and key performance indicators 30% relating to underlying drivers of longterm revenue growth.
When comparing performance against the 2014 bonus targets set, the Committee determined that 70% of the maximum achievable cash and DSP bonus should be paid to the executive directors.
Accordingly, a cash bonus of 35% of base salary will be paid to the executives and 52.50% of base salary will be granted to the executives under the DSP, which will be deferred until March 2017.
