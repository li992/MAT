56 Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements JARDINE LLOYD THOMPSON GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Incentive out-turns in respect of 2014 MAJOR ACTIVITIES AND DECISIONS IN 2014 As described earlier in this report, 2014 was a strong year for the Clawback business.
In response to the requirements set out in the revised UK Corporate For the 2014 bonus for the Executive Directors, between 50% and Governance Code, to include a provision that facilitates clawback of 75% was based on the Group achieving Underlying Profit Before Tax variable remuneration awarded to Executive Directors, the PBT targets and 25% to 50% on the achievement of stretching Committee considered implementation at JLT.

The circumstances that may trigger clawback are The 2012 LTIP was based on EPS performance over the three year material misstatement and gross misconduct.

The expansion will build on the success JLT has had over Executive Officer at JLT, Dominic Burke took a short sabbatical recent years and is the next natural step in our evolution, offering the during May and June 2014.
This included a period of unpaid platform for substantial future earnings growth and significant value leave.
His received salary for 2014 was adjusted accordingly.
Based on the substantial increase in the scope and The expansion plan is expected to result in a net investment of responsibilities of Mark Drummond Bradys role following his approximately 50 million USD80 million during the period 2014 to accession to Deputy CEO, the Committee agreed it would be 2017.
For bonus or LTIP awards the execution of the investment appropriate to increase his salary by 14% with effect from 1st plan may therefore have an impact on targets in respect of the January 2015.
Dominic Burkes salary will increase by 5% from relevant period.
1st April 2015 to reflect the increase in size and complexity of The Committee has therefore agreed to address the impact of US the business.

This was the first increase since 2011 and reflected the impact of the US investment costs for the purposes of measuring substantial increase in the size and scope of the business since LTIP performance.
This adjusted EPS number will then also be used that time.
As the Group Chairman had received an increase in as the base year for the subsequent LTIP award.
2013, his fee was not increased at the same time.
The Committees rationale for this approach is as follows: We will continue to keep our policies under review to ensure they To spread the cost of this investment equitably but not to remain appropriate in the face of evolving best practice, regulatory exclude it.
To incentivise the right behaviours for JLT, encouraging the I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee for their development and execution of strategies which create long-term continued support during the year.
The Committee will continue to monitor the pace and effectiveness of the investment and will retain discretion to disapply or cap the adjustment in the relevant years.
In particular, the Committee will seek to ensure that sustained or unacceptably high costs would not be adjusted out of LTIP measurement.
Richard Harvey The Committee consulted with major shareholders and investor Chairman, Remuneration Committee bodies and received broad support for the approach above.

60 Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements JARDINE LLOYD THOMPSON GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT 2014 KEY COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION The following sections describe how the Committee implemented key elements of the policy in the year ended 31st December 2014 and how it is intended to operate in the year ending 31st December 2015.

As described in more detail on page 12, 2014 saw growth of 3% in Group Underlying PBT to 183.0 million.
Excluding the impact of the Groups investment in the US unanticipated when the targets were set this growth was 6% to 188.2 million.
The stretching target set at the beginning of the year was 201.1 million.
61 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED LTIP 2012 award, vesting in respect of 2014 The 2012 LTIP was based on basic EPS growth excluding exceptional items and impairment charges in the three financial years to 31st December 2014 in accordance with the targets laid out below, determined by the Committee at the time of grant.
Following the announcement of the significant organic expansion into the US, the Committee considered the impact of the expected investment costs 2014-2017.
The Committee determined that it is appropriate to adopt the following approach: In respect of a financial year in which US investment costs occur, that such costs will be added back to the EPS for that year for the purposes of measuring LTIP performance.
The Committee retains discretion over whether to apply or dis-apply such an approach in respect of any impacted financial year and on the proportion of the cost which is added back.
The adjusted EPS number will also be used as the base year for the subsequent LTIP awards.
Any adjustment will be verified by the Company auditors and clearly disclosed in the relevant Directors Remuneration Report.
The approach above is conceptually identical to using an adjusted EPS for LTIP measurement which adds back exceptional costs to the final year and uses the same EPS as the base year going forward.
The Committee believes that although the costs are not exceptional costs from a technical accounting perspective and therefore will not be excluded from Underlying EPS, they are exceptional for the purposes of LTIP measurement.
The approach is consistent with the rules of the LTIP and with the Remuneration Policy.
In respect of 2014, the adjustment for unanticipated US investment costs had an impact on EPS of 1.6p.
Additionally, as was the case last year, the Committee adjusted EPS growth to neutralise the impact of IAS 19 Revised.
Following these adjustments, the Committee determined that the 2014 EPS for the purposes of the LTIP was 57.8p and that the 2012 LTIP will therefore vest at 72.3% on 29th March 2015.
Vesting EPS growth over a three year period % of maximum Below RPI 5% per annum RPI 15% over 3 years 0% RPI 5% per annum RPI 15% over 3 years 16.67% RPI 10% per annum or above RPI 30% over 3 years 100% Vesting on a pro-rata basis between these points.

PENSION Pension benefits are provided to Executive Directors via the defined contribution DC section of the JLT UK Pension Scheme or as a cash salary supplement.
Member contributions are matched by a Company contribution equivalent to 2.5 times the amount paid by the member subject to a maximum of 5% to 15% of pensionable earnings for the Scheme currently 140,000 but reviewed annually.
Contributions in respect of 2014 are included in the Single Total Figure of Remuneration Table on page 60.
One Executive Director is a deferred member of the Defined Benefit DB section of the Scheme, which has been closed to further accrual and to new members since 2006, with members benefits based on their final pensionable salary at that time.
Details of these defined benefit entitlements are set out in the Total Pension Entitlements table below.
To reflect the closure of the DB scheme in 2006, affected employees, including some Executive Directors, also receive a fixed cash supplement, which was calculated as a percentage of salary determined at the time the scheme was closed based on each individuals circumstances.
These cash supplements are included in the Single Total Figure of Remuneration Table on page 60.
TOTAL PENSION ENTITLEMENTS AUDITED The following table provides details, where applicable, of entitlements under the Companys defined benefit pension arrangements in respect of the Executive Director who served during the year ending 31st December 2014.
Normal Accrued Transfer value Increase in Increase in Transfer value of retirement benefit at of accrued accrued benefits accrued increase in accrued 000 age 31 Dec benefits at 31 excluding benefits due to benefits excluding 2014 Dec 2014 inflation inflation inflation M F G Drummond Brady 60 105.6 4,409.7 Nil 2.8 Nil D J Burke, M T Reynolds and JDR Twining do not have any entitlement under a Company defined benefit pension arrangement.
The accrued benefit is the amount that the director would receive from retirement age if they left service on that date.
The increase in the accrued benefit is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year end and that at the previous year end.
Transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice and approved by the Scheme Trustees.
The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the cash equivalent of the directors pension benefits which would be offered by the Trustees of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pension Scheme to another pension scheme as consideration for the other scheme taking on the liability for providing the directors pension benefits at retirement.
The transfer value itself does not represent an actual sum payable to the individual director as part of pay and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
There are no discretionary benefits taken into account when calculating transfer values.
The directors have no guaranteed right to early retirement.
No additional benefit will become receivable by a director in the event that they retire before their normal retirement date.
