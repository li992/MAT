Governance Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 33 Directors remuneration report Remuneration Committee Chairmans statement Dear Shareholder Directors Remuneration Policy I am pleased to present the Companys Directors remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 December 2014.
I was delighted to join the Committee in January 2014, assume the role of Chairman in March and follow through on the policy work put in place by my predecessor, Neil Johnson, our Board Chairman.
Our new Remuneration Policy and annual report on Remuneration received overwhelming approval at the Companys 2014 Annual General Meeting and I would like to thank our shareholders for this support.
The policy has been in force since 1 May 2014 and following a review toward the end of the year the Committee considers that it remains appropriate and therefore no changes are being proposed for shareholder approval in 2015.
For convenience the Policy principles and a table summarising the main elements of the Policy have been re-produced on pages 34 to 37.
Committee activities during the year During 2014 the Committee worked closely with the Nomination Committee and the Board in: defining the termination arrangements for Adrian Whitfield following his decision to step down as Chief Executive Officer in July 2014 and in setting the remuneration terms for Calum MacLean who joined as Chief Executive Officer in January 2015. agreeing terms with David Blackwood for his retirement as Chief Financial Officer which was announced in December 2014.
The remuneration arrangements in 2015 for Mr MacLean and Mr Blackwood are set out on page 39 and the termination arrangements agreed with Mr Whitfield and Mr Blackwood are set out on page 43.
The Committee also considered the new requirements for the recovery or withholding of variable pay contained in the updated UK Corporate Governance Code published in September 2014.
As the Committee already has wide discretionary powers in relation to the operation of the annual bonus plan it has been decided to implement explicit malus and clawback arrangements in that plan from 2015 in line with those already contained in the Companys Performance Share Plan.
The Committee is already giving consideration to future policy changes to be implemented in 2017 when a new vote on policy will be required.
Accordingly the Committee has decided that in the light of emerging best practice it will introduce a two year holding requirement for vested awards under the Performance Share Plan following the three year performance period from 2017 onwards.
Out-turns from 2014 For 2015 base salaries have been increased by 2.4% which is in line with the average across the senior management population.
Under the annual bonus plan the Group profit before tax performance of 90.9 million on a constant currency basis resulted in 49.1% of the profit before tax element of the 2014 plan being awarded which together with health and safety and personal objective performance led to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer each receiving a bonus of 57.3% and 56.8% of their 2014 annual basic salary respectively.
Details of the performance targets are set out on pages 39 to 40.
The relative total shareholder return and earnings per share conditions attached to the awards made in 2012 under the Performance Share Plan were not met and accordingly these awards will lapse in March 2015.
Performance measures linked to strategy The Board and the Committee seek to align our strategy, namely investing in innovation, driving growth and creating excellence see page 5 to both the Performance Share Plan and the annual bonus plan.
Performance Share Plan strategic goals include Asian growth and expansion and an increase in revenue from new products reflecting expansion in emerging markets and innovation.
The Performance Share Plan also includes a cash generation goal from the mature European operations which funds both product development and innovation and international growth.
Safety, health and environmental goals in the annual bonus plan promote excellence in our ways of working.
Our strategy is intended to deliver value for our shareholders.
Accordingly, a significant portion of the long term incentive plan is linked to EPS growth with targets which are stretching but do not encourage undue risk-taking and TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250.
The Committee believes therefore that there is good alignment between our strategy and the remuneration of the executive directors.

We hope we will have the support of our shareholders for the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Remuneration Committee I would like to thank Neil Johnson for his work as chairman of the Committee prior to my appointment and the other members of the Committee for their work and support throughout 2014.

Executive directors are required to hold 100% of their annual salary in the Companys shares.
Until this requirement is met no sales of shares that vest under long-term incentive plans are permitted other than to satisfy tax liabilities that arise on the exercise of share awards under such plans.
The Committee considers that unfettered unexercised vested nil-cost awards are economically equivalent to shares and as such that they should count on a net of tax basis toward compliance with the 100% salary guideline.
The Committee will keep the guideline level of share interest under review.
Payments to past directors No payments were made to past directors during the year.
Arrangements for A M Whitfield and D C Blackwood A M Whitfield On 1 July 2014, Adrian Whitfield announced his intention to step down from his role as Chief Executive Officer and director of the Company.
He agreed to give 12 months notice and to continue as Chief Executive Officer to allow sufficient time for a replacement to be found and an orderly transition to take place.
As a result of the appointment of Calum MacLean as Mr Whitfields successor on 22 January 2015, Mr Whitfield agreed with the Board to step down as Chief Executive Officer, but to remain an employee of the Company until the end of his notice period on 30 June 2015.
During his notice period, Mr Whitfield continues to be paid in line with the terms of his service agreement and is entitled to receive his normal salary, benefits and pension arrangements.
It was agreed, at the time of his giving notice, that he would receive neither a bonus nor an award under the Performance Share Plan in 2015.
He remained eligible for a bonus in respect of performance in 2014 as detailed on pages 39 and 40.
The Remuneration Committee determined that, taking into account the circumstances of the departure, the transition between the leadership of the Company and Mr Whitfields contribution to the business during his tenure, his unvested awards under the Performance Share Plan would continue.
In line with the approved policy the awards will be reduced on a time-apportioned basis, which will be calculated to 31 March 2015 i. e. prior to ceasing employment.
Awards will be subject to the relevant performance conditions which will be measured at the normal time.
Vesting of awards will also be subject to mitigation, to the extent that Mr Whitfield subsequently takes up employment with a competitor of the Company.
D C Blackwood David Blackwood gave notice of his intention to retire from his role as Chief Financial Officer on 18 December 2014, and agreed to remain with the Company until 31 December 2015 in order for his successor to be recruited and a handover to take place.
During 2015, Mr Blackwood will continue to be paid in line with the terms of his service agreement and is entitled to receive his normal salary, benefits and pension arrangements.
It was agreed that Mr Blackwood would not be required to work for six weeks during this period in addition to his normal holiday entitlement.
Mr Blackwood will participate in the 2015 annual bonus scheme and receive an award under the Performance Share Plan in 2015.
On retirement, in line with the approved policy, Mr Blackwoods unvested awards under the Performance Share Plan will continue but will be reduced on a time-apportioned basis calculated to 31 December 2015.
Payments for loss of office No payments for loss office were made during the year.

The Committee received independent advice from Deloitte LLP who were appointed as the Committees independent remuneration advisors in April 2013.

Deloitte also provided tax services to the Company in the year.
The Committee was satisfied that this did not compromise the independence of the advice received.
