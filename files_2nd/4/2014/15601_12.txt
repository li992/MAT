The balance of short-term performance measures is illustrated in the chart below: Short-term performance Performance measure Link to strategy Profitability 50% of short-term The profit measure incentivises the delivery of our strategy by encouraging the creation of shareholder value through Trading profit bottom-line financial results.
Trading profit is used as it is widely understood throughout the business, and does not include property profits.
This reflects our fundamentally different approach to space going forward.
Strategic financial performance The selected strategic financial measures allow for the Company to more specifically incentivise the delivery of key 26% of short-term elements of our strategy.
Group internet sales 10% UK like-for-like sales 8% Establishing multichannel leadership is an important and exciting dimension of our strategy and continues to be a key Group working capital 8% focus for 2014 15.
Another key priority for 2014 15 is delivering on our commitments to continue to invest in a strong UK business.
A focus on improving like-for-like performance will support this.
A working capital metric is included to focus Executives on the effective management of stock, cash and suppliers.

Group customer service 8% Group colleague engagement 8% The Committee therefore decided it remained important to focus the annual bonus framework on: Group CO reduction 8% 2 Improving our service to our customers.
Improving the engagement of all of our colleagues if our colleagues smile, our customers smile too.
Being a business that puts back into our community.
Group customer service and Group colleague engagement is objectively measured through our management Steering Wheel which ensures that we manage in a balanced way across our business.
Balance of measures for short-term bonus % Profitability Strategic financial 24% Strategic non-financial 50% 26% Bonus targets are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive as they would give away details of our budgeting to our competitors.
We therefore do not publish the details of targets.
However, targets are considered to be measurable and appropriately stretching.
If they are achieved the Committee considers that value will have been added for shareholders.
The Committee will provide an explanation of the rationale for the level of any bonus paid in the 2014 15 Directors Remuneration Report including details of where performance fell within the target range to ensure transparency for shareholders regarding the level of reward paid in the context of performance delivered.
The Committee will disclose performance targets when they are no longer considered to be commercially sensitive.
Long-term performance Performance measure Link to strategy Earnings per share and return on capital The ultimate goal of our strategy is to provide long-term sustainable returns for all of our shareholders.
Tesco believes employed matrix that the best way to deliver enhanced value is to grow earnings over the long term while maintaining a sustainable level of return on capital employed in other words to keep growing the size of the business in an efficient way.
2014 Performance Share Plan awards will continue to be subject to performance against a matrix of stretching earnings growth targets and sustainable return on capital performance.
The Committee believes that this combination of EPS growth and ROCE performance is strongly aligned with our strategic objectives and also reflects the drivers of long-term shareholder value.
Performance targets are outlined in the table on page 43 and are unchanged from the 2013 awards.

Shares held in plans which are not subject to forfeiture will be included on a net of tax basis for the purposes of calculating Executive Directors shareholdings.

Five years for new appointees to build shareholdings New appointees will be expected to achieve this minimum level of shareholding within five years of appointment.
When the shareholding guidelines were increased in 2011, Executives were given a period of five years to meet this enhanced requirement and therefore should meet the requirement by June 2016.
PSP participation may be subject to maintaining holding Full participation in the long-term Performance Share Plan will generally be conditional upon maintaining the minimum shareholding.
Holding of 50% of vesting awards until requirement met Where an Executive Director does not meet the shareholding requirement they will be required to hold, and not dispose of, at least 50% of the net number of shares which vest under incentive arrangements until they meet this requirement.

Other policy information Risk management Risk management is an important part of business process.
The Committee considers that Tescos processes in this area provide the necessary controls to prevent inappropriate risk taking.
When reviewing remuneration structures the Committee considered whether any aspect of these might encourage behaviours that are incompatible with our Tesco Values and the long-term interests of shareholders.
If necessary, the Committee would take appropriate steps to address this.
Outside appointments Tesco recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other companies.
Such Non-executive duties can broaden a Directors experience and knowledge which can benefit Tesco.
Subject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are allowed to accept Non-executive appointments, provided that these appointments are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest, and they may retain the fees received.
Currently neither Philip Clarke nor Laurie McIlwee hold any outside appointments.
Funding of equity awards Executive incentive arrangements are funded by a mix of newly issued shares and shares purchased in the market.
Where shares are newly issued the Company complies with ABI dilution guidelines on their issue.
The current dilution usage of discretionary plans is c. 3.5% of shares in issue.
Where shares are purchased in the market, these may be held by Tesco Employees Share Schemes Trustees Limited, in which case the voting rights relating to the shares are exercisable by the trustees in accordance with their fiduciary duties.
At 22 February 2014 the trust held 3,182,335 shares.
Other disclosures Change in CEO remuneration compared to the change in colleague remuneration The following table illustrates the change in CEO salary, benefits and bonus between 2012 13 and 2013 14 compared to other UK colleagues.
The Committee decided to use other UK colleagues for the purpose of this disclosure as over half of our colleagues are based in the UK and the CEO is also predominately based in the UK albeit with a global role and responsibilities.
The Committee therefore considered that this is an appropriate comparator group given that pay changes across the Group depend on local market conditions.

The Company undertakes an annual viewpoint survey for all Group employees to understand their views on working for Tesco and how this can be improved.
Feedback on employee reward is provided as part of this survey.
The Committee reviews information regarding the typical remuneration structure and reward levels for other UK based employees to provide context when determining executive remuneration policy.
Considering shareholders views The Committee believes that it is very important to maintain open dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters.

Going forward the Committee will continue to liaise with shareholders regarding remuneration matters more generally and Tesco arrangements as appropriate.
It is the Committees intention to consult with major shareholders in advance of making any material changes to remuneration arrangements.
