The remuneration committee believes to increase from 80% to 85% for executive directors, with that shareholders interests are best served by focussing a greater 125% of target payable at maximum i. e. the maximum proportion of total potential remuneration on compensation which opportunity would increase from 100% to c. 106% of salary, varies with performance.

PayPoint plc annual report 2014 25 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION The following section provides details of how PayPoints remuneration policy was implemented during the financial year ended 31 March 2014.
The following pages contain information that is required to be audited in compliance with the Directors Remuneration requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
All narrative and quantitative tables are unaudited unless otherwise stated.
Remuneration committee membership in 2013 2014 The remuneration committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for executive directors and senior managers and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors.
The committee members are all independent directors.
Andrew Robb is Chairman of the committee, with Eric Anstee, Stephen Rowley and Nick Wiles as members.
The remuneration committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference which set out the full remit of the committee.
A copy of the terms of reference is available to shareholders by writing to the Company Secretary at the registered office.
The terms of reference are also available on the companys website at www.
The remuneration committee met six times during the year and all members were in attendance with the exception of Andrew Robb and Eric Anstee who were each unable to attend one meeting.
During the year, the committee sought internal support from the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, who attended committee meetings by invitation from the Chairman, to advise on specific questions raised by the committee and on matters relating to the performance and remuneration of senior managers.
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director were not present for any discussions that related directly to their own remuneration.
The Company Secretary attended each meeting as Secretary to the committee.
In undertaking its responsibilities, the committee seeks independent external advice as necessary.
To this end, for the year under review, the committee continued to retain the services of Kepler Associates as the principal external adviser to the committee.
The committee evaluates the support provided by its advisers annually and is comfortable that the Kepler team provides independent remuneration advice to the committee and does not have any connections with PayPoint that may impair its independence.
Kepler Associates is a founding member and signatory of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants, details of which can be found at www.
During the year, Kepler Associates provided independent advice on a wide range of remuneration matters, including current market practice, benchmarking of executive pay, incentive design and remuneration reporting and provides no other services to the company.
The fees paid to Kepler Associates on the basis of time and materials in respect of work carried out for the year under review were 71,000.

Scheme interests awarded in the year ended 31 March 2014 DSB matching awards In the year under review, executive directors deferred 50% of their bonuses and, therefore, were granted matching awards under the 2009 DSB Plan on a 1:1 basis as detailed below.
The awards will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, 6 June 2016.
The performance condition is based solely on earnings per share growth.

The awards will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, 31 May 2016.
The performance condition is based 100% on relative TSR vs. the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts.

Implementation of remuneration policy for 2014 2015 Base salary Executive directors received the following salary increases with effect from 1 April 2014: From 1 April 2013 From 1 April 2014 % increase Dominic Taylor 425,000 450,000 5.9% George Earle 320,000 330,000 3.1% Tim Watkin-Rees 300,000 310,000 3.3% PayPoint plc annual report 2014 29 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued Pension There will be no change to the pension contributions for 2014 15.
Dominic Taylor will receive 16% of salary and George Earle and Tim Watkin-Rees will receive 14% of salary compared to the maximum allowable under our remuneration policy of 20% of salary.
Annual bonus The annual bonus for the year ending 31 March 2015 will operate on the same basis as in the policy table.
As part of the review of remuneration during the year ended 31 March 2014, it was noted that the existing pay out at threshold of 87.5% of target equivalent to 70% of maximum was high relative to market practice.
The committee therefore decided to reduce the threshold pay out to 25% of the target opportunity equivalent to 20% of maximum.
Achievement of budget will continue to deliver a target pay out, with a maximum pay out for delivering stretch performance of 125% of target.
To compensate for the removal of the matching entitlement under the DSB, the committee has approved a target annual bonus opportunity for the 2015 financial year of 85% of salary for the executive directors, again based 100% on economic profit.
The maximum opportunity will be 125% of target 106% of salary and 20% of maximum 21% of salary will be paid for threshold performance.
25% of any bonus earned will be mandatorily deferred into shares vesting or granted as nil cost options, exercisable after three years, subject to both continued employment and recovery by the company for financial misstatement or misconduct.
Economic profit targets for 2014 15 have been set to be challenging relative to the business plan.
These are deemed to be commercially sensitive on a prospective basis, but will be disclosed in next years annual report on remuneration.
DSB The final awards under the 2009 DSB plan will be made in June 2014, based on bonuses payable for the year ended 31 March 2014.
No further awards will be made under this plan.
LTIP The LTIP to be granted in June 2015 will operate on the same basis as in the policy table in the remuneration policy report.
Following a review of remuneration during the year ended 31 March 2014, the committee reduced the LTIP pay out at threshold from 30% of salary to 25% of salary to reflect shareholder feedback.
The Chief Executive will receive an LTIP award in FY 2015 of 145% of salary and other executive directors will receive an award of 125% of salary.
Final vesting will be dependent on the achievement of three year TSR relative to the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts, as follows: Measure Weighting Targets Relative TSR 0% vesting below median vs. FTSE 250 25% vesting at median 100% excluding investment trusts 100% vesting at upper quartile Straight-line vesting between these points Additionally, the committee must satisfy itself that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance of the company.
If events occur which cause the committee to consider that this performance requirement has become unfair or impractical, it may, in its discretion, amend the performance requirement so that it is no more or less difficult to satisfy than when it was originally imposed.
Recovery by the company will apply to unvested LTIP shares in the event of misstatement and or participant misconduct.
Non-executive director fees In April 2014, the board undertook its annual review of non-executive directors fees.
Following consideration of general non-executive director fee increases across the market and current market fee levels, the board determined that a modest increase in the base fee was appropriate.
A summary of the fee increases, which are effective 1 April 2014, is set out in the table below.
From 1 April 2013 From 1 April 2014 Base fees Non-executive director 42,000 45,000 Additional fees Chairman, audit committee 7,000 8,000 Chairman, remuneration committee 7,000 8,000 The new Chairman will receive a fee of 190,000, effective from the annual general meeting.

Matching shares are subject to continued employment for three years.
Dividends may accrue on purchased and matching shares and be paid either in cash or rolled up into additional shares.
Notes to the policy table Payments from previous awards The company will honour any commitments entered into prior to the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy as detailed in this report, and executive directors will be eligible to receive payment from any historical awards made.
This includes outstanding awards made under the 2009 LTIP and 2009 DSB Plan, as detailed in the annual report on remuneration.
The differences between the 2009 LTIP and DSB and the plans in the policy table above are detailed below and in the annual report on remuneration.
In 2014, the remuneration committee undertook a comprehensive review of executive incentive arrangements to simplify the long-term incentive structure and align it with the business strategy, to motivate senior management to maximise economic value for shareholders and to improve compliance with new regulatory and governance requirements.
As a result of the review, the following changes were made to the 2009 LTIP and DSB plans: The payout at threshold in the annual bonus was reduced from 70% to 25% of maximum to be in line with best practice.
The matching plan was removed and a small offsetting increase made to the annual bonus and LTIP opportunities so that the fair value of long-term incentive awards would be broadly maintained.
The requirement to mandatorily defer 25% of the bonus into shares was maintained but deferred shares were made subject to continued employment and cancellation.
Under the LTIP, the level of vesting at threshold was reduced from 30% to 25% to be in line with best practice and unvested awards were made subject to cancellation.
Use of discretion The remuneration committee may exercise discretion in two broad areas for each element of remuneration: To ensure fairness and align executive director remuneration with underlying individual and company performance, the committee may adjust upwards or downwards the outcome of any shortor long-term incentive plan payment within the limits of the relevant plan rules.
Any adjustments in light of corporate events will be made on a neutral basis, i. e. the intention of any adjustment will be that the event is not to the benefit or detriment of participants.
Adjustments to underlying performance may be made in exceptional circumstances to ensure outcomes are fair both to shareholders and participants.
In the case of a non-regular event occurring, the committee may apply its discretion to ensure fairness and seek alignment with business objectives.
Non-regular events in this context include, but are not limited to: corporate transactions, changes in the companys accounting policies, minor or administrative matters, internal promotions, external recruitment and terminations.
Any use of discretion by the committee during the financial year will be detailed in the relevant annual report on remuneration.
Performance measure selection Economic profit has been selected as the measure for the annual bonus plan, as it captures growth, returns and risk.
The use of a single measure provides simplicity and focus.
Economic profit is defined as operating profit after deducting the actual tax charge and a capital charge based on the weighted average cost of capital applied to the average capital employed.
The operating profit is the profit before any goodwill impairment, interest and tax.
Average capital employed is based on a 12 month average starting on 1 April, including cumulative goodwill but excluding net cash indebtedness.
At the sole discretion of the remuneration committee, exceptional items may be removed from operating profit where the inclusion of such items would be inconsistent with fair measurement, and actual tax may be adjusted to normalised rates if they are considered unsustainable.
Performance targets relating 36 PayPoint plc annual report 2014 Variable GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued to the annual bonus plan are set from the companys annual budget, which is reviewed and signed off by the companys board prior to the start of each financial year.
Relative TSR has been selected as the measure for the LTIP as it is considered the best measure of long-term performance for PayPoint, is directly aligned with shareholder interests and rewards management for outperformance of the companys peers.
The FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts is currently considered to be the most appropriate benchmark, being representative of PayPoints size and PayPoints lack of listed sector peers.
TSR is calculated using the three month average share price preceding the start and end of the performance period.
The target for economic profit applying to the annual bonus is set annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points.
The target is set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular strategic priorities and economic environment in a given year.
Remuneration policy for other employees PayPoints approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the group, with consideration given to the level of experience, responsibility, individual performance and salary levels in comparable companies.
All UK employees are eligible to participate in the companys SIP and senior managers participate in the annual bonus scheme with the same measure at the appropriate business level as is set for the executive directors at group level, but each with personal targets in addition.
Senior managers c. 25 individuals are eligible to participate in the LTIP.
Performance conditions are consistent for all participants, while award sizes vary by organisational level.
Shareholding guidelines The committee recognises the importance of executive directors aligning their interests with shareholders through building up a significant shareholding in the company.
Shareholding guidelines are in place, which require executive directors to acquire a holding, equivalent to at least 100% of their salaries.
Executive directors are required to retain 50% of any LTIP and deferred bonus shares acquired on vesting net of tax until the guideline level is achieved.
Acquired holdings may be held by spouses or dependent family members.
Non-executive director remuneration The remuneration of the non-executive directors is within the limits set by the articles of association.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus plan or share incentive programme operated by the company and are not entitled to pension contributions or other benefits provided by the company.
Details of the policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below: Element and link Operation Opportunity Performance to strategy metrics Fees Fee levels are reviewed annually, with any Non-executive director fee increases are Continued To attract and retain adjustments effective 1 April in the year applied in line with the outcome of the strong and non-executive following review.

PayPoint plc annual report 2014 37 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued Pay scenario charts The charts below provide an illustration of the potential future reward opportunities for the executive directors, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: minimum, target and maximum.
Potential reward opportunities are based on PayPoints remuneration policy, applied to base salaries as at 1 April 2014.
For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for the year ending 31 March 2015.
For the LTIP, the award opportunities are based on those LTIP awards that are expected to be granted in June 2015.
Note that LTIP awards granted in the year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value is based on the face value at award rather than vesting i. e. the scenarios exclude the impact of any share price movement over the period.

Where new appointees have initial basic salaries set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period of two to three years subject to the individuals development in the role.
Pension New appointees will receive contributions to personal pension plans in line with existing policy.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with existing policy.
SIP New appointees will be eligible to participate in the SIP in line with existing policy.
Annual bonus The structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant 150% of salary maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year.
Targets for the personal objectives element will be tailored to the executive.
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other 300% of salary executives, as described in the policy table.
The normal limit of 200% of salary will apply, save in exceptional circumstances when awards of up to 300% of salary may be made.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the remuneration committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both PayPoint and its shareholders.
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, the committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a different structure in order to facilitate the recruitment of an individual, exercising the discretion available under the relevant Listing Rule LR 9.4.
2 R to replace incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Such buyout awards would have a fair value no higher than that of the awards forfeited.
In doing so, the committee will consider relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
Internal appointment In cases of appointing a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the remuneration committee and board will be consistent with the policy for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the board, the company will continue to honour these arrangements.
Non-executive directors In recruiting a new non-executive director, the remuneration committee will utilise the policy as set out in the table on page 37.
Service contracts and exit policy Executive directors Executive director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the committee.
In accordance with general market practice, each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract requiring 12 months notice of termination on either side.
Executive director service contracts are available to view at the companys registered office.
Details of the service contracts of the executive directors of the company are as follows: Name Company notice period Contract date Dominic Taylor 12 months 13 September 2004 George Earle 12 months 30 September 2004 Tim Watkin-Rees 12 months 13 September 2004 There are no special provisions in service contracts relating to cessation of employment or change of control.
The policy on termination is that the company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations and executive directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
In addition, the remuneration committee ensures that there are no unjustified payments for failure.
Under normal circumstances, executive directors may receive termination payments in lieu of notice equal to pay and benefits for the length of their contractual notice period.
PayPoint plc annual report 2014 39 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued When considering exit payments, the committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and participants.
The table below summarises how the awards under the annual bonus and LTIP are typically treated in specific circumstances.
Whilst the committee retains overall discretion on determining good leaver status, it typically defines a good leaver in circumstances such as death, ill health, injury or disability, retirement with the companys consent, redundancy or any other reason that the committee determines.
Bad leavers include those leaving employment due to resignation or misconduct, and retirement without agreement of the company.
Final treatment is subject to the committees discretion: Event Timing vesting of award Calculation of vesting payment Annual bonus Good leaver Paid at the same time as continuing employees Eligible for an award to the extent that performance targets are satisfied and the award is pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year served Bad leaver No annual bonus payable Not applicable Change of control Paid immediately on the effective date of change Eligible for an award to the extent that of control performance targets are satisfied up to the change of control and the award is pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year served to the effective date of change of control DABS Good leaver Continue until the normal vesting date.
In the Outstanding awards vest on a time pro-rated basis event of death of a participant, the award would to reflect the length of the vesting period served vest immediately unless the board decides otherwise Bad leaver Outstanding awards lapse Not applicable Change of control Paid immediately on the effective date of change Eligible for an award pro-rated for the proportion of control of the financial year served to the effective date of change of control LTIP Good leaver Continue until the normal vesting date or vest Outstanding awards vest to the extent the immediately, at the discretion of the committee.
performance conditions are satisfied and the awards are pro-rated to reflect the length of the vesting period served unless the board decides otherwise Bad leaver Outstanding awards lapse Not applicable Change of control Vest immediately on the effective date of change Outstanding awards vest subject to the satisfaction of control of performance conditions as at the effective date of change of control, and the award is pro-rated for the proportion of the vesting period served to the effective date of change of control unless the board decides otherwise Outstanding matching awards under the 2009 DSB Plan will be treated in the same way as awards under the LTIP.
Mandatorily deferred and voluntarily invested shares under this plan are simply held on trust for participants and therefore would be released immediately on cessation or a change of control.
Non-executive directors The non-executive directors do not have service contracts: rather, they have letters of appointment which are subject to a three year term.
Details of the terms of appointment of the non-executive directors are set out in the table below: Name Date of letter Unexpired term as at Date of appointment Notice period 31 March 2014 David Morrison 24 July 2013 846 days 10 August 2004 1 month David Newlands 24 July 2013 846 days 10 August 2004 1 month Andrew Robb 24 July 2013 846 days 10 August 2004 1 month Eric Anstee 24 July 2013 846 days 16 September 2008 1 month Stephen Rowley 24 July 2013 846 days 16 September 2008 1 month Nick Wiles 24 July 2013 846 days 22 October 2009 1 month Warren Tucker 5 February 2014 1,042 days 5 February 2014 3 months Under the companys articles of association, all directors are required to submit themselves for re-election every three years.
However, in order to comply with the Code and as reported last year, all directors will be subject to annual re-election.
Non-executive directors letters of appointment are available to view at the companys registered office.
40 PayPoint plc annual report 2014 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the company When making decisions on executive director remuneration, the committee considers pay and conditions across PayPoint.
In particular, it is anticipated that salary increases for senior executives will have regard to those of salaried employees as a whole.
Employee engagement surveys are carried out annually across the group, with questions which seek the employees views on these matters.
Participation in these surveys is generally in excess of 80% of all employees.
Consideration of shareholder views The remuneration committee maintains a regular dialogue with its major shareholders and when determining remuneration, takes into account the guidelines of investor bodies and shareholder views.
The committee continues to monitor trends and developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the structure of the executive remuneration remains appropriate and commits to undergo a shareholder consultation in advance of any material changes to remuneration policy.
This report covers the remuneration of all directors that served during the period.
This report has been approved by the remuneration committee.
Andrew Robb Chairman, remuneration committee 29 May 2014 PayPoint plc annual report 2014 41 GOVERNANCE STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law, the directors are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements under IFRS as adopted by the EU.
Under company law, the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors: properly select and apply accounting policies: present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information: provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entitys financial position and financial performance: and make an assessment of the companys ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and, hence, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the companys website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole: the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face: and the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the companys performance, business model and strategy.
Approved by the board of directors and signed on behalf of the board.
Dominic Taylor Chief Executive 29 May 2014 42 PayPoint plc annual report 2014 GOVERNANCE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF PAYPOINT PLC Opinion on financial statements of PayPoint plc In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the groups and of the parent companys affairs as at 31 March 2014 and of the groups profit for the year then ended: the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union: the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006: and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and parent company statements of financial position, the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity, the consolidated and parent cash flow statements and the related notes 1 to 29.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRS as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern As required by the Listing Rules, we have reviewed the directors statement contained within the directors report on page 23 that the group is a going concern.
We confirm that: we have concluded that the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate: and we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the groups ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team: Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk The assessment of carrying We assessed the assumptions used in the impairment model for goodwill and other noncurrent assets, described in note 10, specifically including the cash flow projections, discount value of goodwill and other rates, perpetuity growth rates and the sensitivities applied.

For transaction-based revenue streams, we performed testing over the relevant computer systems and the operating effectiveness of the controls, as well as substantive audit procedures.
Taxation We tested the appropriateness of the assumptions and estimates in relation to the The recognition of deferred tax, in likelihood of generating future taxable profits to support the recognition of deferred particular on carried forward tax tax assets as described in note 14 to the financial statements.
We considered those losses and share-based payments, assumptions and supporting forecasts and estimates as well as the appropriateness of the requires management judgment.
We worked with our tax audit specialists in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets and to appraise the likely outcome of technical tax treatments, including the review of correspondence with the revenue authorities to assess the reasonableness of the provisions made.
The audit committees consideration of these risks is set out on page 19.
PayPoint plc annual report 2014 43 GOVERNANCE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF PAYPOINT PLC continued Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures.
Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be 2.3 million, which is below 5% of pre-tax profit and below 3% of equity.
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences in excess of 50,000, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We also report to the audit committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit Our group audit scope focused primarily on eleven entities.
Ten of these were subject to a full audit.
This includes PayPoint Romania, where a full scope audit was performed on the statutory year ended 31 December 2013, with review procedures then performed on the three month period to 31 March 2014.
The remaining one entity was subject to audit procedures on specified account balances.
The extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the groups business operations at those locations.
These eleven entities represent the principal business units within the group and account for 99% of the groups net assets, 99% of the groups revenue and 99% of the groups profit before tax.
They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above.
Our audit work on the eleven entities was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than group materiality.
At the parent entity level, we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit procedures on specified account balances.
The group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the audit team visits each of the locations where the group audit scope was focused every year.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion: the part of the directors remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006: and the information given in the strategic report and the directors report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

This report is made solely to the companys members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the groups and the parent companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect, based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, we consider the implications for our report.
