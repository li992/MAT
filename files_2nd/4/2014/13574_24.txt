James Guyette was paid in US dollars translated at 1 US$1.6477 2013 US$1.565.
b Benefits taxable value of all benefits paid in the year.
The benefits for the Non-Executive Directors relate to travel and subsistence associated with attending board meetings.
Group profit and cash performance were below the base level targets set by the committee and therefore no bonus was awarded for 2014. d L ong-term incentive plan LTIP.
This is the estimated value of the PSP shares that are due to vest in March 2015 2014 being the final year of the performance period and for John Rishton, as well as his PSP shares, the performance related shares he received on joining the Company.
It is based on the number of shares that will vest multiplied by theaverage share price of 863.65p over the quarter ending 31 December 2014 as the vesting price is not known at the date of approval of the Directors Remuneration Report.
The performance against targets for 2014 has been determined for these awards as detailed on page 79 and 67% of the original award, which includes the TSR kicker, will vest.
The LTIP amounts for 2013 relating to shares that vested in 2014 have been recalculated using the vesting price of 1015.81p per share.
The original calculation used a share price of 1184.52p per share, as the vesting price was not known at the time.
e Value of the gain made on the exercise of ShareSave options is the difference between the exercise price of 387p and the mid-market price of 1062p on the date of exercise relating to the ShareSave option exercised in 2013. f Pensions.
For defined benefit plans, this is the increase in pension benefit net of inflation for the current year and applying the HMRC methodology multiplier of 20.
Cash in lieu of pension accrual is also included.
David Smith opted not to join the UK defined contribution pension scheme and receives a cash allowance.
The pension figure shown in the single figure table is his benefits accrued from 4 November 2014.
BASE SALARY The committee has reviewed the salary levels of Executive Directors and the result of the review is shown below.
Executive Directors did not receive an increase in 2014 and there will be no increase to the salaries for John Rishton and James Guyette in 2015.
David Smiths increase reflects that his salary on appointment was positioned to allow scope for progression in the role.
The increase for Colin Smith reflects the importance of the role to the business, along with the current modest positioning compared to the external market range.

ANNUAL BONUS The annual bonus pool is delivered under the Annual Performance Related Award plan APRA and in 2014, Executive Directors were eligible for award levels detailed in the remuneration policy.
APRA 2014 PERFORMANCE MEASURES The APRA bonus is determined by Group financial performance and personal performance and for 2014, the Group financial measures were cash flow performance and profit.
Levels for both measures were set as follows: Profit element % Cash element % % of maximum bonus Base 15 15 30 Target 30 30 60 Maximum 50 50 100 The Group financial performance is the addition of the cash and profit out-turns, provided a specified minimum level is achieved on both, after deduction of the cost of bonus from profit, otherwise no bonus is payable.
77 Directors Report DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The 2014 financial performance resulted in no APRA bonus out-turn: Group underlying profit Group underlying profit was 1,649 million which was below the base level of 1,800million and therefore no bonus was payable for 2014.
Cash flow Cash flow for the year was an outflow of 232 million which was below the hurdle of zero inflow outflow which was required to activate any bonus payments.
Overall award No bonus is payable for 2014.
Group underlying profit and cash flow, after deduction of the cost of bonus, and excludes the impact of acquisitions and disposals in the year and unbudgeted foreign exchange translation effects where material.
The extent of this disclosure reflects the Boards view that APRA profit and cash targets are commercially sensitive and this will be kept under review.
DEFERRED APRA AWARDS IN MARCH 2014 SUBJECT TO AUDIT Executive Directors receive 40% of any annual bonus in deferred shares.
For 2013 APRA, the following deferred share awards were made in March 2014.

APRA 2015 The committee has determined that the bonus in respect of 2015 will be operated on similar terms to 2014.
There will be no change to the maximum bonus opportunities for Executive Directors.

PSP 2014 AWARD TARGETS SUBJECT TO AUDIT The targets were as follows and straight line vesting will apply between these points.
Aggregate cash flow per share CPS over the three-year period % of maximum award released Less than 125p 0% 125p 30% 155p 100% PSP AWARDS MADE IN MARCH 2014 In 2014, Executive Directors received PSP grants in line with the remuneration policy as follows: Face value at Minimum Number maximum % vesting Performance of shares % of vesting as a % of period awarded salary 000 maximum end date John Rishton 112,768 120 1,665 20 31 12 2016 James Guyette 51,770 100 764 20 31 12 2016 Mark Morris 51,812 100 765 20 n a Colin Smith CBE 53,336 100 788 20 31 12 2016 Mark Morris forfeited the above award when he left the Company on 4 November 2014.
All awards are made as performance shares based on a percentage of salary and the value is divided by the average share price over a three-day period which was 984.33p before to the date of grant.
The face value is the maximum number of shares that would vest 150% of the award multiplied by the share price at the date of grant.
If the EPS or base CPS targets are not achieved, no shares vest.
PSP AWARDS VESTING IN MARCH 2015 The following sets out details in respect of the March 2012 PSP award, for which the final year of performance was the 2014 financial year.
Targets for 2012 2014 period Performance against targets EPS growth hurdle Awards may vest if EPS growth exceeds the OECD index EPS growth of 16% over the three-year period of consumer prices.

PSP AWARDS TO BE MADE IN MARCH 2015 The performance targets in respect of the 2015 to 2017 performance period under the aggregate CPS measure will beasfollows: Aggregate CPS over the three-year period % of maximum award released Less than 60p 0% 60p 30% 100p 100% CPS is calculated as reported cash flow before the cost of business acquisitions or proceeds of disposals, foreign exchange translation effects, special payments into pension schemes and payments to shareholders, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue.
CPS is cumulative over a three-year period.
79 Directors Report DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED We believe that the combination of EPS, CPS and TSR targets are challenging and that the performance necessary to achieve awards towards the upper end of the range is stretching.
They should not, therefore, be interpreted as providing guidance on the Groups performance over the relevant period.

Theyinclude both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
Normal retirement age for the defined benefit schemes is 62.
John Rishton is a member of one of the Groups UK defined contribution pension schemes and received employer contributions restricted to the annual allowance limits with any excess paid as a cash allowance.

SHARE RETENTION POLICY SUBJECT TO AUDIT We believe it is important that the interests of the Executive Directors should be closely aligned with those of shareholders.
The deferred APRA award and the PSP provide considerable alignment.
However, participants in the PSP are also required to retain at least one half of the number of after-tax shares released from the PSP, until the value of their shareholding reaches the percentage of salary shown in the table below.
When this level is reached it must be maintained until retirement or departure from the Group.
The Executive Directors total shareholding, for the purposes of comparing it with the minimum shareholding requirement, includes shares held: by their connected persons: in the SIP: and PSP shares that have vested, but does not include unvested PSP awards.
The shareholding requirement increased in 2014 to 250% of salary for the Chief Executive and 200%of salary for the other Executive Directors.
APRA deferred shares do not count towards their minimum shareholding requirement.
Except for David Smith, who was appointed on 4 November 2014, and has not had an opportunity to build up his shareholding, the Executive Directors each complied with the 2014 minimum shareholding requirement as detailed in the table below.

The share price has increased from 483.50p at the time this grant was made to 870p at the end of 2014.
These are the main reasons why John Rishtons remuneration in 2012 and 2013 exceeds that of his predecessor.
