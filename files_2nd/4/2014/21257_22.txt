Directors Remuneration Report Annual statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee However, Mr Gilauri suggested that his actual bonus should be notably less.
The reasoning underlying his proposal is that 2015 may be considerably more difficult than last year, so as a demonstration to the Group of the need for cost discipline, Mr Gilauri felt that he and the group of senior officers he leads should take the lead by advocating a lower discretionary bonus.
His suggestion, which was fully endorsed by the senior officers, makes us yet more confident that our compensation structure the large majority of pay to the Groups key management coming in the form of long-vesting shares is the right one: these executives are aligned and keen to work in the best interests of the Company rather than their short-term gain.
As a Committee and Board we applauded Mr Gilauris proposal and backed it with enthusiasm: bonuses need to be not only about backward-looking results but also about the Groups prospects and the overall context in which it is operating Al Breach and senior management taking responsibility for that context.
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Ultimately, the Committee determined to award Mr Gilauri discretionary compensation of 25,000 shares, representing 27% of total salary and 55% of his maximum opportunity.
As mentioned last year, the Committee will review both the number of salary shares Mr Gilauri receives and the maximum discretionary compensation in relation to those shares for Mr Gilauri in 2016 when his contract expires.
In the meantime we are convinced that the combination of the substantial number of deferred salary shares and the potential to earn Our most important decision in implementing the Remuneration discretionary shares of a significant value keeps Mr Gilauri Policy this year was the approval of the discretionary highly motivated and aligned with shareholders.

Directors remuneration 3.1 Single total figure of remuneration for the sole Executive Director audited The table below sets out the remuneration received by BGHs sole Executive Director, Irakli Gilauri, for 2014 and 2013 in respect of his employment with BGH and the Bank.
Mr Gilauris February 2013 contract provides for cash and deferred share salary compensation fixed at 2013 levels.
In addition, Mr Gilauri is entitled to discretionary deferred share compensation up to a maximum of 50% of total salary including both the cash and deferred salary components.
This figure was agreed in connection with the increase in the absolute market value of Mr Giauris fixed compensation cash and deferred share salary in 2013.
The overall compensation arrangements with Mr Gilauri will be reviewed again in 2016.
Over 83% of Mr Gilauris compensation for 2014 as set forth in the table below is in the form of deferred shares for which the average vesting period exceeds three years.

The discretionary compensation in respect of the relevant years is deferred and vests as to 50% in January of the year following work year and 50% in January of the next year, subject to the leaver provisions described in section 8 of the Directors Remuneration Policy on page 98 of this Annual Report.
The means of determining the number of shares underlying this compensation and the terms and conditions are described in section 1 b of the Directors Remuneration Policy on page 96 of this Annual Report.

88 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC | Annual Report 2014 Strategic report Strategic report Strategic report Governance Financial Additional Overview Strategy Performance statements information 3.2 Basis for determining Mr Gilauris discretionary deferred share compensation in respect of 2014 Mr Gilauris KPIs include both objective and non-tangible components.
The objective elements largely track the Groups KPIs as he is expected to deliver on the Groups strategy, but the KPIs also include non-tangible factors such as leadership, strategy development and implementation as well as corporate and social responsibility.
The following table sets out the objective KPIs set for Mr Gilauri in respect of 2014 as well as Mr Gilauris performance against them.
Key performance measure 2014 target 2014 performance Committee evaluation Return on Average c. 20.0% 19.0% Substantially met Equity ROAE Net loan book growth c. 20.0% 23.8% Met Client deposit growth c. 20.0% 6.6% The KPI as written was not met.
The target became irrelevant as corporate deposits were intentionally reduced during the year.
Targets on attractive deposits were met, with a 24.2% and 18.5% growth increase in Retail Banking and Investment Management deposits, respectively.
Tier I Capital c. 20.0% 22.1% Met Adequacy ratio Operating leverage Positive -4.1% This KPI was not met.
This became impossible due to the Boards decision to significantly expand our healthcare business through strategic acquisitions of healthcare facilities in which the cost savings could not be fully realised during the year.
Operating leverage at the Bank on a stand-alone basis was flat.
Cost to Income ratio Continued improvement 42.8% in 2014 compared to 41.2% in 2013 Same comment as for operating leverage.
Net loans to customer 100% 110.6% This KPI was not met, but the Board is funds and DFIs comfortable at this level and net interest income improved as a result of the reduction in excess liquidity.
Net Interest Margin 7.0-7.5% 7.4% Met Cost of Risk 1.5% 1.2% Met Cost of Funding Decrease Decline from 5.9% in 2013 to 4.9% in 2014 Met Express Banking Delivery on strategy A nearly 40% increase in Express Banking Met roll-out customers and doubling of the number of Express Pay terminals, exceeding expectations Revenue diversification Delivery on healthcare, 13.6% increase in net non-interest income, with Met and growth investment management Healthcare, Investment Management and Real and real estate strategy Estate revenue both increasing substantially in 2014 Dividend per share Increase Increase from GEL 2.0 per share in respect of Met 2013 to GEL 2.1 per share in respect of 2014 In terms of objective KPIs, 10 of 13 objective KPIs set for Mr Gilauri were fully or substantially met, and for the each of the three that were not fully met, this was the result of business and strategic decisions taken by the Board during the year.
In terms of non-tangible factors, the Committee considered Mr Gilauris performance particularly strong.
Most notably, he developed for consideration and adoption by the Board the re-formulated strategy announced by the Board in November 2014, and subsequently began implementing that strategy with the successful completion of the capital raising and negotiation and execution of the acquisitions of Privatbank Georgia and Georgian Global Utilities which closed at the beginning of this year.
In addition, the Committee was impressed by Mr Gilauris achievement in pursuing the Groups ambitious social and environmental responsibility agenda, which is described on pages 24 to 31 of this Annual Report.
For 2014 overall, the Committee found that Mr Gilauris performance was excellent.
He met or exceeded most of his KPIs as outlined above.
In the end, the Committee determined that Mr Gilauri should be awarded discretionary deferred share compensation of 25,000 shares the same as last year, which was also a year of excellent performance.
However, with the share price having declined from last years level, the value of the award, at US$654,250, is lower.
It equates to 54.7% of his maximum opportunity.
Our reasons for this reduction in the discretionary compensation value are explained in the Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
As described in our Policy, we do not utilise a strict weighting of performance measures.
Annual Report 2014 | Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC 89 Directors Remuneration Report continued For 2015, we plan to measure Mr Gilauris performance against KPIs which reflect the separation of our banking and investment businesses as well as the strategy of the Group as a whole as outlined below.
Retail loan book growth of 20%.
Delivering on investment business strategy.
Effective oversight of investment companies.
Group-wide Implementation of the new Group management structure.
Coaching and mentoring of the management team.

In 2014, Mr Gilauri exercised options in respect of 116,000 BGH shares and acquired 7,500 BGH shares.
As at the date of this Annual Report, Mr Gilauris shareholding was as follows: 279,131 BGH shares held directly and 289,500 unvested and unexercised BGH shares held under option, resulting in a total number of interests in BGH shares of 568,631, representing 1.44% of the share capital of BGH.
At year-end 2014, NeilCo Ltd, a company wholly-owned by Mr Janin, held 10,000 BGH Shares.
At year-end 2014, Gemsstock Growth Fund, which Mr Breach manages, held 20,000 BGH Shares.
The Groups Policy is heavily weighted towards remuneration in deferred salary shares and discretionary compensation in deferred shares.
The long vesting periods, particularly, for deferred salary shares five years, result in executive management having large holdings of unvested shares.
Accordingly, the Group does not apply a shareholding guideline or impose a holding period on Mr Gilauris or executive managements shares.
The Policy naturally results in our executives holding a significant number of unvested shares and achieves a delay between performance and vesting.
We believe these results are consistent with the principles of the Investment Management Association.
As reflected in the table above, Mr Gilauri held 279,131 vested shares and 289,500 unvested shares as at the date of this Annual Report.
The vesting period for the majority of unvested shares exceeds four years.
None of Mr Gilauris connected persons have interests in any BGH shares.
The Group does not require Non-Executive Directors to hold a specified number of shares in BGH.
Notwithstanding this, some Non-Executive Directors have chosen to become shareholders.
92 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC | Annual Report 2014 Strategic report Strategic report Strategic report Governance Financial Additional Overview Strategy Performance statements information 3.9 Details of Non-Executive Directors terms of appointment Letters of appointment are entered into by BGH with each Non-Executive Director, generally for three-year terms.
The letters of appointment require Non-Executive Directors to provide one-month notice prior to termination.
New BGH letters of appointment for each Non-Executive Director were signed on 10 April 2014, with each Non-Executive Director subject to annual re-election at the AGM.
A succession plan adopted by the Board provides for a tenure of six years on the BGH and Bank Supervisory Boards.
If the Board determines that, in order to maintain the balance of appropriate skills and experience required for the Board, it is important to retain a Director on the Board beyond the relevant six-year period, the Board may offer the Director a letter of appointment for an additional one-year term.
Such a one-year re-appointment may be renewed no more than two times, with the effect that the usual six-year tenure may be extended to a maximum of nine years if circumstances were to warrant such extension.
The table below shows each Non-Executive Directors original date of appointment to the Board of BGH and the Supervisory Board of the Bank and the tenure of each individual at the Bank and BGH.

Neil Janin, David Morrison and Kaha Kiknavelidze have been offered extended letters of appointment in respect of their roles as members of the Supervisory Board of the Bank as their skills and experience continue to enhance the effectiveness of the Supervisory Board and their continued appointments are deemed to be in the best interests of the Bank.
Senior officer remuneration In addition to the CEO of BGH and the Bank, in 2014, there were seven senior officers.
These individuals include the Banks Deputy CEOs responsible for the following directions: Finance, Retail Banking, Corporate Banking, Investment Management, Legal and Affordable Housing, as well as the CEO of Georgia Healthcare Group.
Key information regarding remuneration for senior officers is disclosed below in the interest of transparency, but the remuneration of senior officers is not subject to the Regulations or to the Directors Remuneration Policy.
The principles and remuneration structure described in the Directors Remuneration Policy are currently applied in broadly the same way to senior officers.
This means that, as for Mr Gilauri, senior officers receive remuneration based on two components: salary, which includes both a modest cash sum and deferred share compensation which vests over a five-year period: and a discretionary award, payable 100% in deferred share compensation vesting over a two-year period, which is dependent on both Group performance and the executive achieving his KPIs.
