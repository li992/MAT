Brian Bickells salary was reduced by 38,000 reflecting one month of unpaid leave taken during the year.
At the 2013 A GM, Jonathan Lane retired as executive Deputy Chairman and was appointed non-executive Chairman.
His remuneration in respect of his role as Deputy Chairman is shown above and as Chairman is shown in the single figure for non-executive directors below.
Benefits comprise car benefit, permanent health insurance, life insurance and health insurance.
Pension contribution is 25% of salary and may be taken in cash in part or entirely.
The cash equivalent is reduced by any resultant tax liability borne by the Group 5.
P ayment for performance during the year ie annual bonus.
For 2014, the executive directors received bonuses of 93.75% of salary in shares or 75% of salary in cash.
Each director has elected to take their 2014 bonus entirely in shares.
No further performance criteria apply.
Multipl e year variable is the vesting of shares in the LTIP.
50% of LTIP awards granted in December 2011 will vest on 7 December 2014 and 17 January 2015.
The TSR performance condition for the three year performance period was not met whilst NAV performance was met and resulted in full vesting of the 50% element of the award.
The value of these awards has been calculated by multiplying the number of shares that will vest by the 3-month average share price to 30 September 2014 of 6.75.
The 2013 estimated figure has been restated to reflect actual share price at the date of vesting.
Awards vesting for Jonathan Lane in 2013 and 2014 were pro-rata according to the time he was an executive director.
This includes shar esave options which have been valued based on the monthly savings amount and the discount provided of 20%.
It also includes any dividend equivalents to be paid in respect of LTIP shares due to vest on 7 December 2014 and 17 January 2015 and dividend equivalents paid on the Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme which vested on 17 December 2013.
#070 annual remuneration report continued goverNaNce Annual bonus achievements for year ended 30 September 2014 Retrospective disclosure of the extent to which the targets for the 2014 annual bonus have been met is provided below.
The bonus will be paid in December 2014 and is included in the single figure remuneration.
The Group is a long-term business and looks to maintain a consistent approach to target setting for both annual and long-term incentives.
The Committee is mindful that annual incentive payouts should fairly reflect performance in the round.
The formulaic outturn of quantitative targets is therefore considered in the context of factors such as the buoyancy of occupier demand in the wider West End market and progression against longerterm strategic goals, to determine whether the level of bonus is appropriate.

Christopher Ward received an increase of 9% recognising that when he joined the Company he received a lower salary as he was new to the role.
This reflects the policy on recruitment to manage any below market level salary on appointment with phased increases and is the final year where he has received a signficantly higher than average increase.
Each executive director will receive an award of nil cost options to the value of 125% of salary under the LTIP in December 2014 in respect of the performance period 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2017.
The performance measures will be as set out on page 74 and are the same targets used in each year since the plan was approved in 2006.
Disclosure of annual bonus targets for the year ending 30 September 2015 is deemed to be commercially sensitive and therefore the actual targets are not set out in this report, other than as contained in the remuneration policy.
Performance against all targets will be disclosed retrospectively, provided they are not commercially sensitive.
