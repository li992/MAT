108 GO VERNANCE Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2017 Performance measure selection and approach to target setting Annual bonus measures are selected to reflect the Companys short-term financial and non-financial priorities.
At its discretion, the Committee may vary these measures at the start of each financial year to maintain close alignment between executive incentives and the annual business plan.
The measures used in the Long-Term Incentive Plan are selected to reflect Smiths prevailing strategy and to reinforce the key drivers of value creation highlighted elsewhere in this Annual Report: operating margin, cash conversion and delivering sustainable return on capital.
Annual bonus and LTIP targets are reviewed annually, and take into account the Companys strategic plan, analyst forecasts for Smiths and its sector comparators and external expectations for Smiths key markets.
The Committee sets targets that it considers to be challenging but attainable and aligned to the Companys business objectives over the short term, as reflected in the annual business plan, and longer term, consistent with the strategic plan.
On top of aligning strategy with incentives, targets are designed to ensure that participants are aligned with the interests of shareholders.
Difference in policy between executive directors and other employees The reward policy for other senior employees is broadly consistent with that for executive directors, and the Company does not currently operate any incentive plans in which only executive directors participate.
The Committee reviews each year the all-employee pay and incentive trends and takes these into account in setting executive director pay levels.
The principles of remuneration packages being market related, performance sensitive and driven by business needs are applied at all levels and geographies in the Group.
Pay scenarios The graphs below provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunity for the CEO, and the potential mix between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Minimum, On-Target and Maximum.

The Committee may also make payments to cover reasonable expenses in recruitment and relocation, and any other miscellaneous expenses including but not limited to housing, tax and immigration support.
110 GO VERNANCE Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2017 Internal promotions In cases of appointing a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the policy will be consistent with that for external appointees, as detailed above.
Any commitments made prior to an individuals promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Company may, where appropriate, seek to revise an individuals existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors and prevailing market best practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director external or internal, including details of any exceptional payments, will be disclosed in the RNS notification made at the time of appointment and in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year in which the recruitment occurred.
Non-executive directors In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on page 110.
Service contracts The Companys policy is that executive directors are normally employed on terms which include a one-year rolling period of notice and provision for the payment of a predetermined sum in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances but excluding circumstances where the Company is entitled to dismiss without compensation.
In addition to payment of basic salary, pension allowance and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the one-year notice period, the predetermined sum would include annual bonus and share awards only in respect of the period they have served, payable following the end of the relevant performance period and subject to the normal performance conditions.
Existing service contracts or other applicable agreements are available for viewing at the Companys Registered Office.

Chairman and non-executive directors The Chairman and the non-executive directors serve the Company under letters of appointment and do not have contracts of service or contracts for services.
Except where appointed at a general meeting, directors stand for election by shareholders at the first AGM following appointment.

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2018 Base salary and benefits Salaries are reviewed but not necessarily increased annually and benchmarked against comparable roles at other FTSE 100 companies of similar market capitalisation, revenues and complexity.
Having considered a number of important factors including individuals performance and experience, the relative performance of the Company and the remuneration policy within the Company, the Committee has determined the following annualised salaries for executive directors for 2018: Executive director 2016 17 2017 18 Andy Reynolds Smith 780,000 800,000 Bill Seeger was appointed Chief Financial Officer on an interim basis on 19 May 2017 after it was announced that Chris OShea would be stepping down.
In this role, Bill Seeger is paid a monthly salary of 83,333.
Bill Seeger does not receive any pension contribution or allowance in lieu, and he is not eligible to participate in the annual bonus or the LTIP.
Pension and benefits Andy Reynolds Smith will continue to receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension of 25% of his base salary and Chris OShea will also continue to do so until he leaves the Company on 18 November 2017.
The executive directors do not have a prospective entitlement to a defined benefit pension.
Annual bonus For 2018, Andy Reynolds Smith will continue to have a maximum bonus opportunity of 180% of salary.
Annual bonus measures and their weightings will remain unchanged from 2017.
33% of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares for three years.
Specific targets cannot be disclosed at this time due to the commercially sensitive nature of these objectives, but they will be disclosed at such a time as the Committee deems them to no longer affect the commerciality of the Company, likely to be within two years of the end of the performance period.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The LTIP is a conventional share plan under which an award over a capped number of shares will vest if demanding performance conditions are met.
LTIP awards of conditional shares are granted to selected senior executives including the executive directors with face values of up to 400% of salary.
Under the LTIP, the normal annual grants are 300% of salary for the Chief Executive and 250% of salary for the Finance Director.
The LTIP award granted to Andy Reynolds Smith in 2017 18 at the normal annual grant level of 300% of salary will vest on the achievement of the following performance conditions: Maximum performance Threshold target full performance vesting of Performance measure Weighting target element 3-year EPS growth 35% 3% p. a.
3-year average return on capital employed 35% 15% 18% 3-year average annual cash conversion 30% 90% 105% This represents no change to the LTIP for the 2017 18 cycle.
The Committee believes that the current structure provides an appropriate balance between earnings growth, returns and cash.
The Committee recognises that this balance of Groups performance measures remains very important for many of our largest shareholders.
As previously stated, the scorecard will be reviewed at the start of each future LTIP cycle to ensure it continues to reflect the Groups strategic priorities.
For performance between threshold and maximum, awards vest on a straight-line sliding scale.
