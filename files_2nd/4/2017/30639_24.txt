These LTIP awards are vesting at 66.3 per cent, as detailed in the table below.
This reflects the Groups strong performance over the three financial years ended 31 December 2017, balanced against uncertainty in the economic and political environment.
In particular, this has impacted negatively on absolute share price performance, resulting in no vesting for the Total Shareholder Return component.
Executive Directors are required to retain any vested shares for a further two years after vesting.
