and implications for remuneration In light of the Groups performance, the stretching annual bonus targets set for the year were not achieved, resulting in a 2017 bonus payout significantly below target.
In addition, our investors expect companies to demonstrate restraint on executive pay when it is appropriate to do so: accordingly, Executive Directors will receive no salary increase, the Committee exercised its discretion to reduce the payout of the personal element of the annual bonus for the CEO, and the CEOs LTIP allocation under the 2018 award will be reduced.
In the same spirit members of the senior management team entitled to receive LTIP allocations will also receive reduced awards.
The Committee recognises the importance of close alignment of remuneration with Group performance, and has kept under review the design of the Remuneration Policy.
We believe that the remuneration outcomes for 2017 appropriately demonstrate this link, and that the remuneration framework in place remains fit-for-purpose for 2018.

As disclosed in the Annual Statement at the start of this Remuneration Report, Executive Director salary levels will remain at these levels for the 2018 financial year, and will be reviewed again later in 2018 with any increases that may be determined and awarded in line with our Policy being effective 1 April 2019 : Director Role 2018 2017 Paul Moraviec CEO 670,000 670,000 Frank Schulkes CFO 430,000 430,000 Pension Both Executive Directors will continue to receive a cash allowance of 15% of base salary in lieu of a pension contribution.
Annual bonus For 2018, the CEO will continue to have a maximum bonus opportunity of 200% of salary, and the CFO will continue to have a maximum bonus opportunity of 150% of salary.
The on-target bonus opportunity remains 50% of maximum.
Two-thirds of any bonus earned will be paid in cash, with the remainder deferred into ConvaTec Group Plc shares for a further three-year period.
The annual bonus for 2018 will continue to be based on the following measures and weightings: Measure Weighting Organic revenue growth 40% 1 Adjusted EBIT 40% Personal strategic objectives 20% 1.
Excludes exceptional one-off items and the impact of portfolio changes occurring in the performance year.
The Committee will normally disclose the annual bonus targets retrospectively in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
In the event the Board considers these targets to remain commercially sensitive, they will be disclosed as soon as possible once they are no longer considered to be sensitive.
In line with our Policy, bonuses for the 2018 financial year will be subject to the Groups malus and clawback provisions see page 92 for further details.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The Executive Directors will receive conditional awards of shares under the ConvaTec LTIP in respect of 2018, with face values of 180% of salary for the CEO, and 175% of salary for the CFO.
In line with the commitment made to shareholders last year to introduce a returns measure alongside Relative TSR and EPS, the 2018 LTIP will vest after three years, subject to the following targets: Threshold Maximum Measure Weighting 25% vesting 100% vesting th Three-year Relative TSR One-third Median 90 percentile Three-year compound annualised growth in EPS One-third 5% p. a.
Three-year average Return on Invested Capital ROIC One-third 9.1% 11% Relative TSR will continue to be measured over a three-year period commencing 1 January 2018 compared to the following companies on the basis of TSR rank: Ambu, Beckton Dickinson, Coloplast, C R Bard, Fresenius, Getinge, GN Store Nord, Integra Lifesciences, Smith & Nephew, Stryker, Teleflex, William Demant and Zimmer Biomet.
TSR will be calculated in GBP and using three-month averaging.
EPS targets have been set at stretching levels taking into account both internal and external forecasts, and commensurate with the targets set for the Relative TSR element of the LTIP median to 90th percentile.
EPS performance shall be measured on a constant currency basis by reference to 2017 average rates.
The maximum vesting level is set to represent very stretching performance.
Going forward, the Committee considers it more appropriate to calibrate the EPS targets on a point-to-point basis, and express these in terms of compound annualised growth rates.
They are set to be no less challenging to achieve than the cumulative targets set for the 2017 LTIP cycle.
ConvaTec Group Plc 87 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Remuneration Committee report Annual Report on Remuneration continued In line with the commitment made following investor feedback last year, the Committee has introduced adjusted Return on Invested Capital ROIC as a third measure to 2018 LTIP awards.
Our definition of adjusted ROIC is: Adjusted Net Operating Profit after Tax NOPAT Adjusted ROIC Adjusted Invested Capital Where: Adjusted NOPAT Adjusted EBIT less tax at the adjusted effective tax rate.
Adjusted EBIT will be consistent with the definition previously published by the Company and excludes acquisition related amortisation expense.
It also excludes items identified as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual in nature that management believes are not indicative of the underlying performance of the consolidated Group.
Adjusted Invested Capital Net Assets excluding cash, debt and all amortisation related to the Companys historical acquisitions.
The impact of future acquisitions including intangibles assets, amortisation and goodwill will be captured in the calculations of both the numerator and denominator.
However the Remuneration Committee will review and consider adjusting for the impact of material mergers and acquisitions M&A activity on the Adjusted ROIC targets.
Any adjustment will be made on the basis of ensuring neutrality of the LTIP to this M&A.
Adjusted ROIC targets will be set and measured on a 3-year average basis for LTIP purposes.
Including ROIC provides an appropriate balance between growth and returns in the LTIP, helps align executive remuneration more closely with our stated strategic pillar of efficiency, and rewards the making of appropriate investments to grow.
ROIC targets have been set at stretching levels taking into account a range of reference points, and commensurate with the targets set for the Relative TSR and EPS elements of the LTIP median to 90th percentile.
The Committee retains discretion to adjust performance targets under the EPS and ROIC elements to appropriately reflect the impact of acquisitions and disposals occurring during the performance period, to ensure fairness to shareholders and participants.
The use of any such discretion would be detailed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
2018 LTIP awards will be subject to an additional post-vesting holding period.
To the extent an award vests subject to three-year performance, shares will be required to be held for a further two years i. e. until the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
In line with our policy, LTIP awards will also be subject to the Groups malus and clawback provisions.
Implementation of Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy for 2018 Non-Executive Director fees were set on Listing taking into account competitive practice for similar roles in other international MedTech companies and FTSE 100 companies of similar size.
The current fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors are set out below: Role Fee Chairman 400,000 Deputy Chairman basic fee 110,000 Non-Executive Director basic fee 60,000 Additional fees: Senior Independent Director 20,000 Chairman of the Audit Committee 22,000 Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 20,000 Membership of Board committees 12,000 Non-Executive Director fees will remain at these levels for 2018.

LTIP awards and Transition Awards will be subject to malus over the vesting period and clawback from the vesting date to the second anniversary of the relevant vesting date.
Share ownership guidelines The Committee recognises the importance of aligning Executive Directors and shareholders interests through significant shareholdings in the Group.
The Groups policy as published in the Prospectus was initially set to require Executive Directors to build up a shareholding worth 200% of their base salary, and to retain these shares until retirement from the Board of Directors.
However, the Committee has since decided to increase the share ownership guidelines in line with prevailing best practice to 400% of base salary for the CEO, and 300% of base salary for other Executive Directors.
50% of any net vested share awards after sales to meet tax liabilities must be retained until the minimum shareholding requirements are met.
The share ownership guidelines have been met by the Executive Directors see page 89.
Details of the Executive Directors current personal shareholdings are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Use of discretion The Committee may apply its discretion as set out below when agreeing remuneration outcomes, to help ensure that the implementation of our Remuneration Policy is consistent with the guiding principles for ConvaTec remuneration.
Payments from outstanding awards The Committee reserves the right in certain circumstances to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments where the terms of the payment were agreed: before the Policy came into effect: or at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Group provided, that in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not agreed in consideration of the individual becoming a Director of the Group.
For these purposes, payments include the satisfaction of variable remuneration awards previously granted, but not vested, to an individual.
Minor changes to Policy The Committee retains discretion to make minor, non-significant changes to the Policy set out above for reasons including, but not limited to, regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without reverting to shareholders for approval for that amendment, where seeking such shareholder approval would be disproportionate to the discretion being exercised.
LTIP awards The Committee may exercise its discretion as provided for in the LTIP rules approved by shareholders.
The Committee may also adjust the number of shares comprising an LTIP award or the exercise price if the award comprises options in the event of a variation of share capital, demerger, special dividend, distribution or any other corporate event which may affect the current or future value of an award.
It is intended that any adjustment will be made on a neutral basis, i. e. to not be to the benefit or detriment of participants.
Any use of discretion by the Committee during a financial year will be detailed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration and may be the subject of consultation with the Groups major shareholders, as appropriate.
ConvaTec Group Plc 92 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overview01 Strategic report04 Governance60 Financial statements102 Other information168 Remuneration Policy for the wider workforce The Remuneration Policy for other employees is based on principles that are broadly consistent with those applied to Executive Director remuneration, with a common objective of driving financial performance and the achievement of strategic objectives, and contributing to the long-term success of the Group.
Remuneration supports our ability to attract, motivate and retain skilled and dedicated individuals, whose contribution continues to be a key factor in the Groups success.
Annual salary reviews take into account Group performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in comparable companies.
Pension entitlements and other benefits vary according to jurisdiction, to ensure these remain appropriately competitive for the local market.
Employee ownership of ConvaTec Group Plc shares is promoted across the Group.
Some employees below executive level are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes: opportunities and performance measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individuals role.
Senior executives are eligible for LTIP awards on similar terms as the Executive Directors, although award opportunities are lower and vary by organisational level.
Other executives are eligible for restricted share awards on a discretionary basis.
ConvaTec also offers all employees the opportunity to participate in a share purchase plan, as approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
Approach to target setting and performance measure selection The Committee considers carefully the selection of performance measures at the start of each performance cycle, taking into consideration the Groups strategic objectives and the macroeconomic environment.
Annual bonus measures are selected to align with the Groups short-term KPIs.
Measures may change from year to year subject to the Remuneration Policy, and the rationale for any changes to the bonus measures selected will therefore be disclosed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
LTIP performance measures are selected to ensure they align with the Groups strategy and long-term shareholder value creation.
In line with the commitment made to shareholders last year, LTIP awards to be granted in 2018 will be based on a blend of EPS performance, relative Total Shareholder Return TSR and Return on Invested Capital ROIC as defined on page 88 over a three-year period.
The Committee considers these measures to align executive incentives to the Groups strategy and shareholder interests, and provide a good balance between external and internal measures of performance, and between growth and returns.
Targets are set to be stretching but achievable over the three-year performance period.
EPS and ROIC targets are set taking account of multiple relevant reference points, including internal forecasts, external expectations for future performance at both the Group and its closest sector peers, and for EPS typical EPS performance ranges at other FTSE companies of comparable size and complexity.
Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis The charts below provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Maximum, On-target and Minimum.
Potential reward opportunities are based on the forward-looking policy i. e. excluding Transition Awards, applied to 2018 base salaries and incentive opportunities.
Note that the LTIP awards granted in a year will not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value excludes the impact of share price movement or dividend accrual.
Pay scenarios Fixed remuneration Annual bonus LTIP CEO Paul Moraviec CFO Frank Schulkes Maximum, k Maximum, k On-target, k On-target, k Minimum k Minimum k The above charts are based on the following assumptions: Maximum: fixed remuneration salary, pension, other benefits, plus maximum b onus CEO: 200% of salary, CFO: 150% and full vesting of LTIP awards CEO: 180% of salary, CFO: 175%.

ConvaTec Group Plc 93 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Remuneration Committee report Remuneration Policy report continued Executive Director service contracts In accordance with general market practice, each of the Executive Directors has a rolling service contract.
Paul Moraviec and Frank Schulkes have service contracts with the Company.
Until he left the Company on 31 October 2017, Nigel Clerkin was employed under a service contract with ConvaTec Healthcare Ireland Limited and a separate appointment letter dated 30 September 2016 with the Company in relation to his appointment as a Director of the Company.
Nigel Clerkin received no compensation or benefits under this appointment letter in addition to those provided under his service contract.
The Executive Directors service contracts copies of which are available to view at the Groups registered office are each terminable on 12 months notice from the Group and six months notice from the Executive Director.
This practice will also apply for any new Executive Directors.
The following table shows the date of the service contract for each Executive Director that served during the year: Executive Director Position Date of appointment Date of service agreement 1 Paul Moraviec CEO 6 September 2016 12 October 2016 1 Nigel Clerkin CFO 30 September 2016 29 September 2016 Frank Schulkes CFO 1 November 2017 2 August 2017 1.
The service contracts for Paul Moraviec and Nigel Clerkin took effect on 31 October 2016.
Exit payments policy The Groups policy on termination payments is to consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant contractual terms in the executives service contract and the circumstances of termination.
Executive Directors contracts provide for the payment of a pre-determined sum in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances but excluding circumstances where the Group is entitled to dismiss without compensation, comprising base salary, pension allowance and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Termination payments may take the form of payments in lieu of notice.
Payments would normally be made on a phased basis and subject to mitigation.
If the employment is terminated by the Group, the Committee retains the discretion to settle any other amount the Committee considers reasonable to the Executive Director including in settlement of claims, in respect of legal fees incurred in connection with the termination and fees for outplacement services and relocation costs.
In addition to contractual provisions, the table below summarises how awards under each discretionary incentive plan are typically treated in specific circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the Committees discretion as provided under the rules of the plan.
In the event of termination, any outstanding options granted under the SAYE or equivalent scheme will be treated in accordance with the rules of the scheme, which do not include discretion.
Disclosure in relation to any departing Executive Director, including details of any remuneration payment made to him after he ceases to be a Director, will be made on the Companys website in accordance with Section 430 2B of the Companies Act 2006.

Approach to remuneration on recruitment External appointments In cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director from outside the Group, the Committee may make use of all existing components of remuneration set out in the Policy table, up to the disclosed maximum opportunities where applicable.
When determining the remuneration package for a new Executive Director, the Committee will take into account all relevant factors based on the circumstances at that time to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of the Group and its shareholders.
This may include factors such as the experience and skills of the individual, internal comparisons and relevant market data.
The Committee may also make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, i. e. over and above the maximum limits on incentive opportunities set out in the Policy table.
In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, and the time over which they would have vested.
The intention is that the expected value of any buy-out award would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements, and that the structure will replicate as far as reasonably possible that of the awards being forfeited.
The Committee may consider it appropriate to structure buy-out awards differently from the structure described in the Policy table, exercising its discretion under the LTIP rules to structure awards in other forms including market value options, restricted shares, forfeitable shares or phantom awards and the discretion available under UKLA Listing Rule 9.4.

Any commitments made prior to an individuals promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the Policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Group may, where appropriate, seek to revise an individuals existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other Executive Directors and good practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new Executive Director, including details of any buy-out awards, will be disclosed in the RNS notification made at the time of appointment and in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year in which recruitment occurred.
External appointments held by Executive Directors Executive Directors may accept up to one external appointment subject to approval by the Board, there being no conflicts of interest and the appointment not leading to deterioration in the individuals performance.

Details of external appointments and the associated fees received will be included in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
