2016 17 annual bonus plan outcome In determining the award for 2016 17, the Committee took into account the Companys financial performance and achievements against key short-term objectives established at the beginning of the year.
This involved establishing in advance what would constitute success for good, strong or outstanding performance.
The performance targets and performance are summarised below.
It is the Committees approach to view the performance in the round at the end of the year, taking into account extraneous events and changing priorities, where relevant.
The key success factors for the year were identified as continuing to increase the investment portfolio and to reduce the overall cost of borrowing.
For 2016 17 the maximum potential bonus awards were 100% of salary for Graham Roberts as CEO and 75% of salary for Jonathan Murphy and Andrew Darke.
Following Graham Roberts resignation due to ill-health in June 2016 no bonus was paid to him relating to 2016 17.

His financial targets were as above, overall being rated Strong.
His individual targets were to: develop a data analytic tool to financially appraise current and prospective tenants: deepen his understanding of the wider healthcare property market: sustain excellent communication with the Board: and deliver an operational efficiency and savings plan.
The Committee concluded that Jonathan had performed strongly on all these objectives.
It also noted that Jonathan assumed additional responsibility during the year following the resignation of Graham Roberts and was appointed Interim CEO on 1 October 2016, and confirmed as CEO on 27 February 2017.
As a result, the Committee decided to award Jonathan a bonus of 177,652 equating to 72.8% 93.2% of maximum bonus of his total salary excluding the salary supplement paid to him while acting as Interim CEO.
The Committee also considered the performance of Andrew Darke.
His financial targets were as above, overall being ratedStrong.
His individual targets were to: strengthen and develop the property team: deepen his understanding of the wider healthcare property market: sustain excellent business performance communication with the Board: and continue to enhance the GP property market database.
The Committee concluded that Andrew had performed strongly on these objectives.
As a result the Committee decided toaward Andrew a bonus of 144,100, equivalent to 65.5% 87.3% of maximum bonus of annual base salary.
Up to 50% of any bonus earned by an Executive Director must be deferred into shares for two years to the extent that the Executive Director does not already hold shares worth at least 300% of salary.
While Andrew Darke holds the requisite number of shares, Jonathan Murphy does not, resulting in a portion of his bonus being deferred.
com 59 Total pension entitlements No Executive Director or any member of staff is entitled to a defined benefit pension arrangement.
Graham Roberts, Jonathan Murphy and Andrew Darke received payments in lieu of pension contributions equivalent to 20.0%, 13.5% and 13.5% of salary respectively for 2016 17.
Vesting of long-term incentive awards audited Value Creation Plan As reported previously, to take account of three significant capital raising events, certain adjustments were made to the VCP pay-out algorithm to ensure the potential VCP benefit created at each Measurement Date was: Attributable to managements performance achievement of the VCP performance conditions i. e. an 8% p. a. return to shareholders must be achieved before any value is created for participants : and Aligned with the value created for shareholders during the relevant measurement period.
More particularly, the Committee amended the Threshold Price applicable to the first Measurement Date i. e. 20 August 2015 whereby, for each capital raising event to be known as Tranches, a Threshold Price was set which must be exceeded before any value could be earned by participants.
The paragraphs below summarise the alterations.
The Threshold Price applicable to each Tranche of shares at the first Measurement Date was set as follows: Original New Threshold Threshold Shares Price Price Tranche m pence pence Share capital at the start of the VCP 1 529.5 39.37 39.37 Capital issued for MP Realty Holdings Ltd acquisition 2 44.3 39.37 44.95 Capital issued following placing offer to shareholders 3 414.3 39.37 45.06 Capital issued for Metro MRI Ltd acquisition 4 18.8 39.37 51.29 Each Tranche under the VCP was tested on the first Measurement Date and on 20 August 2015 was subject to the original terms and conditions of the VCP, except that, as shown above, each Tranche had its own Threshold Price.
At subsequent Measurement Dates i. e. one and two years after the first Measurement Date, it was determined that the methodology for determining the Threshold Price for each Tranche will be the same whereby the Threshold Price for each Tranche will be the higher of: The highest return achieved at any previous Measurement Date treated as separate Tranches : and 8% p. a. TSR from the Base Price for Tranche 1 or the capital raising price price on the day of issue for Tranches 2, 3 and 4 and others if further capital raising events occur.
Each Tranche has its own minimum return threshold which must be achieved before any awards earned and deferred at previous Measurement Dates vest at the second or third Measurement Dates.
This means that awards rolled over i. e. accrued but not vested from previous Measurement Dates must sustain an 8% p. a. TSR from the Base Price for Tranche 1 or the capital raising price price on the day of issue for Tranches 2, 3 and 4.
The maximum aggregate number of shares that can be issued to satisfy awards under the VCP to all participants remained limited to 25 million.
Therefore, no adjustments were made to the cap on the number of shares that could be earned under the VCP as a result of the changes to the share capital.
60 Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Remuneration Report continued As previously reported, the first Measurement Date occurred on 20 August 2015.
The table below sets out the actual value creation under the VCP as calculated at the first Measurement Date, using as prescribed in the plan rules the average share price over three months following the announcement of the Companys financial results for the 2014 15 financial year plus dividends paid on shares in issue: Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Tranche 3 Tranche 4 pence pence pence pence per share per share per share per share Average share price at first Measurement Date A 56.27 56.27 56.27 56.27 Dividends paid per share in issue B 5.0625 2.40 1.95 1.50 Measurement Price C A B 61.3325 58.67 58.22 57.77 Threshold Price T 39.37 44.95 45.06 51.29 Value created C-T 21.9625 13.72 13.16 6.48 As per the VCP performance condition, the total participant benefit available was 10% of the above value created for each Tranche multiplied by the number of shares in each Tranche, which amounts in total to 17.8 million.
As a consequence of the Companys strong performance up to the first Measurement Date, the VCP units converted virtually in full into nil-cost options over 24,999,950 shares out of the total 25 million pool.
This resulted in Graham Roberts units converting into 11,779,255 nil-cost options, Jonathan Murphys into 5,153,423 options and Andrew Darkes into 5,889,627 options.
Under the rules, 50% of any shares that accrued at the first Measurement Date in the form of nil-cost options became exercisable at the first Measurement Date, 50% of the remainder become exercisable at the second and 100% at the third, provided the minimum return thresholds for each Tranche are achieved at each Measurement Date.
On 25 September 2015 Messrs Roberts and Murphy exercised the first 50% of their nil-cost options resulting in them receiving after the payment of income tax and NICs 3,121,503 and 1,365,657 shares respectively.
The share price on 25 September 2015 was 54.25 pence.
On 30 August 2016 Messrs Murphy and Darke exercised the next 25% of their nil-cost options resulting in them receiving afterthe payment of income tax and NICs 682,829 and 780,376 shares respectively.
The share price on 30 August 2016 was58.5 pence.
Graham Roberts held outstanding awards under the VCP on his death.
The Committee exercised its discretion to allow these outstanding awards including the Tranche that was due to vest in 2017 to vest at the same time as the 2016 award using the minimum return threshold used in 2016 this award already having provisionally vested in full in 2015.
The impact of the conversion of the Executive Directors units into nil-cost options and the above exercises is set out in the table below: Awards Granted Lapsed Exercised Awards Year of outstanding during the during the during the outstanding Exercise Exercisable Name grant at 01 04 16 year year year at 31 3 17 price between Graham Roberts 2015 2,944,814 2,944,814 Nil-cost Aug 1623 Graham Roberts 2015 2,944,813 2,944,813 Nil-cost Aug 1723 Jonathan Murphy 2015 1,288,356 1,288,356 Nil-cost Aug 1623 Jonathan Murphy 2015 1,288,355 1,288,355 Nil-cost Aug 1723 Andrew Darke 2015 1,472,407 1,472,407 Nil-cost Aug 1623 Andrew Darke 2015 1,472,406 1,472,406 Nil-cost Aug 1723 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information www.
