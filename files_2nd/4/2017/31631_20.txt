LTIP LTIP awards will vest subject to stretching targets which may include relative TSR, ROCE and TNAV.
The Committee has discretion to introduce a post-vest holding period and reviews this prior to each years award.
The Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors in September 2017 and awarded salary increases of three per cent with effect from 1October 2017, in line with the wider employee base.
In addition, Executive Directors will be awarded the maximum bonus opportunity of 150 per cent and LTIP of 200 per cent of base salary.
The structure of the annual bonus and LTIP will remain unchanged in 2018, save for the replacement of the personal objective component, which will be replaced by Group adjusted operating margin.
The annual bonus targets will therefore be based on Group adjusted operating profit, Group adjusted operating margin and Group return on capital employed.
In line with the overall discretion of the Remuneration Committee to determine the size of any bonus payment, as described on page 62, the Committee will take into account the overall performance of an Executive Director against the in-year and longer-term strategic goals of the Group when determining bonus awards.
LTIP targets will continue to be based on ROCE, TNAV and relative total shareholder return.
