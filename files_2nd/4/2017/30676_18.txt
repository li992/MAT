As set out in the Remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM, the Executive Directors variable rewards in relation to performance during 2017 were based on a balanced scorecard of performance measures and objectives, weighted for both Executive Directors between Financial, 30%, Risk 20%, Customer 35% and People and culture 15%.
In addition, a multiplier based on individual behaviours and performance is also applied to the balanced scorecard remuneration outcome.
The tables below illustrate performance against each of the balanced scorecard measures.
As set out on page 68, this approach and multiplier are consistent with that applied for all colleagues across the Bank.

Below, we set out details of the individual multipliers in respect of our Executive Directors for 2017.
Individual behaviours and performance Executive Director Key achievements in 2017 multiplier Craig Donaldson Craig has led the Company into its first full year of profitability with another successful 134% year of exceptional growth and delivery.

He was recognised as the most People Focused CEO by HR Magazine, as the International Retail Banker of the Year by Retail Banker International and also as one of the highest rated CEOs on Glassdoor, evidencing the fantastic leadership he provides to colleagues and theCompany.
Mike Brierley The Company continues to deliver against its financial targets, under Mikes leadership, 118% while remaining within risk appetite.
Metro Bank has achieved profitability during another year of exceptional investment in growth and customer experience.
Capital, costs and revenue are well managed to deliver short, medium and long term goals.
Asset and liability management remain conservative.
The financial control environment remains strong as attested by both internal and external review.
In addition the Finance, Treasury, Legal and Company Secretarial, Procurement and Investor Relations teams that Mike is accountable for deliver high levels of service to their internal customers and external stakeholders.
Calculation of variable pay for the Executive Directors As set out in the 2016 Directors Remuneration Report, each Director was eligible for an on-target variable reward opportunity of 100% of salary in respect of the financial year ending 31 December 2017.
In line with the above and our approach for all colleagues, the proposed variable rewards for the Executive Directors have been calculated as follows.

The remaining 25% is paid in cash.
Share awards in respect of the year ending 31 December 2017 will be deferred into market price share options, the fair value of which will be informed by the Black-Scholes methodology.
72 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 METRO BANK PLC Market price share options are implicitly performance related, and put at risk the deferred element of variable reward that would otherwise be delivered in cash, as they will not accrue any value unless Metro Banks share price increases over the deferral period.

Appointed 21 June 2017 Remuneration for employees below Board level Our approach to remuneration is consistent for all colleagues including our Executive Directors.
The focus is on simplicity, rewarding the right behaviours and outcomes for customers and the business, focusing on long-term growth and discouraging unnecessary risk-taking.
Our Directors Remuneration Policy, as approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM, was developed by reference to our reward principles, which apply to all colleagues: Pay fair salaries and offer strong career and growth opportunities in an AMAZEING culture.
Make everyone an owner: aligning them to the Banks long-term vision.
Reward colleagues based on Metro Banks culture and performance and how they behave and deliver: both as part of the team and as an individual.
Keep reward as simple as possible, with one approach for all.
Take a retail approach to variable reward: no excessive cash bonuses or linear incentives which can skew behaviours and encourage unnecessary risk-taking.

This only includes colleagues who were employed by Metro Bank on or before 1 January 2016 and still employed on or after 31 December 2017.
Any colleagues who joined or left the Bank within this period have been excluded from the analysis.
Salary is taken as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017.
The ratio of CEO salary versus the average salary for all employees at 31 December 2017 was 17.98 2016: 18.81 In the 2016 Annual Report this was reported as 15.63 as it was calculated on a same store basis ie only colleagues who were employed by Metro Bank on or before 1 January 2015 and still employed on or after 31 December 2016.
The 2017 ratio and restated 2016 ratio are simply the salary for the CEO versus the average for all employees employed at 31 December in each year.
Relative importance of spend on pay We made no distributions by way of dividend or share buy-back during the relevant year, or made any other significant distributions.
We therefore consider that at this time there is no information or data which would assist shareholders in understanding the relative importance.
