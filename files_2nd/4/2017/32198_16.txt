Committee may determine from time to time.
1 R ecovery and withholding provisions apply to variable pay, to enable the Company to recover amounts paid under the annual bonus and PSP in the event of the following negative events occurring within three years of the payment date: a material misstatement or restatement to the audited financial statements or other data: an error in the calculation leading to over-payment of bonus: or individual gross misconduct.
Should such an event be suspected, there will be a further two years in which the Committee may investigate the event.
The amount to be recovered would generally be the excess payment over the amount which would otherwise be paid, and recovery may be satisfied in a variety of ways, including through the reduction of outstanding deferred awards, reduction of the next bonus or PSP vesting and seeking a cash repayment.
2 In order to ensure that the remuneration policy is capable of achieving its intended aims, the Committee retains certain discretions over the operation of the variable pay policy.
These include the ability to vary the operation of the plans in certain circumstances such as a change of control, rights issue, corporate restructuring events or special dividend including the timing and determination of pay-outs vesting, and making appropriate adjustments to performance targets as necessary to ensure that performance conditions remain appropriate.
However, it should be noted that in the event that the measures or targets are varied for outstanding awards in the light of a corporate event, the revised targets may not be materially less difficult to satisfy.
Should these discretions be used, they would be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may be subject to consultation with shareholders as appropriate.
3 Annual bonus performance measures are selected annually to reflect the Groups key strategic initiatives for the year and reflect both financial and non-financial objectives.
A majority weighting is placed on financial performance, including a significant element being based on profit-based metrics, ensuring that pay-outs are closely linked to Company growth.
4 The use of a combination of internal financial performance and total shareholder return measures within the PSP is designed to ensure that rewards are linked to long-term shareholder value creation.
The financial metrics chosen will be the measure or measures considered by the Committee at the time of each grant to be most likely to support the Companys long-term growth strategy.
The use of TSR aligns with the Companys focus on shareholder value creation and rewards management for outperformance of sector peers.
5 In exceptional circumstances, the Committee may in its discretion allow participants to sell, transfer, assign or dispose of some or all of these shares before the end of the holding period.
6 Although eligible, the Executive Directors opted out of the offer of Free Shares made to all employees in April 2015.
7 A description of how the Company intends to implement the policy set out in this table for 2018 is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Service contracts and policy for payments on loss of office The service contracts for the Executive Directors are terminable by either the Company or the Executive Director on 12 months notice and make provision for early termination by way of payment of a cash sum equal to 12 months salary, and pension.
Payment in lieu of notice can be paid either as a lump sum or in equal monthly instalments over the notice period, with mitigation.
The Committee will consider the particular circumstances of each leaver on an individual basis and retains flexibility as to at what point, and the extent to which, payments are reduced.
At the discretion of the Committee, a contribution to reasonable outplacement costs in the event of termination of employment due to redundancy may also be made.
A payment to the value of 12 months contractual benefits may also be made.
The Committee also retains the ability to reimburse reasonable legal costs incurred in connection with a termination of employment and may make a payment for any statutory entitlements or to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination of any existing or future Executive Director as necessary.
Relevant details will be provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration should such circumstances apply.
In summary, the contractual provisions on termination where the Company elects to make a payment in lieu of notice are as follows: Provision Detailed terms Notice period 12 months by either party.
over the notice period 5% in respect of pension contributions.
Change of control There are no enhanced provisions on a change of control.
The Executive Directors are subject to annual reappointment at the AGM.
Service contracts are available for inspection at the Companys registered office.
Annual bonus on termination There is no automatic or contractual right to bonus payment.
At the discretion of the Committee, for certain leavers, a pro-rata bonus may become payable at the normal payment date for the period of employment and based on full-year performance.
Should the Committee decide to make a payment in such circumstances, the rationale would be fully disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 71 Directors remuneration report continued PSP on termination Share-based awards are outside of service contracts.
Normally, PSP awards will lapse upon a participant ceasing to hold employment.
However, under the Rules of the PSP, in certain prescribed circumstances namely, death, sale of employing company from the business or otherwise at the discretion of the Committee, good leaver status can be applied.
In exercising its discretion as to whether an Executive Director should be treated as a good leaver the Committee will take into account the performance of the individual and the reasons for their departure and, in the event of this determination being made, will set out its rationale in the following Annual Report on Remuneration.
The extent to which PSP awards will vest in good leaver circumstances will depend on: the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied at the relevant time: and the pro-rating of the award determined by the period of time served in employment during the vesting period.
In such circumstances, PSP awards will usually vest on the normal vesting date.
The Committee retains the discretion to reduce or eliminate time pro-rating, if it regards it to be appropriate in particular circumstances.
However, if the time pro-rating is varied from the default position under the PSP Rules, an explanation will be set out in the following Annual Report on Remuneration.
For the avoidance of doubt, the application of the performance condition may not be waived, although the Committee may at its discretion alter the date to which performance is measured e. g. to the date of cessation of employment as opposed to over the full performance period.
Approach to recruitment and promotions The recruitment package for a new Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Companys approved remuneration policy.
Currently, this would include an annual bonus opportunity of up to 150% of salary and policy PSP award of up to 200% of salary other than in exceptional circumstances where up to 300% of salary may be made.
On recruitment, salary may but need not necessarily be set at a level below the normal market rate, with phased increases greater than those received by others as the executive gains experience.
The rate of salary should be set so as to reflect the individuals experience and skills.
The Committee recognises that it may be necessary in some circumstances to compensate for amounts foregone from a previous employer using Listing Rule 9.4.
Any such compensatory award would be limited to what is felt to be a fair estimate of the value of remuneration foregone taking into account the value of the award, the extent to which performance conditions apply, the form of award and the time left to vesting.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of their prior role would normally be allowed to pay out according to its outstanding terms.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that, if they are outside the approved policy, they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For all appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain appropriate relocation costs.
Policy on external appointments Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted to take on one non-executive position with another company and to retain their fees in respect of such position.
Details of outside directorships held by the Executive Directors and any fees that they received are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

Approach to recruitment For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy in force at that time.
