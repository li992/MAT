The Remuneration Committee will move the normal salary review date for future reviews, from 1 April to 1 July, so that it is aligned with the general workforce review date.
Pension provision, capped at 20% of salary under the existing and proposed Remuneration Policy will remain unchanged at 16% of salary for the Chief Executive and 15% of salary for the other executive directors.
No changes will be made to benefit provisions.
Annual bonus provision, capped at 150% of salary under the existing and proposed Remuneration Policy will be set at 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and 106% of salary for the other directors.
Strategic measures will be introduced for a minority of bonus potential.
Reflecting the Chief Executives increased bonus potential, the proportion of his bonus deferred will be increased from 25% to 50%, which will result in his cash bonus potential decreasing.
For any bonus to be paid under the strategic targets, a threshold economic profit target must be achieved.
LTIP awards, capped at 200% of salary under the existing and proposed Remuneration Policy, will be 50% based on EPS growth targets and 50% based on relative TSR to reflect the committees desire for more balanced performance metrics.
The Chief Executives LTIP award will be set at 175% of salary, although to reflect the increase in the Chief Executives award level, his vesting schedule and the TSR targets will be toughened.
LTIP awards for the other executive directors will remain at 125% of salary with 25% of awards continuing to vest at threshold and full vesting for upper quartile TSR.
Assuming the new policy is approved at the 2017 annual general meeting, these awards will be subject to the new two year holding period which continues to apply post-cessation Policy scope The Policy applies to the Chairman, executive directors and non-executive directors.
Policy duration The new Directors Remuneration Policy will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the annual general meeting on 26 July 2017 and, subject to receiving majority shareholder support, the Policy will apply from the date of approval and is intended to remain in place for a maximum of three years.
Changes from 2014 Remuneration Policy The main changes from the 2014 Remuneration Policy are summarised below: The introduction of a formal salary cap.
Salary increases will be limited to no more than 15% a year, unless there is an exceptional change in the size or structure of the business which materially changes the scope of responsibilities there will be no cap on salary levels for new recruits or promotions to the board, or promotions within the board.
The current malus aka withholding provisions will be strengthened and clawback provisions aka recovery will be introduced on a consistent basis across both the annual and long-term incentive plan LTIP rules.
Shareholding guidelines will be increased from 100% of salary to 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and 150% of salary for the Finance Director and Business Development Director.
A two year post-vesting holding period will be applied to LTIP awards granted to executive directors from 2017 onwards.
The holding period will continue to apply post-cessation of employment.
To aid the administration and clarity of its operation, a number of minor changes have also been made to the wording of the Remuneration Policy where appropriate.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company When making decisions on executive director remuneration, the committee considers pay and conditions across PayPoint.
In particular, it is anticipated that salary increases for senior executives will have regard to those of salaried employees as a whole.
Consideration of shareholder views The Remuneration Committee maintains a regular dialogue with its major shareholders and when determining remuneration, takes into account the guidelines of investor bodies and shareholder views.
The committee continues to monitor trends and developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the structure of the executive remuneration remains appropriate and commits to undergo a shareholder consultation in advance of any material changes to remuneration policy.

Clawback aka recovery and malus aka withholding provisions From FY17 18, all incentive awards, including the cash and deferred element of the annual bonus and the LTIP, will be subject to consistent clawback and malus provisions.
The committee will be entitled to enact these provisions in the following circumstances: misconduct: material misstatement: error in calculation: and serious reputational damage to the Company.
These provisions will be in operation for a period of up to 3 years post payment vesting.
Use of discretion The Remuneration Committee may exercise discretion in two broad areas for each element of remuneration: To ensure fairness and align executive director remuneration with underlying individual and Company performance, the committee may adjust upwards or downwards the outcome of any shortor long-term incentive plan payment within the limits of the relevant plan rules.
Any adjustments in light of corporate events will be made on a neutral basis, i. e. the intention of any adjustment will be that the event is not to the benefit or detriment of participants.
Adjustments to underlying performance may be made in exceptional circumstances to ensure outcomes are fair both to shareholders and participants.
In the case of a non-regular event occurring, the committee may apply its discretion to ensure fairness and seek alignment with business objectives.
Non-regular events in this context include, but are not limited to: corporate transactions, changes in the Companys accounting policies, minor or administrative matters, internal promotions, external recruitment and terminations.
Any use of discretion by the committee during the financial year will be detailed in the relevant annual report on remuneration.
Performance measure selection Economic profit has been selected as the primary financial measure for the annual bonus plan, as it captures growth, returns and risk.
Economic profit is defined as operating profit after deducting the actual tax charge and a capital charge based on the weighted average cost of capital applied to the average capital employed.
The operating profit is the profit before any goodwill impairment, interest and tax.
Average capital employed is based on a 12 month average starting on 1 April including cumulative goodwill but excluding net cash indebtedness.
At the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee, exceptional items may be removed from operating profit where the inclusion of such items would be inconsistent with fair measurement, and actual tax may be adjusted to normalised rates if they are considered unsustainable.
Performance targets relating to the annual bonus plan are set from the Companys annual budget, which is reviewed and signed off by the board prior to the start of each financial year.
The target is based on a number of internal and external relevance points.
The target is set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular strategic priorities and economic environment in a given year.
Strategic targets for the annual bonus may be set each year based on the Companys prevailing strategic objectives at that time.
Targets will be set on a measurable, quantifiable basis where possible, but due to the nature of the objective, may require some subjective assessment.
Absolute EPS and relative TSR have been selected as the current measures for the LTIP as EPS is considered to be an allencompassing measure of long-term financial performance while TSR is considered the best measure of long-term share price performance for PayPoint, being directly aligned with shareholder interests and rewards management for outperformance of the Companys peers.
TSR is calculated using the three month average share price preceding the start and end of the performance period.
The committee retains the discretion to alter the weighting, substitute or use new performance measures for future incentive awards, if they are felt to better support the strategy of the business at that time.
Remuneration policy for other employees PayPoints approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the level of experience, responsibility, individual performance and salary levels in comparable companies.
All UK employees are eligible to participate in the Companys SIP and senior managers participate in the annual bonus scheme with the same measure at the appropriate business level as is set for the executive directors at Group level, but each with personal targets in addition.
Members of the executive board and senior managers circa 25 individuals are eligible to participate in the LTIP.
Performance conditions are consistent for all participants, while award sizes vary by organisational level.
PayPoint plc Annual Report 2017 51 Remuneration report continued Non-executive director remuneration The remuneration of the non-executive directors is within the limits set by the articles of association.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus plan or share incentive programme operated by the Company and are not entitled to pension contributions or other benefits provided by the Company.

52 PayPoint plc Annual Report 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Pay scenario charts The charts below provide an illustration of the potential future reward opportunities for the executive directors, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: minimum, target and maximum.
Potential reward opportunities are based on PayPoints remuneration policy, applied to base salaries as at 1 April 2017.
For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance based on the maximum bonus opportunity of 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and 106% of salary for the other directors.
For the LTIP, the award opportunities are based on LTIP awards of 175% of salary for the Chief Executive and 125% of salary for other executive directors.
Note that LTIP awards granted in the year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value is based on the face value at award rather than vesting i. e. the scenarios exclude the impact of any share price movement over the period.
For simplicity, the value of any SIP awards are excluded.

Where new appointees have initial basic salaries set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period of two to three years subject to the individuals development in the role.
Pension New appointees will receive contributions to personal pension plans in line with existing policy.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with existing policy.
Reasonable relocation support may be provided if necessary.
SIP New appointees will be eligible to participate in the SIP in line with existing policy.
Annual bonus The structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant maximum 150% of being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year.
Depending on the timing of salary the appointment, it may be appropriate to operate different performance measures for the remainder of that initial bonus period.
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other executives, as 300% of described in the policy table.
The normal limit of 200% of salary will apply, save in exceptional salary circumstances when awards of up to 300% of salary may be made.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both PayPoint and its shareholders.
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, the committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a different structure in order to facilitate the recruitment of an individual, exercising the discretion available under the relevant Listing Rule LR 9.4.
2 R to replace incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Such buyout awards would have a fair value no higher than that of the awards forfeited.
In doing so, the committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
Internal appointment In cases of appointing a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the Remuneration Committee and board will be consistent with the policy for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the board, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements.
Non-executive directors In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Remuneration Committee will utilise the policy as set out in the table on page 49.
Service contracts and exit policy Executive directors Executive director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the committee.
In accordance with general market practice, each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract requiring 12 months notice of termination on either side.
Executive director service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.
Details of the service contracts of the executive directors of the Company are as follows: Name Company notice period Contract date D Taylor 12 months 13 September 2004 R Kentleton 12 months 15 July 2016 T Watkin-Rees 12 months 13 September 2004 There are no special provisions in service contracts relating to cessation of employment or change of control.
The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations and executive directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there are no unjustified payments for failure.
Under normal circumstances, executive directors may receive termination payments in lieu of notice equal to pay and benefits for the length of their contractual notice period.
When considering exit payments, the committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and participants.
The table below summarises how the awards under the annual bonus and LTIP are typically treated in specific circumstances.
Whilst the committee retains overall discretion on determining good leaver status, it typically defines a good leaver in circumstances such as death, ill health, injury or disability, retirement with the Companys consent, redundancy or any other reason that the committee determines.
Bad leavers include those leaving employment due to resignation or misconduct, and retirement without agreement of the Company.
Final treatment is subject to the committees discretion: 54 PayPoint plc Annual Report 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Event Timing vesting of award Calculation of vesting payment Annual bonus Good leaver Paid at the same time as continuing Eligible for an award to the extent that performance targets are employees satisfied and the award is pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year served.

Outstanding matching awards under the 2009 DSB Plan will be treated in the same way as awards under the LTIP.
Mandatorily deferred and voluntarily invested shares under this plan are simply held on trust for participants and therefore would be released immediately on cessation or a change of control.
Non-executive directors The non-executive directors do not have service contracts, rather they have letters of appointment which are subject to a three year term.
Details of the terms of appointment of the non-executive directors are set out in the table below: Unexpired term as at 31 Name Effective date of letter March 2017 Date of appointment Notice period D Morrison 10 August 2016 117 days 12 January 1999 1 month N Wiles 8 May 2015 482 days 22 October 2009 1 month N Carson 23 July 2014 117 days 23 July 2015 1 month G Barr 1 June 2015 482 days 1 June 2016 1 month G Kerr 20 November 2015 482 days 20 November 2016 1 month R Sharma 12 May 2017 1,173 days 12 May 2017 1 month 1.

However, in order to comply with the Code, all directors will be subject to annual re-election.
Non-executive directors letters of appointment are available to view at the Companys registered office.
PayPoint plc Annual Report 2017 55 Remuneration report continued The following section provides details of how PayPoints remuneration policy will be implemented for the year ending 31 March 2018 and how it was implemented during the financial year ended 31 March 2017.
The following pages contain information that is required to be audited in compliance with the Directors Remuneration requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
All narrative and quantitative tables are unaudited unless otherwise stated.
Implementation of remuneration policy for 2017 2018 Base salary The Remuneration Committee has determined that there will no base salary increases for 2017 18.
In order to align executive director base salary review date with that for the general workforce, the normal executive director base salary review date for future years will be moved from 1 April to 1 July i. e. the next review date will be 1 July 2018.
Or date of appointment if later.
Pension Policy Limit: 20% of salary Pension contributions will remain unchanged with Dominic Taylors at 16% of salary, and 15% of salary for the other executive directors.
Annual bonus Policy Limit: 150% of salary The Chief Executives annual bonus potential for the year ending 31 March 2018 will be set at 150% of salary with 106% of salary continuing to be based on economic profit targets and the balance based on stretching strategic targets.
The targets themselves are considered commercially sensitive at this stage but will be based on the successful roll out of PayPoint One, as determined by the number of terminals introduced, the timely and successful implementation of a new Customer Relationship Management CRM system to improve service delivery and achievement of further benefits once in place and the approval of a comprehensive succession plan, aligned to wider talent management activities with clear milestones to be achieved.
Reflecting the increased potential from previous years 106% of salary, the Chief Executives bonus deferral will be doubled from the current 25% to 50% of the bonus over a three year period so the cash bonus potential decreases from 79.5% of salary to 75% of salary.
Bonus potential for the other executive directors will remain at 106% of salary with 25% deferred.
However, to promote a collegiate approach across the executive team, 26% of salary will be subject to the PayPoint One and CRM strategic targets set out above, with the remaining 80% of salary continuing to be assessed based on economic profit.
No payments will be made under the strategic bonus targets unless the threshold economic profit target has been achieved.
As is currently the case, full details of the annual bonus targets both financial and non-financial for the 2017 18 financial year onwards and performance against the targets will be disclosed in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
LTIP Policy Limit: 200% of salary For past awards up to and including the 2016 grant, 100% of LTIP awards were based on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR against the constituents of the FTSE 250.
However, for 2017 awards onwards, reflecting the committees desire for more balanced performance metrics, Earnings Per Share EPS will also be used as a performance measure for 50% of the awards.
Relative TSR, will continue to be measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 albeit the committee may exclude less relevant sectors for performance comparison e. g. Oil & Gas companies, Basic Materials and Utilities for 50% of LTIP awards, with threshold vesting for achieving a median ranking, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for achieving an upper quartile ranking or better.
The Chief Executives annual LTIP award will be set at 175% of salary from 2017 onwards as permitted under the current and proposed policy.
Reflecting the increase in the award level, the vesting schedule will be amended and the TSR targets will be toughened.
Rather than 25% of awards vesting for threshold performance, 20% will vest at threshold for both the EPS and TSR part of the Chief Executives awards.
In addition, rather than 100% of the TSR part of the Chief Executives award vesting at upper quartile 75th percentile, this will be increased to upper quintile 80th percentile.
The performance targets, metrics and vesting for the LTIP awards to be granted in 2017 and which are expected to vest in 2020 will be as follows: EPS TSR For 50% of awards For 50% of awards Below Threshold 0% Below 5% p. a.
100% Upper quartile Upper quintile for the CEO 56 PayPoint plc Annual Report 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS When setting the performance targets for the EPS awards the committee considered a number of reference points, including internal financial planning forecasts, external market consensus and a broader view of market conditions.
They were also set in compliance with the Companys overall risk profile.
The committee views this target range as realistic at the lower end, but with significant challenge to achieve full vesting.
Additionally, the committee must satisfy itself that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance of the Company for this part of the award to vest.
If approved by shareholders, these awards will be subject to a two year holding period after vesting for the net of tax shares, which will continue to apply post-cessation.
