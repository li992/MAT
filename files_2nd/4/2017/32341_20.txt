Philip Remnant Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 99 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Remuneration Other information At a Glance The following section sets out our remuneration framework, how the Remuneration Policy was implemented in 2016 17 and how the Committee intends to apply the policy in 2017 18.
Approach to remuneration The approach to remuneration throughout Severn Trent is guided by a framework of common principles, which are outlined below.
Reward principles Design will be as simple and transparent as possible, and it will be easy to understand and communicate: Reward will be relevant to our business goals and objectives, and be affordable: Performance measures and targets will be objectively determined: and We aim to be competitive in the market so we can attract, recruit and retain talented people.
How our executive pay supports our strategy The Committee believes it is important that for Executive Directors and senior management a significant proportion of the remuneration package is performance related and performance conditions applying to incentive arrangements support the delivery of the Companys strategy.
The following table sets out how each of our key strategic objectives are reflected in the annual bonus and LTIP.
Key objectives Measure Incentive scheme Embed customers at the heart of what we do Customer ODIs Annual bonus and LTIP Customer experience measure Annual bonus Drive operational excellence and continuous Profit before interest and tax PBIT Annual bonus innovation Customer ODIs Annual bonus and LTIP Health & safety Annual bonus Invest responsibly for sustainable growth RoRE LTIP Change the market for the better Personal objectives Annual bonus Create an awesome place to work Health & safety Annual bonus 2016 17 remuneration outcomes This table shows how the successful implementation of our strategy has flowed through to the rewards provided to our Executive Directors.
The table below provides a summary total single figure of remuneration for 2016 17 and the 2015 16 total for comparison.
The full explanatory notes for each element of remuneration are detailed on page 106 following the total single figure of remuneration table in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

On-target pay includes fixed pay, 50% of the maximum bonus equal to 60% of base salary and 50% vesting of the LTIP awards with grant levels of 150% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 100% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer and 80% of salary for the Managing Director, Wholesale Operations.
Maximum remuneration includes fixed pay and assumes 100% vesting of both the annual bonus worth 120% of base salary and the LTIP awards.
No share price growth has been factored into the above chart and all amounts have been rounded to the nearest 1,000.
Salary levels which are the base on which other elements of the package are calculated are based on those applying at 1 July 2017.
The value of taxable benefits is the cost of providing those benefits in the year ended 31 March 2017.
The Executive Directors are also permitted to participate in HMRC tax advantaged all-employee share plans, on the same terms as other eligible employees, but they have been excluded from the above graph for simplicity.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 101 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Remuneration Other information Annual bonus An annual bonus was awarded of 75.8% of maximum for the Chief Executive Officer: 75.3% of maximum for the Chief Financial Officer and 75.5% for the Managing Director, Wholesale Operations.
Annual bonus payments for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are circa 12% lower than last year.
This is reflective of the stretching targets we set ourselves at the start of the year, which required significant and sustained improvements in all areas.

The Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Wholesale Operations have now exceeded the shareholding requirement of 200% and 125% of base salary.

The Remuneration Policy was approved by 97.99% of shareholders for three years from the date of the 2015 AGM.
No changes to the Remuneration Policy are proposed this year and therefore there will be no shareholder vote on the Policy at the 2017 AGM.

Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 103 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Remuneration Other information Annual bonus measures in 2017 18 We have reviewed the current bonus measures against our vision and how we operate, and whilst they remain well aligned to our key strategic drivers, we believe the addition of a specific customer experience measure worth 8% of the total annual bonus will serve to strengthen the link between what our people do and desired outcomes for customers.
The metric will assess reduction in written complaints.
Driving a reduction in written complaints is important as it ensures we are resolving issues earlier for customers and ultimately building strong customer focus into all our processes to minimise complaints at any stage.
It is a measure which is well understood by all key stakeholders employees, customers, investors and regulators and the CCW report on the reduction in customer complaints in their annual report on water companies, making it an externally recognised measure.
A corresponding reduction in the customer ODI measure from 35% to 30% and of the personal objectives from 10% to 7% will also apply.

Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 108 Remuneration Directors remuneration report continued The 2016 17 targets were set on the basis of delivering PBIT growth in a lower RPI environment decreasing revenue growth, and required us to absorb a number of headwinds such as inflation, increasing energy costs and the costs of setting up our non-household retail operation.
Against a challenging target in excess of the Final Determination and better than consensus expectations, we delivered Severn Trent Water Limited Group PBIT pre exceptional items of 512.8 million.
The customer ODI targets are reset at the beginning of each year and the targets for 2016 17 were significantly more challenging, with reduced deadbands and improved performance levels, compared with 2015 16.
Delivery of the target would represent improved operational performance on last year, when we delivered exceptionally strong performance and benefited from mild weather.
Our outturn of 47.6 million represents an outstanding result, driven by significant improvements in sewer flooding, supply interruptions and sustained performance on category 3 pollutions, while continuing to benefit from another year of relatively benign weather.
We assume normal weather patterns will return in the future.
In Severn Trent Water we have experienced 22 LTIs resulting in an LTI rate of 0.22 higher than our threshold target of 0.18 and therefore this portion of the bonus lapses.
In Operating Services there were no LTIs which will result in that portion of their bonus paying out in full.
Personal objectives for the executives are linked to our strategic framework which will move us towards our ambition to be the most trusted water company.
Objectives were shared across the team with each Director leading on the areas which best align with their accountabilities and expertise.
Liv Garfields key objectives related to improving the financial health and performance of the business, maintaining excellent customer service, ensuring the business is ready for market opening and PR19, supporting industry thinking and creating an awesome place to work.
The Committee awarded Liv Garfield a personal performance rating at 95% of the maximum.
This is based on the following: identification of a further 100 million in total expenditure efficiencies and strong year on year RCV growth: improved customer service resulting in an ODI reward of 47.6 million: on time delivery of Water Plus, our joint venture with United Utilities, and setting up our Severn Trent Wholesale Market Unit in readiness for non-household competition: on track delivery of the AMP6 asset management strategy: building and maintaining constructive regulatory relationships, contributing to the thinking on opportunities for developing the customer ODI framework and PR19: and delivery of a three percentage point increase in employee engagement, which continues to track above the global benchmark.
Whilst acknowledging a strong financial performance and an exceptional operational year, the Board noted that there remains more to do in relation to health and safety and SIM.
James Bowlings key objectives related to strengthening the wider Finance team, including Internal Audit and Enterprise Risk Management, development and delivery of key financial plans, minimising risk and liability in relation to pensions, enhancing investor relationships and creating value in Business Services.
The Committee awarded James Bowling a personal performance rating at 90% of the maximum.
This is based on the following: transformation of the Internal Audit and Enterprise Risk Management teams, developing a strong co-source function to embed risk management and controls into the way we work: successful development and delivery of our investor engagement plan, cash enhancement plan, and balanced and floating finance plan: management of the defined benefit pension liability through the development of a revised plan following the triennial valuation: successful delivery of Business Services business plans, including the sale of Severn Trent Italia and growth in Energy and Renewables: and improved development planning within the Finance team to identify and build talent breadth and depth at all levels.
Whilst acknowledging a strong financial performance, the Board noted that there remains more to do in relation to financing risk management.
Emma FitzGeralds key objectives related to maximising value from key contracts and capital expenditure, ensuring Wholesale is ready for market opening and PR19, improving customer experience and improving leadership succession planning for operational roles.
The Committee awarded Emma FitzGerald a personal performance rating at 60% of the maximum.
This is based on the following: implementation of a contract management framework, in collaboration with Group Commercial, to maximise value from key contracts, sustain efficiencies across the capital programme and embed new capital prioritisation mechanisms: delivery of functional separation in readiness for market opening: on track delivery of PR19 work streams including proactive asset management and partnerships with the Environment Agency and Drinking Water Inspectorate: and improved development planning across Wholesale to strengthen leadership development.
Whilst acknowledging an exceptional operational year, the Board noted that there remains more to do in relation to health and safety, customer complaints and SIM.

LTIP vesting The chart below sets out a breakdown of the respective LTIP and Recruitment Awards for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Managing Director, Wholesale Operations as disclosed in the total single figure of remuneration table.
We have split the value of the awards into two components: the face value of the award and the growth in the share price since the awards were made.
Value of long term incentive awards Recruitment Award Tranche 3 Vested in 2016 2014 LTIP Vesting in 2017 Recruitment Award Tranche 2 Vested in 2016 Recruitment Award Tranche 3 Vesting in 2017 N A Recruitment Award Tranche 2 Vesting in 2017 000s 200 400 600 800 1,000 Face value at award Share price growth Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Emma James Liv FitzGerald Bowling Gareld 110 Remuneration Directors remuneration report continued 2014 LTIP outcome The 2014 LTIP awards were granted as conditional shares and are subject to RoRCV performance condition measured over three financial years.
RoRCV is calculated as current cost operating profit less tax paid divided by our average regulatory capital value.
0%of each award vests if average RoRCV equals that set in the Final Determination, increasing on a straight-line basis to 50% vesting for 1.02 times the Final Determination and 100% vesting for 1.07 times the Final Determination.
Ofwat is no longer publishing abaseline RoRCV figure in AMP6 which impacts the final two years of the 2014 LTIP award.
However, an equivalent baseline figure can be constructed using the component numbers set out in the Ofwat model giving a baseline figure of 3.49% for 2015 16 and 3.60% for2016 17.
Our final RoRCV of 1.27 times the Final Determination results in a vesting of 100% of the maximum.
This is representative of outstanding performance in financing and total expenditure delivering RoRCV of 5.03%, up by 0.67% year on year.
Recruitment Awards The third tranche of the Recruitment Award made to James Bowling and the second tranche of the Recruitment Award to Emma FitzGerald vested in respect of the performance period ended 31 March 2017.
The performance measures for these awards reflected those under the 2014 LTIP and therefore both awards vested in full.
Outstanding scheme interests, including share awards granted during the year audited The table below sets out details of the Executive Directors outstanding share awards as at 31 March 2017.

The share price used to calculate the number of shares granted was 19.17 beingthe average price over the preceding three days.
Further details of the 2014 LTIP awards are set out on the previous page.
Tranche 3 of James Bowlings Recruitment Award and Tranche 2 of Emma FitzGeralds Recruitment Award are both subject to theperformance conditions set out on the previous page for the 2014 LTIP.
Tranche 3 of James Bowlings Recruitment Award was granted on 29 May 2015.
The share price used to calculate the number ofshares granted was 21.82 being the average price over the preceding three days.
Tranche 2 of Emma FitzGeralds Recruitment Award was granted on 21 July 2015.
The share price used to calculate the number ofshares granted was 21.52 being the average price over the preceding three days.
b 2015 LTIP award The 2015 awards are subject to a RoRE performance condition measured over three financial years.
Average RoRE performance is compared with the baseline RoRE figure set by Ofwat in our Final Determination.
25% of the award will vest if average RoRE matches the baseline figure of 5.65%, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for outperforming the baseline by 1.29 times equivalent to 7.29%.
The 2015 LTIP awards were granted on 15 July 2015.
The share price used to calculate the number of shares granted was 21.49 being the average price over the preceding three days.
c 2016 LTIP award awards granted during the year The 2016 awards are subject to a RoRE performance condition measured over three financial years.
25% of the award will vest if average RoRE matches the baseline figure of 5.65%, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for outperforming the baseline by 1.39 times equivalent to 7.86%.
The 2016 LTIP awards were granted on 21 June 2016.
The share price used to calculate the number of shares granted was 21.59 being the average price over the preceding three days.
At the start of the AMP we set our RoRE measure which is also used to calculate LTIP payments based on the Ofwat measure of RoRE as was published at that time, with two minor exceptions better to reflect our actual performance.
First, we used actual gearing rather than the notional capital structure.
Secondly, we seek to reflect cash performance through the inclusion of: profit loss associated with land sales, miscellaneous activities such as bulk supplies and rental income and the impact of the wholesale revenue forecasting incentive mechanism.
Ofwat have provided clarificatory guidance on RoRE to ensure consistency across companies and will be reporting on this shortly.
On this basis we estimate our RoRE would be 10%.
We intend to calculate and publish both RoRE numbers annually, and for LTIP purposes we will continue to use the measure defined at the start of the AMP to maintain internal consistency and because it provides a clearer reference point for an individual year to set targets.
This year our performance is 11% on the LTIP measure.
d Deferred shares under the annual bonus scheme awards granted during the year Each year, 50% of an Executive Directors annual bonus is deferred in shares for three years.
The awards are granted in the form of deferred shares.
The 2016 award relates to the deferral of the annual bonus for 2015 16.
The awards were granted on 28 June 2016.
The deferred shares relating to the annual bonus for 2016 17 will be granted in June 2017. e Save As You Earn The Executive Directors, in common with all eligible UK employees of the Group, are entitled to participate in the Companys HMRC tax-advantaged SAYE Scheme.

Philip Remnant Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 22 May 2017 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 115 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Remuneration Other information Appendix: Policy Report This section sets out the Remuneration Policy approved by 97.99% of shareholders at the 2015 AGM.
Setting the Remuneration Policy The Committee sets the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and other senior executive managers, taking into account the Companys strategic objectives over the short and the long term and the external market.
The Committee addresses the need to balance risk and reward.
The Committee monitors the variable pay arrangements to take account of risk levels, ensuring an emphasis on long term and sustainable performance.
The Committee believes that the incentive schemes are appropriately managed and that the choice of performance measures and targets does not encourage undue risk taking by the Executives so that the long term performance of the business is not compromised by the pursuit of short term value.
The schemes incorporate a range of internal and external performance metrics, measuring both operational and financial performance over differing and overlapping performance periods, providing a rounded assessment of overall Company performance.
Linkage to all-employee pay The Committee reviews changes in remuneration arrangements in the workforce generally.
It ensures that Executive Director salary increases are normally aligned to the increases for the rest of the workforce.
Furthermore, the annual bonus operates on a broadly similar basis with the bonus schemes operated throughout STW and all UK employees may participate in the HMRC tax-advantaged Save As You Earn SAYE scheme.
The Company has not directly consulted with employees on the topic of Executive Remuneration: however, the Committee does consider the general base salary increase, remuneration arrangements and employment conditions for the broader employee group when determining the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors.
Shareholder views The Committee engages proactively with the Companys major shareholders and takes their views into account.
The Committee reviews any feedback received from shareholders as a result of the AGM process and throughout the rest of the year and takes into consideration the latest views of investor bodies and their representatives, including the Investment Association, the National 1 Association of Pension Funds and proxy advice agencies such as Institutional Shareholder Services.
When any significant changes are proposed to be made to the Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration Committee Chairman discusses these with major shareholders in advance and may offer meetings for more detailed discussion.

Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 117 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Remuneration Other information Further details on the variable pay policy Annual bonus The performance measures and targets for the annual bonus are selected annually to align with the business strategy and the key drivers of performance set under the regulatory framework.
The annual weighting of the bonus between the various metrics and personal contribution may vary depending on the key priorities of the business for the year ahead.
Robust and demanding targets are set taking into account the operating environment and priorities, market expectations and the business plan for the year ahead.
Further details on the performance measures and weightings to be used for the forthcoming year are set out in the Annual Report onRemuneration on page 106.
Long term incentives LTIP For LTIP awards granted in 2015 onwards, RoRE will be used to assess performance.
Using RoRE to assess long term performance reflects the focus of Ofwat in AMP6 and is consistent with our aim to deliver efficient returns to shareholders.
RoRE is calculated as profit after tax plus incentives earned in the year divided by the average equity proportion of our regulatory capital value.
The Committee believes that the use of RoRE provides a strong alignment between the long term financial and operational performance of the Group and the reward delivered to management.
LTIP awards granted in 2013 and 2014 are subject to a performance condition relating to RoRCV.
Details of the performance targets applying to the 2013 and 2014 awards are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 106.
The Committee reserves the discretionary power to adjust the formulaic outturn of the LTIP performance conditions to ensure that the vesting result is reflective of the underlying financial and operational performance of the Company over the performance period.
The use of this discretion is expected to be exceptional and the Committee would consult with its major shareholders before making any upwards adjustment.
In relation to the awards granted in 2013, there is a cap and collar limiting the extent to which this discretion can be applied if the vesting result indicated by the performance condition is greater than 50% the Committee may reduce the vesting to a number not less than 50%: and if it is 0% it may increase it to any figure not greater than 50%.
This cap and collar approach does not apply to awards granted from 2014 onwards.
In addition, for any awards to vest, the Committee must be satisfied that there has been no compromise to the commercial practices or operational standards of the Group.
If the Committee is not so satisfied, then the vesting percentage may be scaled back as appropriate including to 0%.
Legacy Share Matching Plan Until 2013, awards were also made under a Share Matching Plan SMP.
Under the SMP, the Executive Directors could receive up to 0.5 matching shares for each share deferred under the annual bonus plan the maximum award level was therefore 30% of salary.
The matching awards were subject to achievement of a relative total shareholder return performance condition and a financial underpin.
At the time of release, participants also receive the value of the dividends which would have been paid on vested shares over the performance period.
The outstanding awards will be allowed to pay out under the approved policy, subject to achievement of the performance conditions on which they were granted.
None of the Executive Directors hold outstanding awards under this legacy plan.
Remuneration Committee discretion The Committee will operate all incentive plans according to the rules of each respective plan and the discretions contained therein.
The discretions cover aspects such as the timing of grant and vesting of awards, determining the size of the award subject to the policy limits, the treatment of leavers see policy on Payments for Loss of Office on page 112, retrospective adjustment of awards e. g. for a rights issue, a corporate restructuring or for special dividends and, in exceptional circumstances, the discretion to adjust previously set targets for an incentive award if events happen which cause the Committee to determine that it would be appropriate to do so.
In exercising such discretions, the Committee will take into account generally accepted market practice, best practice guidelines, the provisions of the Listing Rules and the Companys approved Remuneration Policy.
External directorships Executive Directors are permitted to take on external non-executive directorships, though normally only one other appointment, tobring a further external perspective to the Group and help in the development of key individuals experience.
In order to avoid any conflicts of interest, all appointments are subject to the approval of the Nominations Committee.
Executive Directors are permitted toretain the fees arising from one appointment.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 118 Remuneration Directors remuneration report continued Shareholding guidelines The Company operates shareholding guidelines under which Executive Directors are expected to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company.
The Chief Executive Officer is expected to build and maintain a holding of shares to the value of 200% of salary, and other Executive Directors 125% of salary.
Executive Directors are expected to retain all of the net of tax number of shares they receive through the LTIP and deferred share bonus until the shareholding guidelines have been met.

Provision Policy Notice period 12 months from either party.
Termination payment Payments for loss of office comprise a maximum of 12 months salary and benefits only.
Mitigation Any termination payment will not be made automatically but will be subject to both phasing and mitigation includingoffset against any earnings from new employment.
Change of control There are no specific contractual payments or benefits which would be triggered in the event of a change in control of the Company.
Outstanding incentive awards would vest in line with the treatment set out below for agood leaver except that the performance and vesting period will end on the date of the change of control.
Annual bonus The Committee may exercise its discretion to pay a bonus to a departing executive, subject to performance and pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the year worked.
The bonus would be paid at the same time as for theother Directors and, if the Executive has left employment by that date, it may be paid solely in cash.
Any outstanding deferred bonus shares will vest on cessation of employment unless the departure is a result ofsummary dismissal.
LTIP & legacy SMP The default treatment is that all awards will lapse on cessation of employment.
However, an Executive will be considered a good leaver in certain prescribed circumstances or by the discretion of the Committee.
IfanExecutive is a good leaver, the award will ordinarily vest on the normal vesting date, subject to performanceandtime prorating as set out below.
The Committee also has the discretion to determine thattheawards for a good leaver should vest early e. g. on cessation of employment subject  pro-rating as set out below.
For the outstanding awards under the legacy 2005 LTIP awards granted in 2013 and prior, the time pro-rating iscalculated by rounding up to the nearest full year unless otherwise specified.
Time pro-rating under the 2014 LTIP awards granted since 2014 is calculated on a daily basis and under the legacy SMP is rounded up to the nearest month.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee may time pro-rate the 2005 LTIP, 2014 LTIP and SMP awards to a lesser extent or not at all.
For the Recruitment Awards granted on appointment to Liv Garfield, James Bowling and Emma FitzGerald, no time pro-rata reduction will be applied in a good leaver situation.
Thisisin recognition of the fact that the expected value of the forfeited awards from their previous employment wassignificantly higher in each case with much of it being non-performance related and which would not have been scaled back for a similar event.
Copies of the service contracts of the Executive Directors and the letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours.
Outplacement services and reimbursement of legal costs may be provided where appropriate.
Any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination would be paid as necessary.
