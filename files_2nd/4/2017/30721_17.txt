and, when combined with EPS, provides a balance between growth and returns.
Performance targets are set to be stretching and achievable, taking into account the Companys strategic priorities and the economic environment in which the Company operates.
The Committee has considered the use of other performance measures to reinforce the Companys long-term objectives, including relative TSR and cash flow.
However, given the diversity of the Groups operations, it would be difficult to set a relevant and robust comparator group for assessing relative TSR performance and there would be some difficulty in cascading many of the other measures appropriately down the organisation.
Targets are set taking into account a range of reference points including the Ignite strategy and broker forecasts for the Group.
The Committee believes that the performance targets set are appropriately stretching, and that the maximum will only be achievable for truly outstanding performance.
Please see page 74 for further details on the target ranges.

Salaries for 2018 were determined taking into account this benchmarking data, as well as the other factors detailed in the policy table.

The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors fees were last reviewed in 2015.
There are no changes proposed for 2018.
ANNUAL BONUS The annual bonus is based on annual financial performance measures and non-financial measures.
The non-financial measures may include personal objectives linked to the delivery of the Ignite strategy.
The measures are selected to incentivise sustainable growth and the financial matrix is designed to provide a balanced focus between commercial and cash initiatives.
The non-financial measures are selected each year to reinforce the Groups strategic objectives.
The maximum opportunity is 150% of salary which is payable for achieving stretch performance against all measures.
Any bonus earned above 100% of salary is automatically invested into the CIP.
Bonus payouts in 2017 are subject to malus and clawback provisions.
In line with the Committees commitment to disclose bonus targets, the table on page 71 illustrates targets, performance and resulting bonus outcomes for the Executive Directors for the 2017 bonuses.
2017 BONUS In recent years our annual bonus has been based purely on financial performance and customer service levels against targets.
For 2017, the Committee agreed that 80% of the bonus should be based on financial performance of revenue and operating profit and 20% of the bonus should be based on strategic objectives, therefore linking an individuals bonus outcome to their contribution to the Ignite strategy.
The principles for setting the new framework are such that it: Drives the desired behaviours underpinned by our Performance Drivers May be easily cascaded through the organisation to reinforce alignment of our collective goals Has clear measures and targets The strategic element of bonus performance is aligned with Ignite Lead in customer experience Become the OEM partner of choice Customer service innovation, including Improving strategic business partnerships progress on the digital customer journey with our OEM brand partners Deliver full potential on all our revenue streams Leverage our global scale Developing business opportunities and Improvement in business processes improving focus on all our revenue streams 70 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACTUAL PERFORMANCE AGAINST TARGETS: Financial measures Strategic measures Total payment Threshold 7,962.1m Target 8,381.2m Stretch 8,800.3m Max 30% % of salary 000 Revenue Actual performance 8,550.9m Stefan Bomhard Operating profit 28.5% 101.46% 727,976 Threshold 341.6m Target 379.5m Stretch 417.5m Actual performance 389.3m Revenue Threshold 7,962.1m Target 8,381.2m Stretch 8,800.3m Max 30% % of salary 000 Actual performance 8,550.9m Richard Howes Operating profit Threshold 341.6m Target 379.5m Stretch 417.5m 28.5% 101.46% 421,186 Actual performance 389.3m Actual performance for determining bonus outcomes has been calculated using the same currency rates as used to set the bonus target.
This ensures that bonus outcomes are linked to, and reward for, underlying financial performance.
Lead in customer experience We set ourselves some very stretching internal targets for customer experience, one which was narrowly missed by 1.9% and the other which was met at threshold.
We also successfully initiated a number of process changes over the year to improve our ability to turn NPS feedback into actions and further strengthen our customer experience.
Become the OEM partner of choice In order to improve our strategic business partnerships with our OEM brand partners we set ourselves a number of stretching targets based on our OEMs expectations for unit volume, market share and customer satisfaction.
Over the year we improved our delivery against our OEMs expectations, exceeding the agreed targets.
Deliver full potential on all revenue streams As a means of recognising the need to have diversification of value drivers and to deliver strong returns in all market conditions, we have focused on improving productivity, deepening our expertise and investing in technicians to maximise the potential of our current assets.
Further, we set and met stretch targets on improvements on Finance and Insurance with additional focus on the development of new products and services which will lead to improvement in profit from an additional revenue stream in many markets.
Leverage our global scale Our dedicated focus on procurement has achieved 20m of annualised cost savings.
