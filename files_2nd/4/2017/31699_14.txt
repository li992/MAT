SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Dear Shareholder I am delighted to present our Directors remuneration report for the financial year ended 30 September 2017, which comprises this statement, the Annual report on remuneration on pages 38 to 44 and the Directors remuneration policy on pages 45 to 51.
Our current remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at our 2015 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee the Committee has continued to operate in accordance with that policy during the 2017 financial year.
The three-year life of the current policy will expire at our AGM in February 2018.
We will therefore put forward a revised remuneration policy to a binding vote at that meeting.
This is set out on pages45 to 51.
Key decisions and pay outcomes for the year ended 30 September 2017 The Groups performance in 2017 exceeded expectations with excellent top and bottom line growth.
Organic like-for-like sales were strong, helped by passenger growth in the air sector, and the year saw the highest level of net gains since IPO at 6.0%, with gains of over 20% in North America and 18% in Rest of World.
The strategic initiatives continued to drive margin improvement across all cost lines and coupled with the sales growth resulted in Group operating profit increasing 27% year-on-year and exceeding the budget target by 11.8%.
As at 30 September 2017, the TSR for the Group stood at 169% since the IPO compared to the top quartile peer group performance of 70%.
Further information regarding the Groups performance can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 25.
In this context, the Committee awarded an annual bonus of 200% of salary to Kate Swann and 100% of salary to Jonathan Davies.
Further details of performance achieved and the bonus targets set are shown on page 39.
The first PSP awards since IPO, granted in 2014, are due to vest in February 2018.
This is the first year for which we are required to include an estimated value of vested PSP awards in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 38.
No PSP awards vested in previous years, so the single figure for the year has been increased by the inclusion of these awards for the first time.
Subject to meeting certain performance criteria, as set out on page 40, the 2014 PSP awards that were made to Kate Swann were 741,384 shares and to Jonathan Davies were 247,127 shares including accrued dividend equivalents to 30 September 2017.
The estimated value of the awards shown is based on the EPS performance to 30 September 2017 and an estimate of relative TSR performance as described above.
Any amendments required to these estimates to reflect the actual outcome of the awards will be shown in the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 30 September 2018.
Following a review during the year, our Executive Directors base salaries were increased by 2% effective 1 June 2017, in line with the average salary increases awarded to UK employees who are paid on a monthly basis.
This resulted in base salaries of 795,906 for Kate Swann and 424,483 for Jonathan Davies.
Proposed policy and remuneration for the year ending 30 September 2018 The Committee intends to apply the revised remuneration policy during the year ending 30 September 2018, subject to shareholder approval.
The current salaries of Executive Directors will continue to apply from 1 October 2017.
We will review the salaries during the year with any changes effective from 1 June 2018, in line with our usual timetable.
The annual bonus plan will operate on the same basis as in 2017.
Awards will be primarily based on underlying Group operating profit.
The Performance Share Plan will operate on the same basis as in 2017.
We are intending to grant PSP awards in November 2017 equal to 200% of salary to Kate Swann and 125% of salary to Jonathan Davies.
These awards will be subject to performance over the three financial years to 30 September 2020.
The performance measures will continue to be 75% EPS growth and 25% relative TSR performance.
The targets for these awards are set out on page 43.
Our Executive Directors have very significant shareholdings.
We believe this provides strong alignment to our other shareholders.
The Committee did consider bonus deferral and additional holding periods for PSP awards, however, given the level of alignment provided by these shareholdings it was not considered that the additional complexity of these features would be appropriate.
Under the proposed remuneration policy, the only change that is proposed is that the maximum pension contribution or cash payment in lieu of pension for new Executive Directors has been reduced from 35% to 20% of salary.
What is included in this report The remainder of the remuneration report is split into two sections in line with legislative reporting regulations.
The Annual report on remuneration contains details of pay received by Directors for the whole of the year ended 30 September 2017.
We have also explained how we intend to implement our pay model during the year ended 30 September 2018.
The Annual report on remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM in February 2018.
The Directors remuneration policy contains details of our revised policy setting out various elements of our approach to Directors remuneration.
The Directors remuneration policy will be subject to a binding shareholder vote at the AGM in February 2018 and, if approved by a majority of our shareholders, will apply from that date.
I hope very much that shareholders will support the Committees continuing overall approach to remuneration and, on behalf of the Committee, I recommend our report to you.

For Kate Swann, any bonus is based on underlying Group operating profit.
For Jonathan Davies, any bonus is based on a combination of underlying Group operating profit performance and his personal performance.
If the individual performance rating is significantly below expectations, the Committee could decide not to award a bonus.
Under this framework Kate Swann had the opportunity to receive an annual bonus up to a maximum of 200% of her base salary and Jonathan Davies had the opportunity to receive up to 125% of his base salary.
The Underlying Group operating profit targets and Group performance for the year are set out in the table below.

Underlying Group operating profit performance in the year, at constant currency, exceeded budget by 11.8%.
In considering Jonathan Davies personal performance during the year, the Committee took into account a range of objectives including his strong contribution to the successful creation of a joint venture with Travel Food Services Private Limited in India and the management of the ongoing outsourcing of the Groups finance and accounting functions.
In determining these bonus outcomes, the Board has considered the sustainability report which includes environmental, social and governance issues within which these results were delivered, and has concluded that these bonus outcomes were appropriate.
Based on this performance, Kate Swann earned a bonus of 1,560,600 200% of salary and Jonathan Davies earned a bonus of 416,160 100% of salary.
