Non-Executive Director remuneration policy The Board as a whole is responsible for setting the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, other than the Chairman, whose remuneration is determined by the Committee and recommended to the Board.

Countryside Properties PLC Annual report 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 63 Approach to recruitment remuneration The Committees approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role.
The remuneration package for any new recruit will be assessed following the same principles as for the ExecutiveDirectors, as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the Executive Director policy will apply.
Historical entitlements will continue to be honoured and allowed to pay out on their original terms, and will be fully disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration at the relevant time.
The table below summarises our key policies with respect to recruitment remuneration: Remuneration element Recruitment policy Base salary and benefits The salary level will be set taking into account a number of factors, including market practice, the individuals experience and responsibilities and other pay structures within Countryside and will be consistent with the salary policy for existing Executive Directors.
Starting salaries may therefore be set below the market level and, subject to performance, increased by more than inflation as the employee gains experience over time.
The Executive Director will be eligible to receive benefits in line with Countrysides benefits policy as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Pension An Executive Director will be able to participate in Countrysides defined contribution pension scheme, orreceive cash allowance in lieu of pension benefits in line with policy for existing Executive Directors.
Annual bonus An Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme as set out in the remuneration policy table.
The maximum opportunity will be no more than 150per cent of salary, of which up to one-third may be deferred in shares, as per the policy for existing ExecutiveDirectors.
Depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee may deem it appropriate to set different annual bonus performance conditions for Executive Directors for the first year of appointment.
Long-term incentives An Executive Director will be eligible to participate in Countrysides Long Term Incentive Plan as set out intheremuneration policy table.
The maximum opportunity offered may be up to 200per cent of salary, as per the policy for existing ExecutiveDirectors.
An LTIP award can be made shortly following an appointment assuming the Company is not in a closed period.
Share buy-outs replacement awards The Committees policy is to not provide buy-outs as a matter of course.
However, should the Committee believe it necessary to grant awards to replace awards from a previous employer, the Committee will seek tostructure any replacement awards such that overall they are no more favourable than the awards due to beforfeited.
In determining the quantum and structure of any buy-out, the Committee will take into account the fair value and, as far as practicable, the timing and performance requirements of remuneration foregone.
Where possible, existing arrangements will be used, although the Committee may also make use of the flexibility provided by the Listing Rules to make awards without prior shareholder approval in unusualcircumstances.
Relocation policies Should relocation of a newly recruited Executive Director be required, reasonable costs associated with this relocation will be met by the Company.
Such relocation support could include but not be limited to payment of legal fees, removal costs, temporary accommodation hotel costs, a contribution to Stamp Duty, replacement of non-transferable household items and related taxes incurred.
In addition, and in appropriate circumstances, the Committee may grant additional support in relation to the payment of school fees.
The Companys policy when setting fees for the appointment of new Non-Executive Directors is to apply the policy which applies to current .
Countryside Properties PLC Annual report 2017 Remuneration policy report continued 64 Service agreements and compensation for loss of office When setting notice periods, the Committee has regard to market practice and corporate governance best practice.
Our policy is that notice periods for Executive Directors should be no greater than 12 months.
Both the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer have contracts with notice periods of 12 months from either side.
The notice period for Non-Executive Directors is three months, save in the case of the Chairman whose notice period is six months.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but are appointed under letters of appointment which provide for a review after an initial three-year term with the possibility of annual renewal.
All service contracts and letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Companys registered office and at the AGM.
When approving any termination payments for a departing Director the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the Company whilst complying withthe contractual terms and seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation orby way of damages for breach of such an obligation or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination ofan Executive Directors office or employment and may provide assistance with outplacement costs.
The table below sets out, for each element of total remuneration, the Companys policy on payment for loss of office in respect of Executive Directors and any discretion available to the Committee.
Broadly, treatment will depend on the circumstances of departure and in particular whether a leaver is a good leaver.
For a good leaver the following will normally apply: Remuneration element Treatment on cessation Salary, benefits and pension Received for the notice period or payment in lieu of notice.
Statutory redundancy payments as appropriate.
Annual bonus No entitlement to a bonus: however, a pro-rated bonus may be paid following the end of the financial year inwhich they leave.
Deferred bonus Vesting of deferred bonus shares on cessation.
LTIP The rules of the LTIP set out the treatment of good leavers.
In summary, awards will normally vest on the normal vesting date and be subject to pro-rating, although the Committee has discretion to allow awards tovest on cessation and to waive pro-rating where it feels it is appropriate to do so.
The Committee may pay any statutory entitlements or settle compromise claims in connection with a termination of employment, where considered in the best interests of the Company.
Change of control On a change of control of the Group, the following provisions will apply to Executive Directors: Remuneration element Treatment on change of control Salary, benefits and pension Received for the notice period or payment in lieu of notice if notice is given.
Deferred bonus Vesting of deferred bonus shares.
LTIP The rules of the LTIP set out the treatment on a change of control.
However, in summary, awards will normally vest at the date of change of control and normally be subject to pro-rating, although the Committee has discretion to waive pro-rating where it feels it is appropriate to do so.

This had the effect of deferring 5m of profit in relation to those sites from 2016 to 2017.
The Board believed that this change was in the best interests of shareholders.
However, in order to ensure that the 2017 targets were appropriately stretching and management did not benefit as a result, the Remuneration Committee set the targets for 2017 taking account of this profit deferral.

The metrics and their weightings for 2018 are as follows: Metric % of maximum bonus Group adjusted operating profit 60 Group adjusted operating margin 20 Return on capital employed 20 Note: Details of the targets for each metric are commercially sensitive and will not be disclosed prospectively.

Long Term Incentive Plan The Committee intends to grant both Executive Directors awards at a level of 200per cent of salary shortly following the announcement of the 2017 results.
The proposed performance metrics and their weightings are set out below: Return on capital employed Relative total shareholder return Tangible net asset value for the year ending 30 September 2020 30% of awards 35% of awards 35% of awards TSR vs. Pay-out TNAV in FY20 Pay-out ROCE in FY20 Pay-out FTSE 250 % of element m % of element % % of element Below threshold Below median 967 30% Threshold Median 20 967 25 30% 25 Target 1,018 50 31% 50 Maximum Upper quartile 100 1,069 100 32% 100 The 2017 ROCE out-turn is discussed on page 29.

Any such adjustments will be fully disclosed to shareholders and will be designed to ensure that the targets are no less challenging than the original targets.
