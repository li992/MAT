This review is considered against a background of the Group operating in a highly consolidated industry and being the largest tobacco and potentially reduced-risk products business in the world outside China, with its two key competitors not subject to the same regulatory disclosures.
Specific performance measures, their weightings and actual performance results achieved in 2017 are disclosed.
The specific performance targets for each measure are considered to be commercially sensitive.
The Remuneration Committee considers that its competitors would gain significant commercial insights into the Groups specific objectives and key priorities for its brands and markets if actual targets were disclosed year-on-year: such disclosure would be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The specific performance targets for each measure will only be disclosed retrospectively, at the earliest, in the Annual Report on Remuneration which relates to the period of 12 months after the end of the relevant STI performance period.
It is expected that the specific Threshold and Maximum targets for the STI performance period ended 31 December 2017 will be published in March 2019 in the Annual Report on Remuneration for 2018.
Disclosure of the specific targets for the STI in the year ended 31 December 2016, and the outcomes against those targets, are included onpage89.

BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2017 77 Remuneration Report Annual Report on Remuneration continued Impact of the RAI acquisition on short-term incentives in 2017 Following the acquisition of the remaining shares of RAI the Group did not already own on 25 July 2017 the Committee has taken time to consider how the impact of this major acquisition should be treated for the purposes of the 2017 short-term incentive scheme.
As a result of this review, the following treatments have been applied in respect of the RAI acquisition.
For all measures 2017 performance is based on organic BAT performance, excluding share, profit, cash and volumes from RAI and other acquisitions.
Further to this, consistent application dictates that all non-adjusting acquisition-related costs such as capital expenditure and net financing costs are also removed.
The Remuneration Committee believe this is the correct, fair and appropriate way to treat the acquisition of RAI.
Consideration of individual performance adjustment factor In addition to the Company-based STI corporate performance measures, the Remuneration Committee has also reviewed each Executive Directors personal performance against a weighted set of operational and strategic measures.
These were agreed as their specific individual objectives at the beginning of the year and depend on the priorities for each Directors area of responsibility in the context of the delivery of Group strategy.
Personal performance rated as Outstanding can result in an adjustment factor of up to 20% to the corporate STI result but is subject to the applicable maximum award limit.
Personal performance rated as Requires Improvement results in any corporate STI result being reduced by 50%.
The Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion to rate the Executive Directors as follows: Chief Executive Outstanding and Finance Director Outstanding.
These ratings resulted in the STI outcomes for both Executive Directors being increased by 20% to give a total short-term incentive result of 243.1% and 184.8% respectively.
The Remuneration Committee has concluded that both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director have shown exceptional leadership during 2017.
This will deliver the benefits of this major strategic acquisition to shareholders over the medium to long-term.

The pension-related benefits disclosed in the single figures for Executive Directors remuneration represent Ben Stevens net accrual for the period, being the differential between his total pension entitlements as at 31 December 2016 adjusted for inflation and as at 31 December 2017, multiplied by 20 in accordance with the UK Directors Remuneration Report Regulations.
These commitments are included in note 12 on the Accounts.
UK Pension Fund members are entitled to receive increases in their pensions once in payment, in line with price inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index up to 6% per annum.

Paul Adams: a historic data is taken from the Remuneration Reports for the relevant years and is recast as appropriate on the basis of the single figure calculation as prescribed in the UK Directors Remuneration Report Regulations: b he retired as Chief Executive on 28 February 2011 which affected his STI and LTIP as follows in accordance with the rules of those schemes: i his STI for the year ended 31 December 2010 was paid as a 100% cash bonus instead of 50% in cash and 50% in deferred ordinary shares: ii the outstanding LTIP awards of ordinary shares vested immediately on his retirement either in full 2008 Award or on a time-apportioned basis 2009 Award and 2010 Award : and iii the LTIP dividend equivalent payments for the LTIP awards which vested at his retirement were also paid in full and or on a pro-rated time and performance basis.
Nicandro Durante: a historic data is taken from the Remuneration Reports for the relevant years and is recast as appropriate on the basis of the single figure calculation as prescribed in the UKDirectors Remuneration Report Regulations: b he became Chief Executive on 1 March 2011 and his single figure remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2011 has accordingly been time-apportioned.
Long-term incentives 2016: in accordance with the UK Directors Remuneration Report Regulations, estimates for the values of the vesting 2014 LTIP awards were given in the Annual Report on Remuneration 2016: these amounts have been re-presented to show the actual market value on the date of vesting in 2017.
Performance and pay chart: this shows the performance of a hypothetical investment of 100 in ordinary shares as measured by the TSR for the Company against a broad equity market index the FTSE 100 Index over a period of nine financial years starting from 1 January 2009 through to 31 December 2017 based on 30-trading-day average values.
A local currency basis is used for the purposes of the TSR calculation making it consistent with the approach to TSR measurement for the LTIP.
BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2017 81 Value of hypothetical 100 holding Remuneration Report Annual Report on Remuneration continued Percentage change in the Chief Executives remuneration The following table shows the percentage change in the Chief Executives remuneration measured against a comparator group comprising the 1 UK employee population on UK employment contracts 2017: 2,202: 2016: 2,022 individuals.
This comparator group is considered to be the most appropriate group as Executive Directors are employed on UK contracts.
Using a more widely drawn group encompassing the worldwide nature of the Groups business would also present practical difficulties in collation as well as presenting a less relevant comparator given the significant variations in employee pay across the Group and the differing economic conditions and wide variations in gross domestic product per capita.
The 1.0% increase to average base salary and the decrease in average taxable benefits and short-term incentive awards for UK-based employees is due to an increase in the proportion of more junior staff within the population.
UK-based employees were awarded performance-based pay increases in 2017 in the range 0% to 8% with an average of around 3%.
The data for this comparator group is made up as follows as at 31 December 2017: 1 the weighted average base salaries: 2 the average taxable benefits per grade: and 3 an estimated weighted average target bonus based on that population as at that date.
3: Executive Directors Remuneration for the upcoming year Base salary for 2018 The Remuneration Committee has determined the following salaries for the Executive Directors Base salary Base salary from Percentage from 1 Apr 2018 change 1 Apr 2017 Executive Directors salaries % Nicandro Durante 1,310,000 4.8 1,250,000 Ben Stevens 924,000 3.5 893,000 The Remuneration Committee considered salary increases for Executive Directors in the context of the level of pay increases for UK employees.
These ranged between 0% and 7.3% based on performance in the prior year, with an average increase of 3%.
The Remuneration Committee also recognised the fact that the Group is now a significantly more complex organisation as a result of both the RAI acquisition and organic growth, with increased profit from operations up 39.1%, revenue up 37.6% and volumes up 3.2% from 2016, and noted the exceptional individual performance shown during the year.
Benefits and pension No changes to the provision of benefits or pension are proposed for 2018.
Short-term incentives for 2018 onwards, including the impact of the RAI acquisition Under the provisions of flexibility afforded to it in order to enable the practical implementation of our Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration Committee has undertaken a review of the current STI performance metrics in conjunction with management.
Following this exercise, it has decided to make a number of changes to the metrics and their weightings applicable for the forthcoming 2018 STI performance year.
In so doing, the Remuneration Committee has concluded that such changes will improve incentivisation of business outcomes that are aligned to the Groups immediate and longer-term strategic objectives.
In addition, the Committee has taken time to consider how the impact of the RAI acquisition should be treated for the purposes of the short-term incentive scheme for 2018 and beyond.
Further to the new metric design outlined on below, RAI will be an operationally fully integrated unit within the Group for the whole of 2018.
Management will be fully accountable for RAI performance in 2018 and consequently we are of the view that the performance ranges for 2018 metrics will fully reflect that all-inclusive basis.
82 BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Introduction Audit Nominations Remuneration Responsibility & Board Committee Committee Committee of Directors The table below sets out the current metric design and weightings alongside the design that will apply for 2018, together with the key reasons driving change: From To Current STI metrics & weightings 2018 STI metrics & weightings Group share of key markets 20% Group share of key markets 10% 1 Global Drive Brands GDB & Key Strategic Brands KSB volumes 20% Adjusted revenue growth of Strategic Portfolio 30% 2 Adjusted profit from operations APFO 40% APFO 30% 2 Adjusted cash generated from operations Adjusted CGFO 20% Adjusted CGFO 30% Total 100% Total 100% Notes: 1.
The most significant change is in respect of the introduction of a new metric, adjusted revenue growth of our Strategic Portfolio.
This Strategic Portfolio is comprised of the following core strategic categories both cigarette brands and potentially reduced-risk brands in our portfolio: Strategic Portfolio Definition for STI from 2018 Cigarette brands: Potentially reduced-risk product brands: 1.
GDBs: Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Rothmans 1.
RAI Strategic Brands: Camel, Natural American Spirit, Newport 2.
Moist Snuff Brands Grizzly and Kodiak 4.
Snus Brands including Epok Adjusted revenue growth for this portfolio is a central value driver for the business from both current and longer-term strategic perspectives and its inclusion within the 2018 STI award, with what we consider to be a very significant weighting attached, acknowledges the need for this objective form part of our incentive design.
The GDB and KSB volume objective, which has served to concentrate focus on the key brands and drive value as well as volume growth in our brand portfolio, makes way for our new objective.
Adjusted revenue growth in this Strategic Portfolio will enable a simultaneous focus on growth in both the core cigarette GDB categories including new key strategic brands at RAI and in our fastgrowing potentially reduced-risk portfolio.
In order to attach what the Remuneration Committee considers to be the appropriate weight to this new metric, it has decided to reduce the weighting of the Group share of key markets metric, from 20% to 10% for 2018.
The overall weight attached to the financial metrics adjusted profit from operations and cash generated from operations within the STI remains constant at 60%.
However, in light of the acquisition during the year of the remaining shares in RAI, the Remuneration Committee concluded that a marginal uplift in the weight attached to the Adjusted CGFO metric, from 20% to 30% was both appropriate and desirable.
Further detail is included in the description of the STI measures for the year ended 31 December 2017 on page 77.
BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2017 83 Remuneration Report Annual Report on Remuneration continued Long-term incentives for 2018 onwards, including the impact of the RAI acquisition on 2018 LTIP awards The performance measures and weightings for the LTIP award to be granted in 2018 will remain unchanged from those for 2017 awards.
The Committee remains satisfied that the current EPS growth targets remain appropriately challenging given the increasing future investment inNext Generation Products.
The Committee has taken time to consider how the impact of the RAI acquisition should be treated for the purposes of the long-term incentive scheme for 2018 awards and beyond.
Relative TSR, EPS growth and operating cash flow conversion ratio no adjustment to performance measurement of 2018 is required.
Performance will include the impact of RAI and other 2017 acquisitions.
Adjusted revenue growth performance for 2018 will include the contribution of RAI and other 2017 acquisitions as management are wholly responsible for that performance.
To allow for a like-for-like comparison with 2018, the 2017 base year will also include the full year of revenue from RAI and other 2017 acquisitions.

Benefits: the Chairmans benefits in 2017 comprised: health insurance and walk-in medical services 17,000 2016: 14,000 : the use of a company driver 63,000 2016: 69,000 : home and personal security in the UK and Ireland, including installation costs 13,000: 2016: 6,000 : hotel accommodation and related expenses incurred in connection with individual and or accompanied attendance at certain business functions and or corporate events 29,000 2016: 9,000 : and commuting flights to London 7,000 2016: 8,000.
The benefits for the other Non-Executive Directors principally comprised travel-related expenses incurred in connection with individual and or accompanied attendance at certain business functions and or events and walk-in medical services.
The figures shown are grossed-up amounts as appropriate as, in line with the UK market, it is the normal practice of the Company to pay the tax that may be due on any benefits.
Christine Morin-Postels benefits in 2016 have been restated to include 2,000 travel-related expenses that were incurred in 2016.
Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors of RAI DCP : as former outside directors of RAI, Holly Keller Koeppel and Lionel Nowell, III each participated in the DCP under which they could elect to defer payment of a portion of their RAI retainers and meeting attendance fees to an RAI stock account, a cash account, or a combination of both.
Following the acquisition of RAI by BAT, amounts deferred to a stock account Deferred Stock Units or DSUs mirror the performance of, and receive dividend equivalents based on, BAT ADSs.
Amounts deferred to a cash account earn quarterly interest at the prime rate as set by JPMorgan Chase Bank.
The respective DSUs of Holly Keller Koeppel and Lionel Nowell, III are disclosed as a note to Summary of Directors share interests below.
The deferred cash account for Lionel Nowell, III showed a balance of US$119,824 at 31 December 2017 25 July 2017: US$117,597.
DSUs and cash deferred under the DCP will be paid to the two Directors in accordance with the terms of the DCP, section 409A of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and each Directors existing deferral elections.

Value of ordinary shares shown above: this is based on the closing mid-market share price on 29 December 2017 being the last trading day of the year of 5,018p.
Meeting the guidelines: if an Executive Director does not, at any time, meet the requirements of the shareholding guidelines, the individual may, generally, only sell a maximum of up to 50% of any ordinary shares vesting after tax under the Company share plans until the threshold required under the shareholding guidelines has been met.
Waiver of compliance with guidelines: this is permitted with the approval of the Remuneration Committee in circumstances where a restriction on a requested share sale could cause undue hardship.
No such applications were received from the Executive Directors during 2017.
Non-Executive Directors are not subject to any formal shareholding requirements although they are encouraged to build a small interest inordinary shares during the term of their appointment.
Details of the performance condition for the LTIP award granted in 2014 which vested during 2017, and of achievement against that condition in the period to 31 December 2016, was set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2016.

Impact of the RAI acquisition on 2016 and 2017 LTIP awards The Committee has taken time to consider how the impact of the RAI acquisition should be treated for the purposes of the 2017 performance year within the 2016 and 2017 long-term incentive awards.
As a result of this review, the following treatments will apply.
Relative TSR and EPS growth no further adjustments are needed as the incremental costs and benefits associated with the acquisition are already factored into performance.
Adjusted revenue growth the 2017 performance year will be measured based on organic BAT performance versus the 2016 base year to allow for a like-for-like comparison.
The contribution of RAI and other 2017 acquisitions will be included from the 2018 performance year onwards.
Operating cash flow conversation ratio the 2017 performance year will be measured based on organic BAT performance, excluding RAI profit and cash, and any additional costs related to the acquisition.

BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2017 93 Remuneration Report Annual Report on Remuneration continued 8: Summary of our Directors Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Directors was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2016.
The full Directors Remuneration Policy is set out in the Remuneration Report 2015 contained in the Annual Report for the year ended 2015, which is available at www.
To assist in reviewing our Annual Report on Remuneration, we have summarised the key elements of the Directors Remuneration Policy as it principally applies to remuneration paid during 2017.
Directors Remuneration Policy summary: our remuneration strategy Our principles of remuneration summary The Remuneration Committees remuneration principles seek to reward the delivery of the Groups strategy in a simple and straightforward manner which is aligned to shareholders long-term sustainable interests.
The remuneration structure comprises fixed and variable elements.
These rewards are structured and designed to be both transparent and stretching while recognising the skills and experience of the Executive Directors and ensuring a market competitiveness for talent.
The fixed elements comprise base salary, pension and other benefits: the variable elements are provided via two performance-based incentive schemes asingle cash and share incentive annual bonus plan STI, and a single long-term incentive scheme LTIP.
In applying these principles, the Remuneration Committee maintains an appropriate balance between fixed pay and the opportunity to earn performance-related remuneration with the performance-based elements forming, at maximum opportunity, between 75% and 85% of the Executive Directors total remuneration.
An annual review is conducted to ensure application and alignment of the Directors Remuneration Policy with the business needs to promote the long-term success of the Company.
How each key element of our remuneration supports the strategic priorities Fixed remuneration: attract and retain high calibre individuals to deliver the Companys strategic plans by offering market competitive base salary pension benefits levels of guaranteed cash to reflect an individuals skills, experience and role within the Company: provide competitive post-retirement benefit arrangements which recognise both the individuals length of tenure with the Group and the external environment in the context of attracting and retaining senior high calibre individuals to deliver the Groups strategy: and provide market competitive benefits consistent with the role which: 1 help to facilitate the attraction and retention of high calibre, senior individuals to deliver the Companys strategic plans: and 2 recognise that such talent is global in source and that the availability of certain benefits e. g. relocation, repatriation, taxation compliance advice will from time to time be necessary to avoid such factors being an inhibitor to accepting the role.
Variable remuneration: incentivise the attainment of corporate targets aligned to the strategic objectives of the Company on an short-term incentives annual basis: performance-based award in the form of cash and deferred ordinary shares, so that the latter element ensures alignment with shareholders long-term interests: strong alignment and linkage between individual and corporate annual objectives via the application of an individual performance adjustment factor to the corporate result: and ensure, overall, a market-competitive package to attract and retain high calibre individuals to deliver the Groups strategy.
Variable remuneration: incentivise long-term sustainable growth in total shareholder return TSR, adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS long-term incentives and adjusted revenue growth, together with the achievement of a consistently high measure of operating profit conversion ratio over a three-year period: to facilitate the appointment of high calibre, senior individuals required to deliver the Companys strategic plans: and to promote the long-term success of the Company.
to put in place a combination of measures with appropriately stretching targets around the long-term plan that provides a balance relevant to the Groups business and market conditions, as well as providing alignment between Executive Directors and shareholders.
In setting performance criteria and thresholds targets, the Remuneration Committee takes account of the Groups long-term plans and market expectations.

96 BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Introduction Audit Nominations Remuneration Responsibility & Board Committee Committee Committee of Directors Directors Remuneration Policy summary: other policy provisions in relation to Executive Directors Service contracts The current Executive Directors are employed on a one-year rolling contract, executed at the time of the original appointment.
The Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to award twoor three-year contracts in the event that the Executive Director is recruited externally or from overseas.
Contracts with an initial period of longer than one year will then reduce to a one-year rolling contract after the expiry of the initial period.
Policy on payment for loss of office Principles The principles on which the Remuneration Committee will approach the determination for payments on termination are as follows: compensation for loss of office in service contracts is limited to no more than 12 months salary and benefits excluding pension: in the event that the contract is terminated for cause such as gross misconduct, the Company may terminate the contract with immediate effect and no compensation would be payable: and the service contracts of the Executive Directors are terminable on the expiry of 12 months notice from either the Director or the Company which means that, where an internal successor has not been identified, the Company would have sufficient time to replace the Executive Director through an orderly external recruitment process and ideally have a period of handover.
Treatment of awards under the share incentive schemes: STI DSBS and LTIP: All-employee scheme: SRS Executive Directors do not have contractual rights to the value inherent in any awards held under the share incentive schemes.
The release ofawards is dependent on leaver status and is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion in deciding good leaver status other than in cases of automatic good leavers as set out in the applicable provisions of the DSBS and LTIP rules.
The discretionary powers are intended to provide flexibility as Executive Directors may leave employment for a broad variety of reasons which may not necessarily fall within the prescribed category of good leaver.
The Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion by reference to guidelines which set out its agreed relevant factors to assist in the determination of a leavers status.
In exercising its discretion, the Remuneration Committee will also take into account the individuals overall performance as well as their contribution to the Company during their total period of employment.
Details of how leavers are assessed as good leavers are set out in the Remuneration Policy.
