In accordance with UK regulations, the vesting price of the assumed vesting is the average market price for the fourth quarter of 2017 which was 5.01 for ordinary shares and $39.85 for ADSs.
The final vesting will be confirmed by the committee in second quarter of 2018 and provided in the 2018 directors remuneration report.
Bob Dudley has requested that the EDIP performance share vesting in respect of the performance period 2015-17 is based on the 500% maximum annual award level which applies under the 2017 directors remuneration policy, rather than the 550% maximum annual award level which applies under the 2014 directors remuneration policy.
c In accordance with UK regulations, in the 2016 single figure table, the performance outcome value was based on an estimated vesting at an assumed share price of 4.73 for ordinary shares and $35.39 for ADSs.
In May 2017, after the external data became available, the committee reviewed the relative reserves replacement ratio position.
This resulted in no adjustment to the final vesting of 40%.
On 19 May 2017, 108,923 ADSs for Bob Dudley and 308,286 shares for Dr Brian Gilvary vested at prices of $36.94 and 4.72 respectively.
This total includes the additional accrual of notional dividends which vested on 2 August 2017.
The 2016 values for the total vesting have increased by $310,709 for Bob Dudley and by 67,820 for Dr Brian Gilvary.

e Value of vested deferred bonus and matching shares.
The amounts reported for 2017 relate to the 2014 annual bonus deferred over three years, which vested on 20 February 2018 at the market price of 4.75 for ordinary shares and include reinvested dividends on shares vested.
There was an additional accrual of notional dividends on 29 March 2018 which will vest in 2018 and will be provided in the 2018 directors remuneration report.
The amounts reported for 2016 relate to the 2013 annual bonus and have been adjusted from the number provided in the 2016 directors remuneration report to include the accrual and vesting of notional dividends.
f As stated in the 2016 directors' remuneration report, Bob Dudley has voluntarily agreed to defer vesting of these awards until after retirement, therefore the performance period is expected to exceed the minimum term of three years.

When reviewing performance over the period, the committee sought input from the chairs of the audit committee and the SEEAC to ensure a comprehensive review of performance.
Following input from the audit committee on the treatment of certain accounting items for which it would not be appropriate for participants to benefit, for example a gain from a legal settlement, the formulaic score under the bonus was reduced from 1.54 to 1.49.
In addition, the SEEAC recommended an exercise of downward discretion to the safety element for executive directors after taking a longer term view of safety performance to date.
Following SEEACs recommendation on the safety component of the scorecard, the remuneration committee exercised its discretion to reduce the score by 0.06, resulting in a final annual bonus scorecard outcome of 1.43 out of 2, a payout of 71.5% of maximum.
