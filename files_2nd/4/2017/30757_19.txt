When the PSP options are granted, the market price at date of grant is calculated using the prior days closing share price.
This is used to calculate the number of options to be granted to the participant, it is not the price that the participant has to pay to receive the options once they have vested.
The options are nil-cost options which means that there is no price to be paid to receive them once they have vested.
However, the participant will have to pay income tax and national insurance at their respective tax rate on the overall market value of the vested award, priced at the time of exercise.
The first set of awards to vest will be those granted in November 2015.
Performance against the EPS performance condition 50% of the award which ended on 31 December 2017 is shown on the previous page.
Performance against the relative TSR performance which will be measured in October 2018 will be reported in next year's remuneration report.

No award will vest if growth is below 6%.

Vesting of 25% of the award will occur for median ranking and the award will vest in full for upper quartile or above ranking, with straight line vesting in between these points based on ranking.
No awards will vest if TSR ranks below the median.
Following vesting, a further two-year holding period will apply to the PSP awards, whereby executive Directors will be restricted from selling the net of tax shares which vest.
SAVE-AS-YOU-EARN SCHEME SHARESAVE The Company offers a Sharesave scheme to all employees, including executive Directors.
The first grant under the Sharesave Scheme was when the Company first listed in 2015.
Participants can save a sum of money each month for a period of three years.
Under the tax approved limits, the maximum that each participant can save each month is 500, however the Sharesave Scheme was oversubscribed and the monthly limit was capped at 100 per month.
At the end of the three year period, the money saved can either be returned to the participant or used to acquire shares in the Company at a price of 1.18 per share.
This price was set at a 20% discount to a market price being an amount equal to the average of the daily middle-market quotation of a share over the three dealing days prior to the grant date.

OTHER SHAREHOLDING INFORMATION AUDITED The closing share price of the Companys ordinary shares at 31 December 2017, was 285p and the price range for financial year was 173p to 311p.
All closing share prices prior to the completion of the rights issue on 17 October 2017 have been adjusted by the rights issue bonus factor to ensure comparability with the closing share prices post the rights issue.
Shareholder dilution Awards granted under the Companys share plans are met by the issue of new shares when awards vest.
The Board monitors the number of shares issued under the various share plans and the impact on dilution limits.
The relevant dilution limits established by the Investment Association in respect of share plans is 10% in any rolling ten-year period and in respect of discretionary share plans is 5% in any ten-year rolling period.
Based on the Companys issued share capital as at 31 December 2017, and assuming that all current awards made under the Companys share plans as at that date vest in full, the dilution level was 3.73% against all share plans and 2.83% against discretionary schemes.
Director loans As previously disclosed, Advent transferred shares to certain Directors of the Group on IPO in recognition of their contribution and management of the IPO process.
The shares are subject to lock up arrangements, as disclosed in the price range prospectus.
As the shares vested immediately, they were therefore taxable at the point of grant.
The Company lent three of those Directors who received the shares monies to cover their income tax and National Insurance liabilities.
These loans were all subject to relevant approvals through the IPO process and are treated as a benefit in kind to the receiving individuals.
All benefiting individuals have entered into a loan agreement with the Company.
These loans must be repaid no later than April 2018.
Loans were originally made to three of the Directors.
As at 31 December 2017, 928,000 remained outstanding to one Director.

The Committee operates various incentive plans according to their respective rules.
To ensure the efficient operation and administration of these plans, the Committee retains discretion in relation to a number of areas.
Consistent with market practice, these include but are not limited to the following: selecting the participants: the timing of grant and or payment: the size of grants and or payments within the limits set out in the Policy Table : the extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance: determination of a good leaver and where relevant the extent of vesting in the case of the share based plans: treatment in exceptional circumstances such as a change of control, in which the Committee would act in the best interests of Equiniti and its shareholders: making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances such as rights issues, corporate restructuring events, variation of capital and special dividends : cash settling awards: and the annual review of performance measures, weightings and setting targets for the discretionary incentive plans, from year to year.
Any performance conditions may be amended or substituted if one or more events occur which cause the Committee to reasonably consider that the performance conditions would not, without alteration, achieve their original purpose.
Any varied performance 120 condition would not be materially less difficult to satisfy in the circumstances.
SECTION 02 GOVERNANCE Equiniti Group plc Annual Report 2017 GOVERNANCE REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY REMUNERATION POLICY FOR OTHER EMPLOYEES The Policy described in the previous table applies specifically to the executive Directors of Equiniti.
The Committee believes that the structure of management reward at Equiniti should be linked to Group strategy and performance.
The table below explains how the Policy has been cascaded below executive Directors, to achieve alignment of policy across the Company.
Element Difference in remuneration policy for other employees Base salary The same principles and considerations that are applied to the executive Directors are, as far as possible, applied to all employees.
Benefits Equiniti also has provisions for market-aligned benefits for all employees.
Pension The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
Annual bonus Approximately 500 members of the management team are eligible for a bonus award under The Leadership Incentive Scheme.
Deferred Annual Members of the Operating Committee have 30% of their earned bonus deferred into an award over shares on Bonus Plan the same terms as the executive Directors.
DABP Performance The PSP is awarded to members of the Operating Committee and key individuals in the Senior Management Share Plan PSP Team.
Options are normally granted at a discount to the market value.
Share Incentive An all-employee plan.
Employees can purchase up to 1,800 of partnership shares each year from gross salary.
Plan For every three partnership shares participants purchase they receive two free matching shares, on the first 180 that they invest annually.
CONSIDERATIONS OF CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP Although the Committee does not consult directly with employees on the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee seeks to ensure that the underlying principles which form the basis for decisions on executive Directors pay are consistent with those on which pay decisions for the rest of the workforce are taken.
For example, the Committee takes into account the general salary increase for the broader employee population when conducting the salary review for the executive Directors.
However, there are some structural differences in the executive Directors Remuneration Policy as set out on pages 118 to 124 compared to that for the broader employee base, which the Committee believes are necessary to reflect the differing levels of seniority and responsibility.
A greater weight is placed on performance-based pay through the quantum and participation levels in incentive schemes.
This ensures the remuneration of the executive Directors is aligned with the performance of Equiniti and therefore the interests of shareholders.
121 GOVERNANCE REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION In the event of hiring a new executive Director, the ongoing remuneration package would be set in accordance with the terms of the approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment and the maximum limits set out therein.
Salaries may be set below market level initially with a view to increasing them to the market rate subject to individual performance and developing into the role by making phased above inflation increases.
Benefits will be provided in line with those offered to other executive Directors, although these may be varied for an overseas appointment taking account of local market practice.
Annual bonus payments will not exceed 150% of base salary and PSP payments will not normally exceed 150% of base salary not including any arrangements to replace forfeited entitlements.
Where necessary, specific annual bonus and PSP targets and different vesting and or holding periods may be used for an individual for the first year of appointment, if it is appropriate to do so to reflect the individuals responsibilities and the point in the year in which they joined the Board.
A PSP award can be made shortly following an appointment assuming Equiniti is not in a close period.
The Committee retains flexibility to offer additional cash and or share based awards on appointment, to take account of remuneration or benefit arrangements forfeited by an executive on leaving a previous employer.
If shares are used, such awards may be made under the terms of the PSP or as permitted under the Listing Rules.
Such payments would take into account the nature of awards forfeited and would reflect as far as possible performance conditions, the expected value foregone and the time over which they would have vested or been paid.
Awards may be made in cash if Equiniti is in a close period at the time an executive joins.
The Committee may agree that Equiniti will meet certain relocation, legal, tax equalisation and any other incidental expenses as appropriate so as to enable the recruitment of the best people including those who need to relocate.
Where a new executive Director is an internal promotion, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms, and adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
In approving this Directors Remuneration Policy, authority is given to Equiniti to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors that pre-date the approval of the policy.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the annual report on Remuneration as they arise.
Element of Maximum percentage of salary remuneration Maximum variable pay: 300% comprising: Annual bonus 150% Performance Share 150% 300% in exceptional circumstances Plan PSP Pension 15% pension contributions cash in lieu of pension Note: Maximum percentage of salary for annual bonus and PSP excludes compensation for awards forfeited.
122 SECTION 02 GOVERNANCE Equiniti Group plc Annual Report 2017 GOVERNANCE REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY SERVICE CONTRACTS AND LOSS OF OFFICE PAYMENTS The policy for service contracts for executive Directors is shown in the table below.
Copies of the executive Directors service contracts are available for inspection at Equinitis registered office during normal business hours and will be available for inspection at the AGM.
Provision Detailed terms Notice period 12 months' notice from the Company 12 months' notice from the Director Termination payment Payment in lieu of notice comprising: Base salary Benefits Pension allowance An executive Directors service contract may be terminated summarily without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, if they are deemed to be guilty of gross misconduct or for any other material breach of the obligations under their employment contract.
The executive Directors may be suspended or put on a period of garden leave, during which they will be entitled to salary, benefits and pension.
If the employment of an executive Director is terminated in other circumstances, compensation may include base salary due for any unexpired notice period, pro-rata bonus subject to the performance conditions having been achieved in respect of the proportion of the financial year worked and any amount assessed by the Committee as representing the value of other contractual benefits and pension which would have been received during the period.
Equiniti may choose to continue providing some benefits instead of paying a cash sum representing their cost.
Any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination including, at the discretion of the Committee, reimbursement for legal advice and provision of outplacement services would be paid as necessary.
Treatment of annual bonus on termination Any bonus paid to a departing executive would normally be paid in cash, at the normal payment under plan rules date, and reduced pro-rata to reflect the actual period worked.
Treatment of unvested share-based Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive Director under Equinitis share plans will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules.
Usually, any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, injury, disability, retirement with the consent of the Committee, the sale of the entity that employs him or her by Equiniti or any other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, good leaver status may be applied.
Under the PSP, outstanding awards will normally vest at the original vesting date to the extent that the performance condition has been satisfied, and would normally be reduced on a pro-rata basis to reflect the period of time which has elapsed between the grant date and the date on which the participant ceases to be employed by Equiniti.
The Committee retains the discretion to vest awards and measure performance accordingly on cessation and or to dis-apply time pro-rating.
However, it is envisaged that this would only be applied in exceptional circumstances.
Under the DABP, unvested awards will vest at the original vesting date unless the Committee exercises its discretion and allows the award to vest in full on or shortly following the date of cessation.
Change of control Outstanding awards on a takeover, winding up or other corporate event will vest early to the extent that the performance condition has been satisfied, and would normally be reduced on a pro-rata basis to reflect the period of time which has elapsed between the grant date and the date on which the participant ceases to be employed by Equiniti.
The Committee would retain discretion to waive time pro-rating, if it felt it was in the interests of shareholders to do so.
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, awards will be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding company, unless the Committee decides that awards should vest on a basis which would apply in the case of a takeover.
Exercise of discretion In determining whether a departing executive Director should be treated as a good leaver, the Committee will take into account the performance of the individual and the reasons for their departure.
