68 Governance Recruitment and appointment policy The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Companys approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.
Similar considerations may also apply where a Director is promoted to the Board from within the Group.
Element Recruitment policy Basic salary The Committee will take into consideration a number of factors, including the current pay for other Executive Directors, external market forces, skills and current level of pay.
Salary may but need not necessarily be set below the normal market rate, with a series of planned increases implemented over the following few years to bring it to the desired positioning, subject to individual performance.
Benefits Benefits provision would be in line with normal policy.
The Committee may agree that the Company will meet appropriate relocation costs.
Pension In line with normal policy, i. e. a maximum company contribution of no more than 25 per cent of base salary.
Annual bonus Eligible to take part in the annual bonus, with a maximum bonus of up to 200 per cent of salary in line with policy.
Depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee may deem it appropriate to set annual bonus performance metrics different from those that apply to the current Executive Directors for the first performance year in which the appointment falls.
Performance A normal award of up to 225 per cent of salary, in line with policy.
share plan In exceptional circumstances this may be increased up to 400 per cent of salary in order to accommodate any buy-out awards.
Buy-out In exceptional circumstances, the Committee may offer additional awards using Listing Rule 9.4.
Any such awards would be for the specific purpose of recruiting an Executive Director key to the operation awards of the Group.
The awards would not exceed what is felt to be a fair estimate of remuneration forfeited when leaving the former employer and would reflect as far as possible the nature and time horizons attached to that remuneration and the impact of any performance conditions.
The Company would aim to replace any forfeited cash awards with shares wherever possible.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
In the case of an internal executive appointment, any variable salary element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according to its existing terms, adjusted as relevant to take the appointment into account.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment would continue.
For the appointment of a new chairman or non-executive director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy in force at that time.
Notice period and payment for loss of office The Committees policy is that the notice periods for Executive Directors appointed will not exceed one year.
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for a term of three years whereupon they are normally renewed, but generally for no more than three terms in aggregate.
The notice period is one month by either the Company or the non-Executive Director.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for payments on termination.
In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code, all non-Executive Directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM.
Their letters of appointment detail the time commitment expected of each non-Executive Director.
Both these and the Executive Directors service contracts are available for inspection at the registered office during normal business hours and on the date of the AGM.

com 69 Remuneration Committee report continued Termination payments Service contracts may be terminated without notice and without payment or compensation, except for sums earned up to the date of termination of employment, on the occurrence of certain events, such as gross misconduct.
The Company may terminate the contract with immediate effect by making a payment equal to basic salary and, in the case of the current Group Chief Executive, pensions allowance for any unexpired period of notice.
The Committees normal policy on termination is to make phased compensatory payments and to reduce or stop such payments to former Executive Directors where they receive remuneration from other employment during the notice period where this is consistent with local employment legislation and market practice.
The table below sets out key provisions for Directors leaving the Company under their service contracts and the incentive plan rules.
Element Termination policy Salary, benefits Payment will be made up to the termination date in line with relevant contractual notice periods and will not and pension exceed contractual entitlements.
Annual bonus: Annual cash bonus will be paid out, subject to performance against targets set.
Vesting will be on the good leaver normal payment date unless the Committee determines that the payment will be made early on the date of termination of employment in exceptional circumstances only.
The payout will be reduced on a pro-rata basis to reflect the proportion of the performance period served.
Deferred bonus shares will vest on the normal vesting date unless the Committee determines that awards will vest early on the date of termination of employment.
The Committee retains discretion to further reduce the awards granted to reflect any personal performanceissues.
Performance PSP awards will vest, subject to performance on the normal vesting date unless the Committee determines share plan: that the awards will vest early on the date of termination of employment in exceptional circumstances only.
good leaver Awards will normally be reduced on a pro-rata basis unless, exceptionally, the Committee determines that such an adjustment would be inappropriate.
The Committee retains discretion to further reduce the awards granted to reflect any personal performance issues.
Incentive plans: All performance-related elements of pay will lapse immediately at the earlier of notice being served or the date all other leavers of termination, unless by exception the Committee determines that it will lapse on the date of termination.
For all leavers, the Committee may also determine to make a payment in reimbursement of a reasonable level of outplacement and legal fees in connection with a settlement agreement.
The Committee may agree payments it considers reasonable in settlement of legal claims.
This may include an entitlement to compensation in respect of leavers statutory rights under employment protection legislation in the UK or in other jurisdictions.
Change of control There are no enhanced provisions on a change of control.
Discretions and judgements The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and long-term plans according to the rules of each respective plan, their respective ancillary documents and the UKLA Listing Rules, which, consistent with market practice, include discretion in a number of respects in relation to the operation of each plan.
Discretions include: who participates in the plan: determining the timing of grants of awards and or payments: determining the quantum of an award and or payment: determining the extent of vesting: how to deal with a change of control or restructuring of the Group: whether an Executive Director or a senior manager is a good bad leaver for incentive plan purposes and whether the proportion of awards that vest do so at the time of leaving or at the normal vesting date s : how and whether an award may be adjusted in certain circumstances e. g. for a rights issue, a corporate restructuring or for special dividends : what the weighting, measures and targets should be for the annual bonus plan and PSP plans from year to year: and the Committee also retains the ability within the policy to adjust targets and or set different measures or weightings for the annual bonus plan and PSP plans, if events occur that cause it to determine that the conditions are unable to fulfil their original intended purpose.
All historical awards that have been granted by the date this policy comes into effect and still remain outstanding including those detailed on pages 75 to 77 of the annual report on remuneration remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms.
70 Governance Illustration of the proposed remuneration policy for 2017 18 The balance between fixed and variable at risk elements of remuneration changes with performance.
The Companys remuneration policy results in a significant proportion of remuneration received by Executive Directors being dependent on Company performance.
The application of the total remuneration of the Executive Directors for a minimum, target and maximum performance in 2017 18 is presented in the charts below.
These figures are indicative as share price movement and dividend accrual have been removed.

It discloses all the elements of remuneration received by the Directors during the year.
The current remuneration policy, as approved by shareholders in 2014, is as set out in the 2013 14 Annual Report available on our website, www.
2 Taxable benefits in 2016 17 principally include a car allowance of 20,000 for Miles Roberts and 17,500 for Adrian Marsh.
Both Directors also receive income protection, life and health cover.
3 The annual bonus is paid 50% in cash and 50% is deferred into shares as described in the policy table on page 67.
4 The value of LTIs for 2016 17 represents the estimated value of the 2014 PSP and the 2014 share matching plan SMP the performance period for both awards being the three years ending 30 April 2017 and the Sharesave plan which matured on 1 April 2017, which provides a gain of 5,529 for both Miles Roberts and Adrian Marsh.
The LTIs for 2015 16 were valued in the 2015 16 annual report using the average share price for the last three months of that financial year.
This has now been restated based on the share price on the actual vesting dates now that this share price is known.
This also impacts the total figure for the prior year.
Note that the SMP was discontinued in 2014.
5 Miles Roberts receives an annual pension allowance of 30% of basic salary in lieu of membership of the defined contribution scheme.
Adrian Marsh is a member of the defined contribution scheme.
He contributes up to his annual allowance and the Company contribution is paid as a cash supplement.
The annual pension allowances are not pensionable and are not considered to be salary for the purpose of calculating any bonus payment.

3 The amount received in 2016 17 includes payment in respect of Chairman of the Remuneration Committee fee of 10,000 for 1 August 2015 and 1 August 2016.
Variable pay The remuneration policy encourages long-term performance by setting challenging targets linked to sustainable growth for the variable pay, which consists of the annual cash bonus, DSBP and PSP.
The Remuneration Committee can use discretion to adjust the targets, for example after a substantial restructuring, but has not done so in the year under review and would disclose and fully explain if it had.
Performance targets An explanation of the performance conditions for the annual bonus and PSP are set out below.
Total shareholder return TSR TSR is the increase or decrease in the value of a notional investment in a share in the Company and each of the companies in the Industrial Goods and Services supersector within the FTSE 250 over the three-year PSP performance period, taking account of share price movement and the value of dividends which are deemed to be re-invested over that period.
Adjusted earnings per share EPS Adjusted EPS is disclosed in the Companys annual report and accounts and is the portion of the Groups adjusted after tax profit allocated to each outstanding share.
Adjusted EPS is an indicator of the underlying performance of the DS Smith Group.
The extent to which a PSP award subject to this performance condition vests depends on the Companys average adjusted EPS performance over the three financial years.
Return on average capital employed ROACE ROACE is disclosed in the Companys annual report and accounts.
It is defined as operating profit before amortisation and exceptional items divided by average capital employed and is a measure of the efficiency and profitability of the Companys assets and investments.
The performance period for the annual bonus is measured over one year.
The performance period for the PSP is measured over three years with targets based on the average of the three financial years.
Adjusted earnings before tax and amortisation EBTA EBTA is adjusted earnings before taxation and amortisation after the effect of pension interest but does not include the results of our investments in associates.
72 Governance Annual bonus Bonus earned in 2016 17 The Executive Directors targets for the 2016 17 bonus were based on budgeted financial targets set out in the tables below, with annual bonus payments determined by reference to performance over the financial year ended 30 April 2017.

2 The annual bonus will be paid in July 2017 for the financial year 2016 17.
50% of the annual bonus awarded will be deferred for a period of three years in DS Smith shares, and be due to vest in July 2020.
The only qualifying condition for the deferred bonus awards to vest is for the Executive Director to remain in the employment of the Company at the vesting date.
The annual bonus plan for the Executive Directors and other senior executives is operated as shown above.
Bonus results are determined by the Committee after the year end, based on performance against targets.
Bonus awards are measured against the achievement of Group objectives.
Maximum bonus opportunity for 2016 17 is shown above for the Executive Directors and is generally between 70% and 110% for the other senior executives.
Implementation for 2017 18 Implemented in line with policy.
The annual bonus will have a maximum opportunity of 200% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and 175% for the Group Finance Director.
It will be based on EBTA and ROACE, each with equal weighting.
In the event of an acquisition in the year, the Committee will assess whether the financial performance of the acquired company should be included and targets adjusted accordingly, or simply excluded.
In the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the annual bonus measures and targets for 2017 18 are commercially sensitive and accordingly are not disclosed.
These will be disclosed next year in the Directors remuneration report, so that achievement against those targets will be visible, in retrospect.
