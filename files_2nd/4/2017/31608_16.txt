The performance conditions applying to these awards made under the PSP are set out below.
The Committee has confirmed that the same performance conditions will be applied to PSP awards made in December 2017.
The first performance condition for the PSP awards is that the average annual compound growth in the Companys adjusted EPS, over the three consecutive financial years following the financial year immediately prior to the grant, must exceed the specified absolute figures.
The performance conditions are as follows: % of awards vesting Adjusted EPS growth over three years PSP 14% p. a.

For the purposes of this condition, EPS is adjusted EPS as defined in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and this definition remains consistent with the definition of adjusted EPS approved by the Committee in previous years.
The second performance condition compares the growth of the Companys TSR over a three-year period to that of the companies in the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts.

The remuneration of the Executive Director is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to exercise the options to acquire the shares and the total value of the shares on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil cost options on the vesting date he may exercise the options at any time up to the day preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the underlying share price between the initial vesting date and the date of exercise of the option.
This increase or decrease in value reflects an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
The nil cost options outstanding at 30 September 2017 and the movements during the year are as follows: Options Vested unexercised Year of Options as at Exercised in during the as at Exercise Earliest normal 4 vesting 1 Oct 2016 year year 30 Sep 2017 price exercise date Expiry date Bruce Thompson 2016 53,436 53,436 1 Nov 2016 Dec 2023 2017 94,565 94,565 1 Nov 2017 Feb 2025 Nigel Lingwood 2016 34,599 34,599 1 Nov 2016 Dec 2023 2017 61,056 61,056 1 Nov 2017 Feb 2025 1 Bruce Thompson exercised 53,436 options on 30 November 2016, at a market price of 924.0p per share and the total proceeds before tax were 493,748.
