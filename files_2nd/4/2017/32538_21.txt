EPS and relative TSR are considered to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance, in that they ensure the Executive Directors are incentivised and rewarded for the underlying financial performance of the Company as well as creating value for shareholders.
The award is subject to clawback and malus provisions.
EPS growth is measured by taking the compound annual percentage growth in EPS over the performance period.
TSR ranked relative to constituents of the FTSE 100 Index is measured by ranking and comparing the Companys TSR to the relevant TSR targets.
Awards are denominated in shares with vesting dependent on the achievement of performance conditions over a three-year period.
Executive Directors will be required to hold vested awards for two years.
After this time, the value will be calculated by alignment to share price movement, but settled in cash.
Where a Director has not yet met the share ownership guidelines, this cash must be used to purchase shares in the Company.

PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION LEVELS The table below shows how the percentage change in the CEOs salary, benefits and bonus between 2016 and 2017 compared with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for employees in South Africa in local currency.
The Committee selected employees in South Africa, as these provide the most appropriate comparator as they are subject to the same inflationary conditions.
% CHANGE IN CEO SALARY, BENEFITS AND BONUS % CHANGE 1 CEO Salary 40% 2 Benefits 430% 3 Bonus 11% All employees Salary 5.60% Benefits 8.50% 3 Bonus 25% Notes 1 The CEOs percentage change is calculated on the annualised 2016 salary, benefits and bonus as disclosed in last years Directors Remuneration Report.
For the purpose of the CEOs salary, the local salary was translated into GBP at a rate of 1:ZAR20.73 at 1 April 2016 and 1:ZAR17.82 at 1 April 2015.
2 Annualised benefits as disclosed in last years Directors Remuneration Report compared with the current reporting period benefits.
The current reporting period benefits include UK business expense reimbursements due to the Companys LSE listing following the Combination, which was not provided in the prior year.
The change in benefits amounts to an increase amount of 6 357.
3 As disclosed in last years Directors Remuneration Report, the annual bonus opportunity for the CEO increased from 133% to 150%.
The total South African employees percentage change is calculated based on the prior year achievement of 58% of the maximum bonus as disclosed in last years Directors Remuneration Report compared against an achievement of 38% of the maximum bonus in the current period.
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPEND ON STAFF COSTS To place the Directors remuneration in context with the Groups finance, the Committee used the below comparison.
The table below shows the spend on staff costs for the reporting period compared to the spend on staff costs in the 12-month period to 31 December 2015, as disclosed in last years Directors Remuneration Report page 90 compared to returns to shareholders over the same period: 1 2016 17 2015 16 CHANGE 000 000 % Staff costs 1 231 000 150 044 720% 2 Returns to shareholders dividends 62 000 14 878 317% Notes 1 The annual change is not comparable as the 2015 2016 figures are prior to Combination covering the Al Noor employees and returns to shareholders, as compared to the current reporting period covering Mediclinic employees and Mediclinics return to shareholders.

104 MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2018 BASE SALARY None of the Executive Directors received any adjustments to their guaranteed package for the next financial year.
This compares with an average base salary increase of 5.74% for MCSA employees 2016: 5.60%.
Remuneration levels were set with reference to local South African pay levels and a broader international comparison.
Given the widening geographic footprint of the Group, the Committee placed greater weight on the international comparators.
2 There were no salary increases awarded to Executive Directors over the reporting period.
Between 70% and 80% of the total potential remuneration offered to Executive Directors is subject to meeting performance conditions.
STI 2018 The Executive Directors have a maximum STI opportunity of 150% CEO and 133% CFO of annual salary.
Of the achieved award 50% will be deferred in shares for two years.
Deferred shares may be settled in cash, subject to continued employment.
Where awards are cash-settled and a Director has not yet met the share ownership guidelines, this cash must be used to purchase shares in the Company.
Dividends that accrue on the deferred shares during the vesting period may be paid in cash at the time of vesting.
The performance measure for the Executive Directors STI in 2017 18 will be calculated on the combined Group EBITDA performance.
We do not publish details of the financial targets in advance since these are commercially confidential.
We will publish achievement against these targets when we disclose bonus payments in the Annual Report, so that shareholders can evaluate performance against those targets.
The award will be subject to malus and clawback provisions.
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 105 LTIP AWARDS TO BE GRANTED IN 2017 The Committee intends to grant an LTIP conditional award to the Executive Directors in 2017 over shares with a value of 200% CEO and 150% CFO of salary.
Vesting of 60% of the award will be based on EPS growth and the remaining 40% will be determined by TSR measured relative to the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index over three years.
Dividends that accrue during the vesting and holding periods will be paid in cash to the extent that awards have vested.
EPS and relative TSR are considered to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance, in that they ensure the Directors are incentivised and rewarded for the underlying financial performance of the Group and creating value for shareholders.

The underpin evaluation includes consideration of environmental, social and governance factors and financial performance.
The Committee will keep the performance measures under review and may change the performance condition for future awards if they are not considered to be aligned with the Companys interests and strategic objectives.
However, the Committee will consult with major shareholders in advance about any proposed material change in performance measures.
The award will be subject to clawback and malus provisions.
