96 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Governance 2017 Annual bonus During the financial year ended 31 December 2017, the performance measures relating to the annual bonus scheme rules were consistent with the Remuneration Policy, with 85% of the bonus for Ashley Almanza and 70% for Mr Weller being based on achievement of challenging financial performance measures.
The financial performance measures were based on budgeted Group earnings excluding specific and other separately disclosed items and budgeted Group operating cash flow before capital expenditure.
For threshold performance, 35% of maximum entitlement would pay out with on-target performance resulting in a payment of 60% of maximum entitlement, with 100% only being earned in the event of achievement of a stretch performance significantly in excess of budget.
The element of bonus determined for each financial performance measure is calculated by interpolating actual achievement against the range between the minimum i. e. entry threshold and the maximum target to achieve maximum performance.
The remaining 15% of the bonus for Mr Almanza and 30% for Mr Weller was linked to objectives relating to non-financial performance.
These consisted of personal objectives or related to the organisation and were linked to specific elements of the Groups strategy for which the particular director had responsibility.
Each executive director has a number of strategic performance measures linked to areas that the committee has agreed for the year.
The committee reviews the progress in each area and then makes an assessment as to whether the executive has performed in accordance with expectations.
The maximum bonus potential remained unchanged from 2016 at 150% of base pay for both Messrs Almanza and Weller.
Bonuses are paid in cash up to 50% of maximum entitlement.
Where the bonus amount is in excess of 50% of the maximum bonus potential, the amount which exceeds 50% is delivered in the form of a deferred share award which vests after a period of three years.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH AND TABLE The line graph below shows the ten-year annual Total Shareholder Return TSR performance against the FTSE 100 index.
The directors believe this to be an appropriate form of broad equity market index against which to base a comparison, given the size and geographic coverage of the Group and the fact that the company is itself a member of the FTSE100.
Nick Buckles stepped down as CEO on 31 May 2013 and Ashley Almanza took over as CEO from 1 June 2013.
After July 2011, the CEOs total single figure of annual remuneration included payment in lieu of pension.
This was 40% of base pay for Nick Buckles and is 25% of base pay for Ashley Almanza.
Prior to July 2011, a notional sum equal to 40% of relevant base pay has been included.
The value of shares that vested in the relevant year under the PSP or a notional value in the case of shares vested but unexercised has been included in the prior years CEOs total figures, since that is the most relevant year for measurement of performance.
The figures before 2013 did not include taxable expenses.
Bonus % of maximum awarded figure for 2017 is the adjusted figure after a reduction equivalent to 10% of base pay was applied, as recommended by the executive directors and approved by the Remuneration Committee.
PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN CEOS REMUNERATION The table below shows how the percentage change in the CEOs salary, benefits and bonus between 2016 and 2017 compared with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for UK-based G4S employees.
The Remuneration Committee has chosen all employees in the UK who were in employment during the two-year period 2016 and 2017 as the group which should provide the most appropriate comparator, as the Group CEO is based in the UK.

Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 103 Directors remuneration report continued STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2018 Decisions were taken on the basis of the directors remuneration policy approved at the companys 2017 AGM set out on pages 107 to 115.
Executive directors remuneration Base pay For 2018, at the annual pay review, it was decided to increase Messrs Almanza and Wellers base pay by 2% from 939,755 to 958,550 and 643,750 to 656,625 respectively.
These changes took effect from 1 January 2018.
Annual Bonus Scheme The annual bonus for the 2018 financial year will operate on the same basis as that for 2017 and will be consistent with the existing remuneration policy.
The maximum bonus opportunity remains at 150% of base pay for both Ashley Almanza and Tim Weller.
The financial measures of group earnings and operating cash flow remain and revenue will also be included in the financial measures for 2018.
These have been selected as they support the companys key strategic objectives.
As for last year, the financial measures are allocated weightings of 85% for Ashley Almanza.
They have increased to 80% for Tim Weller.
The non-financial measures will therefore account for up to 15% and 20% of the maximum bonus opportunity for Messrs Almanza and Weller respectively.
These non-financial measures are based on the Groups strategy and core values and include the following keyareas: Ashley Almanza Mr Almanzas personal objectives for 2018 cover three key areas, namely strategy, productivity and organisation and are as follows: Strategy Continue to develop the Groups use of technology in its products and services.
Productivity Develop and initiate the next phase of the Group productivity programme.
Organisation Embed new organisation to ensure new teams operate effectively.
Tim Weller For 2018, Mr Wellers personal objectives cover productivity and IT.
Productivity Contribute to Group programme with efficiency improvements in key support functions.
IT Deliver lean process IT project.
Details of the performance measures and targets are deemed to be commercially sensitive since they relate to the 2018 financial year.
To the extent that they are no longer commercially sensitive, targets and performance levels against them will be disclosed in the companys 2018 integrated report and accounts.
The proposed target levels for 2018 have been set to be challenging and align with the Groups strategic priorities and business plan.
In reviewing the targets, the committee took into account a number of factors, including for example the fact that in relation to group earnings, the minimum target that needs to be met in order for any bonus to be payable must be at least equal to the earnings in 2017.
The committee considered the proposed targets relating to non-financial measures and concluded that these were also demanding.
Long Term Incentive Plan The level of awards due to be granted in the 2018 financial year under the LTIP approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM will be consistent with the existing remuneration policy.
As for 2017, the committee considers that a combination of earnings per share growth, total shareholder return and average cash flow targets are the most appropriate performance measures for the 2018 awards, as they provide a robust method of assessing the companys performance, both in terms of underlying financial performance and returns to shareholders.
Awards granted under the LTIP during the 2018 financial year are subject to the performance conditions listed in the table on page 105.

The company calculates whether the EPS performance targets have been achieved by reference to the Groups audited accounts, which provide an accessible and objective measure of the Groups earnings per share.
Adjustments to EPS will be made in respect of: Constant exchange rates in line with previous years, these will be normalised to the rates in the base year Acquisitions earnings will be added to the EPS base at the level used in the acquisition business case Disposals earnings will be removed from the EPS base at the business plan rate Share buy-back the company will only execute buy-backs if the investment is economically accretive and it is in the interest of the company.
The adjusted EPS for the purposes of calculating performance against the LTIP target shall be further adjusted by: a increasing the average number of shares in issue during the performance year by the number of shares bought back during the past three years b decreasing the net interest cost in the performance year in respect of the interest charge on the cash cost of any share buy-backs during the past three years.
Interest will be calculated at the Groups average costs of funds for the year.
The Remuneration Committee will apply discretion in the event of impairment.
If the impairment is not a result of management failure, then it will not impact the pay-out.
The Remuneration Committee may alter the terms of the EPS measure if it feels that it is no longer a fair measure and is no longer incentivising.
Operating cash flow is a measure taken before capital expenditure and investments to ensure that management is not incentivised to under-invest in growth opportunities and before pension deficit repayment.
Operating cash flow is expressed as EBITDA - working capital and provisions movement as a percentage of EBITDA.
Average operating cash flow is the average over three years.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 105 Directors remuneration report continued Non-executive directors remuneration The fees payable to the non-executive directors other than the chairman are set by the executive directors who receive input from the chairman.
The fees payable to the non-executive chairman are set by the Remuneration Committee.
In both cases, fees are reviewed annually.
Fees were last increased in July 2016 for the chairman and July 2015 for non-executive directors.
In July 2017, it was decided to postpone the exercise to the end of the year, so that it would take place at the same time as the pay review for executive directors and employees in general.
The review carried out at the end of 2017 received input from the Remuneration Committees advisor, Deloitte.
As a result of the review, the Remuneration Committee considered and approved a proposed increase of the chairmans fee, in line with the increase applicable to group employees based in the UK, of 2% from January 2018.
The review also resulted in a proposed increase to the basic fee for non-executive directors of 2.8%, from 61,750 to 63,500.
Such increase was within the range of market practice in the FTSE 100 and in line with increases for other employees over the same period.
Consistent with market median for companies ranked 31 100 in the FTSE index and in recognition of the increased demands of the role, the fee for the chair of the Audit Committee increased from 19,000 to 20,000.
There was no proposed increase to the fees for the role of Senior Independent Director or other committee chairs.
All increases took effect from 1 January 2018.

Such appointment is reviewed every year and was confirmed in August 2017.

Further guidance was received from the Groups HR director, Jenni Myles, and the director of compensation and benefits, Sok Wah Lee.
Neither the group chief executive nor the group HR director participated in discussions regarding their own remuneration.
The committee is satisfied that the advice it received during the year was objective and independent based on the experience of its members generally.
Information about who are the members of the Remuneration Committee and their attendance at meetings of the committee during the year under review can be found on pages 74 and 93.

There may be one-off awards for retaining scarce and critical individuals below board level.

When determining base salary increases for executive directors, the Remuneration Committee pays particular attention to the data at senior manager level.
At G4S, the committee does not normally consult directly with employees as part of the process of determining the remuneration policy and pay decisions for executive directors and has not therefore done so in setting this remuneration policy.
However, employee surveys are carried out biennially which help determine employees views of their own pay and benefits, as well as those of colleagues in general.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views We are committed to on-going engagement on key remuneration issues and seek our major shareholders views prior to proposing any major change in policy.
This provides us with valuable feedback and we take into consideration these views and seek to reflect them in our policy.
The chairman of the Remuneration Committee will be available to answer any questions and listen to the views of our shareholders at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
