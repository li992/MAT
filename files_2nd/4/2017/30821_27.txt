Potential reward opportunities are based on Unites remuneration policy, applied to the base salaries effective 1 March 2018.
The annual bonus and LTIP are based on the maximum opportunities set out under the remuneration policy for normal circumstances, being 144% of salary and 200% of salary respectively.
Note that the LTIP awards granted in a year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value is based on the face value at award rather than vesting i. e. the scenarios exclude the impact of any share price movement over the period.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Remuneration 000 84 Corporate governance statement DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED Approach to recruitment remuneration External appointment to the Board In the cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director from outside the Company, the Remuneration Committee may make use of all the existing components of remuneration, as follows: Component Approach Maximum annual grant value Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and their current basic salary.
Where new appointees have initial basic salaries set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period of two to three years subject to the individuals development in the role.
Pension New appointees will receive pension contributions or an equivalent cash supplement not greater than the existing policy.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may include but are not limited to the provision of a company car or cash alternative, private medical SAYE insurance and any necessary relocation expenses.
New appointees will also be eligible to participate in all-employee share schemes.
Performance related The structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with the 144% of salary annual bonus relevant maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year.
Targets for the individual element will be tailored to each executive.
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other 300% of salary executives, as described in the policy table.
The normal aggregate limit of 200% of salary will apply, save in exceptional circumstances, where up to 300% of salary may be awarded.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both Unite and its shareholders.
The Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer on a like-for-like basis, which may be awarded in addition to the remuneration structure outlined in the table above.
In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors, including time to vesting, any performance conditions attached to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met.
Any such buy-out awards will typically be made under the existing annual bonus and LTIP schemes, although in exceptional circumstances the Committee may exercise the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.
2 R to make awards using a different structure.
Any buy-out awards would have a fair value no higher than the awards forfeited.
Internal promotion to the Board In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the policy of the Remuneration Committee and Board will be consistent with the policy for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to Executive Director level, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements.
The Remuneration policy for other employees is set out on page 82.
Incentive opportunities for below Board employees are typically no higher than Executive Directors, but measures may vary to provide better line-of-sight.
Non-Executive Directors In recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will utilise the policy as set out in the table on page 84.
A base fee in line with the prevailing fee schedule would be payable for Board membership, with additional fees payable for acting as Senior Independent Director and or as Chairman of the Boards Committees.
Service contracts and treatment for leavers and change of control Executive Date of service contract J J Lister 1 June 2016 R C Simpson 1 June 2016 R S Smith 1 June 2016 Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee.
In accordance with general market practice, each of the Executive Directors has a rolling service contract requiring 12 months notice of termination on either side.
Such contracts contain no specific provision for compensation for loss of office, other than an obligation to pay for any notice period waived by the Company, where pay is defined as salary, benefits and any other statutory payments only.
Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 85 The Remuneration Committee will exercise discretion in making appropriate payments in the context of outplacement, settling legal claims or potential legal claims by a departing Executive Director, including any other amounts reasonably due to the Executive Director, for example to meet the legal fees incurred by the Executive Director in connection with the termination of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement and where the individual must seek independent legal advice.
When considering exit payments, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and participants.
The table below summarises how the awards under the annual bonus and LTIP are typically treated in specific circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the Committees discretion: Reason for leaving Calculation of vesting payment Annual bonus Resignation No annual bonus payable.

The determination of vesting will be made as soon as reasonably practical following the end of the performance period or such earlier date as the Committee may agree within 12 months in the event of death.
Change of control In the event of a change of control, Unite awards may alternatively be exchanged for new equivalent awards in the acquirer where appropriate.

4 2016 figures: LTIP awards granted in 2014, and which vested based on performance to 31 December 2016, are valued using the market price at the date of vesting 10 April 2017 of 642.0 pence.
These amounts have been revised from last years report to reflect the actual share prices on the dates of vesting.
2017 figures: For the 2015 awards, the market price on the date of vesting is currently unknown and so the value shown is estimated using the average market value over the last quarter of 2017 of 727.9 pence.
See following sections for further details.
For both 2016 and 2017, LTIP figures include cash payments in lieu of dividends for vested awards.

2 Manjit Wolstenholme served as Non-Executive Director until her death in November 2017.
Incentive outcomes for the year ended 31 December 2017 audited Performance related annual bonus in respect of 2017 performance The 2017 annual bonus consists of two elements, corporate and individual.
The corporate element of the bonus is calculated on a sliding scale up to a maximum of 120% of base salary, in accordance with which on target performance by the Group results in a corporate bonus of an amount equivalent to 70% of base salary.
To determine the actual bonus payment to an Executive Director, a multiplier being the individual element of the scheme, ranging between 0 and 1.2, is applied against the corporate bonus.
Applying the maximum individual multiplier of 1.2, against the maximum corporate bonus of 120% of base salary, results in a maximum annual performance related bonus opportunity of 144% of base salary.
However, bonus payments at that level would only be made subject to the achievement of extremely stretching corporate performance targets and exceptional individual performance by the relevant Executive Director.
Target performance typically requires meaningful improvement on the previous years outturn, and for financial measures, targets are typically in line with the upper end of market consensus.
The performance related bonuses awarded in respect of 2017 reflect corporate bonuses of 83.2% of base salary.
After applying individual multipliers, actual performance related bonus payments awarded to the Executive Directors were 63.6% of their maximum bonus opportunities.
Further details, including the targets set and performance against each of the metrics, are provided in the following tables.

The individual element of the 2017 annual bonus saw greater emphasis on shared objectives, reflecting the reshaped executive teams collaborative ethos.
Against these stretching objectives, the Committee considers that Executive Directors continued to develop strongly in their new and expanded roles, particularly in light of a number of external challenges throughout the year.

2017 financial performance was strong, evidenced in particular by the above-target EPS and TAR performances, while against both the customer satisfaction measure and the newly introduced University reputation measure, the Group delivered in line with its stretching plan and remains on track to achieve its longerterm goals.
An overall bonus outcome of 63.6% of maximum is an improvement on 2016, which the Committee feels is appropriate taking into account the underlying performance of the Group and the strong individual progress of our Executive Directors.
Having already reached their respective share ownership guidelines, each Executive Director will receive 100% of their bonus awards in cash.

Percentage change in CEO remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared with the average percentage change in remuneration for all employees.
The CEOs remuneration includes base salary, taxable benefit and annual bonus and for 2016 is calculated as an aggregate of the remuneration of Mark Allan until 31 May 2016 and of Richard Smith thereafter annual bonus relates to Richard Smith full year.
The pay for all other employees is calculated using the increase in the earnings of full-time employees for tax years 2016 and 2017.

Review of past performance The following graph charts the TSR of the Company and the FTSE 350 Real Estate Super Sector Index over the nine-year period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2017.
While there is no comparator index or group of companies that truly reflects the activities of the Group, the FTSE 350 Real Estate Super Sector Index the constituent members of which are all property holding and or development companies or real estate investment trusts within the UK was chosen as it reflects trends within the UK property market generally and tends to be the index against which analysts judge the performance of the Company.
The table below details the Chief Executives single figure remuneration over the same period.

The Committee has approved a maximum bonus opportunity for each executive of 144% of salary, consisting of a maximum of 120% of salary under the corporate element and a maximum individual multiplier of 1.2x.
For 2018, the corporate element of the annual bonus will continue to be based on a combination of financial and non-financial measures, weighted 75% and 25% respectively.
University Reputation, which was included in the annual bonus for the first time in 2017, will maintain a 12.5% weighting.
As with last years bonus, it is intended that the majority of 2018 objectives under the individual performance multiplier will be shared across each of the Executive Directors.
Proposed target levels have been set to be challenging relative to business plan, although specific targets are deemed to be commercially sensitive at this time.
It is the Committees current intention to disclose these targets, and the key achievements by each Executive Director, retrospectively in the 2018 Directors Remuneration Report.
Annual bonuses will continue to be paid in cash, unless the recipient has not met their shareholding guidelines, in which case up to 50% of the amount payable will be satisfied by an allocation of shares in the Company deferred for three years.
Clawback and malus provisions apply to all awards.
LTIP For 2018, the LTIP will continue to operate broadly on the same basis as in the 2017 financial year.
The Committee, having considered the performance of the Company and other relevant factors, intends that Executive Directors will each receive an award equivalent to a maximum of 200% of salary delivered through a combination of the PSP and ESOS, with the final level of vesting dependent on the achievement of three-year performance targets relating to EPS, TAR and TSR, as follows: Measure Weighting Targets 0% vesting below 40 pence 25% vesting for 40 pence 2020 Adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS 1 3 100% vesting for 46 pence or more Straight-line vesting between these points.
Total Accounting Return TAR 25% vesting for 7% p. a.

Targets have been set with reference to internal and external reference points, including our strategic plan and broker consensus estimates, and are designed to be stretching but achievable for participants.
Full vesting under each element will require continued exceptional performance over the next three years.
Any awards vesting for performance will be subject to an additional two-year holding period, during which time clawback provisions will also apply.
Further details of the grant date and number of interests awarded will be disclosed in the 2018 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Implementation of Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy for 2018 Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees During the final quarter of 2017, the Board undertook its annual review of Non-Executive Director fees.
Following consideration of salary increases across the Group and indicative fee increases at sector and FTSE comparators, the Board determined that the basic fee should be increased from 45,900 p. a. to 46,800 p. a. and that additional fees should be increased by a similar rate.
The Committee, in considering similar factors, determined that the fee payable to the Chairman of the Board should be increased from 185,000 to 188,700.
Each of these fee increases is in line with increases applied to the broader employee population.
A summary of the fee increases, which are effective 1 January 2018, is set out in the table below.
