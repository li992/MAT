Consideration of remuneration conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee considers the remuneration and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group together with current market practice when determining remuneration for the Executive Directors.
In addition to the UK comparator group set out on page 73, the levels of remuneration, annual bonus and PSP awarded to the Presidents of each of the Group's operating companies are taken into consideration, notwithstanding that these reflect such businesses' particular trading positions and the geographical and technical employment markets in which they operate.
However, the Committee does not consult specifically with employees on the Executive Remuneration Policy.
Consideration of shareholders' views The Committee takes into account the views of the Company's shareholders and best practice guidelines set by shareholder representative bodies when determining Executive remuneration.
The proposals for the 2017 Remuneration Policy were the subject of consultation with the Company's significant institutional shareholders and their representative bodies and their feedback was incorporated into the final policy approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
Details of the votes received on the 2017 Remuneration Policy and annual Directors' Remuneration Report at the 2017 AGM are provided on page 78.

D. Performance Share Plan PSP audited PSP awards to the Executive Directors are currently structured so that one-third of the award is subject to an EPS target, one-third is subject to a TSR target and one-third is subject to an Economic Profit EP target.
Each condition operates over a fixed three-year period being the three financial years commencing with the financial year in which an award is made in respect of the EPS and EP conditions: and three years from the date of grant in respect of the TSR condition with no opportunity for re-testing.
The TSR performance condition is measured independently by Aon.
PSP awards granted during 2017 audited The table below details share options granted to Executive Directors, in line with the Remuneration Policy, under the PSP scheme during 2017.
The maximum level of grant remains at 200% of base salary, calculated according to the average of the closing share price over the five days commencing with the day of the AGM 26 May 2017 and rounded down to the nearest ten shares.
The awards were granted on 6 June 2017.
A holding period of two years applies following vesting.

However, based on the interim TSR performance results provided by Aon as at 31 December 2017, for the TSR performance period to 5 March 2018, part of the award up to a maximum of one-third may vest on the TSR measure in March 2018 see tables below.

The three-year period over which the TSR performance condition is measured ends on 5 March 2018.
Based on the interim TSR performance results prepared by Aon as at 31 December 2017, TSR relative to the FTSE 250 index excluding Investment Trusts and the Company ranked above median at 27.8% resulting in an estimated vesting of 25.7% for this element of the 2015 PSP awards.

Awards lapse if they do not vest on the third anniversary of their award.
E. Retirement benefits audited The Executive Directors are entitled to a defined contribution pension contribution of 25% of base salary.
In light of the pension lifetime allowance of 1 million and the maximum annual pension contribution allowance of 40,000, the Executive Directors are entitled, at their option, to a taxable salary supplement in lieu of some or all of such pension contributions.
Both Executive Directors have chosen this option and each receives a 25% cash payment in lieu of participation in a Spectris pension scheme.
No Executive Director participated in a defined benefit pension plan during the year, nor currently participates in a defined benefit plan.
F. All-employee share plans audited Options granted to John OHiggins on 18 September 2014 under the Spectris Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE Scheme vested on 1 December 2017 and were exercised to acquire 446 ordinary shares at an option price of 2,015 pence per share giving a total exercise value of 8,986.90.
The option price was set at the time of grant based on the closing mid-market price of the Companys shares on 20 August 2014, being the last business day prior to the grant date.
Although the SAYE Scheme rules permit the option price to be discounted up to a maximum of 20% of the market price at the time of grant, no discount was applied to the option price.
The exercise price therefore reflects fair value as at the date of grant.
The closing market price on 1 December 2017 was 2,442 pence per share producing a total gain on exercise of 1,904.42.
Payments for loss of office or to past Directors audited No compensation payments on termination of employment were made to Directors during the year and no payments were made to former Directors.

Historical Chief Executive remuneration The table below shows the total remuneration figure for the Chief Executive for the current year and over the previous eight years.
The total remuneration figure includes the annual bonus and PSP awards that vested based on performance in those years.
The annual bonus and PSP percentages show the pay-out for each year as a percentage of the potential maximum.
Percentage change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive The table below shows the percentage change in the salary, benefits and annual bonus of the Chief Executive compared with the change in the Executive team excluding the Chief Executive and in the Groups UK-based employees between the year ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017.
The Committee has selected this comparator group on the basis that the Chief Executive is UK-based and this provides a local market reference and a sufficiently large comparator group based on a similar incentive structure to the Chief Executive, and reduces any distortion arising from currency and cost of living differences in other geographies in which Spectris operates.

Total employee pay is the total pay costs for all Group employees.
Adjusted profit before tax has been used as a comparison as this is a key financial metric which the Board considers when assessing the Groups financial performance.

74 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Directors shareholdings and share interests audited Directors' shareholding requirements Each Executive Director is, subject to personal circumstances, required to build a retained shareholding in Spectris plc of at least three times base salary in value and is required to apply the post-tax benefit of any vested PSP awards or any bonus payments exceeding 60% of base salary to the acquisition of shares until this required level of shareholding is achieved.
Both Executive Directors currently have holdings in excess of this requirement.
There is no such requirement in respect of the Chairman or Non-executive Directors, who have discretion as to whether to hold the Companys shares or not.
Executive Directors interests in shares The beneficial interest of each Executive Director including their closely associated persons in the shares of the Company, as at 31 December 2017, is as follows: Interests in share plans Shares held as at Percentage of Total interests 1 2 3 Director 31 December 2017 requirement achieved PSP SAYE in shares John OHiggins 287,550 399% 164,670 452,220 Clive Watson 131,000 287% 104,560 1,036 236,596 Notes: 1.

The Spectris Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2007 expired on 25 May 2017 and was replaced by a new SAYE scheme, on substantially the same terms, on 26 May 2017.
This Scheme is a HMRC tax-favoured savings-related share option scheme open to all employees.
No performance conditions attached to SAYE options other than continuous service.
No grants were made under the SAYE Scheme during 2017.
The face value of SAYE awards is calculated using the exercise price.
The option exercise price was set at the time of grant based on the closing mid-market share price on the day immediately before the invitation date.
Although the SAYE Scheme rules permit the option price to be discounted up to a maximum of 20% of the market price at the time of grant, no such discount was applied to the option price.
Shareholders approved a three-year extension to the Spectris Performance Share Plan 2006 in 2014 and a further extension in 2017 for ten years.
The PSP awards are conditional rights to acquire shares and are nominal cost options.
The exercise price is the nominal value of a Spectris ordinary share, which is 5 pence.
The level of PSP awards granted in 2016 and 2017 was 200% of base salary, calculated using the relevant market value at the date of the award, which was: i 1,713.6 pence per share for 2016, based on the average of the mid-market closing price of the Companys ordinary shares over the five business days prior to the date of grant.
The number of shares awarded were rounded down to the nearest ten shares: and ii 2,630.8 pence per share for 2017, based on the average of the mid-market closing share price over the five days commencing with the day of the AGM 26 May 2017.
The number of shares awarded were rounded down to the nearest ten shares.
The face value of the PSP awards is calculated using the average five-day closing mid-market price at date of award as explained in i above.
PSP awards to the Executive Directors are currently structured so that one-third of the award is subject to an EPS target, one-third is subject to a TSR target and one-third is subject to an Economic Profit EP target.
PSP awards granted in 2017 are subject to an additional two-year holding period following the initial three-year vesting period.
Under the terms of the PSP, notional dividends of the Company are applied at vesting over award shares during the period until vesting and for any applicable holding period until exercise thereby increasing the number of award shares granted.
These additional award shares are subject to application of the performance criteria attaching to the award.

WACC was set at 11% for the 2015, 2016 and 2017 awards except that lower transitional rates will be applied for subsequent acquisitions.
Any impairment of goodwill over a performance period will be added back to capital employed.
The TSR performance condition is measured independently by Aon Hewitt.
The EPS figure is obtained from the audited Financial Statements and the calculation of achievement against growth condition is presented to and approved by the Committee.
The Committee will also monitor outcomes for the EP measure to ensure that they achieve the original objectives and may adjust the vesting accordingly.
Any exercise of discretion will be justified in the next Directors Remuneration Report.
Similarly, the Committee must satisfy itself that the Companys relative TSR performance is reflective of its underlying financial performance.
76 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Dilution limits In line with best practice, the use of new or treasury shares to satisfy the vesting of awards made under all of the Companys share plans PSP and SAYE combined is restricted to 10% in any ten-year rolling period.
A further restriction applies to the PSP plan of 5% over the same period of which 3.98% has been utilised.

The contracts of employment in respect of John OHiggins and Clive Watson contain an option, at the sole discretion of the Board, for the contract to be terminated by way of payments in lieu of notice equivalent to 1.4 times monthly base salary for the outstanding months of the notice period.
Such payment accounts for: the 25% employer pension contribution: company car, insurance and fuel benefits: mobile telephone provision: life, disability and medical expenses insurances: and settlement of any statutory employment claims that may arise upon termination, but excludes any element of compensation for loss of bonus and is in full and final settlement of all employment-related claims.
