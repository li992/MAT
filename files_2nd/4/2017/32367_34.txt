The table below sets out the performance measures and their respective weightings for the year ending 31 March 2018: Performance measures Weighting Description Capital Growth 50% Growth of the Companys property portfolio against IPDs relevant Capital Growth Index for the year to 31March 2018 with 16.67% of this element payable at Index and 100% at Index 2.5% 1 Total Accounting Return 30% Growth of EPRA NAV plus dividends paid against target range of 4% at which point 20% of this element is payable 10% for the year to 31 March 2018.

Any dividends will be deducted from the base gure from the point of distribution as it is not realistic to deliver growth after capital has been repaid to shareholders, except where reected in some other way, such as through a share consolidation.
The Committee is of the opinion that, given the commercial sensitivity around GPEs business, disclosing precise individual targets for the Annual Bonus Plan in advance would not be in the best interests of shareholders or the Company.
Objectives, performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the performance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts.
Annual Report 2017 Great Portland Estates 109 LTIP SMP performance measures for the year ending 2018 Following the consolidation of the LTIP and SMP into a single plan, the maximum potential for the 2017 LTIP is, assuming shareholders approve the proposed changes to the LTIP rules, 300% compared to 200% and 100% of salary granted under the LTIP and SMP respectively in 2016.
The following performance measures apply to awards to be granted in 2017.
LTIP SMP awards Start of Performance measure over three years % of award Vesting level measurement period 20% Straight-line vesting 100% between these points Total Accounting Return 33% 4% p. a.
1 April prior to grant TSR against constituents of FTSE 350 Real Estate Sector Upper excluding agencies 33% Median quartile Grant date Total Property Return against IPD Index Total Property Return central London index 33% Index 1.5% p. a.
1 April prior to grant The proposed remuneration policy, if approved by shareholders, will introduce a two year holding period on future LTIP awards, whereby participants will not be permitted to sell any vested awards until the fifth anniversary of grant save to meet any tax liabilities.
The holding period will generally continue to operate post cessation of employment.
While both the plan rules and previous shareholder approved policy permit outstanding awards to accrue dividend roll-up over any vesting period, previous practice was to only accrue such dividend roll-up on SMP awards.
Given the longer period to release i. e. five years, it is considered appropriate to permit dividend roll-up over the consolidated LTIP award.
