90% of bonus was based on financial performance of which 60% was linked to underlying Profit Before Tax PBT and 30% on Group Working Capital and 10% on Health & Safety.
Further details of the bonuses paid, including the financial and non-financial targets and objectives set and actual performance, are provided in the tables below: FINANCIAL ELEMENT Performance targets Weighting Actual Payout Measure % of salary Threshold Target Stretch performance % of salary Original underlying PBT 60% 77.43m 81.50m 85.58m n a n a Revised underlying PBT 60% 71.10m 74.90m 78.60m 79.20m 60% Group Working Capital to Sales 30% 8.90% 8.40% 7.90% 9.00% nil Total 90% 60% The underlying PBT targets stated above have been adjusted from those originally set at the commencement of the performance year, to reflect that certain of the Groups businesses were closed, divested or placed under review during the performance year.
The underlying PBT targets were adjusted proportionately to account for these changes in the Groups businesses.
The figures stated in the table above reflect the Groups published underlying PBT for 2017 as stated in the Financial Statements on page 100 of this report, which do not factor in results for business which were closed, divested or under review in 2017.
The Committee is satisfied that the adjusted targets are not materially easier or more difficult to achieve than the targets as originally set.
The adjustment has resulted in 60% of the proportion of annual bonuses referable to PBT vesting.
The Bonus is calculated as a percentage of base salary however payment generated is pro rata for the year for the Executive Directors.
NON-FINANCIAL ELEMENT For 2017, non-financial performance was measured through the Companys Health & Safety performance, focusing on the Groups Accident Incident Rate AIR and Health & Safety initiatives.
The Committee reviewed performance and determined that the targets were achieved in full, and 10% of bonus out of a maximum of 10% was payable.
OVERALL BONUS OUTCOMES Based on performance in respect of both the financial and non-financial elements, an overall outcome of 70% out of a maximum of 100% was warranted.
Mr N. W. Maddock and Mr M. Oldersma received bonuses of 70% of pro-rated salary for 2017.
Two-thirds of the bonus will be paid in March 2018 and one-third will be deferred into shares, vesting in March 2021.
As in previous years, bonus payments are subject to clawback ie forfeiture or reduction in exceptional circumstances.
Mr D. G. Robertson retired from the Board on 31 January 2017 and ceased as an employee on 28 February 2017.
He was eligible to receive a pro-rated bonus in respect of the period 1 January 2017 to 28 February 2017, subject to performance as determined and approved in the normal manner.
The Committee noted that investigations relating to the historical overstatement of profit had concluded that Mr Robertson was not aware of or involved in the irregularities identified but decided that, due to his position of responsibility, no bonus should be payable to Mr Robertson for 2017.
The Committee concluded that there was no reason to apply clawback for previous years.
Details of the irregularities identified are fully described on page 61 of the Corporate Governance report.
Mr M. Ewell did not participate in any incentive plans during the period he served as Interim Chief Executive.
