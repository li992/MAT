PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES FOR INCENTIVE PLANS AUDITED The Committee continues to be committed to aligning disclosure of the annual bonus operation as closely as possible with investors expectations and market best practice.
In previous years, the Committee has adopted the approach that financial targets would normally be disclosed retrospectively in the following year.
The 2016 Directors Remuneration Report provided details of the targets which had applied to the 2015 annual bonus and stated an intention to disclose the 2016 financial targets in the 2017 Directors Remuneration Report.
The Board considers the 2017 financial targets to be commercially sensitive, given their close link to the Groups long-term strategy.
Furthermore, it is the Committees belief that disclosing targets for 2017 at this stage would put the Group at a competitive disadvantage.
Therefore, the Committee has taken the same approach as previously for the disclosure of financial targets.
In line with the commitment in the 2016 Directors Remuneration Report, the Committee has this year disclosed the targets in full in relation to the 2016 awards as they are no longer deemed to be commercially sensitive.
Strategic Report Governance Financials esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 It is the Committees intention to disclose financial targets in relation to 2017 awards in the 2018 Directors Remuneration Report, when they are no longer expected to be commercially sensitive.
The Committee remains mindful of evolving market practice around the disclosure of financial targets and will continue to monitor the ongoing appropriateness of this approach going forward and in light of shareholder feedback.
In terms of the disclosure of strategic and non-financial objectives, comprehensive disclosure has been provided as far as possible in respect of the 2017 awards.
Details of non-financial targets for 2017 awards have been disclosed on page 56.
ANNUAL BONUS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2017 AUDITED The annual bonus for 2017 was based 60% on a financial measure, 15% on strategic measures and 25% on personal and customer measures.
A risk adjustment process is in place for all measures and is described later in this section.
The illustrations below detail the CEO and CFOs performance outcome against each category of performance measure.
The CEO stepped down on 18 January 2018 and therefore was eligible to receive an annual bonus award in respect of the 2017 performance year.
Overall, an outcome of 56% of maximum opportunity was awarded to the CEO, resulting in an annual bonus award of 70% of salary.
CEO Actual 22.5% 7.5% 26% Total actual: 56% Maximum 25% 15% 60% Total max: 100% Personal and customer Strategic Financial Overall, an outcome of 60.8% of maximum opportunity was awarded to the CFO, resulting in an annual bonus award of 76% of salary.

Targets are set by the Committee each year with reference to the commercial environment.
Actual trading profit from continuing operations was 111.3m and represented a good set of financial results for the year under review.
Targets for 2017 will be published in the 2018 Directors Remuneration Report.
See below for an illustration of how the performance outcome was calculated.
Threshold Target Maximum 0% 25% 50% 100% 43.3% Actual PERFORMANCE AGAINST STRATEGIC, PERSONAL AND CUSTOMER OBJECTIVES AUDITED The specific strategic element was introduced to the annual bonus for the first time in 2016 and enabled a focused assessment of the Executive Directors delivery of the strategic priorities for esure Group.
In 2017 the focus was on growth in policy numbers, footprint expansion and delivering the IT strategy.
The personal measures aim to emphasise the importance of developing organisational capability and enhancing succession plans throughout the organisation and of operating within a prescribed risk and conduct framework.
esures employees are an essential asset for delivering sustainable growth and the personal element of the annual bonus enables an assessment of the Executive Directors capabilities in supporting and developing the workforce.
The customer measures focus on embedding a culture that places customers at the heart of esures business and is based on achievement against a wide range of measures which are assessed monthly and cover the broad range of customer outcomes.
5 54 5 4 55 5 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Annual Report on Remuneration continued As in previous years, the scale for the non-financial measures ranges from not achieved to fully achieved.
Following an independent review by the Chief Risk Officer of the level of performance achieved, the Committee deemed that the CEO had achieved 30% of his objectives, and that the CFO had achieved 34.8% of his objectives out of a maximum of 40%.
The table below provides further information on the strategic, personal and customer measures.
Performance for all elements will be determined to be fully achieved 100% vesting, partially achieved 50% vesting or not achieved 0% vesting.

The Remuneration Committee has discretion to scale back annual bonus payments in the event of, inter alia, risk or regulatory compliance issues and also in the event that the level of bonus represents, in the Committees view, an excessive proportion of the Groups overall profitability.
There were no events in 2017 as confirmed by the Chief Risk Officer which led the Committee to determine that a scale back of the annual bonus payment was appropriate.
In addition, the Committee did not consider that the level of bonus represented an excessive proportion of the Groups overall profitability such that it should be scaled back.
Awards in 2017 were subject to deferral arrangements in line with the Directors Remuneration Policy.
30% of awards will be deferred into shares, with the deferred portion vesting in equal thirds over three years.

Performance was assessed for the period from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017.
Awards were subject to EPS performance two-thirds and relative TSR performance one-third with performance measured over a three-year period.
EPS was measured on a straight-line basis between a threshold growth target of 15% and a stretch target of 39%.
The Groups TSR was ranked against the constituents of the FTSE 250, excluding investment trusts and esure.
25% of the TSR element of the award vests for median performance rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting for upper quartile ranking or above.
EPS growth targets 2015 awards Threshold 25% vesting 15% Stretch 100% vesting 39% EPS performance was below 15% growth which was below threshold for the performance period, resulting in nil vesting under this element of the award.
Relative TSR performance was above upper quartile of the peer group, resulting in 100% vesting of the TSR portion.
Therefore the 2015 awards achieved an overall vesting outcome of one-third of the maximum award available.

com, the Committee determined that an adjustment to the measurement of EPS performance was necessary to enable continued measurement of performance on a like-for-like basis.
Therefore, the Committee used its discretion to determine that the 2015 EPS condition will be measured by excluding the impact of Gocompare.
com from the base year EPS i. e. comparing base year EPS for esure Group only with the final year EPS for esure Group at the end of the performance period.
The growth targets themselves remain unchanged.
This approach to determining EPS performance following the demerger was set out in the 2016 Directors Remuneration Report.

ANNUAL BONUS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2016 AUDITED As stated in the 2016 Directors Remuneration Report, financial targets for the annual bonus awards received in relation to that year were not disclosed owing to their commercial sensitivity.

The maximum awards under the Policy are 300% for the Chief Executive Officer and 250% for the Chief Finance Officer and the Committee reviews the appropriateness of opportunities granted annually.
Darren Ogdens SLP grant will be calculated with reference to his higher temporary salary for the role of Interim Chief Executive Officer.

The 2018 awards will be subject to two independent performance conditions.
Three-quarters of the award will be determined by reference to growth in absolute total shareholder return and one quarter will be determined by reference to relative total shareholder return as set out below.
Performance will be measured over a three-year period beginning on 1 January 2018.
Awards will vest, subject to performance, on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
Following vesting, all awards will then be subject to a post-vesting holding period of two years.
Vesting will be determined with reference to four points, as below.
