Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Directors Remuneration Report Susan Kilsby, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Introduction During 2017, the main focus of the Remuneration Committees work has been finalising the new Directors Remuneration Policy.
The new policy is described below and will be put to shareholders at the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
The Committee has also dealt with a change of both the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director.
In considering the new policy the Committee reviewed the principles of the existing policy that recognise, among other things: the cyclicality of our business: the importance of pay for performance: and that a significant element of remuneration for executive directors and the senior management team should be aligned to longterm performance.
These principles are unchanged and they are set out in full in the introduction to the policy on page 76.
Although the Company is listed in London, the majority of the senior management team and the majority of the Groups business is based in the United States and this, together with the views of shareholders, have been significant factors in the Committees decisions.
New policy As shareholders will recall we had initially anticipated that we would put a new policy to shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
However, as we were still engaged with shareholders up to the deadline for the 2017 AGM we decided to continue with the consultation process before putting a new policy to shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM.
At the start of 2017, the Committee was confident that three of the proposed changes that had been subject to the earlier consultation had overwhelming support from shareholders.
These changes were compatible with the existing policy and, accordingly, they were introduced for 2017.
These changes are all carried forward into the new policy.
They include: Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP We introduced total shareholder return TSR compared to the FTSE 250 as a third performance condition in addition to return on invested capital ROIC and earnings per share EPS growth.
We also added a two-year holding requirement for LTIP awards to further align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders.
Minimum Shareholding Requirement We increased the shareholding requirement for executive directors from 200% of salary to 300% of salary.
Extended LTIP We decided that the ELTIP would not operate in 2017.
In addition, it will not be part of the new policy.
This reduces the maximum incentive opportunity under the new policy and simplifies the remuneration structure.
56 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report These changes were welcomed by shareholders, as can be seen in the vote for the Setting performance conditions 2016 Annual Report on Remuneration which received 99.8% support.
The following points should be noted in respect of the Committees proposed approach to setting performance conditions and targets for the DSP under the new policy: Proposed Policy for 2018 and beyond Our consultation with shareholders, representing over half of issued shares and where strategic and operational objectives are used, the Committee will ensure the main shareholder representative bodies continued throughout 2017.
The main that a significant component of the targets set are capable of quantifiable focus of the consultation was on the Deferred Stock Plan and, in particular, on the assessment: performance conditions, the vesting profile, the maximum size of the award, and the increase in the incentive opportunity will be accompanied by an appropriate a corresponding adjustment to the maximum award under the LTIP.
We made increase in the stretch of the performance conditions: and a number of changes to the proposed policy as a direct result of feedback from the objectives and the performance against those objectives will be fully shareholders.
disclosed in the remuneration report in the following year.
The Committee recognises shareholders sensitivity to quantum in the current market.
In response to this sensitivity, the maximum opportunities under the New Executive Team incentive arrangements have been reduced under the new policy.
The DSP is particularly important given a new CEO and Finance Director as it will help facilitate the build-up of shares early in their tenure subject to performance which The table below summarises the changes in opportunities in variable remuneration: have to be retained for five years.
In the Committees opinion, other benefits of the revised DSP are: Element of reward Existing policy Proposed policy Net annual change Defers an annual incentive in shares that supports the build-up of a long-term Bonus 62.5% 65.0% 2.5% locked-in shareholding aligning the interests of management with shareholders: DSP 72.5% 125.0% 52.5% Manages reward through the cyclicality of the business: LTIP 190.0% 150.0% -40.0% Allows potential for award value to grow due to share price appreciation helping E-LTIP 110.0% every 3 years 36.6% 0.0% -36.6% drive longer-term decision making: and TOTAL 361.6% 340.0% -21.6% F acilitates malus and clawback provisions by having a significant proportion of the incentives earned deferred in shares and under the control of the Company post The maximum variable opportunity is being reduced from just over 360% of salary the determination of the reward for a particular year.
per year to 340% under the proposed policy.
Whilst, the expected fair value of the new proposed policy is unchanged when measured against the current policy, the LTIP Committee believes that the proposed shape of the new incentives better supports As noted above, the Committee introduced two changes to the LTIP in 2017. the Companys strategy over the next period and is better suited to an employee These were the addition of a two-year holding period following a vesting and the base that is predominantly based in the US.

continue under the new policy.
The only additional change proposed under the new policy is the reduction in the maximum size of the award from 190% of salary to Bonus 150% of salary.
Further to shareholder feedback on quantum, the Committee is now proposing that the maximum cash bonus opportunity remains broadly the same at 65% versus The Committee has retained the LTIP as it wishes to ensure that a significant part of 62.5%.

The Committee has included TSR in the LTIP performance conditions for the 2017 DSP award and intends to continue to use it under the new policy because TSR is aligned Overview to shareholders ownership experience.
The Committee recognises the range of The new policy proposes three changes to the DSP: shareholder views on TSR as a performance measure for LTIP awards and, having an increase in the maximum size of the award from 72.5% of salary to 125% considered these differing views, on balance decided to include it.

3 The LTIP awards shown in the 2016 figures above have been restated.
The original disclosure was based on the average share price in the last quarter of 2016 which was 261.23 pence.
When the awards vested on 21 March 2017 the share price was 307.05 pence.
The awards were disclosed in the 2016 report because the three-year performance period for these awards granted in 2014 ended on 31 December 2016.
4 Mike Powells 2014 LTIP award was delayed due to the timing of his recruitment.
The performance period for these awards ended on 31 December 2016 prior to the point at which Mike Powell gave the Company notice.
The award was released at 23.3% in August 2017 and is disclosed in the 2016 figures because the financial performance conditions ended during that year.
5 The LTIP awards granted in 2015 will vest at 50% of the maximum and are disclosed in the table above.
The value disclosed is based on the share price in the last quarter of 2017 which was 325.66 pence.
6 The Deferred Stock Plan awards that are expected to be granted in 2018 are disclosed in the table above because the operating profit used to calculate the pool was over the three financial years ending 31 December 2015, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017 and the strategic objectives were measured at the end of 2017.
The details of these DSP awards are shown on page 66.

62 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Base salary for executive directors In December 2016, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the base salaries for the executive directors and their salaries were increased in line with increases for other members of staff.
The base salary effective from 1 January 2017 for Simon Pryce was 680,572.50 and for Mike Powell was 432,600.00.
When David Crook was appointed finance director on 1 June 2017 his base salary was set at 375,000.
The base salary was set to be competitive looking at our US peers, the general UK FTSE 250 and was lower than the outgoing Group Finance Director to reflect the difference in experience.
When Wayne Edmunds was appointed Interim Group Chief Executive with effect from 1 July 2017 the Remuneration Committee felt that, given the interim nature of the role, it would be appropriate to pay him a base salary only with no bonus or equity awards.
Wayne Edmunds was appointed on a basic salary of $2,500,000 per annum.
The basic salary rate was based on the average single figure paid by the Company over the previous period to the former Group Chief Executive.
The Committee did not feel it appropriate to operate the bonus plan given that the expected tenure was less than one year and it would also be inappropriate to make any awards under the DSP or LTIP.
No further payments will be made to the Interim Group Chief Executive other than the salary for the period that he holds the office.
Fees for the Chairman and non-executive directors The fees for the Chairman and the non-executive directors are in the single figure table.
In accordance with the arrangements on appointment there was no change to the fee payable to the Chairman in respect of 2017.
The non-executive directors fees were increased in line with the increases for other members of staff.
The fee for the senior independent director was increased from 6,500 to 10,400.
This fee was increased because it did not reflect the responsibility or the necessary time commitment.
Benefits Other benefits for the year for each executive director included a company car allowance, private medical insurance, death in service benefit, annual holiday, sick pay, an annual health check and gym membership.
The nature of the taxable benefits for the executive directors were unchanged compared to 2016.
Bonus The maximum bonus opportunity for 2017 is 62.5% of salary for the executive directors split 52.5% of salary for financial performance 35% for operating profit and 17.5% for free cash flow and 10% of salary for personal objectives.
The whole bonus is paid in cash and there are no deferral obligations.
The choice of performance conditions and their respective weightings reflected the Committees belief that they would drive action to deliver exceptional sustainable value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.
In determining the bonus payment for 2017, no discretion was exercised by the Remuneration Committee in determining the outcomes.
Following an assessment against the performance targets, the Committee concluded that Simon Pryce will receive a bonus of 143,261.
The bonus is pro-rated to take into account the fact that Simon stepped down as Group Chief Executive on 30 June 2017.
The bonus paid is 67.4% of the pro-rated maximum.
David Crook will receive a bonus of 92,094, he was appointed as Finance Director on 1 June 2017 and the bonus payable for the first five months of the year prior to appointment as a director is not included in this amount.
The bonus for the first five months of the year was calculated on the salary prevailing at the time.
Both Simon Pryce and David Crook receive 32.1% of their eligible salaries in respect of financial performance 21.4% was for achievement against the operating profit target and 10.7% for free cash flow targets and they will both receive 10% of their eligible salaries for achievement against their personal strategic objectives.
For Simon Pryce his personal objectives were measured at the point he stepped down as Group Chief Executive.
The detailed personal and financial targets and the achievement against these are shown on the following two pages of this report.
Wayne Edmunds and Mike Powell are not entitled to receive a bonus in respect of 2017.
Targets and performance The Board is continuing with its approach to disclose the Bonus targets for the year under review.
Financial measures account for 84% of the maximum opportunity: operating profit represents 56% of the maximum opportunity and free cash flow represents 28% of the maximum opportunity split equally for the half-year position and full-year position.
Personal objectives represent 16% of the maximum opportunity.
Personal objectives The personal objectives set and how the Committee assessed their satisfaction and the level of performance achieved are set out below for the executive directors: Simon Pryce Simon Pryces personal objectives are set out in the table overleaf.
These personal objectives had to be judged at 30 June 2017 when Simon stepped down from the Board.
As all the objectives were on track and it was reasonable to assume that they would have been completed by the end of the year it was decided that Simons personal objectives would be considered as being 100% achieved.

There is a trade creditor cap applied to the actual figures above, which ensures payments to creditors are not inappropriately delayed to deliver bonus targets.
The measures are assessed on a straight line basis between threshold and target and also from target to maximum.
Deferred bonus in respect of 2014 Half of the bonus in respect of 2014, paid in early 2015, to Simon Pryce was deferred into shares and this award will be released shortly after the third anniversary of grant.
Dividends will be awarded on the deferred element once the risk of forfeiture has lifted to reflect economic alignment of the directors interests with those of shareholders.
No additional sum is included in the 2017 single figure total as the full bonus, including the deferred element, was disclosed in respect of 2014, the year it was earned.

The Group underlying operating profit for 2015 was US$202.0 million for 2016 was $330.1 million and for 2017 was $360.4 million, giving an average of $297.5 million and 3.5% of this is $10.4 million.

The plans for the appropriate capital structure were developed during the year and regular updates were provided to the Board and the proposals are announced with the preliminary results on 1 March 2018.
The Board has determined this is fully achieved because the requisite work was completed but the Board requested the proposals were reviewed by the incoming CEO once appointed and held back on timing pending the appointment.
100% Develop the Corporate Responsibility strategic plans and agree appropriate benchmarks.
The external FTSE for Good benchmark was retained.
Further work required on the strategic plans for Corporate Responsibility.

The requisite cost savings have been delivered during 2017.
100% Overall achievement: goals are equally weighted 89% The Remuneration Committee concluded that 89% of the strategic objectives had been delivered and agreed the overall pool is therefore $9,267,125.
The face value of the DSP award that will be granted to David Crook in respect of 2017 is equivalent to 64.5% of his 2017 salary 375,000.
This award equates to 89% of the maximum.
The Remuneration Committee anticipates that it will grant this award in March and as soon as awards are made to executive directors they will be announced via the Regulatory News Service RNS, as well as in the 2018 Annual Report.
66 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Long-Term Incentive Plan The performance conditions for the LTIP awards granted in 2015 are set out in the table below.
Performance was measured over three financial years ending 31 December 2017.
Percentage of EPS growth per annum Average annual ROIC shares vesting 50% of each award 50% of each award Nil Less than 6% Below 9.0% 25% At 6% At 9.0% 25% to 100% straight line pro-rata Between 6% and 12% Between 9.0% and 10.5% 100% At or above 12% At or above 10.5% For the three years ended 31 December 2017 EPS growth per annum was 8.9% and the average annual ROIC was 10.7%.
This performance would lead to the EPS element of the award vesting at 56% of the maximum and a full vesting of the ROIC element an overall vesting of 78%.
As set out on page 73 and calculated in note 6 the earnings used in the LTIP calculation of EPS are adjusted to take account of the Companys exceptional policy and also the underlying current tax charge.
The US tax reform in the final few days of 2017 resulted in a significant increase in the EPS using the agreed methodology.
This was not reflective of management action or underlying business performance and therefore the Committee used its discretion to adjust for the impact of US tax reform and this reduced the EPS growth to 5.1% and accordingly the EPS element will not vest.
The overall vesting will be 50% for the awards held by the executive directors.
The performance conditions for the ELTIP Awards granted in 2015 had an EPS performance range between 12% and 15% with a 9% ROIC hurdle.
The EPS growth, even without making an adjustment as described above, was below the 12% threshold and accordingly all the ELTIP awards lapse.
Pension The Companys pension contribution for Simon Pryce, Mike Powell and David Crook since his appointment to the Board was 20% of basic salary.
During the year all three received a cash payment in lieu of a contribution to a company pension scheme.

Other In 2015, when Simon Pryce was asked to take on the role of President of Flight Support in addition to his role as Group Chief Executive, he was asked to spend significantly more of his time in the United States.
At the time the Remuneration Committee agreed Simon should be neither better off nor worse off as a result of the assignment and agreed to provide accommodation and an allowance to support his incidental living expenses and certain elements were grossed up for tax purposes.
In accordance with this approach Simon Pryce received 97,000 2016: 194,000.

Change in remuneration of Chief Executive Officer and a comparator group The table below shows the movement in total remuneration for the CEO between the current and previous financial years compared with that of the total remuneration costs of relevant comparator employees as a whole.
Relevant employees are employees of BBA Aviation plc and its subsidiaries who are in banded grades 14 about 80 of the Groups senior leaders as the Board believes this is a suitable comparator group.
The CEOs reward is made up of a larger proportion of variable pay than employees within this comparator group.
Percentage change in remuneration of CEO and a relative comparator group of employees 000 Year ended Year ended 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 Percentage change CEO base salary 680.6 661.0 3.0% Relevant average comparator employees base salary 157.4 137.2 14.7% CEO taxable benefits 21.0 21.0 0.0% Relevant average comparator employees taxable benefits 9.0 8.7 3.4% CEO annual bonus 286.5 291.0 -1.7% Relevant average comparator employees annual bonus 51.4 45.6 12.7% For the illustrative purposes of this table and to make the comparisons valid, the CEOs bonus has not been pro-rated for time the figure shown above for the year ended 31December 2017 is double the amount that was actually paid.
The majority of the Comparator Group are paid in US$ and the exchange rate accounts for a proportion of the increase shown above.
Outside appointments Simon Pryce received an annual fee of 50,000 for his role at Electrocomponents plc.

Wayne Edmunds received $192,400 and 60,000 for his roles on the Dialight and Ashtead Boards respectively.
During 2017 he received a combination of a cash fee $85,000 and stock $140,000 for his role on the MSCI Inc. Board.
In accordance with policy the directors retain their fees for these appointments.
68 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Implementation of policy in 2018 The proposed implementation of the existing policy for each element of remuneration in 2018 is described below.
Base salary for executive directors The Remuneration Committee reviewed the base salary for David Crook and, given his appointment was relatively recent, decided not to increase it from 375,000.
The standard pay increase for employees of good standing across the Group was 2.5 3%.
Mark Johnstone, who will be appointed as Chief Executive Officer on 1 April 2018, will receive a base salary of $912,060.
The base salary was set to be competitive looking at our US peers, the general UK FTSE 250 in line with the size of the company and was lower than our outgoing Group Chief Executive to reflect the difference in experience.
Marks salary is denominated in US dollars and accordingly this amount will appear to fluctuate when disclosed in the single figure tables in sterling.
Any increases in salary will be transparently disclosed in US$ within the remuneration report.
Chairman and NED fees On appointment it was agreed that the fee for the Chairman would not be reviewed for the first three years and the Chairmans fee has increased with effect from 1 January 2018 to 295,000, an increase of 18%.
This is the first increase the Chairman has received since becoming Chairman in May 2014.
The basis of the Chairmans new fee was to position him broadly at the median compared to the FTSE 250 in line with the size of the Company and also to reflect the increase in scope and commitment required given the changes to the Company over the period, including the transformational acquisition of Landmark.
The fees for the non-executive directors including SID and Committee Chair roles have been reviewed and it was agreed to increase all fees by 3%, in line with average employee rises during this cycle.
Pension and benefits The Committee does not expect to change the pension or benefit arrangements for the executive directors in 2018.
Annual cash bonus For 2018, the Committee has determined that the annual bonus opportunity for executive directors is 65% of salary subject to shareholder approval at the AGM and will again be contingent on meeting both financial targets and personal objectives.
The Committee has reviewed targets for the year to ensure they remain appropriately stretching and relevant to the Companys business strategy.
In 2018, financial performance objectives will again represent about 85% of the bonus opportunity and personal objectives will represent about 15% of the bonus opportunity.
The financial targets will, as in 2017, be based on operating profit and free cash flow at the half and full year with approximately the same weights as in 2016.
The Board has decided that bonus targets for 2018 are commercially sensitive as they could provide the market and competitors with confidential information on the Groups strategy and expectations.
The Board will disclose the targets once they are no longer commercially sensitive and anticipates they will be disclosed in the 2018 Annual Report.
This has been the Companys practice for the last three years.
Deferred Stock Plan In respect of 2018, Mark Johnstone and David Crook are eligible to receive an award in early 2019 under the plan.
The award will be subject to a maximum of 125% subject to shareholder approval of their 2018 salary following an assessment of Group operating profit performance at the end of the 2018 financial year and performance against the strategic Group objectives.
These awards will be subject to a three-year cliff vest and a subsequent two-year holding period.
LTIP The LTIP award, due to be granted in 2018 for Mark Johnstone and David Crook, will be 150% of salary.
The award will be announced to the market when it is made with additional detailed disclosure to shareholders in the 2018 Directors Remuneration Report.
The three-year performance criteria will be average ROIC: EPS growth and total shareholder return.
As in previous years, the average ROIC and EPS growth targets are set using GAAP applying at the time and the performance will be assessed on a consistent constant GAAP basis.
The performance conditions are shown on page 73 and show progression from the performance conditions for the awards granted in 2017.
The awards will be subject to a two-year holding period following the performance period.
Service contracts The executive directors have rolling contracts of employment with no fixed term which entitle them to 12 months notice from the Company in the event of termination other than for cause.
Executive directors contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination with a payment in lieu of notice, or an enforced period of garden leave at the Companys discretion.
Both the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director are required to give the Company 12 months notice.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment.
The Chairmans appointment letter entitles him to six months notice from the Company and he is required to give the Company six months notice.
The Company may terminate the Chairmans contract immediately and pay him an amount in lieu of his fees for six months less the statutory deductions.
Letters of appointment and service contracts are available for inspection by shareholders at each AGM and during normal business hours at the Companys registered office.
There are no contractual commitments over and above those disclosed above.

75 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Part 3: Policy Introduction The following key principles govern the design of the Groups remuneration and reward structures: relevance to BBA Aviation, the cyclicality of our businesses and the international markets in which we compete and operate: pay for performance, notably the effective execution of the Group strategy and delivery of exceptional, long-term sustainable value for all our shareholders and stakeholders: top quartile for exceptional performance and mid-market for mid-level performance: reward actions that support our Vision, Mission and Values: remuneration should be commensurate with role and responsibilities and sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre individuals with relevant experience: reward should be appropriate and easily understood, both internally and externally: for executive directors, a significant element of remuneration should be aligned to long-term business performance: and the reward structure is compatible with our risk policies and systems and must not create environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
All contractual commitments or awards made which are consistent with the remuneration policy in force at the time that the commitment or award was made will be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled or awards vest.
Any contractual commitments entered into or awards made before the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 came into force or before a person became a director will also be honoured.
The tables below set out a clear and comprehensive summary of BBA Aviations remuneration policy for directors and how it operates.
Policy table: executive directors Base salary There are no performance or recovery provisions.
Strategic purpose Designed to attract individuals with the skills and capabilities to oversee the execution of the Groups strategy.
Set to reflect the role, the international nature of operations and the contribution, skills and experience of the individual.
Operation Reviewed annually taking into account market conditions, business performance, personal contribution and the level of pay awards and conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Market comparisons are carried out every three years and are made against organisations of comparable size, complexity, geographical spread, business focus and opportunity.
Individuals who are recruited or promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the targeted policy level until they become established in their role.
In such cases subsequent increases in salary may be higher than the general rises for employees until the target positioning is achieved.
Maximum opportunity Typically, the base salaries of executive directors in post at the start of the policy period and who remain in the same role throughout the policy period will be increased by a similar percentage to the average annual percentage increase in salaries of all other employees in the Group.
The exceptions to this rule may be where there is an increase in scope, complexity or responsibilities of the role salary progression for a newly appointed director and market adjustment.
Salary increases are linked to individual contribution and performance, which is assessed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee ensures that salary levels are positioned in line with companies of comparable size, complexity, geographical spread, business focus and opportunity so that they are competitive against the market.
Link to performance Salary increases are linked to individual contribution and business performance, which is assessed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
Pension There are no performance or recovery provisions.
Strategic purpose Provides the opportunity for longer-term savings to prepare for retirement, tax efficiently where possible, to ensure arrangements are locally competitive.
Operation Participation in a defined contribution pension plan or a cash allowance in lieu of this or a combination of the two.
Pension is not included in salary figures for the purposes of determining any other benefit entitlement.
Maximum opportunity Up to 25% of base salary per annum as a cash payment or employer contribution into the pension scheme for current executive directors.
The Company will set out in the section headed Implementation of remuneration policy, in the following financial year the pension contributions for that year for each of the executive directors.
In respect of new executive directors, the level of cash payment will be set in line with other employees.
Link to performance n a 76 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Other benefits There are no performance or recovery provisions.
Strategic purpose Provided to ensure arrangements are locally competitive, are consistent with arrangements provided to other senior employees and enhance efficiency and personal welfare.
Operation Benefits include but are not limited to a company car or allowance, private medical insurance, health and welfare benefits, life insurance, death in service benefit, annual holiday, sick pay and an annual health check.
Relocation benefits may be provided in certain circumstances see note 4 on page 78.
The Committee recognises the need to maintain suitable flexibility in the benefits provided to ensure it is able to support the objective of attracting and retaining personnel in order to deliver the Group strategy.
Additional benefits may therefore be offered.
Maximum opportunity Benefits are set by the Remuneration Committee to be locally competitive, and consistent with arrangements provided to other senior employees.
The maximum is the cost of providing the relevant benefits: levels are determined by market rates.
Link to performance n a Annual Bonus Plan ABP There are provisions for recovery of sums paid or withholding of sums subject to the Groups malus and clawback policy see table on page 79.
Strategic purpose Focuses on targets set over a 12-month period that are aligned to the delivery of the Groups strategic objectives and include: incentive for the achievement of Group financial objectives: and incentive for achievement of individual personal objectives.
Operation Annual performance conditions including targets and weightings are determined by the Committee at the beginning of the year.
Bonus is normally paid in March following the finalisation of the Companys year-end accounts and is based on personal and Company performance in the previous financial year.
Bonus is delivered in cash.
Maximum opportunity The maximum annual cash bonus is 65% of salary.
At threshold financial performance, up to 20% of the maximum bonus can be earned.
At target performance, up to 45% of the maximum bonus can be earned.
Bonus is earned on a straight line or kinked line basis between threshold and target, and between target and maximum.
Link to performance The level of bonus paid each year is determined by the Remuneration Committee after the year end based on performance against targets.
Financial targets will normally account for not less than 70% of the potential maximum award, with personal objectives accounting for the remainder.
The Committee reviews the measures, the targets and the relevant weightings on an annual basis to ensure they remain appropriately aligned with the business strategy.
Examples of financial performance measures include operating profit and Group free cash flow.
Examples of personal objectives include achievement of specific strategic goals or KPIs.
Deferred Stock Plan DSP There are provisions for recovery of sums paid or withholding of sums subject to the Groups malus and clawback policy see table on page 79 Strategic purpose To strengthen the focus on delivering the Groups medium to long-term strategic goals and enhance the alignment between the interests of executives and shareholders.
The plan provides the individuals with an economic effect equivalent to annual bonus deferral.
Operation Deferred stock will be allocated from a pool.
Annual performance conditions and targets are set at the beginning of the plan year.
The proportion of the deferred stock pool available for allocation each year will be determined by the achievement of strategic Group objectives during the year.
The value of the pool will be converted into a number of shares based on the prevailing share price.
As well as determining the performance conditions, targets and relative weighting, the Committee will also determine, within the pool limit, the allocation of deferred stock to each individual based on potential and performance at the beginning of the plan year.
Awards are provided in shares which vest on the third anniversary of the grant date subject to continued employment and are subject to a two-year holding period that expires on the fifth anniversary of grant.
An award is made up of conditional shares that will be delivered based on the Companys operating profit, performance against strategic objectives and subject to continuing employment.
Under the rules of the plan the Remuneration Committee may make an award in respect of dividends that would have been received on the shares once the risk of forfeiture has lifted.
In the UK, the Executive Share Option Plan ESOP may be used to grant options that are linked to the DSP to allow directors to take advantage of HMRC-approved share options at no marginal cost to the Company.
Maximum opportunity The maximum opportunity is 125% of salary.
77 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Link to performance The pool will be calculated at the beginning of each year and the size of the pool will be the equivalent in value to 3.5% of the average Group operating profit over the prior three years.
An award under the DSP is subject to satisfying operational and strategic Group objectives that are directly linked to Company strategy and KPIs, measured over a period of one financial year.
The current performance condition is a matrix of Group operating profit and strategic Group objectives.
Long-term incentive plan LTIP There are provisions for recovery of sums paid or withholding of sums paid subject to the Groups malus and clawback policy see table on page 79 below Strategic purpose Focuses executives on achievement of longer-term strategic objectives and ensures long-term alignment with shareholders interests.

All employee equity participation plans Strategic purpose To encourage employees to buy shares in the Company, tax efficiently where possible.
Operation Executive directors may participate in locally approved plans on the same basis as all eligible employees.
Maximum opportunity Subject to the relevant local tax limits.
Link to performance n a Notes 1 The performance measures selected for the purposes of the annual bonus plan and the long-term incentive plans are either Key Performance Indicators for the Group or are selected in order to encourage and reward directly or indirectly sustainable and long-term shareholder value creation.
Performance targets are set taking into account prior year performance, annual budgets, strategic imperatives and external factors.
Threshold performance is set taking into account the highly cyclical nature of our business and the variability of results from year to year and our dependence on flying hours.
The maximum standard of performance is intended to be exacting and to represent a level of performance that places the Group among the best performers.
2 The elements of remuneration for executive directors are similar to those that apply to the management-banded population in the Group.
Any differences that exist arise either because of market practice and or the Remuneration Committees assessment of business need and commercial necessity.
3 The Company also reimburses business expenses in accordance with the corporate business expenses policy which the Remuneration Committee has discretion to revise from time to time.
4 In addition to other benefits, the Remuneration Committee, where necessary, will provide support in accordance with BBA Aviations standard approach to relocation where a director is required to relocate to fulfil their responsibilities.
The primary purpose of the policy is to facilitate recruitment and relocation of key employees by protecting the individual and their family from costs arising directly from a move of residence required for business reasons.
The elements of the policy include, but are not limited to, travel reimbursement of the cost of movement of household goods, housing, schooling and other reasonable costs.
Intention and discretion In respect of the Annual Bonus Plan, the Deferred Stock Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company will set out in the section headed Implementation of remuneration policy, in the following financial year, the nature of the targets and their weighting for each year and in relation to the LTIP the targets themselves.
Details of the performance conditions, targets and their level of satisfaction for the year being reported on will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Should the Committee determine that one or more targets are commercially sensitive, these will be disclosed in subsequent years remuneration reports once commercial sensitivity ceases to apply.
When the Committee sets targets for any element of reward it should be assumed that these are on a consistent basis of accounting and, where accounting standards change during the performance period, the Committee will when it is fair and equitable to do so make adjustments to ensure that directors neither benefit nor suffer as a result of changes in accounting standards.
The Committee may make adjustments for exceptional items in the performance period if it is not fair and equitable to do so.
78 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report In exceptional circumstances the Committee retains the discretion to: change the performance measures and targets and the weighting attached to the performance measures and targets part-way through a performance period if there is a significant and material event which causes the Committee to believe the original measures, weightings and targets are no longer appropriate: make downward or upward adjustments to the amount of bonus contribution earned or DSP or LTIP resulting from the application of the performance measures, if the Committee believes that the outcomes are not a fair and accurate reflection of business performance.
Any adjustments or discretion applied by the Committee will be fully disclosed in the following years Remuneration Report.
The Committee will operate all plans in accordance with the relevant rules and in accordance with the principles of the policy set out in the introduction to the policy above Malus and clawback policy The table below sets out the scope and circumstances under which withholding malus and recovery of pay clawback will be applied to variable pay of the executive directors.

Strategic purpose Designed to attract and retain a high-calibre chairman by offering a market-competitive fee.
Operation The Chairman is paid an annual fee, paid in cash, which is set by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed on an annual basis.
Note that a review does not automatically give rise to an increase in fees.

Link to performance n a Notes 1 The Company also reimburses business expenses in accordance with the corporate business expenses policy which the Remuneration Committee has discretion to revise from time to time.
Shareholding requirement To ensure that executive directors interests are aligned with those of shareholders over a longer time horizon there is a formal shareholding guideline to encourage substantial long-term share ownership by executive directors.
The ownership guideline for executive directors is 300% of base salary, which should be achieved within five years.
This element of the policy ensures that the interests of the executive directors and those of shareholders are closely aligned.
The build-up and retention of shares by management is a key objective of the policy.
The Committee retains the discretion to increase the shareholding requirements.
Legacy arrangements under incentive plans There are outstanding awards which apply to directors made under arrangements which will not be offered under the policy effective from the close of the Companys 2018 AGM.
The awards already made under these plans will be honoured.
Recruitment and appointment policy On appointment the Committees approach to remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role.
The remuneration package for any new recruit would be determined in accordance with the principles set out on page 76.
The Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure the preferred candidate and is aware of guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or enhanced short or long-term incentive payments made on recruitment and the appropriateness of any performance conditions associated with the award.
If an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the policy set out above would apply from the date of promotion but there would be no retrospective application of the policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements.
Accordingly, prevailing elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured and form part of the ongoing remuneration.
These would be disclosed to shareholders in the following years Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Companys policy when setting fees for the appointment of new non-executive directors is to apply the policy which applies to current non-executive directors.
The Companys policy when setting remuneration for a new director is summarised in the following table: 80 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration element Policy Base salary and benefits The salary level will be set taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, experience and the salaries paid for similar roles in comparable companies.

The maximum potential LTIP opportunity under this plan is 150% of salary.
Total incentive opportunity The maximum variable remuneration which may be granted in normal circumstances is 340% of salary under the ABP, DSP and LTIP excluding the value of any buy-out awards.
Buy-out of incentives The Committees policy is not to provide buy-outs as a matter of course.
However, should the Committee determine that the individual forfeited on cessation of circumstances of recruitment justifies the provision of a buyout, the equivalent value of any incentives that will be forfeited on cessation employment of an Executive Directors previous employment will be calculated taking into account the following: the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the executive directors cessation of employment: the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the likelihood of them being satisfied: and any other terms and conditions having a material effect on their value lapsed value.
The Committee may then grant up to the equivalent value as the lapsed value, where possible, under the Companys existing incentive plans.
To the extent that it was not possible or practical to provide the buyout within the terms of the Companys existing incentive plans a bespoke arrangement would be used.
Relocation policies Where the new Executive Director is required to relocate from one work base to another, the Company may provide one-off ongoing support as part of the directors relocation benefits compensation to reflect the cost of relocation for the executive director in cases where they are expected to spend significant time away from their country of domicile.
The level of relocation package will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, but will take into consideration any cost of living differences, housing allowance and schooling.
