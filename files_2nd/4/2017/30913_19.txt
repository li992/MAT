Governance | Remuneration Report Remuneration Report On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Committees report for 2017.
Remuneration Committee In summary As highlighted elsewhere in this report, second half performance was weak even though Centrica has made significant progress on many fronts in 2017 whilst facing a number of difficult external pressures.
Inparticular, the Committee noted that most Group objectives and milestones were achieved including completion of the material divestment programme, strengthening of the balance sheet through SCOTT WHEWAY net debt reduction to 2.6 billion, cost efficiency targets were Committee exceeded and significant progress was made on safety issues.
Chairman Despite this, the Committee has a duty to consider these achievements against shareholder experience and give due weight to all of the outcomes in 2017, which have not always reflected the exceptional Remuneration Committee members attendance for the efforts of Centricas workforce.
Inthis context we have decided: year ended 31 December 2017 to reduce Annual Incentive Plan AIP awards for the Executives Scott Wheway Chairman 7 7 tozero: to reduce the maximum potential Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Lesley Knox 7 7 grant for the 2018 20 cycle from 300% to 250% in recognition of Margherita Della Valle 7 7 alower starting share price: and Carlos Pascual 7 7 to impose a pay freeze on all Executives salaries, where no pay rise will be granted in 2018.

The Committee also needed to assess the vesting outcome for longterm incentive awards that were made in early 2015.
The LTIP awards were dependent on adjusted earnings per share EPS, economic profit EP, safety performance, employee engagement and customer service delivery as assessed by net promoter scores.
Based on performance against these metrics over the three years the LTIP will vest at a level of 26% of the award.
The value of the shares initially granted under the 2015 award has fallen and as such represents an outcome of approximately 47% of salary.
