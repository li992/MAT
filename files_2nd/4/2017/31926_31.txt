90 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Illustration of application of remuneration policy The charts below set out the minimum i. e. fixed remuneration receivable by each Executive Director as at the date of this Annual Report, as well as the potential remuneration for on-target and maximum performance, as a result of the application of the remuneration policy set out above in the year ending 30 June 2018.
The on-target remunerationassumes an annual bonus payment of 65% of the maximum opportunity and a threshold LTIP vesting 25% of the maximum opportunity.
The maximum remuneration assumes maximum performance is achieved and therefore awards under the annual bonus pay out at their maximum levels of 125% Chief Executive and 115% other Executive Directors of salary, respectively, and LTIP awards vest at their maximum level.
No share price appreciation is assumed for LTIP awards.
Approach to remuneration on recruitment External appointment When recruiting a new Executive Director from outside the Group, the Committee may make use of all the existing components of remuneration.
In addition, the Committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under an alternative scheme or arrangement in order to facilitate recruitment of an individual, subject to the policy set out below: Component Approach Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, the experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and the appointees current base salary.
Where a new appointee has an initial base salary set below the market median, any subsequent adjustment will be managed by the Committee, using where appropriate phased increases and subject to the individuals development in the role.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with the remuneration policy, which may also include but are not limited to any necessary expenses relating to expatriation or relocation on recruitment.
SAYE New appointees will be eligible to participate on the same terms as all other employees.
schemes SIP New appointees will be eligible to participate on the same terms as all other employees.
Pension New appointees will receive pension contributions of up to 20% of pensionable salary into a defined contribution pension arrangement or an equivalent taxable cash supplement or a combination of both.
Annual bonus The annual bonus structure described in the remuneration policy will apply to new appointees including the maximum opportunity, pro rated in the year of joining to reflect the proportion of that year employed.
One-third of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares.
LTIP New appointees may be granted awards under the LTIP of up to 200% of salary.
Buy-out The Committee may consider it appropriate to grant a buy-out award with respect to either a bonus or a awards share-based incentive scheme under an alternative scheme or arrangement in order to facilitate recruitment.
When doing so, the Committee may, to the extent required, exercise the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.
Any such buy-out award would have a fair value no higher than that of the award forfeited.
In granting any such award, the Committee will consider relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to the forfeited awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
When considering any performance conditions, the Committee will, where appropriate, take into account those used in the Companys own incentive arrangements.
Where appropriate, the Committee will also consider whether it is necessary to introduce further retention measures for an individual for example, extended deferral periods.
In determining an appropriate remuneration package, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that the arrangements are in the best interests of the Companys shareholders.
Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 91  Report Directors remuneration policycontinued Internal promotion When recruiting a new Executive Director through internal promotion, the Committee will set remuneration in a manner consistent with the policy for external appointments set out above other than with respect to buy-out awards.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to Executive Director level, the Company will continue to honour these commitments.
The remuneration of individuals below the Board is typically not greater than for Executive Directors.
Service contracts A summary of the key elements of the Executive Directors service agreements insofar as they relate to remuneration is as follows: Term of contract Summary of provisions Notice period 12 months notice both to and from the Executive Director.
Payment in Employment can be terminated with immediate effect by undertaking to make a PILON comprising base salary, accrued lieu of notice but untaken holiday entitlement, pension contributions or allowance, car allowance and private medical insurance.
PILON The Company is entitled to make the PILON on a phased basis, so that any outstanding payment s would be reduced or stopped if alternative employment is obtained.
Change of There are no payments due upon a change of control, although deferred bonus shares would be released.
control Other There is no contractual entitlement to notice, or any other payments in respect of the period after cessation of entitlements employment, if the individual is summarily dismissed.
If not required to take any remaining holiday entitlement during on termination his her notice period, the Executive Director will receive a payment for any accrued but untaken holiday entitlement.
Please see Payments for loss of office below for a summary of other entitlements which may be due upon termination and which relate to remuneration.
Payments for loss of office The Companys policy on payments for loss of office is as follows: Component Approach Annual Individuals who are considered to be good leavers may be considered for a bonus in relation to the year in which their bonus active employment ceases.
Any payment will normally be pro rated for length of service and performance during the year.
However, the Committee retains the discretion to review the performance of the individual and the Group in general and, having done so, determine that a different level of bonus payment would be appropriate.
Clawback will continue to apply to the cash element of any annual bonus payment from 2018 until theend of the three-year clawback period.
Deferred shares allocated in part satisfaction of annual bonuses may be released upon cessation of employment if an individual is a good leaver.
Otherwise, they will be released at the end of the three-year holding period unless they are forfeited in the case of gross misconduct and or circumstances justifying summary dismissal.
LTIP If an Executive Directors employment ceases for reasons of death, ill-health, injury, disability, retirement with the agreement of the Company or his her employing company ceasing to be a member of the Group or such other circumstances approved by the Committee, outstanding awards are retained.
The Committee may also at its discretion permit unvested LTIP awards to vest on an accelerated basis or alternatively be retained until the vesting date.
Unvested LTIP awards will, subject to Committee discretion, normally be pro rated for length of service during the performance period and will, subject to performance, normally vest at the same time as all other awards in the LTIP award cycle.
Vested shares relating to awards made from 2017 will be subject to the two-year post-vesting holding period, irrespective of the date on which they vest.
For all other leavers, outstanding LTIP awards automatically lapse, unless the Committee exercises its discretion otherwise taking into account the factors detailed immediately following this table.
SIP and SAYE The Executive Directors are subject to the same leaver provisions as all other participants, as prescribed by the rules schemes of the relevant scheme or plan.
Other If the Company terminates an Executive Directors employment by reason of redundancy, the Company will make a redundancy payment to the Executive Director in line with his her service agreement, any applicable collective bargaining agreement and applicable law and regulation.
The Company may make a contribution towards an Executive Directors legal fees for advice relating to a compromise or settlement agreement and may also make other payments connected to the departure for example, for outplacement services.
With respect to any such payments, the Committee will authorise what it considers to be reasonable in the circumstances.
Change of Deferred bonus shares will be released and any outstanding LTIP awards may vest early subject to the Committees control discretion, having taken into account current and forecast progress against the performance condition s, the proportion of the vesting period which has elapsed and any other factors considered by the Committee to be relevant and the holding period for vested LTIP awardswill cease.
Clawback will no longer apply to any vested LTIP awards or prior payments of cash bonuses.
The rules of the SIP and the SAYE schemes will apply.
No payments are due under the Executive Directors service agreements upon a change of control.
92 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Where appropriate, the Committee will oblige the individual to mitigate his her losses and either offset any alternative remuneration received by the individual against any payments made by the Company for loss of office or reduce any payments to be made by the Company for loss of office to take account of any failure to mitigate when, in the reasonable opinion of the Committee, the individual has failed actively to do so.
In exercising discretion in respect of any of the elements referred to above, the Committee will take into account all factors which it considers to be appropriate at the relevant time.
These include, but are not limited to: the duration of the Executive Directors service: the Committees assessment of the Executive Directors contribution to the success of the Group: whether the Executive Director has worked any notice period or whether a PILON is being made: the need to ensure an orderly handover of duties: and the need to compromise any claims which the Executive Director may have.
Any use of Committee discretion will be disclosed in the relevant annual report on remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group Employees are not formally consulted on the Executive Directors remuneration and were not consulted during the preparation of the remuneration policy set out above.
However, the Groups employee engagement survey provides an opportunity for employees to provide their opinion on their own remuneration arrangements.
The Committee takes into account the overall pay and employment conditions of employees within the Group when making decisions on the Executive Directors remuneration.
In addition, the Committee is provided with information about the proposed annual Group-wide pay review when setting the Executive Directors salaries and is made aware of the approximate outcomes of annual bonuses within the wider workforce.
Consideration of shareholders views The views of shareholders, and guidance from shareholder representative bodies, are important to the Committee and provide the context for setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
The Chair of the Committee consulted with a number of significant shareholders during the year and their views have been taken into account when preparing the remuneration policy.
The Committee will keep the remuneration policy under regular review so as to ensure that it continues to relate to the Companys long-term strategy and aligns the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the shareholders.
In addition, the Committee will continue to monitor trends and developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the structure of executive remuneration remains appropriate.
Non-Executive Director remuneration policy General The Non-Executive Directors remuneration including that of the Chairman reflects the anticipated time commitment to fulfil their duties.
Non-Executive Directors do not receive bonuses, long-term incentive awards, a pension or compensation on termination of their appointments.

2 The Committee took into account the level of non-underlying items incurred during the year and decided that there would be no payment with respect to this element of the bonus.
3 The Committee also took into account the Groups average month-end net debt position relative to the average month-end aggregate capital invested in the Property and Residential divisions.
4 The target relates to a reduction in the Groups average UK AAIR from 1 January to 30 June 2017, as compared with the equivalent period in 2016, with the maximum opportunity requiring a 20% reduction.
There was a 16% reduction, resulting in an 8% payment.
The Committee decided to reduce the amount payable to Bev Dew due to the required number of visible leaderships tours during June to September 2016 not having been undertaken.
One-third of the bonus awarded will be satisfied by an allocation of shares deferred for three years, which will be subject to malus.
