Shareholders engaged with us during 2015 16 as we fundamentally re-designed our executive remuneration arrangements to align reward with the delivery of the outcomes committed to at the Capital Markets Day in January 2016.
This has resulted in a much clearer focus on value creation and long-term share ownership as we undergo our transformational journey to become the leading home improvement company in Europe.
The Policy received strong support at last years Annual General Meeting AGM with over 98% ofshareholders voting in favour.
In this letter, I set out a summary of the key remuneration decisions for 2016 17and how the Policy will be implemented in the coming year.

This was to simplify pay administration by moving towards consistency across the Group.
As disclosed in last years Report on Remuneration, these salary increases were made to move the salary of the CEO toward the market median over time, and to move the salary of the CFO to an appropriate position between the FTSE 25-75 and the retail peer group.
Full details are included in the 2015 16 report.
The CEO and CFO will receive a 2% increase for 2017.
Taxable Benefits The benefits provided to executive directors for both 2016 17 and 2015 16 included car benefit or cash allowance, private medical insurance, deathin-service cover, financial advice and, where applicable, relocation support.
Karen Witts opted for the cash allowance.
2 In last years Remuneration Report, we advised that the relocation support for the CEO had ended.
However, as a result of assistance in respect of an audit by the French tax authorities, which arose because of the CEOs change in circumstance upon appointment, the Committee determined that it was appropriate to categorise the benefit provided as part of the relocation allowance.
The assistance was not anticipated at the time of last years Remuneration Report, and was directly related to the CEOs relocation.
This has resulted in a total relocation support of 253,300 which is within the budget provided of 350,000.
Note that these figures are inclusive of tax payable on expenses reimbursed.
The audit is now complete and no further benefits will be provided under the relocation support.
3 This benefit relates to ongoing annual tax preparation assistance provided to the CEO in the UK and France.
This assistance is provided in recognition of the international nature of the CEOs role and is limited to income tax return preparation required in respect of the CEOs employment income.
Note that this figure is inclusive of tax payable on expenses reimbursed.

Total achievement 90% The Committee considered the annual bonus outcome in view of the performance against the strategic milestones as set out above.
It was concluded that all milestones had been substantially met.
In particular, it was recognised that the achievement of meeting the unified COGS target and the delivery of the GNFR target, ahead of plan, has resulted in a significant step forward in the Companys journey to successfully transforming the business.
The Committee also recognised that some milestones were not fully met, and therefore determined that a bonus of 72% of salary 90% of the maximum opportunity be payable to the executive directors.
This equates to 536,976 for the CEO and 410,976 for the CFO.
The annual bonus for the financial year 2016 17 will be paid in April 2017, and will be paid entirely in cash.
This award level was also considered to be appropriate in the context of the Group financial performance through 2016 17. www.

2 Calculated using the average closing share price for the last three months of the 2016 17 financial year of 350.0pper share.
At the Committee meetings in January and March 2017, the Committee considered whether to make an adjustment to the KEP target to take account of the costs linked to the strategic transformation.
These costs were comprised of the transformation costs and the B&Q store closures.
Overall, adjusting consistently for the positive and negative impacts of these items would have increased the total vesting of the 2014 LTIP from 24.5% to 26.3% of the maximum opportunity.
The Committee concluded that it remained appropriate to retain the formulaic outcome from the measure, and that no adjustment should be made.
Thisresulted in a vesting of 24.5% of maximumfor both the CEO and CFO.
As explained in previous reports, Kingfisher no longer reports using the KEP measure and so a brief explanation of KEP, together with the table below, has been included to provide transparency on the outcome of this measure in respect of the 2014 LTIP.
KEP represents earnings after a charge for the annual cost of capital employed in the business and is derived from the concept of Economic Value Added.
Earnings for KEP purposes are reconciled in the table below and exclude exceptional items and property lease rentals.
A charge is then deducted by applying the weighted average cost of capital WACC to capital employed.
For the purposes of consistency both WACC and capital employed are lease-adjusted.
Leases are capitalised based on an estimate of their long-term property yields.
In order to focus on controllable factors both WACC and long-term property yields are based on those in place when KEPwas introduced.

Pensions audited information Executive directors based in the UK are eligible to join the UK defined contribution pension plan the DC Scheme.
No executive director has aprospective right to a defined benefit pension.
The company operates a policy to limit the combined employer and member pension contributions during a tax year to the annual allowance, with the excess employer contribution being directed into a taxable monthly cash allowance.
In addition, directors may choose to opt out of the scheme completely, if for example, they have reached the lifetime allowance.
A summary of the arrangements for the executive directors is set out below.
Notional employer contribution rate into defined contribution Cash allowance in lieu of Equivalent cash pension scheme to which Member of the employer contributions allowance rate as the individual is eligible UK DC Scheme into DC Scheme % of salary Executive directors Vronique Laury 14% No Yes, in full 12.5% Yes, in excess of the Karen Witts 20% Yes annual allowance 17.5% Notes: Karen Witts own member contributions took up the annual allowance headroom, meaning that the full employer contribution was paid as a cash alternative.
Cash allowances are provided on a cost neutral basis for the company.
This means that a discount is applied to those directors joining after the introduction of pension salary sacrifice SMART pensions in 2012.
This accounts for the fact that employers national insurance is payable on the cash alternative, whereas it is not payable on employer pension contribution into the defined contribution scheme.
Accordingly, the cash alternative for Vronique Laury is 12.5% of salary and for Karen Witts it is 17.5% of salary.

PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS AND LOSS OF OFFICE audited information There were no payments to past directors or for loss of office.
OUTSIDE APPOINTMENTS FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Subject to the rules governing conflicts of interest, the Group is supportive of its executive directors holding external non-executive positions.
Theholding of such roles can provide valuable insight for the executive directors, which can be of benefit to Kingfisher.
Subject to the Committees agreement, the individual may retain any fees applicable for these roles.

The single total figure in the table above shows the combined total remuneration package for both Sir Ian Cheshire and Vronique Laury.

2 The reduction in the CEOs annual bonus is reflective of the reduced maximum bonus opportunity provided under the new Remuneration Policy, approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
The maximum bonus opportunity decreased from 200% to 80% under the new Policy.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS SHAREHOLDINGS AND SHARE INTERESTS audited information Executive directors are required to build a significant shareholding in the company.
Unvested awards are not included when assessing holding requirements.
Vested awards are included when assessing holdings, but are adjusted to take into account the tax liability arising on exercise.
The table below sets out the beneficial interests of the executive directors in the ordinary shares of the company and a summary of the outstanding share awards as at 31 January 2017.
Calculations are based on a share price of 336.2p being the closing price of a Kingfisher share on 31 January 2017.

These awards also include the immediate vest element of the Alignment Share awards granted to both Vronique Laury and Karen Witts under the Kingfisher Alignment Share and Transformation Incentive Plan KASTIP.
2 Nil-cost options and awards which have vested but have yet to be exercised are considered to count towards the shareholding requirement, other than any such shares that correspond to the estimated income tax and national insurance contributions that would arise on their exercise estimated at 47% of the award.
3 Includes options granted to Karen Witts under an HMRC-approved ShareSave plan 6,011 shares which are not in the form of nil-cost options, awards granted to Vronique Laury under the KISS FR 2014 and deferred bonus shares granted to both Karen Witts and Vronique Laury in both 2015 and 2016 under the Kingfisher Incentive Share Scheme.

5 Under the new Remuneration Policy we introduced a requirement that each executive director build a substantial shareholding to ensure alignment with the interests of shareholders.
The Policy requires that the executive directors retain shares awarded to them under the new Policy and the previous Remuneration Policy until they have met the shareholding requirement.
Therefore, the time-based requirement, referred to in last years Remuneration Report, is no longer applicable to the executive directors.
6 As potential beneficiaries of the Kingfisher Employee Benefit Trust the Trust, Vronique Laury and Karen Witts are deemed to have an interest in the companys ordinary shares held by the Trust.
The Trust held 6,455,403 ordinary shares at 31 January 2017.

The CSOP awards are underpinned by a KISS award over the same number of shares.
At the time of exercise, sufficient CSOP underpin shares are exercised to meet the total option price of the CSOP award up to 30,000.
The proceeds are paid to Kingfisher and the CSOP award is subsequently exercised.
The excess CSOP underpin shares which by definition are to the same value as the capital gain on the CSOP then lapse.
2 This is made up of the 29,997.42 used to fund the exercise of the CSOP plus the value of dividends accrued over the period.
Dilution limits The terms of the companys share plans set limits on the number of newly-issued shares that may be issued to satisfy awards.
In accordance with guidance from the Investment Association, these limits restrict overall dilution under all plans to under 10% of the issued share capital over a ten-year period, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten-year period on executive plans.
Only those awards granted under the ShareSave plan are satisfied by newly-issued shares.
Any awards which are satisfied by market-purchased shares are excluded from these calculations.
These include awards granted under discretionary plans, including those awards which have been exercised by the executive directors during the year, and the Alignment Share and Transformation Incentive awards granted during 2016 17.

For 2017, the CEOrequested that the Committee award her and the CFO no more than the average increase to the broader workforce, recognising that the transformation strategy remains in its early stages.
The Committee agreed that this was appropriate and awarded a 2% increase to both executive directors.
It remains the Committees intention to realign the executive directors salaries against the market, as set out in last year Remuneration Report, as execution of the strategy continues to proceed successfully.
This may result in salary increases above the average of the workforce over the remainder of the policy period.

Kingfisher plc | Annual Report 2016 17 78 Governance Annual Bonus Implemented in line with policy.
The annual bonus will have a maximum opportunity of 80% of salary.
The annual bonus will be judged based on the achievement of a number of strategic milestones critical to the delivery of the transformation as set out below: 2017 product range implementation including unified COGS: Digital implementation including implementation of the Brilliant Basics platform and other home improvement platforms: Unified ITimplementation roll-out of unified systems: Goods not for resale GNFR implementation including measures on benefit delivered for the financial year 2017 18: Operating model including the implementation of new, simpler and more effective ways of working: and People motivating employees as we move through our transformational journey.
Group financial performance will also be taken into consideration.
In the opinion of theCommittee, the detail of the annual bonus measures and targets for 2017 18 are commercially sensitive and accordingly are not disclosed.
These will be disclosed next year.
The targets are aligned to the operational milestones set out in the Strategic Report on pages 21 to 23.
Alignment Shares Implemented in line with policy.
The Committee recognised the strong personal performance of both the CEO and CFO throughout 2016 17 and so Alignment Share awards will be made at the level of 80% of salary in line with policy.
A summary of the personal performance for each executive director is set out below: Vronique Laury demonstrated strong personal performance through: the development of a new operating model to take the Group forward to deliver the five-year plan: the completion of the recruitment and development of the Group Executive, as well as her strong leadership of the wider team: the maintenance of the ongoing business and operational delivery through the transformation, in line with expectations: and, the continued delivery of thestrategic milestones.
Karen Witts demonstrated strong personal performance through: her leadership and development of the Finance team: the delivery of front line financial results, critical to the Group, as the Group takes the first steps towards implementing the transformation: the delivery of the first stage of the goods not for resale GNFR benefits: and through her contribution to the development of the operating model which will facilitate the sustained future performance of the business.
The underpin conditions for the Alignment Share awards relate to maintaining the underlying health of the business over the course of the five year strategy period, to the end of 2020 21.
The underpin conditions for the 2017 18 awards, which will apply throughout the duration of the three-year vesting period are: maintenance of the10.1p dividend subject to dividend cover being above 1.75 times: and maintenance of ratio of lease adjusted net debt to EBITDAR below 2.5 times.
If one underpin condition is not met, then up to 50% of the unvested shares would lapse.
If both are not met, then up to 100% of the unvested award would lapse.
The Committee will determine the appropriate deduction considering business performance and progress against the capital return plan.
Performance against the underpin will be considered annually and any reduction will apply to the award next due to vest.
In the event that the lease-adjusted net debt to EBITDAR ratio is exceeded due to Board-approved acceleration of investment plans, then the Committee may apply discretion to allow vesting.
In these circumstances, the Committee would consider delaying vesting in whole or part by a further year to ensure sustainability of performance.

Kingfisher plc | Annual Report 2016 17 84 Governance Approach to recruitment remuneration Area Policy and operation Overall When hiring a new executive director, or making internal promotions to the Board, the Committee will apply the same policy as for existing executive directors, as detailed in the Remuneration Policy.
The rationale for the package offered will be explained in the next Annual Report on Remuneration.
For internal promotions, any commitments made prior to appointment may continue to be honoured as the executive is transitioned to the new remuneration arrangements.
Where an individual is promoted after the Transformation Incentive grant in the policy period, an award may be made to bring the executive onto the in-flight cycle at an opportunity level reflecting their new role, subject to the limits set out in the Policy.
Awards may bepro-rated to reflect the remaining portion of the vesting period.
Any award will take into consideration awards granted prior to promotion.
The policy below is consistent with the principles of the previous recruitment policy which have been adapted in line with the new remuneration structure.
Base salary Base salary would be set at an appropriate level to recruit the best candidate based on their skills, experience and current remuneration.
Benefits Benefits provision would be in line with normal policy.
Where appropriate the executive may also receive relocation benefits or other benefits reflective of normal market practice in the territory in which the executive director is employed.
Pension Pension provision would be in line with normal policy.
Incentive Incentive awards would be made under the Annual Bonus, Alignment Shares and Transformation Incentive in line with the normal policy.
awards Where an individual joins after the Transformation Incentive grant in the policy period, an award may be made to bring the executive onto the in-flight cycle subject to the limits set out in the policy.
Awards may be pro-rated for the portion of vesting period served.
Buy-out awards In addition to normal incentive awards, buy-out awards may be made to reflect value forfeited through an individual leaving their current employer.
If a buy-out award is required, the Committee would aim to reflect the nature, timing, and value of awards forgone in any replacement awards.
Awards may be made in cash, shares, Alignment Shares, Transformation Incentive or any other method as deemed appropriate by the Committee.
Where possible, share awards will be replaced with share awards.
Where performance conditions applied to the forfeited awards, performance conditions willbe applied to the replacement award or the award size will be discounted accordingly.
In establishing the appropriate value of any buy-out the Committee would also take into account the value of the other elements of the new remuneration package.
The Committee would aim to minimise the cost to the company, however, buy-out awards are not subject to a formal maximum.
Any awards would be broadly no more valuable than those being replaced.
Shareholding requirements To ensure the alignment of the interests of executives and shareholders over the long-term, executive directors are required to build a significant shareholding.
The shareholding requirement is 350% of salary for the CEO and 250% for any other executive director.
All shares beneficially owned and nil-cost awards which have vested but that the executive has yet to exercise are considered to count towards the shareholding on a notional post-tax basis.
Deferred bonus shares, awarded under the previous Remuneration Policy, are not included in the assessment of the shareholding requirement until the transfer of beneficial ownership to the executive at the end of the three year deferral period.
Until the shareholding requirement is met, executive directors are required to retain 100% of vested post-tax Alignment Shares, retain 50% of vested post-tax Transformation Incentive shares, and retain 50% of post-tax shares that vest from awards granted under the previous Remuneration Policy.
Itisexpected that executives would retain 100% of post-tax shares from the Transformation Incentive until the requirement is met.
Upon leaving the company, the shareholding requirements will continue to apply for two years.
This will be 100% of the shareholding requirement for the first year and will be 50% of the shareholding requirement for the second year after departure.
Notes to the policy table Malus and clawback Malus and clawback may operate in respect of the Annual Bonus, Alignment Shares and Transformation Incentive.
These provisions enable the company to reduce including, if appropriate, to nil the payout and vesting levels or to recover the relevant value following the cash bonus payout or vesting of shares.
Clawback will apply to the cash bonus for a period of three years following payment and for a period of two years following vesting under the Alignment Shares and Transformation Incentive.
These provisions could take effect in the event of financial misstatement, serious reputational damage, or material misconduct in individual cases.
Change of control In the event of a change of control, share awards will normally vest subject to performance conditions.
Alignment Shares and Transformation Incentive awards will normally be reduced on a time pro-rated basis in line with the treatment for good leavers which is set out in the Service contracts and the policy on payment for loss of office section of this Directors Remuneration Policy.
The Committee may alternatively consider that such a reduction is inappropriate, e. g. if it is agreed with an acquirer to rollover outstanding awards.
Otherawards may be reduced at the Committees discretion.
com 85 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Discretions The Committee retains certain discretions in relation to the Annual Bonus Plan which are set out in full in the plan rules, which include but are not limited to: the determination of and timing of any bonus payment: the impact of a change of control or restructuring: and any adjustments required as a result of a corporate event such as a transaction, corporate restructuring event, special dividend or rights issue.
Discretions set out as part of this Remuneration Policy provide the Committee with discretion in certain matters regarding the administration and operation of the Alignment Shares and Transformation Incentive as set out in the corresponding plan rules approved by shareholders, including, but not limited to the following: any adjustments to performance conditions or awards required as a result of a corporate event such as a transaction, corporate restructuring event, special dividend or rights issue : and minor administrative matters to improve the efficiency of the operation of the plans or to comply with local tax law or regulation.
In relation to the Annual Bonus Plan, Alignment Shares, and Transformation Incentive, and in line with the plan rules, the Committee retains the ability to amend the performance conditions and or measures in respect of any award or payment if one or more event s occur which would lead the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to do so, provided that such an amendment would not be materially less difficult to satisfy than theunaltered performance condition would have been but for the event in question.
Should the Committee use any of the discretions set out above, these would, where relevant, be disclosed in the next Annual Report on Remuneration.
The views of major shareholders may also be sought.
Discretion in relation to the companys All-Employee Share Plans Sharesave and Share Incentive Plan would be exercised within the parameters of the HMRC approved plan status and the Financial Conduct Authoritys Listing Rules.
Legacy Awards In-flight awards made before the adoption of this Policy will continue in line with the approved policy under which they were granted.
Further details of these awards can be found within the Remuneration Policy approved at the 12 June 2014 AGM and included within the 2013 14 Annual Report and Accounts.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees The remuneration structure for members of the Group Executive follows the same approach as for the executive directors but with a lower maximum opportunity as appropriate.
The Transformation Incentive is granted only to the executive directors and members of the Group Executive.
For the next tier of management below the Group Executive, the remuneration structure consists of base salary, benefits, pension, bonus, and Alignment Shares.
Performance measures are tailored to reflect the relevant position of the individual and the relevant part of the business in which they operate.
All other employees are entitled to base salary and benefits and may also receive bonus, pension, profit share and share awards which vary according to local jurisdiction and market practice.
The maximum provision and incentive opportunity available are determined by the seniority and responsibility of the role.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the company The Chief People Officer is invited to present to the Committee on the proposals for salary increases for the employee population generally and on any other changes to the Groups Remuneration Policy.
The Chief People Officer consults with the Committee on the KPIs for the executive directors bonuses and the extent to which these should be cascaded to other employees.
The Committee has oversight of all long-term incentive awards across the Group.
The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure for all individuals in Kingfishers leadership team which includes Operating Company CEOs and Group function directors.
The Committee approves the policy on share award levels for all employees and uses this information to ensure that there is consistency of approach across Kingfisher.
The Group did not consult with employees when drafting the Directors Remuneration Policy.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views The Committee consulted extensively with the companys largest shareholders and their representative bodies leading up to the 2016 AGM on our proposed Directors Remuneration Policy.
