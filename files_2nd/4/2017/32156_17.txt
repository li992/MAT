The exercise price per share to be paid upon exercise is shown against each award.
Performance Share Plan The performance conditions for the 2014 award are based on a three year performance period in terms of absolute Total Shareholder Return TSR and growth in adjusted EPRA earnings per share EPS.
The measures are weighted 50:50 so that half of the award depends on the performance of TSR and half on the growth in EPS.
TSR will be measured from grant and EPS growth will be measured from the latest completed financial year.
The performance period ended at 31 March 2017 and only the EPS performance condition had been met.
Accordingly, only 50% of the 2014 award vested and is available to exercise.
The 2015 PSP award was an enhanced award over 200% of salaries and was split into two awards, with the first award being measured against a three year performance period and the second award being measured against a four year performance period.
The performance conditions are the same for both awards and are as follows: TSR performance condition 33.4% of the award is subject to a TSR performance condition.
25% of the award vests if TSR is 9% on a compound annual basis over the three year and four year vesting periods with full vesting at 16% with straight-line vesting in between.
EPRA EPS performance condition 33.3% of the award is subject to an EPRA EPS performance condition.
25% of the award vests if the compound annual percentage growth in the Adjusted EPRA EPS over the three year and four year vesting periods is 5% per annum with full vesting at 12% with straight-line vesting in between.
Net Asset Value per share plus dividends NAV performance condition the remainder of the award is subject to a NAV performance condition.
25% of the award vests if the compound annual percentage growth in the Adjusted EPRA NAV on a compound annual basis over the three year and four year vesting periods is 9% per annum with full vesting at 16% with straight-line vesting in between.
