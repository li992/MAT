rates, given the budgets importance as the primary comparative used for measuring performance internally.
The budget was based on prices stabilising at above 2016 averages, with increases in metallurgical coal prices, but offset by stronger producer currencies.
Both target ranges are illustrated in the table below, with 25% vesting taking place with performance at threshold.
Threshold Maximum Outcome Vesting Actual prices and FX rates $1.60 $2.40 $2.57 100% share share share Fixed prices and FX rates $1.38 $1.68 $1.66 95% share share share Strong operational performance and delivery of the underlying EBITDA improvement target supported by strong bulks and copper prices, particularly in the second half of the year, resulted in the outperformance of the actual price FX element of the award.
Average market prices for the Groups basket of commodities and products increased by 16% from 2016, significantly exceeding expectations at the time of target-setting.
However, even without the improvement in prices, EPS vested at 95%, with the Group achieving $1.1 billion in operating cost and volume improvements.
This performance was driven mainly by the ongoing ramp-up of Minas-Rio, strong sales volumes at fide Beers in the first quarter and Platinums solid recovery from the operational challenges experienced in 2016.
The impact of the Groups ongoing cost-efficiency programme also played a significant role in exceeding our improvement target for the year.
Measurement of both these targets, therefore, resulted in vesting of the overall EPS element relating to 50% of the annual bonus award of 98%.
The executives individual objectives were set at the start of the year and reflect the Groups strategic priorities for the year.
Each category contained between one and four specific objectives, incorporating a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics.
Following the end of the year, the committee made a detailed assessment of performance against each objective, leading to the evaluations shown in Figure 12.
The Groups safety performance in 2017 was assessed through both additive and deductive component measures.
Figure 11 sets out the outcome in each category, resulting in a net modifier of 3.85 %.
The disappointing number of fatalities in 2017 led to the maximum possible FIFR deduction being applied.
