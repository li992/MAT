The amount is under dispute with the seller, as an amount of approximately 28.9m $39m is expected by the seller.
No provision has been made for the potential additional amount as the Directors do not consider it is probable that an additional amount is due.
Any future settlement that is higher than the fair value estimate of 16.7m $22.6m will result in an income statement charge in a future accounting period as more than 12 months have elapsed since the acquisition and therefore any adjustment would fall outside the 12 month remeasurement period permitted by IFRS 3.
40 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS On 16 January 2018, the Group announced it was in preliminary discussions for a potential combination of UBM plc to be effected by way of an acquisition of the entire share capital of UBM by Informa for shares and cash consideration.
On 17 January 2018, the Group outlined the key financial terms, with UBM Shareholders receiving for each UBM share 1.083 Informa shares and 163p in cash.
On 30 January 2018 the Boards of Informa and UBM confirmed the creation of a leading B2B information services group through a recommended offer for UBM by Informa.
A Circular to the Shareholders of Informa recommending the offer is expected to be issued in March 2018 and general meetings for Informa and UBM are expected to take place in April 2018.
Subject to approval from Shareholders of both companies and regulatory approvals the transaction is expected to complete in June 2018.
