Approach to pay in 2018 The policy was renewed at the 2017 AGM and included a number of developments in best practice, including the addition of holding periods to new LTIP awards.
No further change to the overall approach to pay is anticipated for 2018: The CEO and MD Personal Lines will be awarded a salary increase of 2.5% from 1 April 2018, in line with the average rate for staff generally.
No increase will be awarded to the CFO-designate or the CFO in light of the formers package having just been set and the latters pending retirement.

Committee Chair Clare Thompson Non-Executive Directors Mike Biggs 1 Danuta Gray Sebastian James Andrew Palmer Note: 1.
Appointed to the Committee with effect from 6 March 2017.
Advisers to the Committee The Committee consults with the Chief Executive Officer, the Human Resources Director, and senior representatives of the HR, Risk and Finance functions on matters relating to the appropriateness of all remuneration elements for Executive Directors and Executive Committee members.
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and the Human Resources Director are not present when their remuneration is discussed.
The Committee works closely with the Chairs of the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, including receiving input from those Chairs regarding target-setting and payouts under incentive plans, and whether it is appropriate to operate malus and clawback.
The Chair of the Audit Committee is currently a member of the Remuneration Committee, and the Chair of the Board Risk Committee attended Remuneration Committee meetings on three occasions.
The Remuneration and Board Risk Committees can also hold joint meetings to consider matters of common interest.
The Committee retains FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP FIT as its independent adviser.
FIT is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Groups Code of Conduct.
The Committee appointed FIT when preparing for the IPO and after considering the firms experience in this sector.
During the year, FIT advised on market practice, corporate governance and regulations, incentive plan design and target-setting, recruitment and other matters that the Committee was considering.
FIT does not provide the Company with other services.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice FIT provides is objective and independent.
FITs total fees for remuneration-related advice in 2017 were 125,633 exclusive of VAT.
FIT charged its fees based on its standard terms of business for providing advice.

However, awards remain subject to malus and clawback.
2014 LTIP awards RoTE the expected vesting outcome figures for the RoTE portion of the awards granted under the LTIP in 2014 and reported in 2016 have been updated.
These updates are based on the actual vesting of the RoTE portion of the awards and a share price of 3.376 and 3.819 on 26 March 2017 and 29 August 2017 respectively, compared to the three-month average share price of 3.55686 used in reporting this figure in the 2016 remuneration report.
The revised figures include the actual number of dividends accrued on this portion of the award at vesting.
This results in an adjusted reportable increase of approximately 4,855 for Paul Geddes and 2,938 for John Reizenstein, with a corresponding increase of the single figure for 2016 reflected in the table above.
2015 LTIP awards RoTE the expected levels of vesting are set out on page 82.
The corresponding values under long-term incentives, including the estimated value of dividends accrued to 31 December 2017, are 1,135,614 for Paul Geddes, 687,341 for John Reizenstein and 582,738 for Mike HollidayWilliams, based on a three-month average Company share price to 31 December 2017 of 3.65557.
Any shares vesting under the LTIP granted in 2015 will not be delivered until the end of the applicable vesting periods in March and August 2018.
2014 LTIP awards TSR the level of vesting is set out on page 82.
The corresponding values under long-term incentives, including the value of dividends on vesting, are 927,109 for Paul Geddes, 561,141 for John Reizenstein and 418,193 for Mike Holliday-Williams, using the share prices on 26 March 2017 and 29 August 2017 of 3.376 and 3.819 respectively.
SIP includes the value of matching shares under the SIP.
Mike Holliday-Williams was appointed to the Board on 1 February 2017.
His salary, benefits and pension for the purposes of this table have been pro-rated accordingly.
Penny James was appointed to the Board on 1 November 2017 and also became employed on that date.
The annual bonus figure for Penny James consists of two elements: 173,250 relates to the pro-rated annual bonus for 2017 determined on the same basis as other Executive Directors, 840,841 relates to an estimated payment in lieu of the bonus forfeited at her previous employer as detailed on page 93.
The actual payment will be confirmed in next year's report.
The long-term incentive figure for Penny James relates to an estimated amount in respect of the first tranche of her buy-out awards disclosed on page 90 which vests in April 2018, and is subject to performance conditions ending in the 2017 performance year.
The value is based on an expected level of vesting of 100% and a three-month average share price to 31 December 2017 of 3.65557.
The actual vesting will be confirmed in next years report.
Each Executive Director has confirmed they have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration, other than those already disclosed in the single figure table.
COM 79 Directors remuneration report continued Annual Incentive Plan AIP outcomes for 2017 The Committee established target performance levels at the start of the year.
The Committees approach to setting and assessing PBT targets under the AIP is to set a target level of profit performance and then, at the year end, to assess overor underperformance by judging overall corporate performance both on an absolute and relative basis.
While the Committee does not set a formal threshold to maximum profit range against which performance is formulaically assessed, the Committees starting point each year has been to look at a range of 10% either side of the targets when discussing the achievement.
The Committee again felt this an appropriate basis for its discussions and concluded that the indicative outturn should apply without further adjustment.
The only adjustment from the reported accounting position, as explained in the letter from the Committee Chair, was to exclude the impact of the one-off cost associated with the buying back of the Groups subordinated guaranteed notes which was an unbudgeted initiative to the benefit of the Company and its shareholders.
While this, in fact, had no impact on the outturn, given the level of outperformance of the target, it was the correct principle and consistent with best practice and past practice to exclude the impact.
In the table below, we have disclosed the target set for PBT performance.
The actual PBT performance includes the adjustment to reported PBT as described above.
We have included details of the performance achieved against the non-financial measures to improve transparency for shareholders although some metrics remain commercially sensitive.
The bar chart illustrates the Committees assessment of the level of achievement under the AIP.
The outcomes reflect continuing strong performance during the year as discussed in the Group highlights and Chairmans statement on page 1 and pages 8 to 9 respectively.

80 DIRECT LINE GROUP ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Annual Incentive Plan AIP outcomes for 2017 Financial element 55% weighting As discussed above, there is no pre-set scale around the PBT target for the 2017 financial year and, in accordance with the AIP terms, the Committee determined the appropriate payout for the performance achieved.
The outturn was 26% ahead of the target and, therefore, considerably ahead of the indicative maximum of 10% ahead of target resulting in a maximum payout for this element.
As noted in the Chairs letter, PBT performance included the neutralisation of the capital transactions, which had no impact on the outturn.
Strategic element 25% weighting The Groups strategy is to make insurance much easier and better value for our customers.
We have continued to invest in improving the customer experience and removing the reasons for customer problems.
Overall, performance on the customer agenda against our 11 key customer metrics remains very strong, with the Direct Line and Churchill brands performing well in independent customer experience benchmarking studies and good progress on key Net Promoter Score measures and customer journeys.
2017 saw the introduction of a basket of people measures to the AIP scorecard to reflect the importance of this agenda to the success of the Group.
Progress on these measures was also considered to be very strong, with key focus areas such as succession strength, diversity and employee engagement showing notable development.
The Committee considered that the Group has made good progress in continuing to improve the customer experience against an already solid performance, as well as advancements in its key people measures against a background of high employee engagement.
Having considered performance against targets and an assessment of the quality of performance achieved, the Committee agreed an outturn of 84% under this element for this good performance.
Personal element 20% weighting This element relates to an objective that is shared with other Executive Committee members and set by the Committee.
The Committee considers the performance against this element together with the Executives personal performance and leadership over the year.
The Group remains focused on improving its digital offering, customer experience and operational efficiency, and a key focus of management continues to be the level of change the Group is making to its IT infrastructure.
2017 saw the Group make good progress on these plans, executing key planned changes on schedule, increasing confidence in future plans and managing costs, with a significant focus on the stability and security of the IT environment.
Whilst there was significant progress on these initiatives, the impact on intangible assets due to a reworking of some elements of capital expenditure resulted in an impairment charge at the year end and which is included in the outcome under the Financial element.
Taking performance against each Executive Directors individual performance objectives and the above challenges into account, the Committee determined that the Executive Directors should each receive awards of 60% of the maximum available under thiselement.
Consequently, the annual incentive awards for Executive Directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 were as follows: Actual 000 including cash Maximum Target Actual and deferred Audited % of salary % of salary % of salary elements Paul Geddes, CEO 175% 105% 154% 1,242 John Reizenstein, CFO 150% 90% 132% 644 Mike Holliday-Williams, MD Personal Lines 150% 90% 132% 721 1 Penny James, CFO--designate 175% 105% 154% 173 Note: 1.
The annual incentive award made to Penny James represents a pro-rated amount for the period 1 November to 31 December 2017 since joining the Company.

They were subject to TSR performance over the three-year vesting period, and RoTE performance in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
The Group achieved an average RoTE of 16.2% over the three-year performance period.
This resulted in 76% of the maximum potential vesting of the RoTE element 45.6% of the total award.
The TSR element comprises the other 40% of the total award.
For the March 2014 awards, the Companys TSR was positioned above upper quintile against its comparator group: for the August 2014 awards, TSR was slightly below the upper quintile.
This resulted in 100% and 83.9% respectively of the maximum potential vesting under the TSR element 40% and 33.6% of the total award.
Overall, 85.6% of the total awards vested in March 2017 and 79.2% in August 2017 as the Committee was satisfied that the financial and risk underpins were met at the end of the vesting period.
Awards under the LTIP granted in March and August 2015 are due to vest during 2018.
This is subject to the Committees satisfaction that the financial and risk underpins have been met at the end of the vesting period.
The RoTE performance period for these awards ended on 31 December 2017.
The three-year average RoTE performance for 2015, 2016 and 2017 was 18.1% against a maximum target of 17.5%.
Awards under the RoTE element are due to vest at 100% of the maximum potential 60% of the total award.
We have included these RoTE vesting outcomes plus the TSR vestings from the 2014 awards in the single remuneration figure for the CEO, the CFO and the MD Personal Lines.
You can find details of this on page 79.
Performance under the relative TSR measure will be assessed at the end of the vesting period in March and August as appropriate.

Based on the change in average pay for UK employees employed in the year ended 31 December 2017 and the year ended 31 December 2016.
Salaries are not adjusted for the number of working hours, therefore the increase partly reflects the increase in working hours for some employees during the year.
There were no changes in benefits provision between 2016 and 2017.
For employees other than the Chief Executive Officer, this includes average amounts earned under the AIP, and other variable incentive schemes, including monthly and quarterly incentive schemes operated in certain parts of the Group.
It should be noted that the bonus shows a high increase as the AIP was depressed in 2016 due to the significant reduction arising from the Ogden discount rate change.
This remains subject to review if the rate is subsequently increased following the Governments review.
Chief Executive Officers pay between 2012 and 2017 The table below shows historical levels of the Chief Executive Officers pay between 2012 and 2017.
It also shows vesting of annual and long-term incentive pay awards as a percentage of the maximum available opportunity.
Based on actual vesting under the 2010, 2011 and 2012 RBS Group LTIP.
The value included in the single figures in respect of these awards is 205,000 in 2012, 728,000 in 2013 and 2,437,428 in 2014.
The 2017 single figure reflects the estimated vesting of the RoTE portion of the LTIP granted in March and August 2015.
Any shares under the LTIP granted in 2015 will not be delivered until the end of the applicable vesting periods in March and August 2018.
However, they have been included in the single figure, as the performance period in respect of the RoTE portion has now been completed.
The 2016 single figure has been revised to reflect the actual vesting of the 2014 awards under the LTIP, an increase of 4,855.

Furthermore, the Group implemented a new policy with regards to capital distributions in 2017 whereby the Board will consider whether or not it is appropriate to pay a special dividend once a year, alongside the full-year results.
There have been no share buy-backs since the IPO.

This is calculated after any disposals necessary to pay personal taxes on acquiring such Ordinary Shares.
For these purposes, holdings of Ordinary Shares will be treated as including all vested but unexercised awards, or awards unvested but after the performance period in the holding period, valued on a basis that is net of applicable personal taxes.

A full years award to a total face value of 200% of base salary was made to the CFO-designate on 28 November 2017 as agreed as part of the remuneration package offered on recruitment.
The award is subject to the same performance conditions as awards made to the other Executive Directors earlier in the year except that TSR will be measured over the three years commencing on the date of grant.
Awards made in August and November 2017 also include an additional two-year holding period before awards may be released.
The Companys normal policy is to grant awards twice a year, after the Group announces its full and half-year results.

To do this, the Committee must be satisfied that it is appropriate to permit a bonus award at all, or at a given level.
The gateway involves some subjectivity about performance.
This may result in positive or negative moderation of each AIP performance measure or the overall bonus outcome.
The targets are commercially sensitive and will be reported in next years report.
The list below sets out the gateway criteria for the AIP for 2018.
Gateway criteria for the AIP for 2018 outcomes for Executive Directors Year-on-year changes in profit before tax Quality and sustainability of earnings, referring to reserving, gross written premium, costs and loss ratio, and relevant lead indicators Additional customer context, for example, conduct, experience, brand and franchise health Capital strength and affordability Risk management within risk appetite The Groups relative performance to that of its peers The wider economic environment Exceptional events, such as abnormal weather Any regulatory breaches and or reputational damage to the Group Committee satisfaction that paying the bonus does not cause major reputational concerns The Committee may also use its discretion to account for additional factors.
These include the quality of financial results, the direction of travel of all measures, and, more widely, reputation, risk and audit.
In considering such factors, and whether to adjust the overall payouts and or operate malus and clawback, the Committee receives appropriate input from the Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee.
COM 91 Directors remuneration report continued Performance conditions for LTIP awards LTIP awards to be granted in 2018 will continue to be subject to performance against these performance conditions: 60% based on RoTE over a three-year performance period 2018, 2019 and 2020 40% based on relative TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts over a three-year performance period, starting on the date of grant.
The starting and closing TSR will be averaged over a three-month period For these purposes, we use the Groups standard definition for RoTE, subject to such other adjustments as the Committee may consider appropriate.
To find out more about how we calculate RoTE, see page 175.
The Committee reviewed the performance targets and, in line with its commitment to both reflect the impact of the capital transactions and to ensure that awards to Executive Directors would only be payable if significant value has been created for shareholders, decided to increase the RoTE target range as follows: Performance required for threshold vesting Performance required for maximum vesting Vesting for threshold Awards in 2015 Awards in 2015 Performance measure performance Awards in 2018 Awards in 2017 and 2016 Awards in 2018 Awards in 2017 and 2016 RoTE 20% of this Average Average Average Average Average Average element of the annual RoTE annual RoTE annual RoTE annual RoTE annual RoTE annual RoTE award performance performance performance performance performance performance of 17.5% of 15.0% of 14.5% of 20.5% of 18.0% of 17.5% Relative TSR 20% of this Median Upper quintile element of the award For the TSR element, there is a straight-line interpolation between threshold and maximum performance on a ranked basis.
For the RoTE element, 20% of the award will vest for threshold RoTE and 40% for a RoTE of 18.5% for awards to be made in 2018.
Otherwise, vesting is similar to TSR: a straight-line interpolation occurs from threshold to target, then from target to maximum performance.
The LTIP awards will also vest only to the extent that the Committee is satisfied that the outcome of the TSR and RoTE performance conditions reflects the Groups underlying financial performance from the date of grant until vesting.
When considering these matters, the Committee will also consider whether there have been any material risk failings.
Pension and benefits A pension contribution of 25% of base salary will be paid to the CEO, CFO and CFO-designate in 2018.
Before his promotion to the Board in 2017, the MD Personal Lines received a pension contribution of 15% of base salary and the level of contribution has not been changed following his appointment to the Board.
No Directors participate in any defined benefit pension arrangements operated by the Company.
Benefits comprise providing a company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, life assurance, income protection and health screening.
Like all employees, the Executive Directors are also eligible for certain discounted Group products.
New Executive Director On 1 November 2017, Penny James joined the Board as an Executive Director and was appointed CFO-designate to succeed John Reizenstein.
Pennys annual salary is 675,000 with a pension allowance of 25% of salary.
She also participates in the Companys Annual Incentive Plan up to a maximum of 175% of salary and the Long-Term Incentive Plan up to 200% of salary.
As explained in the letter from the Committee Chairman, this did not reflect any increase on her package from her previous employer.
On joining she received an LTIP award over 200% of salary on the same terms as the August 2017 grant except that the vesting dates will run from the date of grant.
This was granted at the annual award level as no separate buy-out was made to compensate her for the loss of her 2017 award at her previous employer.
In addition, and as disclosed on page 90, she received one-off awards pursuant to Listing Rule 9.4.
2 to compensate for the loss of LTIP awards made by her former employer.
Performance conditions and comparator groups for these awards will be identical to those of the original LTIPs, save for the award which vests in 2019 where DLGs TSR performance will replace that of the former employer for the period from 1 November 2017 to 31 December 2018 post-joining.
Full details of the awards bought out are set out in the relevant section above.

This will only be paid once the Committee has finally determined the amount due.
Any change to the estimated amount will be reported in next years report.
The award will be subject to deferral in line with the Group's deferral schedule which is the same as that of the original award.
Change of Executive Director John Reizenstein, the current CFO, will be retiring in September 2018.
He will not seek re-election at the Companys 2018 Annual General Meeting and will accordingly step down from the Board as an Executive Director at that time.
The Committee confirmed his good leaver status without the use of any discretion.
He will, therefore, retain awards granted to him up to the date on which his planned retirement was announced in September 2017 for details of all awards see pages 87 and 88.
John will also be eligible for an award under the AIP for the period to the AGM in May 2018 and will thereafter receive base salary and benefits only until the date of his actual retirement.
