For those elements of remuneration provided in shares in 2016 and 2017, we have separated out their original value on grant and the additional value generated due to share price growth over the vesting period.
It is the Committees view that one of the key objectives of equity based remuneration is to align executives interests and those of shareholders.
The increase in value of awards due to share price growth over the vesting periods is another demonstration of this alignment.
Explanatory notes on the single figure can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration page 60.

In the Committees opinion, the impact on the total reward of the Director is more important than the single figure in any one year.
This approach encourages Directors to take a long-term view of the sustainable performance of the Company, which is critical in a cyclical business.
The ability for the Directors to gain and lose, dependent on the share price performance of the Company, at a level which is material to their total remuneration is a key facet of the Companys Remuneration Policy.

Marshalls benchmarked its average salaries against other similar companies as part of the review of job evaluations carried out by external consultants in connection with the HR system implementation and this showed that its average pay rates for equivalent jobs were generally competitive or at the higher end of the comparable range.
Saving for the future In 2017 the Group established a new defined contribution scheme within a Master Trust operated by Aviva, and increased its overall employer pension contribution, benefiting the majority of employees.
This will provide an improved pension savings mechanism for employees.
"Bonus Share Plan The Bonus Share Plan approved in 2015 provides the opportunity for those in the BSP to earn free"" bonus shares of up to 5 per cent of salary, which vest after 3 years subject to continued employment."
Sharesave Scheme Share Purchase Plan The Marshalls 2015 Sharesave Scheme encourages wider ownership of Marshalls plc shares across the entire workforce, which ensures that the employees are able to participate in the Groups success in a way that aligns their interests with those of shareholders.
The Share Purchase Plan allows employees to purchase shares ona monthly basis out of gross salary, another way of incentivising investment by employees in the Companys shares.
Fairness throughout our supply chain From living wages in the UK to the elimination of child labour in India, we are committed to ensuring that what is good for business is good for society.
Our approach to labour rights is driven by the ETI Base Code which we adopted in 2005.
To ensure that the Base Code principles are embedded within operations and supply chains, we employ social auditors in India, China and Vietnam, who regularly carry out checks and audits to ensure that the Base Code is being upheld and to report any concerns or violations so that we can take swift action should we need to.
Marshalls has also worked closely with external organisations to evaluate our business and supply chain against the principles now embodied in the Modern Slavery Act 2015 to eliminate slavery in all its forms.
Our Modern Slavery Statement can be found on the Companys website www.
Marshalls was the first company in its sector to belong to the ETI and is committed to the ETI Base Code.
Pay comparisons CEO ratio Our CEO to average employee pay ratio for 2017 is 64.1.
This is measured as the ratio of CEO single figure pay realised in the year to average mean employee pay.
To give context to this ratio, we have included a chart tracking CEO pay and average employee pay since Martyn Coffeys appointment alongside Marshalls TSR performance over the same period.
The Remuneration Committee has always been committed to ensure that CEO reward is commensurate with performance.
The chart shows a clear alignment between shareholder returns and CEO single figure pay.
The CEO single figure for 2013 was affected by the retiring CEOs 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards vesting early on a pro-rata basis owing to his good leaver status.
MARSHALLS PLC 56 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The factors leading to the increase in the ratio over the last 3 years is the strong performance of the Company reflected in the total shareholder return which has resulted in high levels of vesting of share-based incentives granted to the CEO.
The value of these incentives has also materially increased over the performance period due to share price growth, as shown in the charts on pages 53 and 54.
Shareholders expect the CEO to have a significant proportion of his pay based on performance and paid in shares.
It is this element of his package which provides the volatility in CEO remuneration and the variations in the ratio.
b T he 2013 single figure is made up of the previous CEOs base salary and benefits up to 10 October 2013 and Martyn Coffeys proportionate entitlement to salary, benefits and annual bonus for his period of service in 2013.
It also includes the various incentive payments that crystallised as a result of Graham Holden being a good leaver by reason of retirement in 2013 see 2013 Remuneration Report for full details.

TSR is defined as share price growth plus reinvested dividends.
Marshalls plc was a constituent of the FTSE Small Cap Index for the period from January 2009 to August 2015 and became a constituent of the FTSE 250 in August 2015.
This chart shows the value at 31 December 2017 of 100 invested inMarshalls plc on 1 January 2009 compared with the value of 100 invested in i the FTSE Small Cap Index and ii the FTSE 250.

Marshalls TSR performance was 232 per cent better than the overall performance of the FTSE Small Cap Index and 239 per cent better than the FTSE 250 in 2017.
MARSHALLS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 57 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Remuneration Committee Report continued Fairness, diversity and wider workforce considerations continued Percentage change in CEOs remuneration The table below shows how the percentage change in the CEOs salary, benefits and bonus between 2016 and 2017 compares with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for the UK-based employees of the Group as a whole.
b The bonus is the non-deferred amount earned for the relevant year taken from the single figure remuneration table on page 60. c A 2 per cent incr ease was awarded to the workforce on 1 January 2017.
The table above shows, however, that the average salary increase per employee for 2017 was slightly lower.
This was due to variations in overtime in the current year and specific variations relating to the impact and timing of leavers and new starters.
d T he table above shows that the average bonus per employee decreased by 34.3 per cent in 2017 compared with the prior year.
This is due to the impact of the participation of senior management other than Executive Directors in the 2017 MIP.
In 2017, the MIP bonus comprised the first year of cycle 2 of the Scheme, with no elements carried forward from cycle 1 resulting in a fall against the previous year.
Amounts carried forward from earlier years for Executive Directors are disclosed in the long-term incentive column of the single figure remuneration table on page 60.
In 2016, the final LTIP awards also vested.
Gender balance and pay At the end of 2017 our total workforce comprised 2,603 employees with the following gender balance: Male Female Total workforce 83% 17% Senior managers 86% 14% 1 Directors 83% 17% 1 S enior managers comprise those in positions of management or control within the business as reflected in job bandings and measured consistently with previous years.
The Company has also provided datato the Hampton-Alexander reporting initiative in relation to the gender balance at the levels of Board, Executive and their direct reports.
This showed a slightly higher female percentage at ExecutiveCommittee level 19.4per cent based on the smaller Hampton-Alexander reporting sample.
The UK Government Equalities Office legislation requires employers with more than 250 employees to disclose information on their gender pay gapannually.
The first such disclosure is based on amounts paid in the April 2017 payroll.
The bonus gap is based on incentives paid in the year to 31 March 2017.
The Marshalls Group has two employing companies: Marshalls plc which has less than 250 employees, mostly at Director Senior Manager level and Marshalls Group Limited, which employs all remaining employees.
The charts show the consolidated results for Marshalls plc andMarshalls Group Limited, which provides a more accurate overview of pay balance: however, the separate information that is required by the legislation in relation to Marshalls Group Limited is also included below.
This information will also be posted on Marshalls website.
CPM Group Limited was acquired in October 2017, and will report separately for 2017 as it remains a separate employer.
Marshalls is committed to equal pay and opportunities for men and women throughout the Group.
The gender pay gap analysis is based on a calculation of the average hourly pay and bonus of all our employees, irrespective of what job they do.
This shows that as at April 2017 there is a median gender pay gap of 19.3 per cent consolidated 20.7 per cent: Marshalls Group Limited, and a mean gender pay gap of 15.7 per cent consolidated 17.8 per cent: Marshalls Group Limited.
Our recruitment policies, salary and bonus structures are designed to be gender-neutral, and for male and female employees insimilar roles, the rates of pay and bonus are the same.
However, as the gender split analysis shows, more than 80 per cent of our workforce are male, andthere are more males than females in every pay band across the organisation.
This is representative of the construction sector generally.
We are evaluating the 2017 results to develop our understanding of the detailed contributory factors.
In broad terms, because the construction sector has traditionally attracted more men than women, a majority of our longer-serving employees for example in middle management or shift leader positions are male, and most of the senior roles, attracting the highest pay and bonus, are also currently held by men, we believe these are the main reasons for the difference.
With the assistance of PwC, we will be analysing the results in detail so that we are able to develop our processes.

We know our bonus awards are gender-neutral, and across our consolidated workforce more women than men participate in a bonus scheme: however, the predominance of men in senior roles carrying higher base pay means that we are also reporting a gender pay gap in mean and median bonus.

This in turn will lead to better alignment of pay with job grades, which are scored in a gender-neutral way.
We are also engaged in initiatives to make our employment opportunities more attractive to female applicants to address gender imbalance, for example in outreach programmes in schools and colleges to support women in engineering, inreviewing and improving flexible working policies for all our workforce and in ensuring that recruitment fosters applications from individuals of diverse backgrounds to improve the gender mix.
Diversity initiatives The Group has policies that promote equality and diversity in the workforce as well as prohibiting discrimination in any form.
The Group launched aCode of Conduct during 2017, initially focusing on its supply chain, which clearly states its commitment to these principles and requires a similar commitment from its business partners.
Marshalls is supportive of the initiatives reflected in the Hampton-Alexander, Parker, and McGregor-Smith reviews to improve ratios in gender and ethnic diversity at Board and senior management level as well as in the wider workforce.
Aligning pay and recruitment policies with these principles forms akey element of our planning for 2018 and beyond.
The Remuneration Committee Chairs engagement programme is expected to include a focus on initiatives to eliminate unconscious bias, if it is found, and to ensure our pay and performance policies are fair and transparent with measures to encourage applications from talented and motivated individuals regardless of gender, ethnicity, degree of physical ability or background.
Retention of such people by giving fair consideration to flexible working policies where appropriate, and ensuring incentive schemes are fairly distributed will also be key elements of our diversity strategies.
Weaim tomake progress on these objectives in moving towards the 2020 target of at least 33 per cent of our Board and senior management being female.
We welcome and give full and fair consideration to applications from individuals with recognised disabilities to ensure they have equal opportunity for employment and development in our business.
Wherever practicable we offer training and make adjustments to ensure disabled employees are not disadvantaged in the workplace.
