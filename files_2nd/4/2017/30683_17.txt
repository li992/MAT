110 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Long-term incentives summary For 2017, the figures include Performance Share Plan PSP awards granted in 2015 and AstraZeneca Investment Plan AZIP awards granted in 2014.
Performance periods for both awards ended on 31 December 2017 but shares will not be released and dividend equivalents will not be paid out to the Directors until the awards vest at the end of their respective holding periods.
The award values have been calculated using the average closing share price over the three-month period ended 31 December 2017 4999.4 pence.
The long-term incentive figures for 2016 include shares awarded to Mr Soriot in 2013 under the AZIP to compensate him for long-term incentive awards from previous employment which were forfeited on his recruitment as AstraZenecas CEO, in addition to regular AZIP and PSP awards granted in 2013 and 2014 respectively.
Performance periods for these awards ended on 31 December 2016 at which point the PSP awards vested.
Shares under the AZIP awards will not be released and dividend equivalents will not be paid out to the Directors until the awards vest at the end of the four-year holding period.
The AZIP award values for 2016 have been recalculated using the average closing share price over the three-month period ended 31 December 2017 4999.4 pence.
The PSP award values for 2016 have been recalculated using the closing share price on the date of vesting 4960.0 pence.
Figures disclosed in last years Remuneration Report were based on the average closing share price over the three-month period ended 31 December 2016 4510.6 pence.
As the share price used to calculate the value of these awards has increased, the 2016 long-term incentive award values are higher than those disclosed in last years Remuneration Report, as are the single total figures of remuneration for 2016.
The long-term incentive figures also include the value of dividend equivalents accrued during the relevant performance periods.
2015 PSP performance 77% of the PSP awards granted to Mr Soriot and Mr Dunoyer on 27 March 2015 in respect of the 2015-2017 performance period are due to vest on completion of the holding period on 27 March 2020.

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Directors Remuneration Report 111 Annual Report on Remuneration continued Annual bonus in detail Our bonus process explained Stage 1 Group scorecard The Committee assesses the Companys performance against the measures contained in the Group scorecard.
The Group scorecard for 2017 outcome assessment contained metrics under three performance measures: Achieve Scientific Leadership, Return to Growth and Achieve Group Financial Targets.
Each Group scorecard metric had a defined payout range, with 100% target bonus pay-out for on-target performance and 200% of target bonus pay-out for the maximum level of performance.
A threshold level of performance is set for each metric and performance at or below threshold level will result in 0% payout for that metric.
Performance against each metric is assessed and the Group scorecard outcome overall is the result of the combined weighted outcomes for each metric.
Information on the operation of the annual bonus scheme in 2018 is provided on page 122.
Stage 2 Overall business The Committee assesses the Group scorecard outcome to ensure that it accurately reflects business performance and the experience and individual performance of shareholders over the year of assessment.
The Committee also carries out an assessment of each Executive Directors personal performance.
assessment Taking these factors into account, the Committee determines the level of bonus that represents a fair and balanced reflection of the individual Executive Directors performance during the year.
Stage 3 Final individual Bonuses for Executive Directors will not normally exceed the historical maximum opportunities of 180% of base salary for the CEO and 150% bonus determination of base salary for the CFO.
Ordinarily, if the assessment at Stage 2 exceeds these amounts, the Executive Directors bonus is capped at the relevant historical maximum amount.
If the Committee believes it will be in the interests of shareholders to award a bonus in excess of these historical limits up to the maximum permitted under our Directors Remuneration Policy, major shareholders would be consulted in advance.
Each Executive Directors annual bonus is determined upon completion of this third stage.

112 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Achieve Scientific Leadership These targets reflect the Companys ability to deliver innovation to the market.
In 2017, we continued to make progress towards achieving scientific leadership.
The AstraZeneca pipeline includes 144 projects, of which 132 are in the clinical phase of development.
There are 11 NME projects currently in late-stage development, either in Phase III pivotal Phase II studies or under regulatory review.
During 2017, across the portfolio, 80 projects successfully progressed to the next phase.
This included eight first approvals in a major market and 12 NME progressions.
In addition, 18 projects have entered Phase I and 10 have been discontinued.
The Committee and the Science Committee assessed the substance of the achievements during the year and concluded that the results disclosed in the 2017 Group scorecard table represent a fair and balanced outcome.
The acquisitions, divestment and licensing target was set to reflect the estimated number of deals required to deliver a given level of value during the year.
Seven significant deals were completed during 2017, however the value delivered by the completion of the Lynparza collaboration with MSD was significantly ahead of that anticipated at the start of the year when targets were set.
The Group scorecard outcome reflects achievement of the target in respect of this metric.
Return to Growth These targets are based on quantitative sales targets for 2017 and relate to the Companys Growth Platforms.
The Return to Growth targets are set at budget exchange rates at the beginning of the performance period and evaluated at those rates at the end of the performance period: they are not directly comparable year to year.
Targets reflect acquisitions and disposals and take into account known events such as the biennial price reviews in Japan, which impacted 2016.
In 2017, the New Oncology therapy area and Emerging Markets region performed well, exceeding target, and Japan met its target.
New CVMD and Respiratory were below target reflecting a number of challenges in meeting these stretching targets.
The target, threshold and maximum performance hurdles for the 2017 individual Growth Platforms are currently deemed to be commercially sensitive as our competitors may use this detailed information to help predict what our targets and expectations are for growth products for future performance years and refine their competitive response.
We will disclose this information in the 2018 Remuneration Report.
Achieve Group Financial Targets These targets are based on the Companys key financial measures.
The cash flow measure is evaluated by reference to net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets.
The Core EPS and Revenue measures are evaluated by reference to budget exchange rates such that beneficial or adverse movements in currency, which are outside the Companys control, do not impact reward outcomes.
During 2017, all measures within the Group financial targets exceeded target with a strong performance.
Based on performance against the weighted measures, the Group scorecard outcome for 2017 was 157% of target bonus.
Overall business and individual performance assessment The Committee reviewed the Group scorecard outcome in the context of overall business performance and the Executive Directors individual performance.
Over the course of 2017, AstraZeneca made encouraging progress in our main therapy areas, particularly pipeline performance, as well as in commercial execution and cost discipline.
The Committee considered shareholder experience, noting that TSR performance over the year was ahead of the market FTSE30 FTSE100 and peers, and that Core Earnings Per Share EPS for 2017 was above target.
The Committee was also mindful that the results of the MYSTIC Phase III trial, which showed that the combination of Imfinzi and tremelimumab did not meet a primary endpoint progression-free survival in 1st line Stage 4 NSCLC were disappointing, as was the delay to our plans for the launch of ZS-9.
However, the Committee determined that the number of successes far outweighed the disappointments.
The assessments of the CEO and CFOs individual performance over 2017 included measures reinforcing aspects of the Group scorecard, supporting our Be a Great Place to Work strategic priority and measuring the success of initiatives to drive productivity and innovation within the business.
The assessment of Mr Soriots individual performance included progress in increasing diversity in leadership roles across AstraZeneca: achievement of key sustainability targets, including rankings within the Global 100, FTSE4Good and DJSI indices: and strong scores from quarterly employee surveys in relation to personal development and growth opportunities and establishing AstraZeneca as a Great Place to Work.
The assessment of Mr Dunoyers performance included delivery of Growth Platforms and revenues: performance against financial targets balancing short-term goals with supporting longer-term R&D investment: ongoing internal productivity programmes: and good progress in decreasing our operating cost base.
In the context of overall business and individual performance during 2017, the Group scorecard outcome is considered to be an appropriate reflection of key achievements and the level of bonus awarded to each Executive Director has been set at 157% of target bonus.
Final individual bonus assessment The Executive Directors target bonuses for 2017 were 100% of base salary for the CEO and 90% of base salary for the CFO.
The level of bonus determined under Stage 2, the overall business and individual performance assessment, equates to bonus payouts below the historical levels of maximum opportunity for Executive Directors and therefore the level of bonus awards does not need to be moderated under this final individual bonus assessment.

The TSR peer group against which performance has been assessed for the 2015 PSP was set at the time of grant and is detailed on page 113 of the 2015 Annual Report.
2014 AZIP performance The AZIP targets were disclosed at the time of award, on page 109 of the 2014 Annual Report.
The operation of the targets was revised in 2017 to address shareholder concerns that the original structure could incentivise too great a focus on short-term earnings.
The original cliff vesting approach was replaced with a sliding-scale, whereby 25% of the award will lapse in respect of any year in the performance period in which either of the performance targets are not achieved.

A new Non-Executive Director receives one third of their annual fee in the first month of service following appointment, to recognise the additional work and time involved in finalising their appointment, including activities associated with their induction as a Director.
The balance of the annual fee is paid in equal monthly instalments over the remainder of the Directors first year of service.
In the second and subsequent years of service, the annual fee is paid in equal monthly instalments.

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Directors Remuneration Report 115 Annual Report on Remuneration continued Directors interests in shares Directors interests as at 31 December 2017 Audited Minimum shareholding requirements apply to the Executive Directors and SET members.
The CEO is required to build a shareholding and hold shares amounting to 300% of base salary and the CFO is required to hold shares amounting to 200% of base salary, each within five years of their dates of appointment.
All other SET members are required to build a shareholding over time and hold 125% of base salary as shares while in office.
As at 31 December 2017, Mr Soriot and Mr Dunoyer had fulfilled the minimum shareholding requirement.
Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to build up, over a period of three years, a shareholding in the Company with a value approximately equivalent to the basic annual fee for a Non-Executive Director 75,000 during 2017 or, in the case of the Chairman, approximately equivalent to his basic annual fee 575,000 during 2017.
All Non-Executive Directors who had served for a period of three years or more as at 31 December 2017 held sufficient shares to fulfil this expectation.
The Companys Articles of Association require all Directors to acquire a beneficial interest in 500 shares in the Company within two months of appointment.
All Directors met their requirement at the date of this Remuneration Report.
The following tables show the interests of the Directors including the interests of their connected persons in Ordinary Shares as at 31 December 2017, as well as details of any Directors interests in options over the Companys shares.
No Director or senior executive beneficially owns, or has options over, 1% or more of the issued share capital of the Company, nor do they have different voting rights from other shareholders.
None of the Directors has a beneficial interest in the shares of any of the Companys subsidiaries.
Between 31 December 2017 and 1 February 2018, there was no change in the interests in Ordinary Shares shown in the following tables.

Over that period Mr Soriot has gifted 512,699 beneficially owned Ordinary Shares to family members for nil consideration, the value of that number of shares being equivalent to 2,152% of Mr Soriots 2017 base salary as at 31 December 2017.
The family members to whom the shares have been gifted do not constitute connected persons for the purposes of this disclosure, so are not included within Mr Soriots beneficial shareholding figure in the above table.

The five equally weighted performance measures attached to 2017 PSP awards are detailed below.
20% of the award will vest if the threshold level of performance is achieved: the maximum level of performance must be achieved under each measure for 100% of the award to vest.
Relative total shareholder return TSR TSR performance of the Company is assessed against a predetermined peer group of global pharmaceutical companies.
The rank which the Companys TSR achieves over the performance period will determine how many shares will vest under this measure, as detailed below: TSR ranking of the Company % of award that vests Below median 0% Median 20% Between median and upper quartile Pro rata Upper quartile 100% More information about the TSR performance of the Company, including the Companys peer group, is set out on page 120.
EBITDA Vesting under this measure is based on the achievement of threshold performance against a target of cumulative Reported EBITDA excluding non-cash movements on fair value of contingent consideration on business combinations and gains on disposals of intangible assets.
The level of award vesting under this measure is based on a scale between a threshold target and an upper target, as detailed below: EBITDA % of award that vests $12.0bn 20% $18.0bn 100% 118 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Cash flow The cash flow measure is assessed using cumulative net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets.

The level of award vesting under this measure is based on a scale between a threshold target and an upper target, as detailed below: Aggregate revenue of Growth Platforms % of award that vests $16.5bn 20% 1 $19.5bn 100% 1 The hurdle of $19.5bn was agreed by the Committee in January 2017 but incorrectly reported in the 2016 Remuneration Report due to an administrative error.
Achieve Scientific Leadership The Achieve Scientific Leadership measure covers three areas: NME approvals reflecting the Companys ability to deliver innovation to the market, major life-cycle management approvals which represent a good proxy for near-to-mid term growth and the volume of NMEs in Phase III and their registration.
These three metrics are equally weighted.
As the PSP performance measures related to Achieve Scientific Leadership are an indicator of the Companys longer-term strategic priorities, we believe that the targets and target ranges associated with them are commercially sensitive.
We will make retrospective disclosure when the targets are deemed to be no longer commercially sensitive, which we currently anticipate to be following the end of the performance period.

These scenarios assume a constant share price and do not take into account dividends paid.
Minimum performance Fixed remuneration has been calculated based on the base salary applicable in 2018, the value of taxable benefits reported in the 2017 single total figure of remuneration and pension allowances equivalent to 30% of base salary for the CEO and 24% of base salary for the CFO.
No annual bonus or LTI will pay out if threshold levels of performance are not met.
Performance in line with expectations Annual bonus equivalent to 100% of base salary for the CEO and 90% of base salary for the CFO.
LTI award vesting with a value equivalent to 250% of base salary for the CEO and 200% of base salary for the CFO.
Maximum performance Annual bonus equivalent to 180% of base salary for the CEO and 150% of base salary for the CFO.
LTI award vesting with a value equivalent to 500% of base salary for the CEO and 400% of base salary for the CFO.

These are broadly consistent with those applicable in 2017, the changes being: The Acquisition, licensing and divestment deals metric has been removed from the Achieve Scientific Leadership measure.
The impact of this activity is captured in the Group financial targets which better reflects the results, rather than a separate measure for the number of deals.
The underlying Growth Platforms for the Return to Growth measure remain the same: however, from 2018, the Committee has determined that performance should be assessed against one single consolidated measure, simplifying the overall bonus calculation and enabling more immediate disclosure of targets.
The Total Revenue measure has been replaced with Total Product Sales, being Group Global Consolidated Product Sales with performance measured at constant exchange rates.
This aligns to the Companys external guidance and focus on commercial execution to drive product sales growth.
The measure for the Cash flow target remains as net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets.
Annual bonus performance measures Measure weighting Underlying metrics if applicable Metric weighting Achieve Scientific Leadership 30% NME Phase II starts 6% NME and life-cycle management positive Phase III 8% investment decisions NME and life-cycle management regional submissions 8% NME and life-cycle management regional approvals 8% Return to Growth 30% Achieve Group Financial Targets 40% Cash flow 10% Core EPS 20% Total Product Sales 10% We intend to disclose the 2018 Group scorecard outcome and details of the performance hurdles and targets in the 2018 Remuneration Report, following the end of the performance period.
Individual performance for each of the Executive Directors will be assessed by reference to individual objectives in line with the Companys objectives for the year.
In response to a suggestion that under the type of bonus structure in place up to 2017, underperformance under one metric could potentially be compensated for by overachievement under another metric, from 2018 this possibility will be removed.
Under the 2018 Group scorecard, the achievement for each Executive Director will be assessed for each metric on a stand-alone basis.

Given the proportion of AstraZenecas revenue that is now represented by our Growth Platforms, disclosing the threshold and maximum hurdles for the Return to Growth measure could be considered to be guidance, which is not the Companys intention.
Both the Achieve Scientific Leadership metrics and Return to Growth measure are thus considered to be commercially sensitive and will be disclosed following the end of the performance period.
The Return to Growth and EBITDA measures are evaluated by reference to budget exchange rates such that beneficial or adverse movements in currency, which are outside the Companys control, do not impact reward outcomes.
The EBITDA measure is assessed using cumulative Reported EBITDA excluding non-cash movements on fair value of contingent consideration on business combinations and gains on disposals of intangible assets.
The Cash flow measure is evaluated using net cumulative cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets.
The companies in the TSR comparator group are AbbVie, Amgen, Astellas, BMS, Celgene, Daiichi Sankyo, Lilly, Gilead, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, MSD, Novo Nordisk, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi, Shire and Takeda.

Further information on the Non-Executive Directors fee structure can be found within the Remuneration Policy, available at www.
The Non-Executive Directors fees are reviewed, but not necessarily increased, every two years.
Certain of the fees were increased with effect from January 2015 following a review in late 2014.
All fees were reviewed in 2016, but no changes were proposed then.
The last increase in the basic Board fee was in 2010.
With effect from January 2018, the Chairmans fee, the basic Board fee for other Non-Executive Directors and Science Committee fees have been increased to recognise the steady increase in the Chairmans and the Boards workload and responsibilities, and the importance of the Science Committees work, which reflects our commitment to science, and ensures that the level of fees do not hinder the recruitment of Directors of the right experience and calibre in a global market.
In addition, a new fee has been introduced for the Non-Executive Director who oversees sustainability matters on behalf of the Board to reflect the increasing importance of this area for many stakeholders, including shareholders and employees.
No Board member participated in any decision relating to their own fees.

The technology has two components a homing device to a specific section of DNA guide-RNA and enzymatic scissors that cut DNA Cas9 nuclease.
In the cell nucleus, the guide-RNA sequence directs the Cas9 nuclease to cause double-stranded breaks in the target DNA sequence.
By harnessing the cells own DNA-repair apparatus, the gene being targeted can be altered, either by deleting it, adding nucleotides to it, or by turning its activity on or off.
CRISPR is a powerful tool that enables us to manipulate genes of potential importance in disease pathways and examine the impact of these modifications in a highly precise way.
Integrating this technology into our research helps accelerate the discovery of novel treatments for patients.
