Indeterminingawards,  i. e. thesumofthebonus awards may be less than the enterprise bonus pool.
The approach to the calculation of bonuses is aligned to shareholders interests and ensures that bonuses are affordable, while the ROE targets increase the performance gearing.
The committee reviews the bonus pool framework each year to ensure it remains appropriate, taking into account the prevailing environment, interest rates and expected investment returns, headcount and any other relevant factors.
com Annual report 2017 Beazley 103 Performance out-turn for 2017 The process for determining 2017 bonuses is described below, including full details of the ROE targets underpinning our bonus approach along with the guideline levels which are used by the committee in its determination for each executive director.
ROE for 2017 was 9% and the overall enterprise bonus pool in which executive directors as well as other senior employees participate was calculated based on this.
The committee then considered the individual bonus award for the executive directors and other senior employees within the committees remit.
In determining the bonus award for each individual the committee took into account the individuals contribution including, where relevant, the performance of their division.
In considering individual awards in respect of executive directors for 2017, the committee had regard to the broad framework detailed below: At the beginning of the financial year, the risk-free return RFR was set at 1.5% taking into account the yield on US treasuries of two to five year maturities.
This resulted in the following ROE hurdles and guideline bonus awards: Guideline illustrative ROE performance hurdles ROE performance bonus award as a % of maximum Threshold performance 1.5% 0% 4.5% 12.5% 11.5% 37.5% 19% 75% Maximum performance 26.5% 100% These percentages are indicative only and based on broad group results.
Within the pool framework bonus out-turns may be higher or lower taking into account divisional, strategic and personal performance.
2017 ROE performance % 2016 ROE performance % 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 2017 performance range 2016 performance range 2017 ROE performance 2016 ROE performance The framework is used by the committee as a broad guideline rather than being formulaic and applies to a broader group of executives than board directors.
A key principle of the process is that the committee exercises its judgement in determining individual awards taking into account the individuals contribution and performance.
In particular, there may be a diverse spread of returns earned across the various divisions within the business which will be reflected in bonus out-turns achieved.
The table therefore provides full retrospective disclosure of all the group financial targets that determine the annual bonuses.
