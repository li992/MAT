Rationale The Committee had a challenging task balancing competing factors when considering the potential additional award: a. T he Board believes that it was essential to gain the experience and leadership skills of the CEO, particularly in ensuring that the Groups operations globally aligned and maximise the US business, which represents a substantial proportion of revenue: b. T here was unanimous agreement that Siggi Olafsson was the ideal candidate: c. UK governance and remuneration practice has a strong bearing on the Committees position: and d. O ther global generics companies, particularly those with significant US operations, have recently awarded highly competitive up-front packages to Chief Executives who are in a comparable position.
Operation The award will operate on a similar basis to Element C of the EIP.
The key features are: The award is subject to stretching performance criteria that require the CEO to achieve priorities that have been identified by the Board as strategically and operationally critical: The performance criteria are measured over the year to 31 December 2018: The potential award would be a deferred bonus by way of an award of shares that would vest three years from the date of grant: The price used to determine the number of shares uses the same mechanism as the EIP: The award is subject to Malus and Clawback provisions in accordance with the Companys policy: and The entire potential award is subject to a holding period of five years from the date of grant.
Performance targets Due to the commercial sensitivity of the targets, a summary of the performance criteria for the potential award are detailed below.
