To ensure full alignment and transparency, LTIP performance is assessed using the same definition of ROCE as used for the reporting of key performance due to a decrease in the Private Medical insurance cost in the UK.
As a consequence of the change in the definition of ROCE discussed in more detail on page 11 of the annual report, it was necessary to restate 3.
The differences in percentage change in the CEOs annual bonus compared with that of other senior employees reflect design differences.
The large the ROCE targets for the 2016 LTIP award to ensure they remained aligned to the new definition.
The ROCE target range for the 2016 award disclosed in change in the bonus for both the CEO and other senior employees is the result of extremely strong business performance in the financial year to 31 March last years report of 17% to 23% was originally calibrated under the previous definition of ROCE.
The Committee noted that a mechanical adjustment to 2017 compared with the financial year to 31 March 2016. reflect exactly what these targets would have translated to assuming that the new ROCE definition had been in place when the targets were originally set would have resulted in a reduction to the target range of between 1.4% and 1.9%.
However, the Committee decided to take a more conservative approach by reducing each end of the range by just 1% to 16% to 22% shown in the table above.
As a result, it can be seen that while the targets have been Relative importance of spend on pay lowered to reflect the new definition, they are no less stretching than the original targets and are actually marginally more stretching.
