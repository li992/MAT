CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Remuneration report Annual statement As I explained in the annual statement introducing last years directors remuneration report, at our 2017 AGM we are required to resubmit our directors remuneration policy for approval by our shareholders as it has been three years since the policy was first approved at our 2014 AGM.
Accordingly, at our 2017 AGM there will be two remuneration related resolutions presented: the normal annual advisory vote on our directors remuneration report:and the vote to approve our new directors remuneration policy, which willapply to all payments to be made to directors from the 2017 AGM and which unless altered with shareholders approval will apply for aperiod of three years.
Pay for performance in 2016 17 As described more fully in the strategic report, 2016 17 was another good year for Greene King.
Revenue was up 6.9% whilst profit before exceptional and non-underlying items was up 6.6% to 273.5m.
This performance I am pleased once again to be able to was achieved against a difficult backdrop of increased costs, weaker consumer confidence and stronger competition.
summarise the companys remuneration policy, Reflecting performance against the stretching targets set at the beginning the way in which it has been implemented of the year, bonus pay-outs for this year were 35.8% of eligible salary for during the last financial year and the way it the chief executive and 30.3% of eligible salary for the chief financial officer.
In relation to the LTIP awards granted in 2013, which are due to willbe implemented this forthcoming year.
vest in July this year, the core LTIP award will not vest as the performance targets were not met, whilst 18% of the growth LTIP award will vest.
The remuneration committee remains very mindful of investor interest in executive Our new remuneration policy The directors remuneration policy which we are proposing at the 2017 remuneration and has again sought to ensure AGM has a high degree of consistency with our current policy, although that the remuneration policies and practices at we are proposing to make certain changes which we believe are appropriate Greene King drive appropriate behaviours by and which will enable the policy to better support our overall strategy.
management that are in the long-term interests We are making no changes regarding our policy on base salaries.
In addition, in 2017 18 our executive directors salaries will remain unchanged from of the company and its shareholders.
the base salaries which were paid in 2016 17.
The changes being proposed to the current policy will adjust the mix of incentives at Greene King so that there is an equal weighting between the annual bonus plan and the LTIP, with the maximum opportunity under each plan set at 150% of base salary.
Under the policy approved at the 2014 AGM, Lynne Weedall the maximum levels available under these plans were 100% of base salary Chairman of the remuneration committee for annual bonus and 200% of base salary for LTIP.
Accordingly, the proposal involves a rebalancing of the incentives available within the policy.
There is no increase in overall pay quantum as a result of these changes.
The reason for making this adjustment is that this revised structure is the most appropriate mechanism for introducing to our remuneration policy customer NPS in our Pub Company and employee team engagement, twoof our existing KPIs which we do not currently apply as performance measures for incentive pay.
These metrics, which will be included in the new annual bonus structure, relate directly to important pillars of our overall strategy: building strong and attractive brands: delivering industry-leading value, service and quality: and working with the best people.
As a committee we believe it is important that these metrics are emphasised through their direct inclusion in our incentive plans they reinforce that individuals experience of Greene King both as customers and employees is at the heart of what makes Greene King a successful business that is operated ina balanced and sustainable way.
54 GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2017 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE We also believe that applying these KPIs on a basis which is measured annually performance targets for the 2017 LTIP awards are not included within this rather than over a three-year performance period is better as this gives the report.
Due to timing constraints and in particular the closed period which remuneration committee flexibility to set appropriate year-on-year growth preceded the announcement of our annual results, we will be consulting targets.
At the same time as making this change, we are also introducing our major shareholders on these performance targets in the coming weeks, other features which we believe are important balances against any risk and we will disclose details thereof when the awards are made in the ofincreased focus on short-term performance: autumn, provided that the new remuneration policy is approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
within the annual bonus plan, there is no increase in the amount of cash which can be earned.
Any amounts earned over the previous annual bonus The remuneration committee consulted with its largest shareholders maximum level 100% of base salary will be subject to deferral in shares: before proposing the changes reflected in the new remuneration policy and we are grateful for the constructive responses which we received in 2017 18, the level of attainment for annual bonus on-target performance inthis process.
75% of base salary will not be increased: We are happy to receive feedback from shareholders at any time in relation a holding period three years vesting and two years holding will apply to our remuneration policies and hope to receive your support for the to the executive directors LTIP awards from 2017 onwards: and resolutions referred to above at the forthcoming AGM.
our share ownership guidelines have been increased to 200% of base salary from 100% of base salary.
Along with the reduction of LTIP quantum to 150% of base salary, we have also revisited the balance of the measures which are to be applied Lynne Weedall for LTIP awards from 2017 onwards, and in 2017 we intend to introduce Chairman of the remuneration committee afree cash flow measure for part of the LTIP awards, whilst also retaining 28 June 2017 ROCE and EPS growth as LTIP performance measures.
We regard free cash flow as one of most important measures for determining success at Greene King, and so we believe it is appropriate to increase the emphasis within our remuneration package for this measure.

Minimum relates to the value of the package assuming that current salary, benefits and pension alone are paid.
The on-target annual bonus opportunity is assumed to be 50% of the maximum award for the purposes of these illustrations.
The actual on-target level may vary from year to year reflecting the performance scale applied.
The on-target vesting level under LTIP is assumed to be 50% of the maximum award.
The maximum scenario assumes full bonus pay-out and full vesting of LTIP awards.
No assumption as to share price growth is made in either the on-target or the maximum scenarios.
Approach to recruitment and promotions The remuneration package for a new executive director would be set in accordance with the terms of the companys prevailing approved remuneration policy at the time of recruitment.
In particular, the annual bonus potential will be limited to 150% of salary and awards under the LTIP will be limited to 150% of salary.
In the case of an external hire, if required to secure an individual, the committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements, when it considers them to be in the best interests of the company, to take account of deferred remuneration forfeited by the new hire when leaving their former employer.
Any such additional buy-out payments would be one off in nature: would reflect where possible the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that forfeited remuneration: and would be limited to the value of the forfeited remuneration.
For the avoidance of doubt, there is no formal limit on the value of any such buy-out awards.
For an internal promotion to executive director level, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out in accordance with its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For both external and internal appointments, the committee may agree that the company may meet certain relocation and or incidental expenses asappropriate.
Service agreements and exit payment policy Newly appointed executive directors are offered a service agreement with a notice period of one year.
In the event of the employment of an executive director being terminated, the committee would take into account the commercial interests of the company, pay due regard to best practice and apply usual common law and contractual principles, including the individuals duty to mitigate their loss.
The payment of any annual bonus in respect of the year of termination is subject to the discretion of the committee, which may determine that an annual bonus is payable with respect to the period of the financial year served, but pro-rated for time served, and not paid until the normal due date forthe payment of bonuses.
The vesting of any LTIP awards will be governed by the rules of the LTIP.
Awards will normally lapse unless the individual is considered a good leaver.
An individual would generally be considered a good leaver if they left the groups employment by reason of death, injury, ill health, disability approved by the committee, or retirement, although the committee has the absolute discretion to treat any individual as a good leaver for any other reason.
Inthe case of a good leaver, payments would normally be scaled back to recognise the shorter period of service than the award was intended to cover and remain subject to outstanding performance conditions.
If the individual terminates employment during a holding period for an LTIP award, the holding period will normally continue to apply in respect of the performance-vested shares, unless the committee thinks it is appropriate to allow the earlier release of shares in the particular circumstances.
Annual report 2017 GREENE KING PLC 59 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Remuneration report continued Service agreements and exit payment policy continued Rooney Anand, whose employment with the company commenced on 6 August 2001, is subject to a one-year notice period from the company.
Histerms of employment do not contain any additional terms relating to compensation for termination of employment.
The terms of his appointment as chief executive were agreed and set out in a letter dated 24 December 2004.
Kirk Davis employment, which commenced on 3 November 2014, is subject to the terms of a contract dated 29 September 2014.
His employment may be terminated by the company giving one years notice, without any additional terms relating to compensation for termination of employment.
The company has power to enter into settlement agreements with executives and to pay compensation to settle potential legal claims.
In addition, and consistent with market practice, in the event of termination of an executive director, the company may pay a contribution towards the individuals legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement.
Any such fees would be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements.
For the avoidance of doubt, the policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.
There are no obligations on the company contained within the existing directors contracts which would give rise to payments not disclosed in this report.

External directorships The companys policy is to allow executive directors to take up one or more non-executive directorships in an external company, subject to board approval.
Fees received for serving as a non-executive director of an external company are retained by the executive director.
Consultation The company engages regularly with shareholders on matters relating to its strategy and business operations.
Where necessary, we also engage with shareholders and their representative bodies on matters relating to executive remuneration and it is the committees policy to consult with major shareholders prior to making any major changes to its executive remuneration structure.
The committee consulted with its largest shareholders before proposing thechanges reflected in this directors remuneration policy.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the group As explained in the general policy section of the directors remuneration policy, the committee takes into account group-wide pay and employment conditions.
The committee reviews the average group-wide base salary increase and is responsible for all discretionary and all employee share arrangements.
Consistent with normal practice, the committee did not consult with employees in preparing the directors remuneration policy.
The committee is cognisant of the requests from, amongst others, the Investment Association for companies to publish ratios comparing CEO pay to employee pay.
The committee has not, however, published this data in the directors remuneration report given the absence of a common methodology for these comparisons: the companys expectation is that it will publish ratios showing comparisons in future years when, as can be expected, UK regulations or guidance develop a common methodology.

Pension benefits for the executive directors comprised cash in lieu of pension contributions.
Long-term incentives in 2016 17 comprised the value of the awards granted in July 2014, which will vest in July 2017 and which were subject to performance targets measured over the three years to May 2017.
The value of the award has been calculated using 6.94, being the average share price for the last three months of the 2016 17 financial year, and also takes into account the value of the dividend equivalent shares which accrued on the award.
It has been assumed that the 2014 core LTIP award will not vest due to failure to meet the minimum performance conditions and that 18% of the 2014 growth LTIP will vest.
For the long-term incentives in 2015 16 the actual share price on the date of vesting has been used restated from the estimate of 1,172k for Rooney Anand disclosed in the 2015 16 annual report.
Ian Durant retired from the board on 9 September 2016.
Gordon Fryett was appointed to the board on 1 December 2016.
