At the start of 2017, we expected a challenging year ahead for advertising with continued economic and political uncertainty impacting business confidence.
Our internal forecast of a c. 5% contraction in the advertising market over the year, which set the context for the 2017 target setting, has subsequently proved to be accurate.
Despite these challenges, ITV has continued to perform strongly.
Real progress hasbeen made against operational KPIs and tight control maintained over costs and cash.
The 2017 adjusted EBITA target was set at 785 million versus the 2016 adjusted EBITA outcome of 885 million.
This lower, but still stretching, 2017 target reflected the decline in the external advertising environment mentioned above.
In addition, it should be noted that the 2016 profit out-turn benefited from a format sale in a new geography, which would not repeat in 2017.
Given these downward pressures, the 2017 actual target being 100 million below the 2016 out-turn was considered by the Board and the Committee to be stretching at the time the target was set.
However, strong performance against a number of metrics ensured that actual adjusted EBITA for2017 was 842 million which represented a significant outperformance of expectations at the start of the year.
Linear viewing is up for the second year and continues to deliver the mass audiences and key demographics advertisers demand.
Video on Demand VOD viewing is up nearly 40% with The ITV Hub now having over 21 million registered users, with good growth in online advertising.
ITV Studios delivered good organic revenue growth and we have astrong pipeline of programmes for 2018.
The remainder of the bonus 25% was based upon the Committees assessment of the contribution each Executive Director made to the overall strategy through the delivery of specic targets.
The Committee applies suitable judgement when assessing performance in this regard.
Both Executive Directors had a number of common objectives aligned to our strategic priorities and delivered well against these objectives.
The factors taken into account are summarised overleaf.

90 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information Annual Report on Remuneration Remuneration Policy in 2018 The following section provides details of how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented in 2018.
Salary Salaries are paid in line with the Remuneration Policy.
On 1 January 2018, Ian Grifths received an increase of 2.75% in line with the wider employee group.
2018 Salary Carolyn McCall 900,000 Ian Grifths 642,213 Taxable benets and pension These are provided in line with the Remuneration Policy.
Both Carolyn McCall and Ian Grifths receive private medical cover, car-related benets, and a cash allowance inlieuof participation in any ITV pension scheme.
Bonus cash and shares The targets for the annual bonus are generally set at the start of the financial year.
The targets are based on assumed market conditions and take into account both the budget for the year as well as longer-term strategic priorities.
Awards made to Executive Directors through the bonus will be paid two-thirds in cash and one-third deferred into shares under the DSA.
The performance metrics and weightings for 2018 bonuses will be similar to previous years.
The Board considers the actual targets for 2018 to be commercially sensitive at this time and we envisage including equivalent disclosures to those included for the 2017 bonus in next years report.
The Committee may adjust bonus targets or outcomes to reflect significant one-off events e. g. major transactions, foreign exchange movements or material changes toassumed plan conditions to ensure that the plan continues to reward performance fairly.
The Committee may amend the bonus pay-out should any formulaic assessment of performance not reflect the overall business performance of the year.
Share awards The performance measures for LTIP awards are reviewed annually to ensure that they remain aligned with the Companys strategic priorities over the course of the three year performance period.
For 2018, Carolyn McCall will be granted an award over 265% of salary and Ian Grifths an award over 225% of salary.
Following Carolyns appointment as Chief Executive in January 2018, the Company is currently in the process of completing astrategic refresh.
The Committee has decided to defer the setting of performance measures for the 2018 awards until the strategic refresh has been completed.
This is to ensure that the targets are fully aligned with the future strategic plan.
Major shareholders were consulted regarding this approach and the feedback was supportive.
Once the targets for the 2018 awards have been set, the Committee expects to disclose these to shareholders on the Companys website and in the Remuneration Report for 2018.
The Committee will engage appropriately with major shareholders regarding any material changes.
Malus and Clawback Malus and clawback provisions may be operated at the discretion of the Committee in respect of any cash and deferred share elements ofthe bonus and awards made under the LTIP.
Under malus, unvested share awards including any LTIP shares subject to a post-vesting holding period can be reduced down to zero if considered appropriate or be made subject to additional conditions.
Clawback allows forrepayment of bonuses previously paid and or shares previously received following vesting.
Malus clawback can be operated up to fouryears following the start of the relevant bonus year for bonuses, and up to six years from the relevant date of grant for LTIP awards.
The circumstances in which the operation of these provisions would be applied may be considered from time to time but currently include material misstatement of results, gross misconduct or fraud.
The Committee has carried out a review of these arrangements and is happy that there is no need to instigate either malus or clawback for any vested or outstanding awards at this time.

Carolyn McCall buyout arrangements In line with the Remuneration Policy, it was agreed that ITV would buy out certain bonus and share awards that Carolyn forfeited by leavingher previous employer, easyJet plc, and joining ITV.
Details of forfeited arrangements are set out in the easyJet plc Annual Report and Accounts for 2016 17.
In determining the buyout, the Committee has taken into account relevant factors including performance conditions attaching to theforfeited awards, the likelihood of the awards vesting and the form and timing of the awards.
The awards will be bought out on acomparable basis where possible, particularly where the performance period has completed.
Part of the buyout will be dependent on the extent to which legacy incentives at her previous employer vest in due course.
All elements of the buyout package are subject to continued employment.
If Carolyn gives notice to leave the Company within 12 months of commencing employment, all awards paid or that vested during this period will be repayable by her.
The buyout arrangements comprise the following: Annual bonus easyJet bonus award forfeited in respect of 2016 17 will be replaced with an award of equivalent value.
This will include acash payment of 607,287 and a deferred share award equivalent to 303,643, which will vest after three years.
Legacy deferred bonus shares shares relating to easyJet bonuses paid in prior years, and not subject to additional performance conditions, will be replaced with equivalent awards over ITV shares that will vest over the same time horizon as awards forfeited.
Long-term incentives various long-term incentive awards that were forfeited on joining ITV will be replaced with equivalent ITV share awards.
The value of the buyout in respect of the 2014 and 2015 awards will be based on the final vesting outcome for the corresponding easyJet awards.
To the extent that the 2015 award lapses, no buyout will be made.
In respect of the 2016 award, a replacement award willbegranted in due course, subject to ITV performance criteria.
Consistent with the approach taken in respect of the 2018 ITV LTIP award, the exact performance criteria will be determined following the completion of the strategic refresh.
