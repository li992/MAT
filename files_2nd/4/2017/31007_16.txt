co. uk Strategic report Governance Financial statements Remuneration Policy In 2017, following consultation with Rightmoves major investors, the Committee proposed the Remuneration Policy, set out in the Remuneration Policy Report on pages 53 to 62.
The Policy was approved with overwhelming support from our shareholders.
The Policy addresses the significant shortfall in executive directors base salaries compared with the Committees assessment of an appropriate salary for each role and the performance of the current directors.
Increases of 3% in excess of the average workforce rise have been awarded to the CEO and Finance Director from January 2018, recognising the size and complexity of each role and the present incumbents experience and capabilities.
The Committees objective is to retain a remuneration framework that rewards and incentivises our management team to deliver Rightmoves longer-term strategy with a clear emphasis on performance-related pay to reflect the culture of the Group.
The Remuneration Policy continues to provide below market levels of fixed pay with above market levels of variable pay opportunity, subject to the achievement of challenging performance measures linked to the Group KPIs.
Variable pay is geared towards long-term sustainable performance, with a high level of annual bonus deferral into shares, long-term incentive awards and appropriate share ownership guidelines.
We are committed to maintaining an open and transparent dialogue with shareholders.
We have valued the engagement with and support of our shareholders and we remain focused on disclosing clearly how much our executive directors earn and how this links to the Groups performance.

Rightmove plc annual report 2017 59 000 Governance | Directors remuneration report continued Recruitment and promotion policy The Committee proposes an executive directors remuneration package for new appointments in line with the principles outlined in the table below: Element of remuneration Policy Base salary Base salary levels will be set based on the roles and responsibilities of the individual together with their relevant skills and experience, taking into account the market rates for companies of comparable size and complexity and internal Company relativities.
In some circumstances e. g. to reflect an individuals limited experience at a PLC board level it may be considered appropriate to set initial salary levels below the perceived market competitive rate.
Phased increases, potentially above inflation, may then be offered to achieve the desired market positioning over time, subject to an individuals continued performance and development in the role.
Benefits Benefits as provided to current executive directors.
Where necessary the Committee may approve the payment of relocation expenses to facilitate recruitment, and flexibility is retained for the Company to pay legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual in relation to their appointment.
Pension Defined contributions or a cash alternative at the level provided to current executive directors.
Annual bonus An annual bonus would operate in the same manner as outlined for the current executive directors as described above and in the Annual Report on Remuneration, although it would be pro-rated to reflect the employment period during the bonus year.
Flexibility will be retained to set equivalent objectives for any new executive joining part way through a year.
The maximum bonus potential would not exceed 125% of base salary.
It would be expected that the bonus for a new appointment would be assessed on the same performance metrics as that for the current executive directors on an ongoing basis.
However, depending on the timing and nature of appointment it may be necessary to set tailored performance criteria for their first bonus plan.
Long-term incentives A new appointment will be eligible to receive PSP awards as outlined in the Policy table.
Share awards may be granted shortly after an appointment subject to the Company not being in a closed period and would be measured against the same performance criteria as the current executives.
However, any award granted outside the normal award and performance cycle may be pro-rated at the Committees discretion.
The Committee may introduce post-vesting holding periods under the PSP for new executives if it considers this an appropriate commitment in conjunction with the shareholding guidelines.
The ongoing maximum award would not exceed 200% of base salary.
For an internal hire, existing awards would continue over their original vesting period and remain subject to their terms as at the date of grant.
The new appointment would be eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plan and the SIP under the same terms as all other employees.
Buy-out awards To facilitate an external recruitment, it may be necessary to buy-out remuneration which would be forfeited on leaving their previous employer.
When determining the quantum and structure of any buy-out awards the Committee will, as a minimum, take into account the following factors: the form of remuneration cash or shares : timing of expected payment vesting: and expected value i. e. taking into account the likelihood of achieving the existing performance criteria.
Buy-out awards, if used, will be granted using the Companys existing share plans to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
