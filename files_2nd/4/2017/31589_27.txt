Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY Our overall approach to remuneration The principal objective of our Remuneration Policy is to support a performance based culture that will help drive the successful execution of our business strategy.
We aim to provide competitive levels of remuneration opportunity for our senior executives and leadership team, a significant portion of which is in the form of variable pay.
In setting the Remuneration Policy the Committee carefully considered corporate governance best practice and the companys environmental and social responsibilities.
2017 18 Remuneration Policy The table below sets out the companys Remuneration Policy that will be presented to shareholders at the 2018 AGM and subject to shareholder approval, will take effect for the 2017 18 financial year.
There is no intention to revise the Policy more frequently than every three years.
However, the Committee will review the Policy annually in order to ensure that it remains aligned with the companys strategy, appropriately positioned against the market and aligned with corporate governance requirements.
In the event that a change to the policy is required, the Committee will consult with the companys major shareholders prior to submitting the Policy for approval.

com Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Illustration of the application of Remuneration Policy As described in the remuneration principles section on page 64 the Committee believes that our executive remuneration packages should provide a significant part of potential reward through performance based incentive plans.
Set out below are the potential total pay outcomes for both Executive Directors across three alternative performance scenarios under the current Remuneration Policy.
The three scenarios are minimum, on-target and maximum performance, respectively.
For simplicity, the illustrations below are calculated before any change in share price and roll-up of dividends.

A target vesting of 60% values the ESOP award at 18% of the maximum value Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for other employees The implementation of the Remuneration Policy described above applies specifically to Executive Directors.
Where possible, principles set out in the policy have been applied to all employees to achieve alignment as per the below table: Element Application of policy for other employees Base salary Paid in cash and reviewed annually, normally taking effect 1 January.
Salaries are set with reference to internal pay levels, as well as local market competitiveness compared to roles of a similar nature and size of responsibility.
Benefits Britvic provide local market typical benefits focused on employee health and wellbeing.
The majority of employees participate in the companys flexible benefits plan.
Pension Subject to local market practice and regulations.
GB employees have rights under the GB legacy defined benefit pension arrangement which is now closed to future accrual the plan was closed to executives at the same time.
A defined contribution pension was introduced following the closure of the defined benefit pension in which UK employees are entitled to participate in.
Annual bonus Approximately 250 leaders and senior managers participate in bonus arrangements with measures aligned to that of the executive directors.
Typically, all other employees are eligible to receive a bonus linked to profit and revenue of the company as well as their individual performance.
Long term incentives The performance share plan is awarded to approximately 90 leaders globally each year.
Approximately 15 leaders also receive options under the executive share option plan.
Performance conditions for both awards are linked to those of the executive directors.
All employee share plans Where possible, we offer employees annual free share awards linked to company performance as well as the opportunity to purchase Britvic shares.
In some locations, alternative local profit sharing arrangements are available, depending on local market practices and legislation.
The value of each element the employee may receive will vary according to the employees seniority and level of responsibility.
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 71 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED Remuneration Policy notes Key changes to the Remuneration Policy The key changes to the Remuneration Policy from the Policy approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM are to align the remuneration structure with best practice expected by shareholders and wider stakeholder.
The changes are summarised as follows: Introduction of a two-year post-vesting holding period to awards for both PSP and ESOP under the LTIP to further align Executive Director interests to that of shareholders.
An increase to the CFOs minimum shareholding requirement to 200% of salary from 100%.
Clari cation that on recruitment, any awards above the normal award levels as set out in the main policy table will only be used to compensate for awards forgone from previous employment.
Differences in Remuneration Policy for all employees All employees are entitled to base salary and benefits and may also receive bonus, pension and share awards the values of which vary according to the individuals seniority and level of responsibility.
Details on implementation of the Remuneration Policy for all employees can be found on page 67.
Share awards made prior to the implementation of approved Remuneration Policy Unvested ESOP and PSP awards will continue to pay out in accordance with the relevant plan rules and previously approved Remuneration Policy at the time of award.
Any payments under these plans will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration as required by the regulations.
Committee discretion In addition to the discretion set out in this Remuneration Policy report, the Committee may apply discretion in operating the Remuneration Policy in certain matters including the following: The timing of any payments.
The impact of a change of control or restructuring.
Any adjustments to performance conditions or awards required as a result of a corporate event such as a transaction, corporate restructuring event, special dividend or rights issue.
The operation of malus and clawback provisions.
Minor administrative matters to improve the effi ciency of operation of the plans or to comply with local tax law or regulation.
Discretion regarding the treatment of leavers is set out in the Service contracts and the policy on the payment for loss of office section.
The Committee also reserves the right to make a remuneration payment that originated from before the individual became an Executive Director.
In relation to the annual bonus and LTIP plans, the Committee retains the ability to amend the performance conditions and or measures in respect of any award or payment if one or more events have occurred which would lead the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to do so, provided that such an amendment would not be materially less difficult to meet.
Recognising the dynamic nature of the Groups business and in order to provide flexibility in the near-term, the Committee retains discretion to vary the metrics of the performance measures as the business may require over the next three years.
The Committee may also make adjustments to the formulaic outcomes of incentives where, in the opinion of the Committee, they do not reflect the underlying performance of the business.
If the Committee used any of the discretions set out above these would, where relevant, be disclosed in the next Annual Remuneration Report and the views of major shareholders may also be sought.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee is kept regularly updated on pay and conditions across the Group and has reference to average pay increases and the average salaries for the wider employee population.
These metrics are considered by the Committee when reviewing the remuneration for Executive Directors.
The company did not consult with employees when drawing up the Remuneration Policy.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views The Committee is committed to on going dialogue with the companys shareholder base.
This can take a variety of forms, such as: Meetings with major shareholders to consider signi cant potential changes to policy or speci c issues of interest to particular shareholder groups: and Other dialogue to update shareholders and take their feedback on planned re nements to arrangements.
In drawing up the proposed Remuneration Policy, the Chair of the Committee engaged with Britvics major shareholders and key institutional representative bodies.
The views expressed by our shareholders during this process have been considered in the development of the Remuneration Policy.
com Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Approach to remuneration on recruitment When hiring a new Executive Director, or making internal promotions to the Board, the Committee will in principle apply the same policy as for existing Executive Directors, as detailed in the Remuneration Policy.
The rationale for the package offered will be explained in the next Annual Remuneration Report.
For internal promotions, any commitments made prior to appointment may continue to be honoured as the executive is transitioned to the new remuneration arrangements.
Our recruitment Remuneration Policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and promotion of high-calibre executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets to deliver our strategic objectives.
The details are set out in the table below: Area Policy and operation Base salary B ase salary would be set at an appropriate level to recruit the best candidate based on their skills, experience and current remuneration.
In some instances, it may be appropriate to recruit on a salary at the lower end of the typical market range and progress salary increases above the typical rate of increases provided to the wider employee workforce to align with performance and policy over time.
Benefits and pension Bene ts and pension would be in line with normal policy and may include, where appropriate, relocation bene ts or other bene ts re ective of normal market practice in the territory in which the Executive Director is employed.
Annual bonus Awards would be made under the annual bonus plan in line with the Remuneration Policy.
Maximum opportunity would not exceed 140% of base salary.
Normal LTIP awards Awards would be made under the LTIP plans in line with the Remuneration Policy.
Under the ESOP, maximum opportunity would not exceed 300% of base salary.
ESOP and PSP Under the PSP, maximum opportunity would not exceed 150% of base salary.
Additional LTIP awards On the recruitment of an executive the Committee may make a one-off performance linked award under the ESOP and PSP subject to the below limits.
Any awards above the normal award levels as ESOP and PSP set out in the main policy table will only be used to compensate for awards forgone from previous employment.
Under the ESOP an award of up to 500% of base salary may be made in a year to an Executive inclusive of the normal annual award that would be granted to an executive.
Under the PSP an award of up to 200% of base salary may be made in a year to an Executive inclusive of the normal annual award that would be granted to an executive.
Replacement awards T he Committee will normally seek to avoid using replacement awards.
However where, in exceptional circumstances, replacement awards are considered by the Committee to be necessary, they are not subject to a formal maximum, although would be designed to re ect only the value of remuneration forgone by the recruited executive or less.
In making any buy-out awards the Committee would take into account any additional LTIP awards made as set out above.
Service contracts T he Committee may agree a contractual notice period with the executive which initially exceeds 12months, as applies to other executives, particularly if it is necessary to attract executives who will be required to relocate their family.
This will reduce to a 12-month rolling notice period once the individual is 12 months from the end of their initial notice period.
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 73 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office The table below sets out items that are contained within the service contracts for the Executive Directors.

Contractual termination payment T he company may terminate the executives employment at any time and with immediate eff ect and will pay the executive an after tax sum in lieu of notice equal to the basic salary which the executive would have been entitled to receive during their notice period.
A payment may also be made in respect of outstanding untaken holiday entitlement accrued up to and including the date of termination.
Payments in lieu of notice would be paid monthly and are subject to mitigation if the executive obtains alternative income during the period.
If the executive is terminated for reasons such as gross misconduct no payment in lieu of notice will be due.
The Committee may at its discretion put the Executive on garden leave for any period provided that base salary and contractual bene ts are paid during this period.
The Committee would only use this discretion when appropriate and would seek to minimise the cost to the company if such discretion was required.
Non-Executive Directors The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment for a three year term On termination Non-Executive Directors shall only be entitled to accrued fees as at the date of termination.
In the event of a settlement agreement, the Committee may agree payments it considers reasonable in settlement of legal claims.
This may include reasonable reimbursement of professional fees in connection with such agreements.
The table below sets out details of how an Executive Directors incentives and pension would be treated on termination.
Items of fixed pay are detailed in the previous table.
Incentives Treatment Annual bonus In the case of retirement with the agreement of the Committee, redundancy, death in service, or such other reason as the Committee may in its discretion approve, the bonus will be pro rated to the date of termination and paid on the normal payment date.
Executives leaving for any other reason will normally forfeit their awards.
ESOP and PSP Awards for executives who are treated as a good leaver under the rules of the LTIPs reasons include ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, change of control, retirement with the consent of the company, and any other reason at the Committees discretion will vest at the normal vesting date unless the Committee determines the awards should vest at an alternative date taking into consideration the extent to which any performance conditions have been satis ed and time served over the performance period.
If the executive is not a good leaver, the awards will lapse immediately on termination.
If the executive ceases to be a Director as a result of death, awards will vest as soon as practicable taking into consideration the extent to which any performance conditions have been satis ed and time served over the performance period.
Other appointments The Executive Directors are not permitted to have any engagement with any other company during the term of their appointment without the prior written consent of the Board.

The Committee is of the view that the performance targets under the bonus plan are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the company to disclose them before the start of the financial year.
Disclosure of targets in advance could lead the company to be at a disadvantage as many competitors are not subject to the same levels of disclosure.
Targets and the performance against them will be disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report following the end of the financial year.
