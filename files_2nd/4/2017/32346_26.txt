The variable compensation for all employees is drawn from the AAP and is allocated by reference to role, responsibility and performance and with regard to regulatory requirements.

In addition, all UK employees are eligible to join the Intermediate Capital Group plc SAYE Plan 2014.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company and employee views The Remuneration Committee considers the employment conditions and the remuneration structures in place for all employees of the Group when setting the Directors remuneration policy.
The Remuneration Committee has oversight of the remuneration arrangements of senior investors and senior management and control function employees and reviews the remuneration structure and market positioning for other roles.
The overall and average salary increase across the Group is approved by the Remuneration Committee each year.
The Remuneration Committee does not consult with employees when setting the Directors Remuneration Policy but employees views are represented at Remuneration Committee meetings through the Head of HR and Head of Reward.
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION ICG operates in a highly specialised and competitive market, and so competition for talent is fierce.
The Committees approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay what is sufficient to attract appropriate candidates to a role.
Newly recruited Executive Directors are offered a remuneration package similar to that of existing employees in the same job role.
All Executive Directors are offered the same annual salary, benefits and pension and all participate in the Annual Award Pool and are subject to an overall cap on incentives.
Furthermore, objectives are assigned to the Executive Directors.
However, it may be necessary to offer a new Executive Director a remuneration package that differs from that currently provided to the Executive Directors in order to attract the best recruit.
This could include a higher base salary and relocation and or housing benefits.
Buying out deferred bonuses and long term incentives is permitted subject to, as far as possible, the timing, delivery mechanism i. e. shares or cash and amounts paid out being ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 85 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS set to reflect any former arrangement including potential forfeiture of part or all of the former arrangement.
As far as possible, the value of any replacement awards will reflect the expected value of the forfeited awards.
In the event of an internal promotion to the Board, the Committee reserves the right to allow any pre-existing awards or arrangements to continue notwithstanding that these may not be consistent with the approved policy.
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND POLICY ON PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE Executive Directors The Companys policy is for Executive Directors to have one year rolling contracts which are deemed appropriate for the nature of the Companys business.
Service contracts are held, and are available for inspection, at the Companys registered office.
The details of the service contracts for Executive Directors serving during the year and the treatment of long term incentive awards to Executive Directors are shown below.

In exercising its discretion, the Committee will take into account the circumstances in which the individual has left the Company, their performance and the impact that this has had on the Companys overall performance.
The Committee reserves discretion to make an annual bonus award to an Executive Director in respect of the final full year of service, taking into account the circumstances of the individuals termination of office and performance for the financial year concerned.
Non Executive Directors Non Executive Directors do not have contracts of service and are not eligible to join the designated Group pension plan or receive payment for loss of office.
All Non Executive Directors have three months notice period, are re-elected annually and with the exception of Rusty Nelligan and Virginia Holmes were last re-elected in July 2016.
Rusty Nelligan and Virginia Holmes were appointed subsequent to the last Annual General Meeting and so will be proposed for re-election at the upcoming Annual General Meeting.
Details of Non Executive Directors appointment dates are as shown below.

No further awards will be made to existing Executive Directors under the BSC plans and it is not the current intention for any more awards of Shadow Carry to be made.
The value of on target remuneration for each of the Executive Directors is based on the aggregate remuneration that the Committee has agreed should be receivable in the circumstances in which the Company achieves its targets.
The Company does not currently anticipate appointing a further Executive Director beyond the two specified.
If it does so during the period of the policy, the Company will publish a scenario chart in a similar format for that new Executive Director in the next Annual Report.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the overall remuneration policy for all the Companys employees and ensures that the remuneration arrangements should take into account the long term interests of shareholders, investors and other stakeholders.
The Company recognises the importance of communication with its shareholders, particularly through interim and annual reports and the AGM.
The Remuneration Committee Chairman and Company Secretary contacted the Companys major shareholders to offer a meeting or call to discuss the proposed changes to Directors Remuneration Policy.
Where shareholders accepted the offer, after discussions they were generally supportive of the proposals.
The Remuneration Committee Chairman and the Company Secretary also met with a number of shareholder advisory groups, including the Investment Association, ISS and Glass Lewis, to seek their input on the changes.
The Chief Executive, CFOO and the Chairmen of the Board and each of its Committees will be available to answer shareholders questions at the AGM.
The CEO and the CFOO meet institutional shareholders on a regular basis, and the Chairman periodically contacts the Companys major shareholders and offers to meet with them.
The Board as a whole is kept fully informed of the views and concerns of the major shareholders.
When requested to do so, Non Executive Directors will attend meetings with major shareholders.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 87 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DETERMINATION OF THE ANNUAL AWARD POOL AUDITED ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION The central feature of the Remuneration Policy is the Annual Award Pool AAP.
The AAP is determined by the Executive Committee and Remuneration Committee through an This section reports on assessment of ICGs financial performance.
Cash profit provides a link between income remuneration paid during generation for shareholders and employee compensation, ensuring that excessive awards to employees are not made and that any awards that are made are affordable on a cash the financial year.
Management information is provided to the Executive Committee and Remuneration Committee on performance to ensure that financial results are put into the context of wider performance and risk appetite.
All incentives are governed by an overall limit expressed in terms of cash profit.
The table below includes the cost of incentives drawn from the AAP for the financial year under review and the four previous years.
This percentage may be exceeded in any year but must not be exceeded on an aggregate average basis over five years.
Managing the AAP by reference to a five year rolling average is a shareholder protection to ensure that variable awards to employees are made in a considered long term way rather than as a reaction to a single years exceptional performance.
Realised cash profits are significantly driven by the realisation of investments, which is unpredictable and often beyond the Companys direct control.
In a strong profit year, such as this year, the Committee may choose not to distribute the full AAP, but can instead choose to retain some of it for potential use in future years, while in a lower profit year such as FY13 the Committee may choose to distribute some of the retained AAP.
This approach allows the Committee to plan over multiple years and smooth fluctuations in realisations.
In strong profit years, the Committee is not compelled to make awards which may be excessive, while in years with a lower cash profit and or no investment realisations, employees can still be appropriately incentivised to protect the long term interests of the business and mitigate the risk of undesirable loss of talent.
In both cases due regard is given to projected results of future periods and to ongoing management and retention of employees.
The amounts awarded therefore may not fully correlate to annual variations in cash profit, but this reflects the multi-year approach taken by the Committee.
The Committee is mindful each year of the appropriate level of compensation to ensure the retention of employees at all levels, and seeks to ensure that employees are rewarded against appropriate benchmarks.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS An Executive Directors annual incentive award is governed by the size of the AAP and their individual performance as determined by the annual appraisal process.
At the beginning of the financial year under review, the Committee assigned the Executive Directors a number of Key Performance Indicators KPIs broadly in the areas of fundraising and growth, investment portfolio performance, operational and risk management measures, performance management and financial performance.
88 ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 CHAIRMANS BOARD OF CORPORATE COMMITTEE REMUNERATION DIRECTORS LETTER DIRECTORS GOVERNANCE REPORTS REPORT REPORT ANNUAL REPORT ON ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS PERFORMANCE IN THE YEAR A summary of the KPIs, and the Executive Directors performance against these objectives is set out below: Link to Performance Strategic KPI Objectives Weighting Target Underperforming Target Outperforming Narrative Long Term Fundraising The Group raised 4bn of gross inflows, in line Objective third party 15% 4bn p. a. with its long term target, taking the three year capital committed average to 4.4bn.
Short Term Fundraising The target was exceeded by 500m in the year, with Objective third party funds raised across 11 strategies including some of 15% 3.5bn capital committed our newer strategies, such as Strategic Secondaries and Australian Senior Loans.
% of full realisations This has been an extremely strong year for above fund hurdle rate realisations, 92% of which were above the relevant hurdle rate.
In particular, we have successfully 15% 80% realised some of our older and more challenging vintage assets, which required significant management by our investment committee over many years.
Fund deployment in The investment market remains highly competitive line with expectations and it is therefore a considerable achievement to 50% have maintained the investment pace of our funds 10% of funds with 86% meeting their deployment targets whilst continuing to apply our disciplined and rigorous approach to investing across all funds.
Impairments At 2.7%, impairments are slightly above our historic average and relate to a small number 15% 2.5% of specific assets.
In general, the portfolios are performing well.
FMC profit margin At 41.2% we exceeded our target FMC profit margin.
This was achieved whilst continuing to invest in 10% 40% our people and the systems necessary to grow the business and to meet the increasing demands of strong governance and regulation.
Gearing We have completed the structural regearing of our balance sheet with a 200m special dividend paid 10% 0.8x-1.2x in August 2016.
At 0.95x, gearing is well within our target range.
Target adjusted ROE Adjusted ROE at 18.2% was materially 10% 13% above the long term objective of 13%.
LINK TO STRATEGY Grow assets under management Invest selectively Manage portfolios to maximise value ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 89 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In addition to the KPIs, each Executive Director is measured against the effective application of commercially appropriate risk management practices, metrics and controls.
In some years, strategic initiatives may be too sensitive to be disclosed as KPIs.
It is the intention of the Committee that these will be retrospectively disclosed in future years once they are less sensitive.
There were no such KPIs this year.
In addition, the Executive Directors are evaluated by the Board against 10 criteria in order to establish how effectively they are operating as a team in terms of their complementary knowledge and skills mix, their strategic thinking, decision making, communications, relationship and resource management.
Overall, the Board assessed their performance in FY17 to be good and improved on the previous year.
The Executive Directors are also fully appraised and that appraisal is informed by the Board evaluation, peer, HR and Compliance feedback.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS SETTING THE LEVEL OF AWARD In considering the appropriate level of awards for the Executive Directors, the Committee first considers their collective performance against their KPIs.
The Committee believes that this is necessary in order that the collaborative leadership structure and joint decision making of the Executive Committee, which has been so important to the overall success of the Group, is maintained and appropriately rewarded.
This approach has, over many years, ensured that all Executive Directors are aligned with and jointly responsible for the Groups strategic direction and key decision making.
This year the Committee was of the view that there has been extremely strong performance across the Executive Directors, taking into account all the feedback collated, and in particular the results achieved against the KPIs, and most notably, the growth in Fund Management Company profit, which was driven by the successful execution of the stated strategy, and outperforming on fundraising in a year in which the Group was raising for its less mature strategies.
The Committee also gave careful consideration to the improvements made across the Group in terms of operational risk management practice and reporting and noted the continued improvement in these areas.
This all combined to deliver record profits for the Group as a whole and both individual business segments independently FMC and IC.
The Committee noted that the impairment target was narrowly missed but were satisfied that the performance of the underlying portfolio remained strong.
The Pre-Incentive Cash Profits resulting largely from successful realisations, and strong fund management profitability were a record high at 407.5m, up 121% over the prior year.
As this is a core measure which aligns the interests of Executive Directors and employees with shareholders, the Committee considered that it was appropriate to increase overall spend on annual awards across the Group whilst also taking the opportunity to protect the future sustainability of the business.
Against the backdrop of such strong financial results, the Committee considered that awards to each of the Executive Directors should be increased compared with last year to reflect their respective contributions to the overall achievements of the Group but have exercised some restraint in the magnitude of that increase, with spend for the Executive Directors increasing by 26%, and all other employees by 20%.
The FY17 spend on awards to the Executive Directors represents a significantly reduced proportion of Pre-Incentive Cash profit as compared with the previous three years.
Additionally, the awards to both Christophe Evain and Benot Durteste positively reflect the material contributions made by each of them to the significant realisations and successful fundraising achieved during the year.
The Committee also chose to recognise the fact that both had maintained the investment discipline which is so important to the future success of the Group, particularly during such unpredictable economic conditions, and also considered the impact of the successful ICG Recovery Fund 2008 transaction.
As a result of Philip Kellers contribution to the overall achievements of the Group and effective representation of the interests of the PLCs investments through his participation in the Investment Committees, his awards have been increased compared with last year.
In arriving at this decision, we also recognised his role in effecting the significant development of risk management and operations, with a clear focus on quality and scalability.
He was also instrumental in the structural regearing of the Group and its ongoing strong financial management.

In FY17, 59% of the long term incentive awards arose as a result of the ICG Recovery Fund 2008 transaction completed during the year and 90% related to awards made in 2013 or earlier.
In the case of Benot Durteste, 71.8% of the long term incentive payments received in the period relate to awards made in his role as an Investment Executive prior to his appointment as an Executive Director.
5 Individuals are invited to participate in Third Party Carry and must pay the fair market value for their partnership share in the Third Party Carry partnership and therefore there is no remuneration value.
The percentage of the total distributable Third Party Carry by fund awarded to the Executive Directors is shown on page 94.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN RESPECT OF THE SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE In the financial year under review, in line with the Directors remuneration policy, the base salary payable to each Executive Director was increased to 375,000 per annum from 369,000 per annum, a 1.6% increase.

HOW DO WE BENCHMARK OUR COMPENSATION?
Remuneration awards are benchmarked against the following peers in the major jurisdictions where the Group operates: Listed financial service companies Listed asset managers Unlisted private equity firms Listed private equity firms Unlisted asset managers Other organisations as appropriate for the individual role Investment banks The Groups Human Resources team carries out an extensive annual exercise to benchmark proposed salaries and deferred awards for all employees.
This exercise covers employees at all levels and in all geographies and provides an assessment which shows how a particular employee is remunerated compared with the market in their particular field.
Executive Director compensation is heavily benchmarked against a range of peers and the available data set has been discussed regularly by the Remuneration Committee see page 73.
The benchmarking exercise draws on a wide variety of sources including information from recognised independent market data providers, our own insight from dealing with recruitment consultants and other advisers, experience from our own recruitment and staff turnover, and our understanding of market competitors.
Due to the unique nature of the Groups business as a listed entity which competes for talent against other asset managers and listed and unlisted private equity employers as well as investment banks, it is necessary to obtain a wide range of comparison sets.
Hence, while we do consider other listed financial service companies in our benchmarking, they are not the only relevant comparator.

ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 93 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET CARRY AWARDS AUDITED BSC awards cannot be accurately valued, as the value depends on performance over a multi-year period and, if a hurdle is not met, awards may never have any value.
Amounts actually received under BSC awards are disclosed in the single figure table under Long Term Incentives in the year in which they arise see page 90.
To allow budgeting and management of allocations from the AAP an internal assumption is made as to the potential investment performance of balance sheet investments at a money multiple of 1.5 times.
Despite the uncertainty of both the value and timing of this return, no risk weighted discount is applied.
While the actual outcome will inevitably be different, the below table shows the notional value of BSC that was allocated from the AAP for awards made to Executive Directors in respect of FY17.
This is not included within the Single Figure Table.
Notional value as a charge to AAP Christophe Evain Benot Durteste 514,480 Philip Keller 344,043 Executive Directors allocation of BSC represents 4.3% of the total available for allocation to employees in FY17.
SHAREHOLDER IMPACT OF AWARDS For all awards made during the 2010 11 financial year and subsequent financial years, the Company has used, and intends in the future to use, market purchased shares to satisfy any equity settled incentive awards.
The Committee has set a dilution limit for FMC Equity Awards the FMC Equity Pool of 20% of the issued share capital of the FMC that may be made the subject of FMC Equity Awards.
The Company has established the ICG EBT 2015 which may be used to hold shares and cash in conjunction with employee incentive schemes established by the Company from time to time.
