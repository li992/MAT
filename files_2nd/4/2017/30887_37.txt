As can beseen, the ratio has typically been around 50:1, with the ratio being higher in 2014 as a result of the partial vesting ofLong-Term Incentive awards in that year.

Accrued benefit for Jerry DeMuro is the total value of his Section 401 k account, including both employee and company contributions as well as investment returns.
Peter Lynas is a member of the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme ExPS and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 2000 Plan which together provide a pension for executive directors payable at 62 of 1 30th of three-year average final salary for each year of service subject to the payment of members contributions currently 8%.
Benefits paid prior to age 62 for ExPS and age 65 for 2000 Plan will be subject to actuarial reduction.
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target benefit for executive directors payable from normal retirement age of 1 30th of Final Pensionable Pay FPP for each year of ExPS pensionable service subject to a maximum of two-thirds of FPP.
FPP is defined as annual base salary averaged over the last 12 months prior to leaving service in respect of service accrued to 5 April 2006 and 36 months prior to leaving in respect of service from 6 April 2006.
The ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-service benefit equal to four times base salary at date of death, and a spouses death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of the prospective pension at normal retirement age.
Spouses pensions arealso payable upon death in retirement and death after leaving the Companys employment with a deferred pension.
Once in payment, pensions are increased annually by the rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum increase of 5% per year in respect of pre-6 April 2006 service and 2.5% per year in respect of service from 6 April 2006.
Peter Lynas joined the ExPS in 1999.
BAE Systems 108 Annual Report 2017 Annual remuneration report continued The 2000 Plan provides a pension of 1 50th of Final Pensionable Earnings FPE for each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement age of 65 and members pay contributions of 8% of Pensionable Earnings.
FPE under the 2000 Plan is the best consecutive three-year average of base salary and bonus in the ten Plan Years prior to leaving, less an offset for State pensions.
The Company decided in 2006 to limit pensionable bonuses in the 2000 Plan in the 2006 07 Plan Year to 20% of base salary and to 10% of base salary for the 2007 08 Plan Year and thereafter.
However, there is a guarantee that the FPE figure for benefits in respect of service prior to 6 April 2007 will not be less than the FPEfigure at 5 April 2007 to ensure that employees do not lose the benefit of contributions paid on past bonuses.
PeterLynas has 32 years and two months service in the 2000 Plan.
The review of pension policies carried out in 2010 by the Committee concluded that the pension benefits should continue to be based on the Companys registered pension schemes and that, in appropriate circumstances, the Company will continue to have the option to offer an unfunded pension promise so as to mitigate the impact of further reductions to the Lifetime Allowance and the impact of the reduced Annual Allowance.
Peter Lynas was given the choice to remain in the current arrangement and pay the increased tax or to take an unfunded promise: he elected for the latter.
The Committee has decided that in cases where the Company is to pay an unfunded promise, executives will be given the choice to commute some or all of the benefit for a taxable lump sum, or take it as pension.
Where an unfunded pension is taken, ten years after retirement, the executive will be given a further opportunity to commute the residual value of the unfunded pension for a lump sum.
Therefore, Peter Lynas total pension is the sum of his 2000 Plan benefits plus the top-up from the ExPS, most of which isprovided through the unfunded promise referred to above.
Ian King is a member of the ExPS which he joined in 1999 and the 2000 Plan, with benefits in line withthose set outabove and had opted to take an unfunded promise.
At his retirement on 30 June 2017 he had 34 years service inthe 2000 Plan and became a pensioner member.
As reported last year, when he retiredas a director and ceased employment on 30 June 2017, his retirement constituted early retirement with Company consent for pension purposes and, accordingly, he was entitled to an immediate pension.
Under the rules of the 2000 Plan and the ExPS, and as set outabove, a pension of 1 30th of three-year final average salary for each year of service subject to the payment of members contributions currently 8% is payable at 62 years of age.
Benefits paid prior to age62 for ExPS and age 65 for2000 Plan will be subject to actuarial reduction, currently a reduction of 4% to annual benefits for each year that retirement takes place prior to 62 for ExPS and 65 for 2000 Plan, with proportionate reductions applied in respect ofpart years.
Ian King was 61 at the date ofhis retirement and his pension payments werereduced accordingly.
Charles Woodburn participates in the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme Defined Contribution Retirement Plan EPSDCRP, which is a defined contribution arrangement for senior executives.
Charles Woodburn contributes the maximum 10,000 per annum into the EPS DCRP arrangement as permitted by the Annual Allowance limit and a 19%salary supplement is paid in lieu of the Company contributions.
