Remuneration committee report Remuneration committee chairmans annual statement On behalf of the board, I am pleased to present my first directors remuneration report as chairman, having been appointed following the 2017 annual general meeting AGM.
I would like to thank my predecessor, David Harrel, for his contribution to the committee and support throughout my transition to this role.
2017 has been a busy year for the remuneration committee.
In addition to the committees usual activities, we have undertaken an extensive review of the remuneration policy, which applies to executive directors in order to ensure that it remains fit for purpose, aligned to our business strategy and supportive of the interests of shareholders and clients.
We have also ensured that the key principles of the remuneration policy are consistently applied to executive committee members.
Membership and attendance As part of this process, I had the opportunity to meet with a number of our larger shareholders to discuss our proposed Director Meetings attended eligible to attend revisions to our remuneration policy that will apply for the next S F Gentleman chairman 4 4 three years.
I would personally like to thank them all for their J W Dean 4 4 valuable and considered input into this process.
Their feedback K A Matthews 4 4 has been very helpful in informing the committees view.

There are no material changes to the EIP structure, but we have A new remuneration policy for 2018 increased the level of disclosure In line with our now established three-year cycle, a new We operate one single incentive plan for executive directors, remuneration policy is being put forward to our shareholders the EIP which combines both short and long term metrics for approval at our AGM in May 2018.
In setting this policy, and recognise that it is atypical in the market.
We believe, the priorities for the committee have been to ensure that however, that it continues to work well in incentivising remuneration structures and performance measures: positive business and financial performance and aligning the support the future strategy of our business, reflecting the need interests of executive directors with our shareholders and for investment at different times in the market cycle and the clients.
We therefore propose to retain the EIP structure in its opportunities for inorganic growth that may arise current form.

continue to comply with regulations and industry best practice.
From a shareholder perspective, the key difference in our approach when compared with a more traditional annual A summary of the proposed changes to our policy is set out below, bonus and long-term incentive construct, is the additional with further details presented on pages 86 and 87. disclosure of long-term performance metrics that accompany separate long-term incentive schemes.
This year, therefore, we will disclose, on a forward-looking basis, the long-term performance ranges against which we will be assessing performance.
This aims to improve transparency for shareholders as to the performance ranges that will apply to the long-term elements of our plan.
The long-term targets for the 20182020 cycle are disclosed on page 87 of this report.
Increase the maximum opportunity under the EIP from 200% to 300% of salary and retained holding restrictions Our existing remuneration policy was introduced at a time when there was significant regulatory uncertainty as to whether smaller banks would be required to comply with new bonus capping requirements introduced under the Capital Requirements Directive.
In response to this uncertainty, and anticipating that this would be likely to become required practice across the sector, a maximum 200% cap was included in our remuneration policy which was approved in advance of any clarification from the regulator regarding its expectation.
Our approach, however, reserved the firms position regarding fixed salaries until the regulations became clearer.
The UK regulator has since confirmed that it does not expect smaller banks, including Rathbones, to comply with this capping requirement.
In reviewing our remuneration policy, the committee has concluded that this cap has reduced total remuneration levels to an uncompetitive level when compared to peers, who, as non-banks, did not and were not required to apply the cap in a similar way.
com 81 Remuneration committee report continued The committee discussed at length the appropriateness of 3.
Increase in the weighting of performance metrics linked to both increasing the maximum opportunity of the EIP in the the long-term and financial performance, whilst removing current environment, recognising the wider sensitivities and personal objectives market focus on executive pay and the award quantum at In the consultation process, some shareholders did highlight this time.
We placed considerable emphasis on the a desire for a greater proportion of the EIP to be based on importance to shareholders and stakeholders of ensuring financial metrics only, to ensure that only a similar proportion that the remuneration arrangements we have in place were of the total EIP award as a percentage of base salary could be sufficiently competitive and appropriate both for current and earned from the non-financial components.

determined that any increase should be applied to the incentive element of the plan as opposed to fixed pay.
In The personal objective element 20% has been replaced with setting the quantum of the award, the committee observed a 5% increase in the strategic element, a 5% increase to the that the proposed package for the executive directors was short-term financial metrics and a 10% increase to the longconsistent with the lower quartile of our competitive market.
Overall, this means the EIP will be 80% This reflected the committees desire to balance the need for weighted towards financial metrics, of which 50% are an award increase with any concerns on pay ratcheting weighted to long-term.
This, combined with the five-year and or excessive focus on benchmarking.
The committee deferral and full restriction on share sales over this period, reaffirmed the current five-year holding and vesting means a significant portion of this plan is measured over provisions associated with all deferred share awards to eight years.
In removing the personal element, the committee ensure that executive director interests were aligned noted the tension between investors desire for less for the longer term.

Recognising the wider sensitivities to increasing quantum, the committee was very keen to test the proposal with Our policy requires that a minimum of 70% of the EIP will shareholders as part of a consultation process before be based on financial performance measures.
This is to finalising its decision.

We would consult with shareholders before making any changes to the weightings as they have been implemented for 2018.
