In setting the Directors remuneration policy, the Committee considers a range of factors including: Conditions elsewhere in the Group Across the Group, remuneration is reviewed regularly with the intention that all employees are paid appropriately in the context of their local market and given their individual skills, experience and performance.
Each business units salary increase budget is set with reference to local market conditions.
The Remuneration Committee considers salary increase budgets in each business unit when determining the salaries of Executive Directors.
Prudential does not consult with employees when setting the Directors remuneration policy.
Prudential is a global organisation with employees and agents in multiple business units and geographies.
As such, there are practical challenges associated with consulting with employees directly on this matter.
As many employees are also shareholders, they are able to participate in binding votes on the Directors remuneration policy and annual votes on the Annual report on remuneration.
Shareholder views The Remuneration Committee and the Company undertake regular consultation with key institutional investors on the remuneration policy and its implementation.
This engagement is led by the Remuneration Committee Chair and is an integral part of the Companys investor relations programme.
The Committee is grateful to shareholders for their feedback and takes this into account when determining executive remuneration.

The Chairman and the Group Chief Executive attend meetings by invitation.
The Committee also had the benefit of advice from: Group Chief Risk Officer: Chief Financial Officer: Group Human Resources Director: and Director of Group Reward and Employee Relations.
Individuals are never present when their own remuneration is discussed and the Committee is always careful to manage potential conflicts of interest when receiving views from Executive Directors or senior management about executive remuneration proposals.
During 2017, Deloitte LLP was the independent adviser to the Committee.
Deloitte was appointed by the Committee in 2011 following a competitive tender process.
As part of this process, the Committee considered the services that Deloitte provided to Prudential and its competitors, as well as other potential conflicts of interest.
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and voluntarily operates under their code of conduct when providing advice on executive remuneration in the UK.
Deloitte regularly meet with the Chair of the Committee without management present.
The Committee is comfortable that the Deloitte engagement partner and team providing remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with Prudential that may impair their independence and objectivity.
The total fees paid to Deloitte for the provision of independent advice to the Committee in 2017 were 56,000 charged on a time and materials basis.
During 2017, Deloitte gave Prudential management advice on remuneration, as well as providing guidance on capital optimisation, digital and technology, taxation, internal audit, real estate, global mobility and other financial, risk and regulatory matters.
Remuneration advice is provided by an entirely separate team within Deloitte.
In addition, management received external advice and data from a number of other providers.
This included market data and legal counsel.
This advice, and these services, are not considered to be material.
During the year, the Company has complied with the appropriate provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code regarding Directors remuneration.

2017 AIP performance measures and achievement Target-setting process For the financial AIP metrics, the performance ranges are set by the Remuneration Committee prior to, or at the beginning of, the performance period based on the annual business plans approved by the Board.
These reflect the ambitions of the Group and business units, in the context of anticipated market conditions.
The Committee seeks advice from the Group Risk Committee on risk management considerations to be applied to remuneration architecture and performance measures to ensure risk management culture and conduct is appropriately reflected in the design and operation of Executive Directors remuneration.
In 2017, the AIP performance measures were simplified from seven to four measures and Executive Directors 2017 bonuses were determined by the achievement of IFRS operating profit, operating free surplus, NBP EEV profit and cash flow, which are aligned to the Groups growth and cash generation focus.
This reflected the Committees objective to simplify the AIP metrics.
As part of the continuing implementation of Solvency II, the weightings of the Group Chief Risk Officers AIP performance targets with effect from 2017 were changed so that the entire AIP outcome relates to a combination of functional and personal measures.
Financial performance The Committee reviewed performance against the performance ranges at its meeting in March 2018.
Of the bonus performance metrics, the maximum targets were all exceeded other than Group IFRS operating profit, Savings & Retirement Solutions cash flow and IFRS operating profit, and Prudential Corporation Asia operating free surplus generated and IFRS operating profit which were between plan and maximum and Group NBP EEV profit and Prudential Corporation Asia NBP EEV profit which were between threshold and plan.

Update on performance against targets for awards made in 2016 and 2017 under the Prudential Long Term Incentive Plan As at 31 December 2017, Prudentials TSR performance during the period 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017 was ranked between median and upper quartile and during the period 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 was ranked in the upper quartile.
Prudentials Group IFRS operating profit performance between 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017 was 5 per cent above the stretch target established for 2016 PLTIP awards.
The Groups IFRS achievement between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017 was 2 per cent above the stretch target adopted for 2017 PLTIP award.
Between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017, the Group also made good progress towards meeting the measures which form part of the sustainability scorecard used for 2017 to 2019 PLTIP awards: Capital measure As at 31 December 2017, the Groups Solvency II operating capital generation was above the plan level.
Conduct measure During 2017, there were no significant conduct culture governance issues that resulted in significant capital addons or material fines.
Diversity measure As at 31 December 2017, 25 per cent of our Leadership Team was female.
This represented good progress towards the target that 27 per cent of the Leadership Team be female by the end of 2019.
Remuneration in respect of performance periods ending in 2017 Long-term incentive plans with performance periods ending on 31 December 2017 Our longterm incentive plans have stretching performance conditions that are aligned to the strategic priorities of the Group.
In deciding the portion of the awards to be released, the Committee considered actual financial results against these performance targets.
The Committee also reviewed underlying Company performance to ensure vesting levels were appropriate, including an assessment of whether results were achieved within the Group and business units risk framework and appetite.
The Directors remuneration policy contains further details of the design of Prudentials longterm incentive plans.
Prudential Long Term Incentive Plan PLTIP In 2015, all Executive Directors were granted awards under the PLTIP.
The awards were subject to challenging targets.

TSR is measured on a local currency basis since this has the benefit of simplicity and directness of comparison.
The peer group for the 2015 awards is: Aegon Aflac AIA AIG Allianz Aviva AXA Generali Legal & General Manulife MetLife Munich Re Old Mutual Prudential Financial Standard Life Sun Life Financial Swiss Re Zurich Insurance Group Following the merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management during the year, the Remuneration Committee determined that Standard Life would be retained in the peer group for the premerger period and the combined entity would be included in the peer group from the date of the merger for all outstanding PLTIP awards.
Prudentials TSR performance during the performance period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017 was between the median and upper quartile of the peer group ranked 6th.
The portion of the awards related to TSR that therefore vested was 91.67 per cent.
Under the IFRS measure, 25 per cent of the award vests for meeting the threshold IFRS profit set at the start of the performance period increasing to full vesting for performance at or above the stretch level.

All the individual business units exceeded their stretch performance target and achieved 100 per cent vesting, other than Asia which exceeded plan performance, but not the stretch target, and therefore vested at 87 per cent.
Details of business unit IFRS targets have not been disclosed as the Committee considers that these are commercially sensitive and disclosure of targets at such a granular level would put the Company at a disadvantage compared to its competitors.
The Committee will keep this disclosure policy under review based on whether, in its view, disclosure would compromise the Companys competitive position.

co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults Recruitment arrangements In making decisions about the remuneration arrangements for those joining the Board, the Committee worked within the Directors remuneration policy approved by shareholders and was mindful of: The skills, knowledge and experience that each new Executive Director brought to the Board: The need to support the relocation of executives to enable them to assume their roles: and Its commitment to honour legacy arrangements.
Appointing highcalibre executives to the Board and to different roles on the Board is necessary to ensure the Company is well positioned to develop and implement its strategy and deliver longterm value.
As the Company operates in an international market place for talent, the best internal and external candidates are sometimes asked to move location to assume their new roles.
Where this happens, the Company will offer relocation support.
The support offered will depend on the circumstances of each move but may include paying for travel, shipping services, the provision of temporary accommodation and other housing benefits.
Executives may receive support with the preparation of tax returns, but no current Executive Director is tax equalised.
Mark FitzPatrick joined the Board during the year.
As Mark did not need to relocate to enable him to assume his role and he had no awards from his previous employer to replace, there were no specific arrangements required for his recruitment.
Nic Nicandrou changed Board role during the year.
As this change resulted in Nic relocating to enable him to assume his new role, relocation support in line with the approved Directors remuneration policy was provided.
Details of this support are included in the notes to the 2017 single figure table.

Tonys deferred bonus awards will be released in accordance with the plan rules and remain subject to malus and clawback provisions.

60 per cent of this bonus will be paid in 2018 and 40 per cent will be deferred for three years, subject to malus and clawback provisions.
The Committee also exercised its discretion in accordance with the approved Directors remuneration policy and determined that Tony should be allowed to retain his unvested PCA LTIP and PLTIP awards granted in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
These awards will vest in accordance with the original timetable, subject to the original performance conditions, remain subject to malus and clawback provisions, and will be prorated for service.
