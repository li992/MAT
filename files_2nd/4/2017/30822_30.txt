Subject to a Committee-operated discretionary assessment of underlying financial performance During the year, consideration was given to whether to introduce a further holding period under the performance share plan.
The Committee believes that the current performance period of three, four and five years, combined with clawback provisions of one year following vesting, already provides strong alignment between the Executive Directors and shareholders, although this position will be kept under review.
Malus and clawback Shares awarded under the deferred bonus plan and the performance share plan are subject to malus provisions.
The Committee may apply malus at its discretion in circumstances including but not limited to : a material misstatement of the Companys audited financial results a material failure of risk management by the Company, any Group company or business unit a material breach of any applicable health and safety or environmental regulations by the Company, any Group company or business unit serious reputational damage to the Company, any Group company or business unit serious misconduct of the individual The annual bonus and the performance share plan are also subject to clawback provisions.
The Committee may at its discretion seek to apply clawback in circumstances of: a material misstatement of the Companys audited financial results where the individual is responsible or accountable and where Executive Directors would always be deemed to have management responsibility serious misconduct of the individual Clawback provisions may be applied up to two years following the determination of the annual incentive and up to one further year following vesting for awards under the performance share plan.
Taking into account the three, four and five year vesting timescales, this means that performance share plan awards may be reclaimed for up to four, five and six years, respectively, from the date of award.

TSR is dened as share price growth plus reinvested dividends.
Since 2009, a key driver for growth in value within the UK real estate market has been exposure to central London properties.
As a result of the demerger of Capital & Counties from Liberty International now intu properties plc in 2010, intus portfolio does not include properties in central London and intu has therefore not benefited from the uplift experienced by those property companies with exposure to London.
However, given the cyclical nature of the property sector, we would not expect this trend to endure over the long-term cycle.
For additional context, the following two charts have been provided to show intus absolute total return NAV growth plus dividends and total property return capital value growth adjusted for capex and net income expressed as a percentage of capital employed over the same period.
intus total property return is shown relative to the IPD monthly retail index.
