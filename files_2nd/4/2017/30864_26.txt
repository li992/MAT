As you can see from the charts on page 125, sustained growth across all of our key performance metrics has delivered substantial value to our shareholders.
This has been reflected in both the annual bonuses paid and the release of longterm incentive awards, as set out in the Annual report on remuneration.
In particular, the longterm incentives awarded to Executive Directors in 2015 had stretching performance conditions attached to vesting and were denominated in shares or ADRs.
The value generated for shareholders through share price growth and dividends paid over the last three years is reflected in the value of the LTIP releases.
The value of these performancerelated elements of remuneration is added to the fixed packages provided to Executive Directors to calculate the 2017 single figure of total remuneration.
The total 2017 single figure for the Group Chief Executive is higher than the total 2016 single figure, which is chiefly a result of the higher value of the 2015 PLTIP release.
The values for the current Executive Directors who were Directors during the year are outlined in the table below: Fixed pay Performance related 2017 Pension and 2017 LTIP 2017 2016 Executive Director Role salary benefits bonus vesting single figure single figure 1 Mark FitzPatrick Chief Financial Officer 335,000 102,000 1,197,000 1,634,000 N A John Foley Chief Executive, M&G Prudential 765,000 306,000 1,283,000 2,378,000 4,732,000 4,291,000 2 3 Nic Nicandrou Chief Executive, PCA 869,000 521,000 1,414,000 2,016,000 4,820,000 4,184,000 Anne Richards Chief Executive, M&G 400,000 253,000 2,400,000 3,053,000 3,875,000 4 Barry Stowe Chairman & CEO, NABU 880,000 279,000 5,354,000 3,109,000 9,622,000 7,679,000 Mike Wells Group Chief Executive 1,103,000 769,000 2,072,000 4,758,000 8,702,000 7,370,000 Notes 1 Mark FitzPatrick was appointed to the Board on 17 July 2017 as Chief Financial Officer.
