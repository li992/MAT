When determining bonus outcomes the Committee will take health, safety and environmental performance into consideration and may reduce the bonus awards if it considers it appropriate.
One third of any bonus paid will be deferred into shares for a three year period.
Full retrospective disclosure will be made.
Commentary No change to maximum awards or performance measures from last year.
The Committee remains comfortable that the structure of the annual bonus does not encourage inappropriate risk taking and that the mandatory deferral of one third of bonus into shares provides clear alignment with shareholders and fosters a longer term link between annual performance and reward.
The Committee considers the targets set for 2018 to be at least as demanding as in previous years and were set after taking due account of the Companys commercial circumstances and inflationary expectations.

The plan was rolled out in 2016 and at this time, the cap was set at 65,000: and is increased each year in line with inflation and from April 2018 will be 67,620.
Employees who earn in excess of the pension cap receive a pension supplement.
For current Executive Directors this supplement is up to 25% of salary: however from 2018, any new appointments to the role of Executive Director or to the Executive Committee will receive a supplement of up to 15% in line with the general population.
Where employees elect not to join the pension plan, cash is paid in lieu of a Company pension contribution.
Again, for current Executive Directors this is set at 25% of salary: however from 2018, any new appointments to the role of Executive Director or to the Executive Committee will receive a supplement of 15% in line with the general population.
Steve Foots pension provision Steve Foots accrues pension benefits under the Croda Pension Scheme CPS with an accrual rate of 1 60th and an entitlement to retire at age 60.
From 6 April 2011 onwards, pension benefits accruing are based on a capped salary.
This cap was 187,500 until April 2014 at which point it reduced to 150,000, and due to annual allowance regulations and changes to the pension scheme, reduced to 37,500 in April 2016 reduced from the scheme cap of 65,650 due to annual allowance regulations.
If Steve Foots retires before he is 61, a reduction will be applied to the element of his pension accrued after 6 April 2006.
If he retires before the age of 60, a reduction will be applied to the element of his pension accrued before 6 April 2006, unless in either instance, he is retiring at the Companys request.
In the event of death, a pension equal to two-thirds of the Directors pension would become payable to the surviving spouse.
Steve Foots pension in payment is guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 10% per annum for benefits accrued before 6 April 2006, and in line with inflation up to a maximum of 2.5% per annum for benefits accrued from 6 April 2006 onwards.
Steve Foots is entitled to death-in-service benefits from the CPS.
He also receives a pension supplement at 25% of salary above his personal pension benefit cap.
Jez Maidens pension provision Jez Maiden has elected not to join the CPS and is therefore paid a pension supplement of 25% of salary.
He has an agreement with the Company to provide him with death-in-service benefits outside of the CPS.
Keith Laydens pension provision As previously detailed, Keith Layden started to draw his pension under the CPS on 19 October 2014.
He can draw this deferred pension, with Company consent, while continuing in employment.
His pension will increase in line with retail price index RPI to a maximum of 10% per annum for pension accrued before April 2006 and a maximum of 2.5% for pension accrued afterwards.
Keith Layden was paid a pension supplement of 25% of salary up until his retirement as an Executive Director in April 2017.
Keith Layden retirement As announced on 28 February 2017, Keith Layden retired from his role as Chief Technology Officer and Executive Director on 30 April 2017.
Keith continued to receive base salary and contractual benefits up to his retirement date at which time these payments and benefits ceased.
In line with the provisions in the relevant plan rules, as a retiree, he was considered to be a good leaver.
As a result, he was eligible to receive a pro-rata annual bonus payment for the period of his employment in 2017 based on the number of complete calendar months worked in the relevant year.
The payment will be made at the normal time calculated based on the performance targets tested over the complete financial year.
One-third of the bonus earned will be deferred for three years.
With regard to his outstanding shares awards, as a good leaver, these will remain eligible to vest in line with the relevant plan rules.
Vesting in connection with Performance Share Plan awards will be subject to a pro-rata reduction to reflect the proportion of the relevant performance periods for which he was employed and with performance targets tested at the normal time.
The holding period applying to vested share awards will continue to apply.
No PSP awards were made in 2017.
No further payments will be made in connection with his retirement.
