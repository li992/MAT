Implementation for 2017 18 95 Summary of remuneration policy 96 Dear Shareholder, The objective of the Directors Remuneration Report for 2016 17 is to set out in a simple and transparent way how SSE pays its Directors executive and non-executive : the decisions made on their pay and how much they received in relation to 2016 17 performance.
The report also describes how this links to the Companys purpose and strategy: how the Remuneration Committee works, and how it has given due consideration to the perspectives of SSEs stakeholders.
Linking Executive Directors remuneration with SSEs purpose and strategy It is key that our overall remuneration policy is aligned to SSEs core purpose of providing energy in a reliable and sustainable way: energy is a long-term business requiring effective stewardship.
It must also be aligned to SSEs strategy of efficient operations and disciplined investment, which requires genuine customer focus and strong delivery capability, across a balanced range of energy businesses.
In addition, it must be consistent with SSEs wider commitment to being a responsible company, which, in remuneration terms, means a policy characterised by simplicity to enable effective stakeholder scrutiny and balance to take account of a broad range of considerations.
Finally, remuneration policy must be characterised by fairness: fair to the Executive Directors themselves: fair relative to the rest of the SSE team: fair in terms of the value delivered to SSEs investors by its Executive team: and fair in terms of SSEs contribution to society as a whole.
Together, stewardship, customer focus, S SS SE p E pl lc c A An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt 2 t 20 01 17 7 80 80 1.

4 Lord Smith of Kelvin stepped down as Chairman on 23 July 2015 and was retained by SSEs Executive Committee for a further year to provide advice and counsel on key business issues relating to Scotland.
5 SSE offers all staff a range of voluntary benefits some of which operate under a salary sacrifice arrangement.
The salaries shown above is reported before any such adjustments are made.
6 Benefits relate to company car, Share Incentive Plan company contributions and medical benefits.
7 The AIP figures above show the full value of the award before 33% was deferred in shares.
8 The PSP awards due to vest in 2016 lapsed in full.
The estimated value shown in the table above is based on the average share price in the three months to 31 March 2017 of 15.19p, as is required by the reporting regulations.
The awards remain subject to service until May 2017 and so the prior year comparative will be restated in next years report to show the actual value on vesting, as is required by the regulations.
9 The pension value represents the cash value of pension accrued over 1 year x a multiple of 20 less director contributions in line with statutory reporting requirements.
10 Directors have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration other than as disclosed in the table.
Rationale for 2017 single total figure As indicated on page 83 and shown in specific detail in the following sections, the financial and operational performance of the business has been strong in the context of the overall market conditions.
As a result of this and the increases agreed to maximum AIP levels in 2016, the year-on-year increases in the above table are significant.
This corporate performance is also reflected in the pay outcomes for wider employees with the average annual incentive paid increasing by around 11% compared to last year.
In this context, the Committee is satisfied that the total single figure outcomes are appropriate and not excessive.
Salary The salaries shown in the table reflect a 2016 17 salary, effective from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017, of 844,104 for the Chief Executive and 652,424 for the Finance Director.
This represented an increase of 2.4% from the previous year, which was in line with the average performance-based salary increase for the wider SSE employee population.
Benefits Benefits are provided at an appropriate level taking into account market practice at similar sized companies and the level of benefits provided for other employees in the Company.
Core benefits include car allowance, private medical insurance and health screening.
The Executive Directors participate in the Companys all-employee share schemes on the same terms as other employees.
Pension The Executive Directors are members of either the Southern Electric Pension Scheme or the Scottish Hydro-Electric Pension Scheme and their plan membership predates their Board appointments.
These are both funded final salary pension schemes and the terms of these schemes apply equally to all members.
The Directors service contracts provide for a possible maximum pension of two thirds final salary from the age of 60.
In relation to Executive Directors who are subject to the scheme-specific salary cap which mirrors the provisions of the previous HMRC cap arrangements the Company provides top-up unfunded arrangements which are designed to provide an equivalent pension on retirement from the age of 60 to that which they would have earned had they not been subject to the salary cap.
From 1 April 2017 pensionable earnings will be capped at RPI 1%.
These are legacy arrangements and would not be used for any new external appointments.
The Executive Directors, in common with all other employees who joined at the same time, have the following pension provisions relating to leaving the Company: for retirement through ill-health an unreduced pension based on service to expected retirement is paid: in the event of any reorganisation or redundancy an unreduced accrued pension is paid to a member who is aged 50 or above, with at least five years service or, for a member who has not yet reached that age, it will be payable with effect from 50: and from the age of 55, a scheme member is entitled to leave the Company and receive a pension, reduced for early payment, unless the Company gives consent and funds this pension on an unreduced basis.
Dependent on the circumstances surrounding the departure of the Executive Director and financial health of the Company at the time, the Committees policy is to give consideration to a cash commutation of the unfunded unapproved retirement benefit UURB pension at the time of leaving.
Any cash commutation will limit SSEs liability, taking into account valuations provided by independent actuarial advisors, and will be calculated on what was judged to be a cost neutral basis to SSE.

The table below provides more information on the measures and the performance that was ultimately delivered.
Financial 50% Weighting Threshold Target Maximum Actual outcome % Out-turn Total Adjusted PBT 30% 1,449m 1,526m 1,604 1,546m 62% 19% DPS Growth 10% rpi rpi rpi 2% rpi 50% 5% Cashflow Retained cashflow net debt 10% 13% 13.5% 14% 15.7% 100% 10% 34% Adjusted Total to 30% The financial performance targets were set at the start of the financial year taking into account internal financial plans, external consensus where it exists and the expected impact of identified opportunities and threats to the business in the context of wider economic conditions.
The performance target range is set on a realistic basis but requiring true outperformance for Executive Directors to achieve the maximum.
The Remuneration Committee has a history of setting challenging targets, evidenced by the average AIP payout over the previous five years of 41% with a maximum achieved of 64%.
While the committee measured overall financial performance at 34% it decided to exercise its discretion to make a downward adjustment to 30% taking into account factors influencing some of the exceptional charges during 2016 17.
Non-financial 50% When setting non-financial targets, the Committee ensures they are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely SMART objectives.
By their nature, some objectives require a more subjective assessment than others and this is completed by the Committee following the input from the wider Board and other Board Committees as appropriate.
The Committee is committed to providing as much retrospective detail of the measures as possible, setting out clearly the decision making process and the levels of attainment achieved, but mindful that we cannot disclose any information which could be considered commercially sensitive.
Customer 15% Performance is assessed using a selection of internal and external surveys including the Citizens Advice Bureaus Energy Supplier Complaints league table, the Institute of Customer Service, the National Customer Satisfaction Index UK, Ofgem Customer Satisfaction measure and other trusted third party customer satisfaction surveys.
For Network customer performance the Committee considers the wide range of Ofgem metrics that are used to determine incentives and penalties for that part of the business.
The Committee takes a broad view of performance against each measure before approving the overall performance outcome.
Retail customer service performance A strong year for customer service in Retail.
SSE was the leading large energy supplier as measured in the quarterly Citizens Advice Energy Supplier Performance Report 88% throughout 2016 17.
A new company record score was achieved twice during the year.
SSE continues to have the lowest Ombudsman complaints in the industry with fewer than five complaints accepted per 100,000 customers in every quarter of 2016 17 compared with an average of between 19 and 23 for the industry as a whole.
Networks customer service performance Customer interruption performance in Distribution, measured through an Ofgem scheme, delivered incentive earnings of almost 13.9m and performance against 80% Ofgems customer service satisfaction measure saw the incentive award increasing significantly to almost 2.8m, reflecting measures to improve customer contact and engagement.
Customer complaints performance has also improved, with 78% of all complaints resolved during 2016 17 within 24 hours an increase from 65%.
Total 84% 13% 87 Directors Report Corporate governance Remuneration continued Teamworking 20% This section is based upon an assessment of the SSESET of values.
The Committee assesses each one individually before reaching an overall conclusion on the performance outturn.
Safety Performance was overshadowed by the tragic death of a contractor colleague on an SSE 65% construction site.
The number of SSE employees injured in the 12 month period reduced from 57 to 47 and there was a slight improvement in the 12 month rolling combined Total Recordable Injury Rate 0.22 and a slight decrease in Accident Frequency Rate to 0.11.
There was a concerted focus in the year on further developing SSEs safety culture, managing process safety risks, ensuring appropriate authorisation processes and improving employee wellbeing.
Taking everything into account, however, overall performance was adjusted down.
Service Strong performance with Retail retaining a leading position in the Citizens Advice Energy Supplier 85% Performance Report: and with Networks securing incentive earnings relating to customer interruption performance, customer contact and engagement Distribution and strong performance in a survey of stakeholder satisfaction Transmission.
Efficiency excellent progress in bearing down on controllable costs, including sustainable savings of 90% 50m realised against an original target of 30m and detailed plans in place to deliver further controllable savings in 2017 18.
In 2016, SSE announced the disposal of a partial stake of SGN, with the price secured confirming SSEs ability to deliver value for shareholders.
Strong performance in refinancing with debt replaced at lower like for like costs.
Sustainability Strong progress was made in this area.
Achieved an Arating in the annual CDP formerly 85% Carbon Disclosure Project assessment.
Enhanced tax disclosure was delivered through the Talking tax 2016 report and retention of Fair Tax Mark accreditation.
Achieved British Standard for inclusive service provision for its Networks business and committed to securing the Standard for its Retail business.
A new partnership was developed with the Institute of Business Ethics in support of implementing a revised and robust code of ethical business practice.
Excellence Significant progress made with a number of key capital projects progressing well, including 85% the completion of the Beauly-Denny transmission line.
Strong progress was also made in delivering renewable energy projects in Scotland and Ireland.
Excellence in large capital project delivery was also recognised with SSE winning the Excellence in Sustainability in Irish Construction Awards 2016.
Early disclosure on gender pay contributed to SSE securing the Building Public Trust in Corporate Reporting Award for people reporting in the FTSE 100.
Teamworking Good progress with the review of the Executive-level governance framework to ensure 79% decisions are made at the right level, and good progress with the review of organisational design to improve the effectiveness of organisational structures in SSEs businesses.
Detailed structural changes made with people and business impact well managed.
Continued focus in support of the inclusion and diversity agenda with each business developing specific action plans.
Total 82% 16% Personal 15% Personal performance measures are intended to focus executive directors on the key operational and strategic objectives which support the longer-term performance of the business.
Some objectives are consistent across all members of the senior management team, but others are personal to the individual reflecting the key responsibilities of their role.
Some goals have quantifiable targets, but others require a more subjective assessment.
The Committee considers performance against each measure before determining an aggregate outcome for this element of the AIP.
Alistair Phillips-Davies Delivered a very strong business performance against a challenging backdrop.
86% A clear focus on simplifying the SSE group and delivering strong controllable cost savings through increased efficiency and review of organisational design.

Both the cash and deferred element remain subject to clawback provisions.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the range of measures used in the AIP ensures that performance is assessed using a balanced approach, without undue focus on a single metric which could be achieved at the expense of wider initiatives.
Given the performance noted above and wider operational achievements noted in the Strategic Report on page 16 the Committee is comfortable that the AIP outcomes represent a fair reward for performance delivered.
PSP awards vesting in the year 2014-2017 PSP awards granted during the 2014 15 financial year, have three-year performance periods which ended on 31 March 2017.
Performance was assessed against the targets as set out in the table below: % % Performance condition Measure Weight Threshold Maximum Outcome Performance Outturn Relative TSR v FTSE 100 20% Median Upper Quartile 47th out of 94 26.6% 5.3% v MSCI 20% Median Upper Quartile 10th out of 23 51.1% 10.2% Financial Share-Based EPS 20% Rpi Rpi 10% rpi 0 0 DPS 20% Rpi Rpi 4% rpi 50% 10% Customer Consumer Futures ranking 20% Rank 2 Rank 1 1st 100% 20% Total 45.5% The performance outcomes noted above are in line with the strong financial, customer, share price and dividend performance over the three year performance period.
The Committee is satisfied that the level of vesting is fair reward for the performance delivered.

Ratio of Chief Executives earnings to employees earnings Average Chief Executive employee 1 2 earnings earnings Pay ratio 2016 17 2,925,000 40,723 72:1 2015 16 1,696,000 39,990 42:1 Notes: 1 The Chief Executives earnings are calculated on the same basis as the single figure of remuneration table shown on page 86.
2 Average employee earnings are based on staffing costs calculated on the same basis as Note 8.1 of the accounts, excluding social security costs.
The movement in the pay ratio is explained largely by the increase in Chief Executives earnings in 2017 as a result of improved performance through AIP and PSP and the 2016 increase to the maximum AIP level by 50%.
While all employees who benefit from the AIP and PSP and perform well have also seen an increased level of payout in 2017 they represent less than 10% of the overall workforce and therefore have less impact on the ratio above.
The average 2016 17 employee salary increase was 2.4%.

93 Directors Report Corporate governance Remuneration continued External appointments audited Executive Directors are able to accept a non-Executive appointment outside the Company with the consent of the Board, as such appointments can enhance Directors experience and value to the Company.
Any fees received are retained by the Director.
Gregor Alexander is a non-Executive Director with Stagecoach Group plc during 2016 and received 59,700 in fees.
Gregor Alexander is also Chairman of Scotia Gas Networks and receives no additional fees for this.
Payments for loss of office and payments to past Directors There were no payments for loss of office or to former Directors during the year.
Governance The Remuneration Committee The members of the Committee and the meetings attended is set out on page 80.
The terms of reference for the Committee are available on the Companys website http: sse.
In summary, the Committee determines and agrees with the Board, the Companys framework and policy for executive remuneration including setting remuneration for all Executive Directors, the Company Chairman and Company Secretary.
The Committee also monitors the level and structure of remuneration across the senior management team.
During the year the Committee met 3 times where it considered the following: Meeting Date Agenda Items May 2016 AGM season overview, AIP and PSP performance discussions, below-board remuneration, 2015 16 DRR, clawback and malus review, remuneration advisors annual performance review, draft agenda items for 2016 17.

March 2017 AIP and PSP performance update, 2016 17 draft DRR, chairman fee and Executive Director base salary reviews, below-board pay, 2017 18 planning.
Advice to the Committee The Chief Executive, the Director of Human Resources and Head of Reward advised the Committee on certain remuneration matters for the Executive Directors and senior executives although they were not present for any discussions on their own remuneration.
The Director of Human Resources and Head of Reward advised on HR strategy and the application of HR policies across the wider organisation.
During the year the Committee undertook a comprehensive retendering process for external advisors.
As a result, FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP FIT were appointed as the Committees independent advisors in November 2016.
Until FITs appointment Deloitte LLP acted as the Committees advisors.
Both advisors have provided a range of information to the Committee which included market data drawn from published surveys, governance developments and their application to the Company, advice on remuneration disclosures and regulations and comparator group pay.
FIT and Deloitte received fees of 33,578 and 35,520 respectively in relation to their work for the Committee, calculated on a time and materials basis.
Both FIT and Deloitte are founding members of, and adhere to, the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct.
The Code defines the roles of consultants, including the requirement to have due regard to the organisations strategy, financial situation, pay philosophy, the Boards statutory duties and the views of investors and other stakeholders.
The Committee reviews the advisers performance annually to determine that it is satisfied with the quality, relevance, objectivity and independence of advice being provided.
FIT provides no other services to the Company.
Morgan Stanley and Co International Plc provided analysis on comparator performance, but did not receive fees specifically for these services as they are retained as SSEs brokers.
Freshfields LLP also provided advice on legal matters, such as share plan rules, during the year.
Evaluation The external Board evaluation process which was carried out during the year confirmed the Remuneration Committee continued to operate effectively.
Details of the evaluation process are set out on pages 64 and 65.
Shareholding voting in 2016 On 21 July 2016, shareholders approved the Remuneration Policy and the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2016.
Below are the results of the resolutions.

Benefits No changes proposed Pension No changes proposed Annual Incentive Adjusted EPS 30% The AIP targets are considered to be commercially sensitive at this Plan Cashflow 10% time and therefore will only be disclosed retrospectively in next DPS 10% years report.
Personal 15% Adjusted EPS growth will replace Adjusted PBT because as a Teamwork 20% measure it is more closely aligned to our commitment to Customer 15% dividendgrowth.
PSP No changes proposed: It is recognised that sustained DPS growth at RPI would be good TSR v FTSE100 20% performance in the context of SSEs business environment and is TSR v MSCI Europe 20% considered to be a stretching level of performance rather than a EPS 20% threshold level of performance.
As with previous years, the entry DPS 20% or threshold level vesting for the DPS element has therefore been Customer 20% set at 50% for achieving this stretch.
In assessing performance against DPS the Committee must be satisfied that a reasonable level of dividend cover has been maintained.
The customer service measure is based on an independent external customer measure Citizens Advice League Table and the measure compares SSEs performance with the other energy suppliers.
Chairmans and non-Executive Directors fees As at 1 April 2017 Chairman 377,500 Base fee 68,000 Additional Senior Independent Director fee 17,000 Additional fee for being Remuneration Committee Chairman 17,000 Additional fee for being Audit Committee Chairman 17,000 Additional fee for being SHEAC Chairman 12,000 The policy for fees mirrors that for Executive Directors where we aim to pay appropriately based on time commitments and scope of responsibilities, but generally at a level that is below the market median.
95 Directors Report Corporate governance Remuneration continued The Chairmans fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The fees for non-Executive Directors are a matter for the Chairman and Executive Directors.
Care is taken to ensure no director is present when their own remuneration is discussed.
As highlighted as an action in last years report, time was taken during the 2016 17 year to review the Chairmans and non-Executive Directors fee levels.
The Committee and Board as a whole, are aware that fee increases in recent years have not kept pace with the increasing time demands required for each role.
The increased time commitments reflect the ever growing level of regulation and compliance.
The review further highlighted that the fee levels were considerably lower than those of other companies of a similar size and complexity.
A decision was therefore taken to increase fee levels effective from 1 January 2017.
The new levels remain considerably below the market median but are felt to be appropriately positioned in line with our stated policy.
