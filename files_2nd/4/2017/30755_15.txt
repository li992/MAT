3 Mr Mortstedt provided specific advice that was in addition to the duties under his contract of employment, which are his participation at CLS Holdings plc Board meetings.
The Committee has agreed the fees and is of the opinion that the market rate for the specific nature of the advice he provided was appropriate based on his experience and historical knowledge of the Group.
The specific advice related to the sale of Vauxhall Square: the Bond portfolio, investments and cash management: refinancing and borrowing: and specific property acquisitions and disposals.
4 The Bonus total comprises 50% of the Element A 2017 contribution into the Directors Plan Account and the award made of deferred shares in respect of Element B of the PIP see below for details of calculations.
The reason that only 50% of Element A is disclosed as Bonus is because the balance is deferred and at risk of forfeiture in respect of future years performance and therefore under the Regulations is required to be disclosed on vesting.
The award of deferred shares under Element B does not vest until three years after the date of grant and cannot be sold for a further 2 years.
However, in accordance with the Regulations the value of these shares is shown in the Bonus column on the date of grant as there are no further performance conditions which have to be satisfied for the shares to vest.
The value of the Element B award disclosed inthe table has been calculated using the average market value of a share for the 30 day period to 31 December 2017 of 233.6 pence in accordance with the rules of the PIP.
5 The LTIP column value is the difference between the values calculated in 4 above in respect of the PIP Element A and the 2017 payment see page 69 for details of calculation and is the payment of part of the deferred performance-based element under the PIP.
The date of payment will be on or around 26 March 2018.
The value of thenotional shares under Element A has been based on the average market value of a share for the 30 day period to 31 December 2017 of 233.6 pence in accordance with the rules of the PIP.
6 Taxable Benefits relate to the provision of private medical insurance.
7 In 2016, fees of 450,000 were disclosed as due to the consultancy company associated with Mr Mortstedt in respect of specific advice which was in addition to the duties under his contract of employment.
Following confirmation from the consultancy company that it had waived the 2016 fees in full, the 450,000 has been deleted from this comparative table.
