Policy Implementation in 2018 Remuneration policy for executive directors The existing remuneration scheme for the executive directors was developed with the support of external consultants and was implemented on 17 June 2015 covering the period of 2015 until the end of 2018.
The Group worked with EY to review the existing remuneration policy for executive directors.
The existing remuneration policy will expire at the end of 2018.
The Group has developed a new remuneration policy, which is presented in this document and if approved by shareholders on 2018 AGM, will become applicable starting from 1 January 2019.
Non-executive director compensation As advised by the external consultants and approved by the shareholders on 2017 AGM, the compensation of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman will be decreased by about 20% and 30% respectively starting from 1 January 2018.
Their new fees reflect the complexity of tasks and high intensity of the work carried out by the Chairman and Deputy Chairman to support the growth of the business, taking into account their deep understanding of the market and their roles as the founders of the bank.
The Chairmans and deputy Chairmans input add significant value and are key and instrumental for the other members of the Board of Directors and for the Executive Committee members, especially on all strategic matters and relationship with large corporate or individual customers as well as with policy makers.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to seek out shareholder feedback and undertake a benchmarking review of compensation practices when the current policy expires.
Introduction of the Policy for Companies Act 2006 purposes Due to requirements associated with the Group's premium listing and to comply with Companies Act 2006 requirements, shareholders will be asked to specifically approve the Policy at the upcoming 2018 Annual General Meeting with the new Policy coming into effect for Companies Act 2006 purposes from 1 January 2019.
Statement of implementation In 2018, the Remuneration Committee intends to continue to provide remuneration in accordance with the policy tables set forth below as approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
Fees and salaries may be adjusted but in all cases will not exceed the maximums stated in the appropriate policy table as approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
New targets will be set for the deferred share bonuses.
The appropriate level of awards to be granted in 2018 is assessed by the Remuneration Committee but in all cases will remain within the maximums stated in the appropriate policy table as approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017 135 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED From January 2018 the following will apply: Executive directors Base salary cash and deferred shares The cash and deferred share salaries are set out in the executive directors' service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to agree changes to the base salary with the executive directors but no change will exceed the maximum stated in the policy approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.

Directors Remuneration Policy This section describes the proposed new remuneration policy for executive directors, which is expected to come into force starting from 1 January 2019 and is intended apply for 3 years until the end of 2021, subject to shareholders approval at the AGM meeting to be held on 21st May 2018.
The new policy aims to enhance our existing remuneration structure and ensure that it is more closely aligned with all stakeholders expectations, as well as to offer competitive compensation to the executive directors.
Total expected compensation will not exceed 2017 levels.
The following table compares the executives maximum and actual compensation paid in 2017 to their maximum and expected compensation under the new remuneration policy in 2019 respectively.
The 2017 maximum opportunity has been valued using the closing market value of the shares on 9 March 2018 GBP18.4 converted into US$ using the cross rate of the official exchange rates published by the NBG of 2.4462 for GEL US$ and 3.397 for GEL GBP on the same date and grossed up for directors income tax on share awards paid by the Company.
The key changes are: Introducing a long-term incentive plan LTIP in the form of a performance share plan with a 3 year vesting period subject to meeting performance conditions over this period.
Awards are initially intended to be in the form of conditional share awards, which are conditional rights to receive shares in the Company, but the plan also permits the grant of options and restricted share awards.
The performance will be measured over three years and shares will be delivered during the first quarter of the fourth year from the start of the performance period, subject to the achievement of appropriate performance measures.
However after delivery, the shares will be subject to an additional two year holding period during which time they will be subject to continued employment.
The maximum amounts of the LTIP are as follows: CEO-US$ 1,554,240, CFOUS$ 777,120 The amount of deferred shares under the base salary and the annual bonus will be calculated by reference to a cash amount rather than a fixed number of shares.
The shares granted will be subject to continued employment for a 2 year period as follows: 50% of the award for 1 year from the award date and the other 50% for 2 years from the award date.
The maximum amount of deferred share salary and the annual bonus will be also fixed by reference to a cash amount rather than number of shares.
The maximum amounts of the deferred share salary are as follows: CEOUS$ 510,000, CFOUS$ 255,000.
The maximum amount of annual bonuses are determined as follows: CEOUS$ 1,301,760, CFOUS$ 650,880.
The maximum amounts of annual cash salaries to be paid to CEO and CFO are determined to be US$ 453,994 and US$ 227,004 respectively.
It is the Remuneration Committees intention that the Policy remains unchanged for three years until the end of 2021.
For the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that the new remuneration scheme to be approved at the 2018 AGM allows the existing remuneration scheme for the executive directors to continue until 1 January 2019 with the new remuneration scheme to take effect from 1 January 2019.

Directors Remuneration Policy continued Pre-existing obligations It is a provision of this Policy that the Group will uphold all pre-existing obligations and commitments that were agreed prior to this Policy taking effect.
The terms of those pre-existing obligations and commitments may differ from the terms of the Policy and may include without limitation obligations and commitments under service contracts, deferred share compensation schemes and pension and benefit plans.

TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017 141 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 10.
Directors Remuneration Policy continued 10.2 Individual arrangements There are no individual arrangements other than those disclosed in this report.
10.3 Performance measures and targets a Salary deferred shares Paying part of the executive director's salary in shares is an important element of remuneration as it helps to align each individual's efforts with the Groups performance.
As the executive directors' shareholding will increase each year, we believe this is an effective tool to incentivise executive directors to think about long-term performance.
There are no performance measures or conditions associated with salary the salary is fixed at the outset in the executive directors' service contracts.
The Policy naturally results in our executive Directors holding a significant number of unvested shares and achieves a delay between performance and vesting which we believe is consistent with the principles of the Corporate Governance Code.
b Annual Share Bonus Annual deferred share bonuses are awarded to reward past performance over the year.
At the end of the performance year, the shares will be delivered to the extent that annual KPIs have been met as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Once shares are delivered, the shares will be subject to a 2 year post performance vesting period with 50% vesting each year subject to continued employment.
The Remuneration Committees goal for each KPI is to establish a level of performance that is not certain to be attained, so that achieving or exceeding the targets requires diligent efforts by our executive directors.
Remuneration committee intention is to retain the current KPIs for the Annual Share Bonus, which consist of corporate, financial such as ROE, cost to income ratio, CoR and non-financial KPIs share price performance, employments and customer satisfaction levels and individual KPIs such as leadership and or performance of specific function and which reflect the executive directors' required contribution to the Group's overall key strategic and financial objectives for that financial year.
However, given the fact that the first year under assessment for the Annual Share Bonus is 2019, the respective KPIs will be set at the start of the each performance period: 2019, 2020 and 2021.
The nature but not necessarily the weightings of the KPIs will be disclosed in the annual report published in the performance year.
However, specific targets for each KPI will be disclosed only retrospectively given the sensitivity of the measure to the Groups business.
Each KPI will have a threshold, target and maximum level and conditions to meet these levels.
Targets for each corporate KPI will be determined by the Remuneration Committee and will be approved by the Board.
Individual KPIs will be approved by the Remuneration Committee based on the recommendations of the CEO.
c LTIP The Awards, will be granted subject to performance conditions over a 3 year period.
After three years, the shares will be delivered to the extent the performance conditions have been met as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Once shares are delivered, the shares will be subject to a 2 year post performance holding period subject to continued employment.
This approach will be used for 3 years starting from 2019.
Thus, 2019-2021 performance will be measured in 2022, 2020-2022 performance will be measured in 2023 and 2021-2023 performance will be measured in 2024.
Given the fact that the first performance period under the LTIP will start only in 2019, the exact performance conditions will be defined closer to this date.
The Remuneration Committees goal for each performance condition is to establish a level of performance that is not certain to be attained, so that achieving or exceeding the targets requires diligent efforts by our executive directors.
Remuneration Committees current view is that performance condition will include a measure of efficiency e. g. ROE, a measure of share price performance e. g. absolute EPS TSR and a measure of long term differentiator such as customer experience.
However, in the case of relative KPIs, the Remuneration Committee retains the right to apply downward adjustment considering factors such as absolute share price TSR in determining the final payouts.
Any measure selected, will be closely aligned with the group strategy.
The performance conditions for each three year performance period will be set at the start of the each performance period: 2019, 2020 and 2021.
The performance conditions and respective targets will be disclosed in the annual report published in the year of the award.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to amend the agreed performance conditions in exceptional circumstances if, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the original performance conditions are no longer appropriate.
142 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Overview Strategy & Performance Each performance condition will have a threshold, target and maximum level and conditions to meet these levels.
Targets for each corporate performance condition are determined by the Remuneration Committee and are approved by the Board.
d Shareholder guidelines Executive directors should naturally build up a significant holding of shares in the Company.
In order to encourage this and set a standard position, the Company is introducing a minimum shareholding requirement of 200% base salary.
There is no set time during which this requirement must be met, but until it is met, executive directors are expected to hold shares net of tax acquired under this policy.
Shares counted for this purpose include deferred shares paid in relation to salary and annual bonus and any vested awards from the LTIP.
Unvested awards from the LTIP will not be counted.
Consideration of shareholder views The current policy takes into account shareholder feedback regarding the remuneration of the Board.
Shareholder input has been key to designing the remuneration policy as described above.
We have established a practice to meet with the shareholders on this matter and request their feedback, which will continue in the future.
The Remuneration Committee remains mindful of shareholder views when evaluating and setting ongoing remuneration strategy.
Remuneration throughout the Group Remuneration of other top management members of JSC TBC Bank is similar to that of the executive members of the Company.
Other senior and middle management across the Group as well as some other key employees receive their entire salary in cash and are also eligible to cash and share bonus compensation.
All other employees within the Group receive cash salaries and may be eligible to receive cash bonuses.
Executive director and employee pay is studied and determined through the use of appropriate market data usually with input from a compensation consultant.
All employees receive a competitive benefit package in line with Georgian market practice and are entitled to participate in the pension scheme on a voluntary basis.
Policy table: non-executive directors In the same way as the executives, the non-executive directors receive their compensation both from the Company and the main subsidiary, JSC TBC Bank, proportionate to the time spent working on the respective entity's Boards and committees.
Starting from 1 January 2018 until the end of 2021, the compensation for the non-executive directors is as follows: TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017 143 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 13.

range between US$27,206 - US$28,125 The ranges depend on tax residency status where the Company aims to ensure that the net compensation per each of the items above paid to the non-executive directors are thesame.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to structure the non-executive directors fees differently in its absolute discretion.
Fees are generally paid monthly in cash.
However, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to pay the fees on a different basis.
Fees are periodically reviewed and adjusted by the Remuneration Committee, having regard to external comparators such as the Group's peer group, the chair or committee roles and responsibilities and other market factors.
Expenses To compensate non-executive The Group may reimburse non-executive directors for The policy is framed by the nature directors for expenses their expenses incurred in connection with the of the expenses that the incurred in connection with performance of their duties including attending Board Remuneration Committee is willing the performance of their and committee meetings such as, for example, travel, to provide to non-executive non-executive director duties accommodation, other subsistence expenses and directors.

144 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Overview Strategy & Performance 13.1 Non-executive directors Since non-executive directors are not employees, they do not receive compensation or benefits reserved only for employees such as company paid subsidised insurance or paid holiday.
The non-executive directors are not eligible for performance-based share awards.
They do not currently receive pension or other equivalent benefits except for the chairman and deputy chairman who are compensated for and provided with car service expenses.
Awards with performance conditions are not part of the non-executive remuneration package as we do not wish the non-executive directors to be driven by short-term Group performance so as to maintain their independence as advisors to the Group.
The non-executive directors are entitled to broad indemnification by the Group pursuant to a deed of indemnity entered into with each director and are covered by the Groups Directors & Officers Liability Insurance Policy.
Illustration of application of the Remuneration Policy The following graphs illustrate the levels of remuneration that each executive director could earn in 2019 under the new Policy.
Directors compensation consists of cash salary, deferred share salary, annual bonus and LTIP.
Cash salary and deferred share salary are the same in each performance scenario.
No pension contributions have been included in the performance scenarios as we assume no pension contributions will be paid.
"The ""below bonus threshold"" chart reflects a scenario where KPI achievement falls below 60% and so no bonuses would be awarded."
If KPIs are fulfilled at minimum, on target or maximum ranges the evaluation and subsequent bonus award will be 60%, 100% and 135-137% respectively.
Recruitment policy The Remuneration Committee intends that the components of remuneration set out in the above policy tables, and the approach to those components as set out in the policy tables, will subject to the remainder of this recruitment policy be equally applicable to the annual package provided to new recruits, i. e. for executive directors, salary with cash and share components, discretionary deferred share bonuses, pension and employee benefits: for non-executive directors, fees and relevant expenses.
For an internal appointment of an executive or non-executive director, any pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment, as appropriate.
In the year of promotion for an internal appointment, additional awards pro-rated for the time served in the new role may be made to the individual within the maximums set out in the policy tables above.
Where necessary, the Remuneration Committee can make a recruitment-related award to an external candidate.
However, the Group will not pay more than the Remuneration Committee considers necessary and will endeavour to deliver any such awards in line with the existing Group policies.
The Remuneration Committee has a preference not to provide a buy out arrangement and or to establish additional or particular arrangements specifically to facilitate the recruitment of the individual.
