Board changes and changes to the Committee The Committee considered a number of possible alternatives, As set out earlier in the report, in November 2017 the Board ranging from retaining the current approach, which is very announced the appointment, with effect from January 2018, much in line with UK plc market practice, to moving to a of Kerrigan Procter as CEO of Legal & General Capital, which restricted stock style plan or the potential use of a single will enable the group to further enhance the synergies across incentive plan.

The following sections sets out relevant extracts of our directors remuneration policy the policy which was approved by shareholders by way of a binding vote at the 2017 AGM on 25 May 2017.
As set out in the Chairmans letter on page 78, although no changes have been made to the policy.
There are some changes in relation to the how the policy will be implemented going forward.
For ease of reference, we have highlighted these areas within the policy.
Remuneration 2017 policy element Base Salary Purpose and link To help recruit and retain executive directors of the calibre required to develop, lead and deliver the business strategy.
to strategy Operation The Committee sets base salary taking into consideration: the individuals skills, experience and performance: the scope of the role: pay and conditions elsewhere in the group: overall business performance: and external market benchmark data in other FTSE 100 companies and other relevant bespoke groupings of financial and non-financial institutions.
Base salaries are normally reviewed annually, with increases effective 1 March.
Opportunity Whilst there is no maximum base salary, any increases for executive directors will normally be in line with the range of increases for other UK employees in the wider group.
In specific circumstances, the Committee may award increases above this level, for example: where the Committee has set the base salary for a newly appointed executive director with a view to allow the individual to progress into the role over time: or where, in the Committees opinion, there has been a significant increase in the size or scope of an executive directors role or responsibilities: or where there is a significant change in the regulatory environment.
Performance Personal performance will be taken into consideration in determining any salary increase.
Proposed changes for 2018: Base salary No change in approach LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 83 GOVERNANCE Remuneration 2017 policy element Benefits Purpose and link Benefits are provided to executive directors to attract and retain the best talent for the business and to ensure that the total to strategy package is competitive in the market.
Operation The Committees policy is to provide executive directors with a market competitive level of benefits, taking into consideration benefits offered to other senior employees in the UK, the individuals circumstances and market practice at similar companies.
Benefits provided to executive directors are normally in line with benefits provided to other senior employees in the UK.
Benefits currently provided to executive directors include: car allowance, private medical insurance, life assurance, Group Income Protection, and insured death in service arrangements.
These are all in line with our general policy for other UK employees.
In line with other Legal & General employees, executive directors can choose to acquire Legal & General products, and are eligible to participate in the companys voluntary benefits which they fund themselves, sometimes through salary sacrifice.
They are eligible to participate in the UK all-employee share plans on the same terms as other employees.
The two current all-employee share plans are: the savings-related share option scheme SAYE the all-employee share incentive plan Where an executive new or current is required to relocate, or perform duties outside their home country in order to fulfil their duties, in line with our mobility policy and practice, additional benefits may be provided, for example: home country benefits such as healthcare and additional support in relocating such as assistance for housing, school fees, travel home, relocation costs and tax advice.
Opportunity In line with other UK employees, there is no maximum level for the benefits as this is dependent on the individuals circumstances and the cost to the company.
The maximum opportunity for participation in the current all-employee share plans is in line with other employees and takes into account the prevailing HMRC rules.
Relocation international assignment benefits the level of such benefits would be set taking into account the circumstances of the individual and typical market practice.
Performance There are no performance conditions.
Proposed changes for 2018: Benefits Benefits No change in approach.
The approach to benefit provision for executive directors is the same as that operated for senior managers in the rest of the UK organisation.
84 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 GOVERNANCE Remuneration 2017 policy element Pension Purpose and link The policy aims to provide competitive post-retirement benefits and therefore recognise sustained contribution.
to strategy Operation Pension contributions are set at an appropriate level to attract and retain high performing people.
In line with other employees in the UK, executive directors currently participate in either a defined contribution pension plan, a defined benefit pension plan or receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension, or have some combination thereof.
The defined benefit pension plan was closed to new joiners in 2001.
From 2009, increases in pensionable salary for the defined benefit pension plan for remaining active members have been limited to a maximum of 2.5% each year and in 2015 the scheme was closed to future accruals.
For executive directors who took enhanced protection in 2006, a cash allowance was provided in lieu which may be reviewed or amended by the employer.
Non-UK national executives may be permitted to participate in home-country pension plans where relevant.
Base salary is the only element of pensionable remuneration.
At the discretion of the Committee, executive directors may elect to sacrifice all or part of their cash AVP into pension.
Opportunity New executive directors receive 15% of base salary into the defined contribution pension plan they contribute 5%.
This contribution level for executive directors is the same as that operated for senior managers in the rest of the UK organisation in the defined contribution pension plan.
As for other employees, there is a cash alternative.
Mark Zinkula may also contribute part of any cash allowance into a US 401k pension plan.
Mark is also a member of a cash balance plan in the US.
Proposed changes for 2018: Pensions Pensions No change in approach.
The contribution level for executive directors is the same as that operated for senior managers in the rest of the UK organisation.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 85 GOVERNANCE Remuneration 2017 policy element Annual variable pay AVP Purpose and link Incentivise executive directors to achieve specific group and or divisional, financial, strategic and personal predetermined to strategy goals, within the groups risk appetite and taking into consideration the companys culture and values, on an annual basis.
The deferred proportion of AVP into shares reinforces retention and enhances alignment with shareholders by encouraging a longer-term focus and risk alignment.
Operation Performance targets and weightings are set annually by the Committee to ensure they are appropriately stretching.
Performance is normally assessed over a one-year period.
AVP out-turns are determined by the Committee after the year end, taking into consideration performance against targets, the underlying performance of the business and individual performance.
The Committee may exceptionally adjust the outcome of the AVP calculation if it believes there are underlying circumstances that justify such a change.
Normally, 50% of any AVP awarded is deferred.
Deferred awards are normally awarded in the form of restricted shares or nil-cost options or phantom equivalent if appropriate.
However, awards may be deferred in other forms dependent upon business or regulatory requirements.
Deferred awards will vest after a period set by the Committee.
This period will normally be three years.
Dividends on deferred awards made in the form of shares accrue during the deferral period and normally are paid in the form of shares to the executive directors upon vesting.
Dividend equivalents may accrue on awards made in other forms.
Deferred awards are subject to malus.
Clawback provisions also apply to both deferred awards and cash awards paid.
The Committee may adjust and amend the awards in accordance with the rules.
Opportunity The maximum award opportunity in respect of any financial year is based on role as follows: For the Group Chief Executive and CFO the maximum potential is 150% of base salary.
For the CEO LGIM and the CEO LGC the maximum potential is 175% of base salary.
The award opportunity at threshold performance is 0% of minimum, with up to 50% of maximum bonus payable for target performance for the Group Chief Executive, CFO and CEO LGC.
Up to 60% of maximum bonus is payable for target performance for the CEO LGIM.
Performance Performance measures are selected by the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis to ensure that they are aligned with the groups strategic priorities and the delivery of sustainable shareholder value.
Performance is measured based on an appropriate mix of group and or divisional financial performance targets as well as strategic including customer and employee measures and personal measures.
Performance measures are weighted with normally up to 70% based on financial targets.
The split between financial, strategic and personal performance measures and the relative weighting of group and divisional performance targets will be kept under review by the Committee on an annual basis.
Proposed changes for 2018: AVP No change in approach.
86 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 GOVERNANCE Remuneration 2017 policy element Performance Share Plan PSP Purpose and link Awards under the PSP are reflective of the Committees desire that the remuneration of executives should be weighted to strategy towards the delivery of sustainable returns to shareholders over the longer term.
In addition to deferred awards under the AVP, awards under the PSP enhance alignment with shareholders by focusing executives on the longer-term performance of the business.
Operation Award of shares or options which are subject to a performance period of normally no less than three years.
Performance is normally measured after the end of the three-year performance period.
Subject to performance, awards are normally released in three equal tranches following the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date.
The Committee retains discretion to lengthen the performance period and holding period for future awards.
The Remuneration Committee may also amend the final level of vesting dependent on the underlying performance of the group.
The Committee may only exercise such discretion downwards and may not increase the level of vesting.
The parameters which the Committee uses in making this assessment will include, but are not limited to, market share, partnerships entered into and maintained, cost constraint, shareholder perception, capital management and a range of risk measures to ensure that the company has operated within appropriate risk thresholds.
Financial performance targets are set annually by the Committee to ensure they are relevant and sufficiently stretching.
PSP awards are normally awarded in the form of nil cost options or conditional shares or phantom equivalent where appropriate.
However, they may be awarded in other forms if the Committee considers it appropriate.
Dividends or dividend equivalents accrue in the period following the end of the performance period until vesting and release.
These will normally be paid in shares on a reinvested basis.
PSP awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions.
The Committee may adjust and amend the awards in accordance with the PSP rules.
Opportunity The maximum award opportunity under the PSP is 300% of salary in respect of any financial year.
The Remuneration Committees current intention is that the normal award opportunity in respect of any financial year will be 250% of base salary for all executive directors.
15% of the award normally vests for threshold performance increasing to 100% of the award for maximum performance.
Performance Performance measures for the PSP are selected by the Remuneration Committee to be aligned with the groups long-term strategic priority of delivering sustainable returns to shareholders.
The Committee therefore intends to grant awards based on an appropriate mix of earnings, capital efficiency and shareholder return measures.
The split between these measures, for each grant, is set annually by the Committee and will normally be 50% based on total shareholder return and 50% on financial measures.
Proposed changes for 2018: PSP Maximum opportunity: no changes.
Time horizons: In line with shareholder expectations and evolving market practice in this area, we are proposing to extend the holding period that currently applies to awards under the PSP, such that the whole award must be held for a further two years following the date of vesting.
Performance measures: In line with shareholder feedback and our continued focus on alignment with the commercial strategy: The EPS DPS matrix will no longer be used as a performance condition.
Instead, EPS performance alone will make up 50% of the award.
After considering a number of alternatives, the Committee believes that EPS continues to be an appropriate and effective driver of the delivery of the commercial strategy.
Relative TSR performance will continue to make up the other 50% of the award.
In its review, the Committee considered the appropriateness of the current bespoke comparator group.
Overall, the Committee considered the current group to be a fair representation of the key comparators of the group as a whole.
Only the following changes are proposed: Following the merger, Standard Life Aberdeen which has been reclassified a diversified financials group will remain a constituent of the bespoke comparator group going forward in place of legacy Standard Life Given the differing nature of their operations, St Jamess Place and Old Mutual will be removed from the bespoke comparator group.
Vesting of PSP awards will be subject to an assessment of performance against Solvency II objectives.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 87 GOVERNANCE Recruitment remuneration General approach The Committee aims to attract, motivate and retain executive directors with the required expertise to develop and deliver the business strategy, while at the same time ensuring that the remuneration arrangements offered are in the best interests of both the company and its shareholders and paying no more than considered necessary to attract the right calibre of candidate to the role.
In determining the appropriate remuneration arrangements on hiring a new executive director, the Committee will take into account all relevant factors, including, but not limited to: the individuals skills and relevant experience internal relativities local market practice in the jurisdiction from which candidate was recruited logistics and support if a relocation is required appropriate market data the individuals existing remuneration package Where possible the Committee endeavours to align the remuneration arrangements of new executive directors with the remuneration outlined in the policy for other executive directors.
Any such awards will be within the maximum level of variable remuneration limit set out below.
Where an existing internal candidate is made an executive director, the Committee may continue to honour prior commitments made before joining the Board.
Maximum variable The maximum level of annual variable pay and long-term incentives which may be awarded to a new executive director will pay levels be in line with the policy table, that is 475% of base salary.
This limit excludes buyout awards.
Buyout of The Committee recognises that, as a consequence of regulatory changes around the globe in the financial services sector, any existing long-serving executives are likely to have accrued significant levels of deferred remuneration which may be lost on a remuneration transfer of employment.
Accordingly, to aid the recruitment of a new executive director, the Committee may make awards to components buyout remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, taking into consideration relevant factors or other including, but not limited to: arrangements form of the award any performance conditions attached to those awards the vesting profile of the awards and likelihood of vesting relevant regulatory requirements and guidance in place in relation to buyout awards Buyout awards will typically reflect the terms and the value of the arrangements forgone.
Where possible the Committee will use existing share-based plans to effect a buyout.
However, in the event these are not an appropriate vehicle, the Committee retains the discretion to use the Listing Rules exemption LR 9.4.
2 for the purpose of making an award to buyout remuneration terms forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Relocation Where a new executive director has to relocate to take up the appointment, either within the UK or from overseas, practical and mobility and or financial support may be given in relation to relocation or mobility in line with our internal policies.
This may include the cost of any tax that is incurred.
For appointments from overseas, home country benefits may continue to apply.
Relocation and mobility support may also apply to the recruitment of a non-executive director NED.
Shareholder The Committee believes that remuneration arrangements should be as transparent as possible.
Therefore the Committee transparency will make every effort to explain the rationale for the recruitment arrangements in the Directors remuneration report following the recruitment of a new executive director.
Recruitment of The Committee will normally align the remuneration arrangements for new non-executive directors with those outlined non-executive within the policy table.
directors Proposed changes for 2018: Recruitment remuneration No change in approach.
88 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 GOVERNANCE Service contracts and termination and payments for loss of office When determining leaving arrangements for an executive director, the Committee takes into account any preestablished agreements, including the provisions of any incentive plans, typical market practice, statutory and contractual obligations, the performance and conduct of the individual and the commercial justification for any payments.
The following summarises our policy in relation to executive directors service contracts and payments in the event of loss of office: Notice period Standard notice policy is: and Termination 12 months notice from the company Payments 12 months notice from the Executive Director the current CFOs service contract may be terminated on 6-months notice by the company or the executive director Executive directors may be required to work during the notice period or take a period of garden leave or may be provided with pay in lieu of notice if not required to work the full notice period.
Payments in lieu of notice: Our policy for new appointments is that termination payments in lieu of notice would consist solely of base salary and the cost of providing benefits for the outstanding notice period.
Any statutory requirements will be observed.
Our standard practice is to include within executive directors contractual terms mitigation provisions as regards payments in lieu of notice.
The CEO LGIM may be paid his contracted benefits for three months following his effective date of termination of employment provided he is not dismissed for cause.
Expiry date All executive directors are subject to annual re-election.
The contracts for our executive directors are rolling service contracts.
Treatment of Rights to annual variable pay, deferred annual variable pay awards and performance share awards are governed by their outstanding respective plan rules.
incentive award Annual variable pay There is no automatic entitlement to an annual bonus in the year of cessation of employment.
However, for a good leaver, the Committee may determine that an executive director will receive a pro-rata bonus in respect of the period of employment during the year of cessation based on an assessment of group and personal performance.
Deferred annual variable pay awards In the event that a participant is a good leaver any outstanding unvested deferred annual variable pay award will normally be released at the normal time.
Where it considers it appropriate, for example in the circumstances of terminal illness, the Committee reserves the right to accelerate any payment due.
Good leaver circumstances are leaving due to circumstances such as death, disability, ill health or injury, redundancy, retirement with company agreement, the individuals employing company business ceasing to be part of the group, or other circumstances at the Committees discretion.
For all other leavers outstanding unvested awards lapse.
Awards will generally vest early on a takeover of the company, merger or other corporate reorganisation.
Alternatively participants may be allowed or required to exchange their awards for new awards.
If there is a demerger, delisting or special dividend or other transaction which may affect the share price, the Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a takeover.

Good leaver circumstances are leaving due to death, disability, ill health or injury, redundancy, retirement with company agreement, the individuals employing company business ceasing to be part of the group or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee.
For all other leavers, outstanding unvested awards lapse.
Alternatively, participants may be allowed or required to exchange their awards for new awards.
Where an award vests early in these circumstances, the Committee will determine the level of vesting, having regard to the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied to the date of vesting subject to downwards discretion based on underlying performance and unless the Committee determines otherwise to the fact that the award is vesting early.
Other information The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in connection with a Directors cessation of office employment where the payments are made in good faith in the discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such obligation or by way of settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of the directors office employment, or for any fees for outplacement assistance and or Directors legal and or professional advice fees in connection with his cessation of office employment.

Single figure of remuneration Executive Directors The following table shows a single total figure of remuneration for each executive director in respect of qualifying services for the 2017 financial year, together with a comparative figure for 2016.
15% of Mark Zinkulas salary and AVP are paid to him in the US.
At the time of his appointment as CEO LGIM a US dollar to GB sterling exchange rate of 1 $1.60 was agreed.
In 2017, Mark received $149,448 in salary in the US.
The rate will be kept under review during 2018.
The 2014 PSP figures reported in the 2016 single figure now reflect the actual vesting price of the shares, which vested on 9 March 2017, at 2.503 per share.
The values previously included in the 2016 report based on a three-month average share price to 31 December 2017 were 1,316k Nigel Wilson and 899k Mark Gregory and Mark Zinkula.
Historically our performance share plan PSP had a threeyear performance period which was aligned to grant date and generally ran to April or May.
In 2016 we changed the performance period used to determine vesting of the PSPs to align the end of the performance measurement period with our financial yearend date.
As a result of this change, our 2016 single figure table contained two PSPs, one relating to the threeyear performance period ending May 2016, and another relating to the new threeyear performance period ending December 2016.

For Nigel Wilson and Jeff Davies, they were weighted between group financial objectives 70% and other strategic personal objectives 30%.
For Mark Zinkula and Kerrigan Procter they were weighted between group financial objectives 35%, divisional objectives 35% and other strategic personal objectives 30%.
For 2017, AVP payouts as a percentage of the maximum were: Nigel Wilson 85%, Jeff Davies 90%, Mark Zinkula 81% and Kerrigan Procter 86%.

As set out in the Remuneration Committee Chairs statement accompanying the report, in determining payouts the Committee considered the impact of mortality assumption changes on operating profit and EPS and the oneoff impact of the changes in US corporate tax on EPS, given that these are outside the control of management.
The committee was of the view that it would not be appropriate to include the full impact of these items, in calculating the AVP outturn.
However, the underlying performance of the group was sufficiently strong that the impacted group financial performance targets were met in any event.

TSR performance condition 50% of the 2017 award Twenty five percent of the award will vest based on Legal & Generals TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100.
The remaining 25% of the award will vest based on Legal & Generals TSR performance against a bespoke group of insurers comprising the insurance constituents in the FTSEurofirst 300 plus any FTSE 350 Life Insurance companies not in the FTSEurofirst 300 and five US firms including Metlife, Prudential Financial, Ameriprise Financial, Principal Financial and Lincoln National.
The vesting schedule of the TSR performance conditions is as follows: % of award that vests Below median 0% Median threshold vesting 15% Between median and the 80th percentile 15%100% 80th percentile and above 100% At the end of the threeyear performance period, the Committee will critically assess whether the formulaic vesting outcome produced by the matrix is justified.
To do this, the Committee will look at a number of factors including: whether the result is reflective of underlying performance and has been achieved within the companys agreed risk appetite: the quality of earnings and the nature of any changes in leverage: key assumptions: dividend cover and behaviours, etc.
If such considerations mean that the formulaic outcome of the vesting schedule is not felt to be justified, then the Committee can exercise downwards discretion.
Performance Share Plan PSP 2018 For 2018, Nigel Wilson, Jeff Davies, Mark Zinkula and Kerrigan Procter will each be granted an award over nilcost options with a face value of 250% of base salary.
As indicated previously, for the 2018 award, the following performance measures will be used: relative TSR performance against the FTSE 100 25% of award and a bespoke group of insurance companies 25% of award EPS growth 50% of award Vesting of awards will be subject to an assessment of performance against Solvency II objectives.
Having considered the business plan over the coming three years and market expectations of performance and given the level of stretch within the TSR performance conditions, the Committee considered it appropriate to continue to set threshold vesting 15% of the award at median TSR performance and maximum vesting at the upper quintile TSR performance.
For the EPS growth measure the Committee considered it appropriate for vesting to be based on performance as set out in the table below: EPS growth p. a.

102 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE | DIRECTORS REPORT ON REMUNERATION Remuneration for employees below Board General remuneration policy The groups remuneration policy is designed to reward, motivate and retain high performers in line with the risk appetite of the group.
Remuneration is considered within the overall context of the groups sector and the markets in which the divisions operate.
The policy for the majority of employees continues to be to pay around the relevant midmarket range with a competitive package designed to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, and with an appropriate proportion of total remuneration dependent upon performance.
We define core remuneration as base salary, annual bonus and other benefits such as pension.
Key employees are also eligible to participate in the performance share plan PSP.
Summary of the remuneration structure for employees below Board Element Policy Base salary We aim to attract and retain key employees by paying salaries which deliver competitive total remuneration.
Factors taken into account when determining salaries include: the nature, size and scope of the role the knowledge, skills and experience of the individual individual and overall business performance pay and conditions elsewhere in the group appropriate external market data As a member of the Living Wage Foundation salaries are also set with reference to the Foundations UK and London living wage levels.
For 2018, the average base salary increase was 3.7%: however, it was agreed that this spend would be focused on more junior employees within the group and as such base salary increases for senior managers within the group including the executive directors were limited to 2%.
Annual bonus The majority of employees participate in a discretionary bonus plan, unless an alternative plan applies based on role.
An employee will be considered for a discretionary bonus award based on achievement against objectives, conduct and behaviours, the role performed during that year and internal relativities.
The group operates bespoke bonus plans where business appropriate.
However, the Remuneration Committee has ultimate discretion over all bonus plans.
Bonuses above a certain threshold are subject to deferral with the deferral amount increasing with the size of the bonus.
Deferred awards are normally held in shares for three years.
The company reserves the right to adjust deferral levels for code staff as deemed appropriate.
Performance share Participation in the PSP is offered to a small number of senior executives each year in recognition of the strategic and plan PSP influential role that they hold in terms of driving company performance, as well as their individual contribution.
This includes employees in LGIM whose roles span different business divisions and whose participation encourages synergy and teamwork across the group.
Participation in the plan for one year does not guarantee participation in future years.
PSP awards will be made to around 60 employees during 2018.
Where appropriate, grants under the PSP may also be made for new employees who join the company during the year in key roles.
Other share plans The company operates a Share Bonus Plan SBP which provides the vehicle for deferral of annual bonuses in the majority and long-term of cases and also allows for a limited number of awards of shares to high potential individuals and those with critical skills.
incentives In addition, the company operates a cash based long-term incentive plan for LGIM LGIM LTIP based on the financial performance of the division.
Participation in the LGIM LTIP is limited to senior managers within the division.
Pension All employees are given the opportunity to participate in a Group Pension Scheme.
Employee share All employees are given the opportunity to participate in a Save as You Earn SAYE plan and an Employee Share Purchase plans plan.
These are both HMRC approved plans which offer all employees the opportunity to share in the success of the business.
Annual equal pay audit The group seeks to ensure that our pay policies and practices are free from unfair bias.
Part of the pay review process is an annual equal pay audit that reviews pay and bonus decisions by gender, ethnicity, age and fulltime versus parttime working.
In addition, it considers the pay of the control function departments risk, compliance and internal audit as well as the oversight departments of finance and human resources and looks at decisions for employees who report directly to the business versus those who report to the function head.
Gender pay reporting The group has published its first gender pay report.
Further details can be found on page 34 of the report.

Terms of reference The Committees terms of reference are available on our website.
The remit of the Committee includes the remuneration strategy and policy framework for the whole company as well as the executive directors.
The Committee particularly focuses on: determining the individual remuneration for executive directors and for other designated individuals or for those who are discharging a head of control function role undertaking direct oversight on the remuneration of other high earners in the group oversight of the remuneration of Code staff and employees in the control and oversight functions oversight of remuneration policies and structures for all employees Considering risk The Reward Steering Committee RSC and the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function make a key contribution to the process of designing reward structures and evaluating whether achievement of objectives and any payment from plans have taken into account the overall risk profile of the company.
Reward Steering Committee RSC Reporting to the Remuneration Committee, the RSC helps set the framework within which our incentive arrangements are normally reviewed and implemented, with a view to supporting business strategy, whilst acting within the groups risk appetite.
The members of the RSC include the Group HR Director, Group Chief Risk Officer, Group Conduct Risk Director, Regulatory Risk Director, LGIM Compliance Director and the Director of Group Finance.
Where a business unit tables a proposal for consideration, the relevant business manager is required to attend the RSC meeting to explain the background and to answer all questions and challenges from the RSC.
Group regulatory risk and compliance function The Remuneration Committee also works closely with the group regulatory risk and compliance function with respect to remuneration proposals.
In particular, the function reports to the Committee on an annual basis on whether any risks have been taken outside of preagreed parameters, there have been regulatory breaches, or they are aware of any other considerations that may lead the Committee to consider whether it should impact the payment of bonuses to staff including in particular the executive directors and code staff.
The CRO also specifically looks at the overall risk profile of the company and whether executive directors have achieved objectives within the companys accepted risk appetite.
The CRO also reviews the executive directors objectives for the forthcoming year to ensure they are in line with the risk parameters.
Since the implementation of a new Solvency II remuneration policy in 2016, the scope of the CRO report has been extended to consider whether there are any risk considerations which may warrant adjustments to the overall level of corporate annual variable pay awards.
106 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE | DIRECTORS REPORT ON REMUNERATION Engagement with shareholders The Committee seeks to maintain an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance and any changes to the companys executive pay arrangements.
During the course of 2017, the Committee undertook a detailed review of the policy to ensure it remains appropriate for the company.
As set out in the letter from the Remuneration Committee Chair, during the course of 2017 the Committee undertook a detailed review of the policy to ensure it remains appropriate to the company.
The result of the review was that the policy was considered appropriate to drive group performance: however, two changes were considered appropriate: firstly to extend the time horizons of longterm incentive awards and secondly to replace the previous EPS DPS matrix which determined 50% of PSP awards with a sole measure of EPS.
During the course of late 2017 and early 2018, the Committee consulted with the groups largest shareholders on the above changes.
