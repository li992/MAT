Base Salary Purpose and link to strategy Salaries are a key component of the reward package in attracting, motivating and retaining executives who are instrumental in driving and growing the business and delivering the Companys strategic goals.
operation Salaries in the Group are based on the value of the individual, the level of responsibility, experience and market conditions.
Salaries are reviewed at least annually but are not necessarily increased.
the Committee may award salary increases at other times of the year if it considers such an award to be appropriate.
In reviewing salaries, account is taken of market conditions, significant changes in role, pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group, inflation and budgets.
Maximum the salary payable to executive Directors will normally be capped at the upper quartile of the relevant market benchmark for the role under review.
this maximum salary represents the highest end of the range at which the Committee would expect the base salary to be set, rather than the actual amount to be paid.
Salaries will be set on a case-by-case basis to reflect the role and the experience and qualifications of the individual.
there is no separate cap on the annual increase to base salaries.
However, the Committee will normally determine the appropriate level of increase for executive Directors taking into account the general level of increase for the broader workforce, but on occasion may need to make a more significant increase to recognise additional responsibilities, or an increase in the scale or scope of the role.
Larger increases also may be considered appropriate if a Director initially had been appointed to the Board on a belowmarket salary.

Remuneration of Any Executive Directors to be appointed in 2018 the Committee expects that any recruitment benefits or compensation and the salary, bonus and share scheme arrangements, and pension and other benefits to be provided to any new executive Director appointed during 2018 will be in line with the Directors remuneration Policy last approved by the Companys shareholders, as disclosed in the 2016 Annual report and Accounts.
As disclosed in the Nominations Committee report, the recruitment of a permanent Group Chief executive officer was put on hold in August 2017 pending the results of the possible offer, and subsequent final offer, from CDL.
As discussed earlier in the report the offer lapsed on 26 January 2018.
In the event a new executive Director is to be appointed in 2018, the Committee will be mindful of the guidance set out in the Investment Association Principles of remuneration that the use of additional holding periods for performance share awards is now commonly expected by investors, so that in total the performance and holding period should cover a period of at least five years.
In addition, the Committee anticipates working with its remuneration advisor to develop a more tailored and fit-for-purpose remuneration package for any permanent Group Chief executive officer or other executive Director to be appointed, which may include the use of a post-vesting holding period in the LtIP, and the deferral of a portion of any cash payments under the Companys short-term incentive bonus plan.
the Committee believes that these measures could assist in further aligning the interests of executive Directors with the interests of the Companys shareholders, and therefore help drive continued long-term value creation.
Non-Executive Director fees Payments to Non-executive Directors will be in accordance with the current Directors remuneration Policy.
Non-executive Directors therefore will continue to receive a basic fee for Board membership and separate annual fees for their service as a member and, to the extent applicable, the Chair of a Board committee.
the Senior Independent Director will be paid an additional fee, currently of 10,000 per year, to serve in such capacity.
Details of the current additional committee and chair fees are set out in the table below and no changes are being proposed for 2018: Annual fee for Additional membership of annual Chair Committee a committee fee Audit Committee 5,000 10,000 remuneration Committee 5,000 10,000 Nominations Committee 2,000 risk Committee 3,000 5,000 the Chairman of the Board will receive a set fee determined by the Committee from time to time.
the current annual fee is 250,000 and will remain the same in 2018. the Chairman also may continue to receive additional fees for serving as a director of certain subsidiary companies.

As a result, and as noted earlier in this report, the Committee will consider including this feature in the package offered to new executive Directors.
Consideration by the Committee members of matters relating to Directors remuneration the Committee is authorised by the Board to appoint external advisers if it considers such an appointment to be beneficial.
the Committee decided in December 2016 that it should carry out a tender process for the appointment of the Committees remuneration adviser as a matter of good practice given that the incumbent, Mercer Kepler, had been in role for five years.
the Committee conducted a comprehensive tender and selection process during which the Committee invited five firms including the incumbent to submit written proposals.
four of those firms were then shortlisted and made presentations to the Committee.
At the end of that process,  LLP PwC were selected as the Committees new remuneration adviser, with effect from 1 December 2017.
Consultants from PwC then commenced a transition exercise and attended the remuneration Committee meeting of 14 December 2017: before then consultants from Mercer Kepler attended most of the Committees other meetings in 2017.

Its scope of work includes attending Committee meetings: updating the Committee on developments in the market and trends in remuneration best practices and governance: reviewing this report: carrying out total remuneration benchmarking for executive Directors: carrying out IfrS 2 valuations for the Company in relation to the Companys share schemes: providing regular tSr monitoring reports and independently validating the Companys annual LtIP vesting calculations.
PwC was paid 3,208 in respect of such services provided in 2017.
PwC may also be called upon to advise the Board of Directors of the Company or those Directors charged by the Board to make recommendations from time to time on the remuneration of Non-executive Directors, including the Chairman.
In terms of PwCs other engagements with the Group, they provided limited advisory services to the Independent Non-executive Directors of the Company on matters relating to the share schemes of the Company and the effect on those share schemes of the offer by CDL.
the aggregate amount of fees paid to PwC for these services during 2017 was 19,665.
PwC also acted as the primary tax advisor to the Group in the eU and provided tax consulting services to the Group in other regions upon request.
this work will continue in 2018.
Aside from these services, PwC did not provide other significant services to the Group over the year and currently is not engaged to provide any services in 2018 other than the tax consulting services, for which PwC has implemented confidentiality barriers between their tax consulting and remuneration advisory teams to help ensure that their remuneration advice remains independent.
the Committee also reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and the Committee is comfortable that the PwC engagement partner and team that provide remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with the Company that may impair the independence of their judgment.
In addition, as a founder member of the remuneration Consultants Group, PwC voluntarily operates under the Voluntary Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
finally, as a member firm of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in england and Wales ICAeW, PwC complies with the ICAeWs ethical guidelines.
As a result, PwC operates under rigorous rules on independence, compliance and quality assurance.
for the reasons outlined above, the Committee has determined that the advice provided by PwC is objective and independent.
Mercer Kepler served as the Committees remuneration advisor until 1 December 2017.
Mercer Keplers fees were generally charged on an hourly basis and the aggregate fees paid to Mercer Kepler during 2017 were 11,918 2016: 30,100.
Mercer Kepler also provided advice to the Company on the accounting treatment of share options under IfrS 2, Mercer Kepler provided no other services to the Group in 2017.
Mercer Kepler, as a founding member and signatory to the Code of Conduct for remuneration Consultants, routinely confirmed via their consultants that they did not have any conflicts of interest and the Committee was satisfied that their advice was independent.
External appointments the Company recognises that executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden the executives knowledge and experience, for the benefit of the Group.
If an executive Director wishes to take on an external Non-executive Director appointment, the Companys policy is to support an executive Director with that appointment provided that there are no conflicts of interest and the role does not interfere with the executives commitment or duties.
they may retain any fees paid in connection with such other appointments, with the approval of the Committee.
Since there were no executive Directors serving on the Board as at the date of this report, no external appointments are reported.

The Groups share schemes In addition to the LtIP, the Group operates two other share schemes for senior employees other than the executive Directors, the Deferred Share Bonus DSB scheme and the executive Share Plan eSP.
Under the eSP awards of conditional shares are made to senior executive management.
the eSP was approved by the Group on 18february 2016 to replace participation in the LtIP for this population.
the Committee determines the size of the awards to be made taking into account the Groups performance and achievements over a one, two and three-year period.
the shares are released to participants in tranches, subject to continued employment and the rules of the plan, with 25% vesting one year after grant: 25% two years after grant: and 50% three years after grant.
the awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions under the rules of the eSP.

Awards of conditional shares are made to senior employees, but not to those who participate in the eSP, and are calculated based on a percentage of a participants bonus earned for the previous year.
Awards also are subject to malus and clawback provisions under the rules of the DSB.
In June 2017 awards were made to 59 employees over 55,750 shares and vest as to 25% after one year, 25% after two years and the final 50% after three years, subject to continued employment and the rules of the scheme.

executive Directors who participate in the LtIP, together with other employees of the Group who participate in the LtIP and other performance share schemes, are potential beneficiaries of the eBt and, as such, are deemed to be interested in any shares held.
Dilution the Company ensures that the level of shares granted under the Companys share plans and the means of satisfying such awards remains within best practice guidelines so that dilution from employee share awards does not exceed 10 per cent of the Companys issued share capital for all-employee share plans and five per cent in respect of executive share plans in any ten-year rolling period.
the Company monitors dilution levels on a regular basis and the Committee reviews these at least once a year.
