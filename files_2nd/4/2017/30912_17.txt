The company continued to invest in digital LTIP awards reduced for 2017 & 2018 by transformation and simplification.

As such, bonus was only payable to the would not be appropriate to take the full bonus and that a further Executive Directors for 2017 for performance delivered ahead of reduction in outcomes was appropriate.
The Committee commends market expectations.

Good progress was made in delivering on a number of aspects The degree of stretch in the targets set relative to plan was of the strategic plan.

We completed the programme on reasonable outcome: 16 February 2018.
The share buy back programme did not benefit the outcome of incentives for the Executive Directors.
Management is making tangible progress in executing the strategy but, at the time of the Committees deliberations, this was not fully Sales revenues in the year did not reach the stretch targets in the reflected in the share price: annual incentive plan.

2017 performance provides a solid foundation from which to build and positions the company well for a return to growth in 2018.
As a result, the annual bonus payable to the CEO for 2017 is 44% of maximum and for the CFO is 47% of maximum.
92 Pearson plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Remuneration overview Understanding total remuneration for the CEO for 2017 As noted above, the Remuneration Committee has decided to maintain the lower level of long-term incentive awards in 2018.
Given the level of performance achieved and the progress made In 2017, we reduced LTIP awards by approximately 30% from prior towards executing our longer term strategic plan, the overall levels, whilst retaining stretching performance targets.
We have also reported single figure for the total remuneration of John Fallon reduced the proportion of these awards that will vest for threshold for 2017 is 1.758m.
This is a 16% increase compared with 2016. performance from 25% to 18% of the award.

This is Therefore, the 2018 awards will be made with the same face value as higher than the annual bonus for 2016, which was 24% of the a % of salary as those in 2017. maximum opportunity.
Responding to shareholder feedback we are rebalancing the John Fallon did not receive a salary increase in 2017 and none of performance measures for 2018 awards.
One third of any award the 2015 LTIP award for the performance cycle from 2015 to 2017 will vest based on each of Earnings Per Share EPS, Gross Return vested.

We will limit the pension allowance for future new external Looking forward to 2018 simpler, balanced Executive Director appointments.
This will reduce the maximum performance measures cash allowance in lieu of participation in a pension scheme from 26% to 16% of salary.
The base salary for the CEO and CFO will be increased by 2.5% in 2018 in line with the average increases for UK employees.

Executive directors will be expected to maintain a shareholding of at least half their normal guideline for two years Working within our existing policy, to simplify the annual incentive following retirement.
plan AIP structure for 2018, and reflecting shareholder feedback, we have reduced the number of performance measures from five to four.
We have replaced the two profit based measures previously included Operating Profit and EPS with a single Operating Profit measure, which will determine 40% of the outcome of the plan.
This provides a greater focus on the metric used by management on a day-to-day basis to manage the business, whilst reducing the prominence of EPS in the overall remuneration framework.
We have also made minor adjustments to the weightings of the other performance measures Cashflow 20%, Revenue 20% and Strategic Measures 20%.
We believe this creates an AIP that is appropriately balanced between key metrics and objectives for 2018.
Each performance measure will operate independently.
There will be no changes to the maximum annual incentive opportunities for 2018.
Section 4 Governance Remuneration 93 Remuneration overview Our remuneration policy is aligned with our strategy Summary of key Committee actions Our shareholders approved our remuneration policy in 2017. and decisions Nevertheless, the Remuneration Committee considered carefully whether we should seek shareholder approval for a new policy at the AGM in 2018.
The primary principle of our remuneration policy Comprehensive and multi-phased 2017 actions remains to support the companys strategy, which is focused on investor engagement delivering sustainable performance and the creation of value over 30% reduction in LTIP award levels the long term for our stakeholders.
The remuneration of our Reduction in LTIP threshold vesting level Executive Directors is closely tied to the achievement of annual from 25% to 18% of maximum and longer-term objectives, while remaining sensitive to the LTIP subject to stretching targets set above shareholder experience.
market consensus expectations at the time We concluded that we are able to operate within our current policy, AIP based on challenging targets with no which we believe underpins the companys strategic objectives benefit from buyback or currency movement and maintains an appropriate relationship between pay and Maximum payout would require maximum performance.
The policy has worked well in 2017 to provide the right performance on each individual component framework to reflect strategy and execution priorities, while also and outperformance on any one element allowing us to address the concerns raised by our shareholders as cannot compensate for others expressed at last years AGM and also on subsequent engagement.
Discretionary downward adjustment to remove benefit of tax rate reduction Conclusion Further reduction in outcomes Pearson is undergoing substantial change as the business delivers LTIP awards maintained at same reduced 2018 decisions on digital transformation and continuous improvements in level as 2017 efficiency, while addressing the needs of all our stakeholders.
