Annual profit and margin targets for the Group and each division are set in line with the budget approved by the Board in light of shareholder expectations, the Groups strategy and market conditions.
Cash targets for the Group and the divisions included operating cash flow targets measured monthly over ten months, cash conversion targets measured at two points in the year and stock turn targets measured three times during the year.
These targets were based on the Groups budget.
The rationale for measuring cash on a monthly basis is to encourage smooth flow of cash throughout the year so as to incentivise sustainable cash flow.
Given the complex structure and number of cash targets, we believe the disclosure of such targets would not be practical or meaningful to shareholders.
Performance directed on strategic measures included the following: Strategic measures Outcome Develop capability in additive manufacturing Orders won and in the pipeline with targeted customers.
Accredited as a Partner with multiple organisations in the year.
Further progress and success in eDrive to improve market share Considerable success in gaining business.
Market leader in P4 architecture for electric all-wheel drives: successful launch of eTwinster.
Sharpen business focus Progress on portfolio rationalisation and movement of work to plan.
Increase productivity and standardisation Increased standardisation significantly across CVJ.
Progress on cobots and automation.
