The LTIP award made to John Martin was in the form of nil cost options.
At vesting, the exercise price per share will be nil.
The LTIP award made to FrankRoach was a conditional share award and there is no exercise price.
The share price used to calculate the face value of the PBBO and RSBO share awards granted on 21 June 2017 was 4,944.6 pence which was the average share price over a five-dealing day period preceding 28 February 2017.
The PBBO and RSBO awards made to Mike Powell were conditional share awards and there is no exercise price.

Dividend equivalents also accrue on the LTIP and PBBO awards and the amount which may be due to an Executive Director is not included in the calculation of face value.
The maximum dilution which may arise through issue of shares to satisfy the entitlement to these LTIP, PBBO and RSBO scheme interests would be 0.00057 per cent calculated as at31 July 2017.
