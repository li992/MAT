Chairs letter As Chair of the Remuneration Committee the Committee and on behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to present our Board report on remuneration for the 2017 financial year, in line with the requirements of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
Structure of report This year we have restructured our report to support greater transparency and ease of use.
We have included a new at a glance section presenting the key outcomes for 2017, and have brought our implementation of policy in 2018 section to the front of the report to make it easier for our readers to see our intended approach in 2018.
The main body of the report includes the following sections: Section A: This describes how the existing policy, approved at the 2016 AGM, was implemented in 2017: Section B: This summarises the remuneration policy of the Board with regard to the remuneration of the directors.
The full remuneration policy, as approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2016, is also available on our website in the 2015 Annual Report at www.
com en investors reports-and-results 2015. aspx Wider workforce considerations and approach to remuneration Our approach to remuneration emphasises simplicity, with strong alignment to our strategic priorities.
We recognise that the emerging governance environment places an increased importance on consideration of pay and conditions in the wider workforce.
Following the anticipated release of revisions to the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Committee will review its approach to considering wider workforce reward, and how the views of employees and other stakeholders input to our decisions.
Business performance and incentive outcomes for 2017 Bodycote has performed strongly through 2017, with a top line revenue growth of 9.6% at constant currencies.
The Groups general industrial markets performed particularly strongly, with a return to growth after a multi-year negative trend.
Annual bonus Improved profitability alongside tight controls on working capital and a focus on higher value added businesses have enabled us to deliver a headline operating profit of 123.9m an increase of 24% on 2016 together with a headline operating cash flow of 111.7m.
Our bonus is based on these metrics, and therefore performance was above maximum under the profit measure and under the cash flow measure.
The annual bonus is also, in part, based upon the achievement of personal objectives which relate to the strategic focus of the Company such as growth in emerging markets and Specialist Technologies, against which the CEO performed at 84% of maximum, and the CFO at 70%.
Overall the bonus therefore paid out at 97.9% of maximum for the CEO and 96.1% of maximum for the CFO, of which 35% and 23% for the CEO and the CFO respectively, will be deferred into shares for three years, in line with our approved policy for bonus deferral.
Long term incentive The Companys principal long term incentive, the Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP is based on performance against return on capital employed ROCE and earnings per share EPS targets over a three year period.
Our ongoing focus on operating efficiency, margins, and targeted investments in high growth markets has supported earnings development over the three year period despite the challenging environment.
Strong returns have also been delivered, helped by the focus on capital investment in specialist markets and performance was achieved at 48.2% of maximum.
The 2014 Co-Investment Plan CIP is based on absolute total shareholder returns growth, and the TSR CAGR value of 5.4% we have delivered over the three year performance period is reflected in a vesting under this plan of 54.2%.
No awards have been made under the CIP since 2015, and so this is the penultimate vesting for this plan.
Note that David Landless, our former Finance Director, will receive pay-outs from these incentives pro-rated for the proportion of the performance period for which he was in the role.
54 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017 25695 19 March 2018 3:29 PM Proof 7 Application of the policy for 2018 The Committee continues to operate within the Remuneration Policy agreed at the 2016 AGM.
We set out below a brief overview of how the policy will be applied in the year ahead: Base salaries: An increase of 2.9% will be applied to the base salaries of the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer with effect from 1 January 2018, in line with inflation.
Benefits and pension: There will be no changes to benefits and pension during 2018.
Annual bonus: The maximum bonus opportunity remains 200% of salary for the CEO and 150% of salary for the CFO, with 35% of any bonus paid being deferred in shares for three years following conclusion of our transitional deferral arrangements.
The measures and weightings used have been reviewed and we believe a bonus consisting of 77% headline operating profit, 10% headline operating cash management and 13% personal objectives continues to enable the annual bonus to be aligned to the Companys strategy and ensures our executives are focussed on delivery of improved profitability and control on working capital.
Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP : Award levels will remain 175% of salary for Executive Directors.
Similarly, measures and weightings have been reviewed and we believe the equal focus on returns and earnings is strongly aligned with our strategic priorities.
The growth of our business and our ability to deliver strong and sustainable returns to investors is based on delivery of an effective deployment of capital in rapid growth areas and bolt-on acquisitions.
ROCE and EPS metrics will ensure strong alignment between these strategic goals and the reward of our executives over the longer term.
Non-Executive Director changes On 30 March 2017, Alan Thomson informed the Board of his intention to retire as Chairman and on 31 October 2017 we announced the appointment of Anne Quinn CBE as Non-Executive Chairman with effect from 1 January 2018.
Alan Thomson stepped down as Chairman and retired as a director on 31 December 2017.
As of 1 January 2018 we have appointed an additional Non-Executive Director, Lili Chahbazi.
At the March 2017 meeting of the Remuneration Committee, it was agreed that the fee paid to the Non-Executive Chairman would be increased from its 2016 level of 169,125 to 200,000.
In determining the appropriate fee level the Committee considered market benchmarking against the FTSE 250 and other companies of comparable size and complexity in line with our approved policy set out in Section B of this report.
The Committee sought to ensure the revised fee was sufficiently competitive to support the attraction and retention of a Chairman of suitably high calibre and experience to support our leadership as our Company continues to evolve.
The fee agreed as of 1 January 2018 for the new Non-Executive Chairman, Anne Quinn, was 225,000.
I trust the information presented in this report enables our shareholders to understand both how we have operated our remuneration policy over the year and the rationale for our decision making.
We remain fully committed to continuing an open and transparent dialogue with our shareholders.
I would welcome your views on the content of this report or any other items you would like to discuss and I look forward to meeting you and answering any questions you may have at the AGM.

Payments to past directors In March 2017 David Landless received a bonus payment relating to the year ending 31 December 2016 amounting to 66,128.
This was in line with our approved policy and related to his full year of service in 2016, but was paid to Mr Landless in 2017.
Under a consultancy agreement following cessation, David Landless agreed to be available to the Company during January and February 2017 to support Dominique Yates and Stephen Harris through this transitional period and received a fee of 6,000 in exchange for his services during the period.
No other cash payments were made to Mr Landless.
In June 2017 David Landless received dividend equivalents in connection with the pro-rated vesting of the 2014 CIP amounting to 3,386.
Davids 2015 Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP and Co-Investment Plan CIP awards are to be pro-rated to his leaving date and are subject to achievement of performance conditions at the end of the three year performance period.
No CIP awards were made in 2016 or 2017.

Directors shareholdings As described in Section B: Directors Remuneration Policy, the Board operates a shareholding retention policy under which Executive Directors and other senior executives are expected, within five years of appointment, to build up a shareholding in the Company.
For the purposes of this requirement, only beneficially-owned shares and the net of tax value of deferred shares under the annual bonus as they are not subject to further performance conditions will be counted.
The shareholding requirement for the CEO is 200% of salary and for the CFO is 150% of salary.

The Committee may also exercise operational and administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules.

Notes to the Remuneration Policy table The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out on pages 66 to 75 where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company.
For these purposes payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment being agreed at the time the award is granted.
Executive Directors remuneration is reviewed annually and takes into account a number of factors.
The Company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the Company to pay any more than is necessary.
Senior and high performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, which are similar to those offered to the Executive Directors to ensure reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.

The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any incentive scheme.
Appropriate benefits may be provided to non-executives and the Chairman from time to time.
The Company will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the Non-Executive Directors and Chairman and may settle any tax incurred in relation to these.
Fees retained for external Non-Executive directorships To broaden the experience of Executive Directors, they may hold positions in other companies as Non-Executive Directors provided that permission is sought in advance.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the Company to pay any more than is necessary.
Senior and high-performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, similar to the Executive Directors to ensure reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when formulating Executive Director pay policy.
However, it does take into account information provided by the Human Resources function on pay and conditions across the Company, and considers these as part of its discussions and decision making, along with feedback from employee satisfaction surveys.
In formulating Executive Director pay policy, the Committee receives information on all employee pay conditions throughout the Group.
The Committee does not use any remuneration comparison metrics.
We recognise the Governments recent commentary in this area, and will ensure that our approach to consideration of employee views and pay and conditions across the Company reflect appropriate legislative and corporate governance requirements.
com 25695 19 March 2018 3:29 PM Proof 7 Additional information Financial statements Governance Strategic report Board report on remuneration continued Statement of consideration of shareholders views The Committee always welcomes the views of shareholders in respect of pay policy as well as those views expressed on behalf of shareholders by their respective proxy advisers.
The Committee documents all remuneration related comments made at the Companys AGM and feedback received during consultation with shareholders throughout the year.
Any feedback received is fully considered by the Committee.
In developing the proposed Remuneration Policy for 2016 and beyond the Remuneration Committee engaged extensively with the Companys key shareholders and their representative bodies.
Through this process the Remuneration Committee took on board the feedback received and refined the proposed Remuneration Policy as appropriate to ensure it meets the expectations of our shareholders.
Approach to recruitment remuneration When recruiting new Executive Directors, the Companys policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and experience appropriate to the role to be filled, taking into account remuneration across the Group, including other senior executives, and that offered by other FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar size and complexity.
New Executive Directors will generally be appointed on remuneration packages with the same structure and pay elements as described in the pay policy table on pages 66 to 70.
Each element of remuneration to be included in the package offered to a new director would be considered separately and collectively in this context.
Component Policy General The Companys policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and experience appropriate to the role to be filled.
The initial notice period may be longer than the Companys one year policy up to a maximum of two years.
However, this will reduce by one month for every month served, until the Companys policy position is reached.
Base salary Base salary levels will be set at an appropriate level to recruit the best candidate in consideration of the new recruits existing salary, location, skills and experience and expected contribution to the new role, the current salaries of other Executive Directors in the Company and current market levels for the role.
Other benefits Other benefits will be considered in light of the provision in place for the other Executive Director s. If it is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders, the Committee may consider providing additional benefits, potentially including relocation costs, tax equalisation or advisers fees.
Pension Pension will be considered in light of the retirement arrangements which are in place for the other Executive Director s with a contribution level considered by the Committee to be appropriate in light of the new recruits package as a whole, market practice at the time and on a broadly equivalent basis to existing provisions for other executives.
Annual bonus Normal awards will be made under the annual bonus plan in line with the Remuneration Policy.
The Executive Director may be invited to participate in the bonus on a pro-rated basis in the first year of appointment.
Long-term incentives Normal awards will be made under the BIP in line with the Remuneration Policy.
The Executive Director may be invited to participate in in flight BIP awards on a pro-rated basis when appointed.
The Company is required to set out the maximum amount of variable pay which could be paid to a new director in respect of his her recruitment.
In order to provide the Company with sufficient flexibility in a recruitment scenario, the Committee has set this figure as 450% of base salary.
This covers the maximum annual bonus and the maximum face value of any long-term incentive awards.
This level of variable pay would only be available in exceptional circumstances, and in order to achieve such a level of variable pay, stretching targets would need to be met.
For the avoidance of doubt, this 450% variable pay limit excludes the value of any buyout payments or awards associated with forfeited awards.
Replacement awards For an external appointment, although there are no plans to offer additional cash and or share-based payments on recruitment, the Committee reserves the right to do so when it considers this to be in the best interests of the Company and shareholders.
Such payments may take into account remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attached to that remuneration.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buyout awards which will be forfeited on leaving the previous employer.
Our approach to this is to carry out a detailed review of the awards which the individual will lose and calculate the estimated value of them.
In doing so, we will consider the vesting period, the option exercise period if applicable, whether the awards are cash or share based, performance related or not, the Companys recent performance and payout levels and any other factors we consider appropriate.
If a buyout award is to be made, the structure and level will be carefully designed and will generally reflect and replicate the previous awards as accurately as possible.
We will make the award subject to appropriate malus and clawback provisions in the event that the individual resigns or is summarily terminated within a certain timeframe.
An explanation will be provided at the time of recruitment of why a buyout award has been granted.
Internal promotions For internal promotions any commitments made prior to appointment may continue to be honoured as the executive is transitioned to the new remuneration arrangements.

It is the Committees intention to only use this discretion in circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders: to vest deferred shares at the end of the original deferral period or at the date of cessation.
The Committees policy is that shares will vest on the original date of vesting.

Exercise of discretion In the event that an Executive Director leaves the Company, the Committees policy for exit payments is to consider the reasons for cessation and consequently whether any exit payments other than those contractually required are warranted.
Further, in the event of a compromise or settlement agreement, the Committee may agree payments it considers reasonable in settlement of legal claims.
This may include an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under employment protection legislation in the UK or in other jurisdictions.
The Committee may also include in such payments reasonable reimbursement of professional fees in connection with such agreements.
Change of control Our policy is not to have a change in control clause in Executive Directors service contracts.
Neither S. C. Harris nor D. Yates contract have a change of control clause.
To the extent that executive contracts are renewed, or new appointments made, the Committee will continue to adopt a policy of not having change of control clauses in service contracts.
In any case, legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic salary, annual incentives and benefits, which may arise on the termination of employment of any Executive Director, other than payments made on a change in control or for payments in lieu of notice.
On change of control the awards under the Companys incentive plans will generally vest subject to performance and time apportionment as determined by the Committee and in accordance with the rules of the relevant Plan.
