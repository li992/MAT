72 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE This policy is unchanged in substance since approval at the AGM on 14 September 2016.
Other than minor text changes to ensure this policy remains clear for the reader, a few other minor changes have been made to provide additional clarity, including updated scenario charts shown below.
PERFORMANCE MEASURE SELECTION AND APPROACH TO TARGET SETTING EBITDA and billings are considered to be the best measures of the Groups annual performance given the current size and stage of growth, and will continue to determine annual bonus vesting.
The Committee will keep this under review, and may select alternative measures as the Group evolves and strategic priorities change.
Annual bonus targets will be selected prior to, or shortly after, the start of the financial period.
Financial targets will be calibrated with reference to the Groups budget for the upcoming financial period and the Groups performance over the prior financial period.
Threshold and stretch performance levels for performance-based awards under the LTIP will be set at the start of the three-year performance period.
The Committee aims to set stretching but achievable targets, taking account of a range of reference points, including market consensus and the Groups strategic plan.
DIFFERENCES IN REMUNERATION POLICY OPERATED FOR OTHER EMPLOYEES Other employee remuneration has the same components as set out in the policy, being base salary, annual bonus, long-term incentive participation, pension, life assurance and benefit provision.
Annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements share a similar structure and pay-out arrangement, although the mix between performance-based and time-based awards, and the maximum award, varies by seniority and role.
OTHER In addition to the above elements of remuneration, any commitment made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, the approval and implementation of the policy detailed in this report will be honoured, this includes awards made to Directors both Executive and Non-Executive prior to IPO.
PERFORMANCE SCENARIOS The graphs below provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunities for Executive Directors, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Minimum, Target and Maximum.

APPROACH TO REMUNERATION FOR NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR APPOINTMENTS In the cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee may make use of all the existing components of remuneration, as follows: Maximum Component Approach opportunity The base salaries of new appointees will be determined based on the Base salary experience and skills of the individual, relevant market data and their n a current basic salary.

New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with the Benefits policy which may include but are not limited to car allowance, n a medical insurance and life insurance.
The structure described in the policy table will apply to new 200 percent of Annual bonus appointees with the relevant maximum being pro-rated to reflect the base salary.

All-employee New appointees may be eligible to participate in all-employee In line with schemes schemes on the same basis as other employees.
74 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED In determining appropriate remuneration for a new Executive Director, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of the Group and its shareholders.
In addition to the remuneration arrangements set out above, the Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, using Listing Rule 9.4.
In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
The fair value of any buy out will not exceed that of the award being foregone.
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the approach will be consistent with the policy for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to Board level, the Group will continue to honour these arrangements.
Incentive opportunities for below Board employees are no higher than for Executive Directors, but measures may vary.
In recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on page 71.
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND EXIT PAYMENT POLICY NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The appointments of each of the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are for a fixed term of three years and subject to annual re-election by the Company at the AGM.
Their letters of appointment set out the terms of their appointment and are available for inspection upon request.
They are not eligible to participate in the annual bonus, nor do they receive any additional pension or benefits other than nominal travel expenses on top of the fees disclosed on page 83.
Non-Executive Directors appointment may be terminated at any time upon written notice or in accordance with the articles and receive no compensation on termination.

Executive Director Role Appointment date Term of appointment Kris Hagerman Chief Executive Officer 11 June 2015 12 months Nick Bray Chief Financial Officer 11 June 2015 12 months The Employer is entitled to terminate an Executive Directors employment by payment of a cash sum in lieu of notice, equal to i the basic salary that would have been payable, and ii the cost that would have been incurred in providing the Executive Director with medical insurance benefits for any unexpired portion of the notice period the Payment in Lieu.
The Company can alternatively choose to continue providing the medical insurance benefits under item ii instead of paying a cash sum representing their cost.
The Payment in Lieu will be paid in monthly instalments over the notice period.
In specified circumstances not involving a change of control, in which case the severance payment applicable is as described below, each Executive Director is entitled to terminate his employment without notice and receive a severance payment.
The severance payment will be equal to the Payment in Lieu and paid in a single lump sum.
The specified circumstances are where either: a the Employer terminates or gives notice to terminate the Executive Directors employment without cause: or b the Executive Director terminates his employment in response to: a material diminution of his authority, duties, responsibilities or status in a manner inconsistent with his service agreement: a breach of a fundamental term of his service agreement: a material reduction in his annual basic salary or target bonus opportunity: or being required to relocate his place of work beyond a specified distance each a Good Leaver Reason.
Each Executive Director is entitled to a severance payment, paid in a single lump sum, in the event of a termination of his employment by his Employer without cause or by the Executive Director for a Good Leaver Reason at any time during a period ending 18 months after any change of control of the Company whether by way of a general offer or a scheme of arrangement or compromise and beginning three months prior to the announcement of such general offer or scheme of arrangement or compromise.
The severance payment will be equal to the sum of: i 150 percent of the Executive Directors annual basic salary: ii 150 percent of the Executive Directors target bonus for the Companys financial year in which the termination occurs: and iii the total cost of providing the Executive Director with the benefits including pension contributions to which he is entitled under his service agreement for a period of 12 months.
The Groups change of control provisions are standard practice in the US where many of the Groups executives, including the CEO, are located and to renegotiate contracts would likely represent an increased cost for the Company where this provision may never be triggered.
For future hires, the Committee will consider the appropriateness of the contractual provisions at that time, taking into account prevailing market practice in the geography that the executive is located.
76 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED The Companys policy on termination payments is to consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the executives contractual terms, the circumstances of termination and any duty to mitigate.
The table below summarises how incentives are typically treated in different circumstances: Reason for leaving Treatment Bonus Summary dismissal, resignation Awards lapse.
Good leaver Eligible for an award to the extent that performance conditions have been satisfied, pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year served, with Committee discretion to treat otherwise.
Change of control Eligible for an award to the extent that performance conditions have been satisfied up to the change of control, pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year served, with Committee discretion to treat otherwise.
Executives may be eligible for an enhanced bonus payment in the case of termination of employment within 18 months of a change of control, as described above.
Long-term incentives Summary dismissal, resignation Awards lapse.
Good leaver Outstanding awards will normally be pro-rated to the date of leaving, with Committee discretion to treat otherwise and with discretion to either test at the end of relevant performance periods, or immediately assess, whether or not relevant performance criteria have been met.
Change of control Outstanding awards will normally vest and be tested for performance over the period to change of control, and be pro-rated for time based on the proportion of the period served, with Committee discretion to treat otherwise.
Executives may be eligible for additional vesting in the case of termination of employment within 18 months of a change of control.
All-employee schemes Treated in line with applicable scheme rules EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Executive Directors may accept external appointments with the prior approval of the Chairman, provided that such appointments do not prejudice the executives ability to fulfil their duties for the Group.
Any fees for outside appointments would normally be retained by the Director.
CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN GROUP The Committee takes into account the general basic salary increase being offered to employees elsewhere in the Group when annually reviewing the salary increases and remuneration for the Executive Directors.
Employees have not been consulted in respect of the design of the Groups senior executive remuneration policy.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS The Committee takes shareholder feedback into careful consideration when reviewing remuneration and regularly reviews the Remuneration policy in the context of key institutional shareholder guidelines and best practice.
It is the Committees policy to consult with major shareholders prior to making any major changes to its executive remuneration structure.

INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 79 ANNUAL BONUS ANNUAL BONUS FOR FY17 The Group operates an annual performance-related bonus scheme for a number of senior executives including Executive Directors.
Bonus opportunities for FY17 were 200 percent of salary for Kris Hagerman and 160 percent of salary for Nick Bray.
Target bonus was 50 percent of the maximum opportunity.
The level of annual bonus earned in any one year is based on Group performance against predetermined financial targets for the year and personal performance.
In FY17, the bonus was based 80 percent on billings and EBITDA, as defined by the scheme rules, with 12.5 percent of maximum vesting for threshold performance and 50 percent for target performance, and 20 percent on personal performance.
No bonus is awarded for performance below the threshold.
The financial element payout is based on the lower of the implied payouts for billings and EBITDA, so to achieve any vesting of this element, executives were required to perform on both billings and EBITDA.
Following consultation with shareholders, the Committee has worked to improve disclosure of retrospective annual bonus targets.
The financial targets for the FY17 annual bonus are no longer considered commercially sensitive, and are disclosed in full, alongside performance against these targets, below.

For levels of performance between the points set out in the table above, bonus payout was determined on a straight-line, pro-rata basis.
The overall bonus payout was based on the lower of the implied payouts for billings and EBITDA, and was therefore 53 percent of maximum for the financial element.
After taking into account personal performance, including strong financial delivery, supporting talent retention and succession planning, and delivery of key products into the marketplace in line with the product strategy, Kris Hagerman and Nick Bray will receive bonuses of 110 percent and 88 percent of salary, respectively.
The entire bonus in respect of FY17 will be paid in cash.

The overall bonus payout was based on the lower of the implied payouts for billings and EBITDA, and was therefore 58 percent of maximum.
After taking into account personal performance, Kris Hagerman and Nick Bray received bonuses of 116 percent and 92 percent of salary, respectively.

Based on salary as at 1 July 2016.
The RSU awards are not subject to future performance conditions, and will vest over four years, subject to continued employment, with 25 percent of the awards vesting on 14 June 2017 and the remainder vesting on a quarterly basis thereafter until 14 June 2020.
The PSU awards vest subject to the vesting outcome implied by performance against annual targets over the three years to the financial year-ended 31 March 2019, with the award vesting to the extent that targets are met on the third anniversary of grant.
Targets for the three years are set at the start of the performance period.
For FY16 and FY17 awards, vesting is based on the lower of the implied payouts for billings and cash EBITDA i. e. the measures are equally weighted, with 25 percent vesting for threshold performance, 100 percent for stretch performance, with up to an additional 25 percent vesting for performance between a super stretch target and maximum target.
The face value of awards in the table above are calculated after application of the potential opportunity above the super stretch target.
No awards will vest for performance below the threshold.
INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 81 PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR OUTSTANDING PSU AWARDS The Committee believes that disclosing the individual annual financial performance targets for FY18 and FY19 in this report would put the Company at a competitive disadvantage to its international and privately held competitors, which are not subject to similar disclosure requirements.
In response to feedback from our shareholders in advance of the 2016 AGM, the Committee recognises shareholders request for improved disclosure of long-term incentive performance targets.
Therefore, below is disclosed on a retrospective basis the annual financial targets, and performance against these targets, for PSU awards made in 2015 and 2016.

Based on two years of performance to 31 March 2017, forecast vesting is c. 111% or 89% of maximum final total vesting percentage will not be known until the end of the 3-year performance period.

Based on one year of performance to 31 March 2017, forecast vesting is c. 100%, or 80% of maximum final total vesting percentage will not be known until the end of the 3-year performance period.
82 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED DILUTION LIMITS It is proposed that Sophos will continue to manage dilution within the context of maintaining award levels within a 10 percent limit over five years, the limit that has applied since our incentive plans were approved at IPO.
The Committee is aware that this is higher than the limit adopted by many UK companies and preferred by many institutional investors of 5 percent over ten years in respect of discretionary awards and 10 percent over ten years in respect of all schemes.
The Committee believes the higher limit we operate is necessary in part because of the broad-based nature of our equity plans, under which shares are provided to a large proportion of our employees including SAYE and ESPP schemes open to most employees and are a key part of the Groups employee compensation package, and reflects the need to be able to compete with other US and international companies for the high-calibre employees and executives required to secure Sophos future success.
Current dilution under all our incentive schemes is c. 5.5 percent, and reflects the front-loaded approach to incentive grants following our IPO.
