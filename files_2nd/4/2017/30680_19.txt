These changes placed a greater emphasis on financial goals reflecting the importance we place on achievement of financial measures.
The financial measures comprise 75% of the total award and are split between revenue 35%, trading profit margin 25%, and trading cash flow 15%.
These measures were selected because revenue and trading profit margin constitute the key drivers of profit growth, and trading cash flow was a key measure of how efficiently we turn our assets into cash.
Trading profit margin is a critical measure both for the business and our investors and delivering margin improvements is a core commitment under our strategy.
The remaining 25% of the total award are individual business objectives, similar to previous years, tied to our strategic priorities.
As in previous years, these business objectives fell into the categories of Business Process, People and Customer.
The weighting of the performance measures for 2017 can be summarised as follows: Financial objectives 75% Revenue 35% Trading profit margin 25% Trading cash flow 15% Business objectives 25% Business process 8.33% People 8.33% Customer 8.33% The figures for threshold, target and maximum relating to the financial objectives of the cash element of the 2017 Annual Incentive Plan are shown below: Threshold Target Maximum Actual 1 Revenue $4,578m $4,720m $4,861m $4,654m 1 Trading profit margin 21.8% 22.3% 22.7% 22.3% Trading cash flow $801m $890m $979m $940m 1 At constant exchange rates.
2 During the year, the trading cash flow target was adjusted upwards to reflect the change regarding the cash funding of closed post-retirement benefit schemes see pages 150155.
Target was set and approved by the Board in the 2017 Budget.
Threshold and Maximum are set at -3% from the target for revenue, at -45bps for the trading profit margin measure and at -10% for the trading cash flow from target.
This resulted in a bonus achievement of 73% of salary in respect of the financial objectives.
Weight Achieved % of target Award % of salary Revenue 35% 77% 26.9% Trading profit margin 25% 107% 26.8% Trading cash flow 15% 128% 19.2% Accordingly, the following amounts have been earned by Olivier Bohuon and Graham Baker under the cash element of the Annual Incentive Plan in respect of their financial objectives.
Olivier Bohuon 859,517 Graham Baker 371,647 The same measures and weightings will apply to the financial measurements of the cash element of the Annual Incentive Plan 2018.
For reasons of commercial sensitivity, we are unable to disclose the precise targets now, but they will be disclosed in the 2018 Remuneration Report at the time of vesting.
Business Objectives When setting business objectives for the upcoming year, the Board looks not only at the expected financial performance for the year, but also at the actions it expects the Executive Director to carry out in the year to build a solid foundation for financial performance over the longer term.
In reviewing performance against these objectives at the end of the year, the Board is mindful that there is not always a necessary correlation between financial performance and the achievement of business objectives.

The first looks at what has been achieved, namely the extent to which the employee has performed against the financial and business objectives set at the beginning of the year.
The second looks at how this performance has been achieved, reflecting the right culture and values in accordance with our critical enablers.
Against each, the employee is rated as having performed below, in-line or above expectations.
Assessment of how Executive Directors have achieved Below expectations In-line with expectations Above expectations Assessment of what has been achieved Below expectations No Award No Award No Award In-line with expectations No Award Award of Award of 50% of Salary 55% of Salary Above expectations No Award Award of Award of 55% of Salary 65% of Salary The Remuneration Committee has considered the performance of Olivier Bohuon and Graham Baker in exactly the same way as other employees in the Group when determining the level of Equity Incentive Award to be made to them.
In assessing their performance against the same financial and business objectives used to determine the level of their cash award, the Remuneration Committee has determined that on the first criterion assessing what they have achieved Olivier Bohuon and Graham Baker have both performed in-line with expectations throughout the year.
On the second criterion assessing how they have achieved, the Remuneration Committee has determined that Olivier Bohuon has performed in-line with expectations and Graham Baker has performed above expectations.
These ratings result in an Equity Incentive Award of 50% of salary for Olivier Bohuon and 55% of salary for Graham Baker.
In summary, as a result of the financial performance described on page 85 and the performance described in the table on page 86, the Remuneration Committee determined that the following awards be made under the Annual Incentive Plan in respect of performance in 2017: Cash Component Equity Component Executive Director % of salary Amount % of salary Amount Olivier Bohuon 91% 1,071,825 50% 589,745 Graham Baker 104% 531,022 55% 280,500 These figures are converted into dollars and included under Annual Incentive Plan cash and equity in the single figure table on page 83.

Olivier Bohuon has announced his intention to retire by the end of 2018 and will therefore not be entitled to receive an Equity Incentive Award in 2019 after ceasing to be an employee.
He will therefore receive a cash amount equivalent to the Equity Incentive Award he would have received, ifany, had he remained employed.
This will be disclosed in full in the 2018 Remuneration Report.
The Equity Incentive Award element will operate in 2018 in exactly the same way as in 2017 and previous years.
The Remuneration Committee will assess what has been achieved by the Executive Directors against the same financial and business objectives used to determine the level of their cash awards.
The Remuneration Committee will assess how the Executive Directors have achieved their objectives by considering the role played by the Executive Directors in establishing an appropriate culture and set of values throughout the organisation.
The level of Equity Incentive Award tobe made will be determined according to the matrix on page 87.
LONG-TERM VARIABLE PAY Performance Share Plan Performance Share Programme 2017 grants Performance share awards granted in 2017 were made to Executive Directors under the Global Share Plan 2010 to a maximum value of 190% ofsalary 95% for target performance.
During 2016, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the operation of the Performance Share Programme and made changes to the performance measures and weightings which were included with the Remuneration Policy and approved at the Annual General Meeting on 6 April 2017.
The four equally weighted performance measures are relative TSR, return on invested capital, sales growth and cumulative free cash flow.
These measures are aligned with our financial priorities and strategies.
Performance will be measured over the three financial years from 1 January 2017 and awards will vest subject to performance and continued employment in 2020.
Sufficient shares will be sold tocover taxation obligations and the Executive Directors will be required to hold the net shares for a further period of two years.
The two equally weighted peer groups against which the Companys TSR performance will be measured are defined at the start of each performance period based on constituents of the following: A sector-based peer group based on those companies classified as the S&P 1200 Global Healthcare subset comprising Medical Devices, equipment and supplies companies official industry classifications of Health Care Equipment and Supplies, Life Sciences Tools & Services and Health Care Technology.
This is a broader sector-based peer group than in previous years, so that we maintain a focus on outperforming our broad sector without being impacted by the volatility of a smaller group.
FTSE 100 constituents excluding financial services and commodities companies.
This is in response to shareholders who assess our performance not based on sector, but instead based on the index we operate in.
The Groups TSR performance and its performance relative to the comparator group is independently monitored and reported to the Remuneration Committee by Willis Towers Watson.
Total Shareholder Return TSR performance is relative to two separate indices as follows: Award vesting as % of salary at date of grant Relative TSR ranking Sector Based Peer Group FTSE100 Peer Group Below median Nil Nil Median 5.9375% 5.9375% Upper quartile or above 23.75% 23.75% Awards will vest on a straight-line basis between these points.
If the Companys TSR performance is below median, none of this part of the award will vest.

The Remuneration Committee will have the discretion to adjust ROIC targets in the case of significant events such as material mergers, acquisitions and disposals and that such adjustment will be consistent with the deal model and approved by the Board at the time of the transaction.

This target however will be disclosed in the 2019 Annual Report, when the Committee will discuss performance against the target.
Cumulative free cash flow is defined as net cash inflow from operating activities, less capital expenditure, less the cash flow input of certain adjusted items.
Free cash flow is the most appropriate measure of cash flow performance because it relates to cash generated to finance additional investments in business opportunities, debt repayments and distribution to shareholders.
This measure includes significant elements of operational financial performance and helps to align Executive Director awards with shareholder value creation.
It is important as it is derived from increased revenues and healthy trading profits.
Having a healthy cash flow will enable us to continue to grow and invest.
25% of the award will be subject to cumulative free cash flow performance and will vest as follows: Cumulative free cash flow Award vesting as % of salary Below $1,482m Nil $1,482m -13% of target 11.875% $1,703m 23.75% $1,924m or more 13% of target 47.5% 90 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2017 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONAL FINANCIAL RISK GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS GROUP AND OTHER & MARKETPLACE REVIEW REVIEW INFORMATION DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued REMUNERATION IMPLEMENTATION REPORT Performance Share Programme 2018 A performance share award will be made in 2018 to Graham Baker under the Global Share Plan 2010 to a maximum value of 190% of salary 95% for target performance.

Vesting of the conditional awards made in 2015 was subject to performance conditions based on TSR, revenue in Emerging Markets and cumulative free cash flow measured over a three-year period commencing 1 January 2015.
25% of the award was based on the Companys TSR relative to a bespoke group of 12 Medical Devices companies.
This group comprised of the following companies: Baxter, Becton Dickinson, Boston Scientific, Coloplast, Conmed, Edwards Life Sciences, Medtronic, NuVasive, Orthofix, Stryker, Wright Medical and Zimmer.
The following companies delisted during the period and were therefore removed: Covidien, C R Bard, Nobel Biocare and St Jude Medical.
Against this peer group, the Companys TSR performance ranked below median meaning that this part of the award therefore vested at 0%.
25% of the award was based on revenues in Emerging Markets.
The threshold set in 2015 was $2,395 million with a target of $2,818 million.
Over the three-year period, the adjusted revenues in Emerging Markets were $2,411 million.
These adjustments include translational foreign exchange and Board-approved M&A.
This part of the award therefore vested at 13% out of the 25% target.
50% of the award was based on cumulative free cash flow performance.
Over the three-year period, the adjusted cumulative free cash flow was $2,024 million which is between target and maximum.
These adjustments include items such as Board-approved M&A, including the acquisition of BlueBelt and Board-approved Business Plans such as the metal-on-metal settlements.
This part of the award therefore vested at 95%.
