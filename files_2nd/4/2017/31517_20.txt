The policy took formal effect from the date of approval and is intended to apply until the 2019 AGM.
Please note that some of the information shown has been updated to take account of the fact that the policy is now approved and enacted rather than proposed.
A full version of the original shareholder approved policy can be found in the Annual Report for the year ended 25 December 2015 available on our website at www.
Overview of Remuneration Policy The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will: Align rewards with the interests of shareholders: Motivate and encourage superior performance: Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy: Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management: and Ensure that the overall package for each Director is linked to strategic objectives of the Group.
The table on pages 60 and 61 summarises the main components of Dignity's ongoing remuneration policy.
Details of how the Committee will implement the policy are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 64.

This resulted in the following required holdings of Ordinary Shares.
Until the guideline is met, the executive is required to retain 50 per cent of shares acquired under the Companys share plans after allowing for tax and national insurance liabilities.
Recovery and withholding provisions apply to variable pay, to enable the Company to recover amounts paid under the annual bonus and LTIP in the event of a restatement of the accounts or an error in calculation leading to an over-payment.
Payments may be recovered for up to two years after payment vesting or two external audit cycles.
The amount to be recovered would generally be the excess payment over the amount which would otherwise be paid, and recovery may be satisfied in a variety of ways, including through the reduction of outstanding deferred awards, reduction of the next bonus or LTIP vesting and seeking a cash repayment.
Annual bonus metrics will be determined at the start of each year, based on the Group's priorities for the coming year.
Measures may include profit such as operating profit, PBT or EPS which is one of the key financial measures of growth.
LTIP performance metrics will be determined at the time of grant and based on the Group's long-term strategy.
Total Shareholder Return is an important benchmark of the success of the business and provides a strong alignment with the returns received by shareholders.
The EPS measure ensures a focus on long-term profitability which the Committee believes is a driver of shareholder value.
The Committee is made aware of pay structures across the wider Group when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary review for the Executive Directors.
An annual bonus plan operates across all employees in the Group and all permanent employees are eligible to participate in the SAYE scheme.
Overall, the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees.
This ensures that there is a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration received by the Executive Directors given it is the Executive Directors who are considered to have the greatest potential to influence Group value creation.
62 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Report on Directors remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 Bonus Plan and LTIP discretions The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and LTIP according to their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
A copy of the LTIP rules is available on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of these plans.
These include but are not limited to the following albeit with the level of award restricted as set out in the policy table on page 61 : Who participates in the plans: The timing of grant of award and or payment: The size of an award and or a payment: Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction: Determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate treatment chosen: Adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends : and The ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose whilst being no less stretching.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the Policy Report, authority was given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed previously to shareholders.
Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors The Company's policy results in a significant portion of remuneration received by Executive Directors being dependent on Company performance.
The graph below illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the Executive Directors for 2018 vary under three performance scenarios: minimum, on-target and maximum.
On-target comprises fixed pay and assumes a bonus of 20 per cent of maximum is paid and 50 per cent of the LTIP vests.
Maximum comprises fixed pay and assumes full bonus payment and LTIP vesting based on the same number of awards as last year and an assumed share price on grant of 825 pence.
No account has been taken of any changes in the Company's share price since the end of the period.
Recruitment and Promotion policy The remuneration package for a new director will be established in accordance with the Company's approved policy subject to such modifications as are set out below.
Salary levels for Executive Directors will be set in accordance with the Company's remuneration policy, taking into account the experience and calibre of the individual and their existing remuneration package.
Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, a series of increases to the desired salary positioning may be made over subsequent years subject to individual performance and development in the role.
Benefits will generally be provided in line with the approved policy, with relocation or other expenses provided for if necessary.
A pension contribution or cash in lieu of up to 15 per cent of salary may be provided.
Minimum On-target Maximum Minimum On-target Maximum Minimum On-target Maximum Overview 01 03 Strategic Report 04 43 Governance 44 74 Financial Statements 75 129 Other Information 130 132 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 63 The structure of variable pay elements will be in accordance with the Company's approved policy detailed above.
The maximum variable pay opportunity will be as set out in the remuneration policy table, being 150 per cent of salary under the annual bonus plan and awards with a face value of 150 per cent of salary under the LTIP.
Different performance measures may be set initially for the annual bonus in the year of joining, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial year that he or she joined the Board.
In the case of external recruitment, if it is necessary to buy out incentive pay or benefit arrangements which would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer, this may be provided, taking into account the form cash or shares, timing and expected value i. e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria of the remuneration being forfeited.
Replacement share awards, if used, may be granted using the Company's existing share plans to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the LSE Listing Rules.
The aim of any such award would be to ensure that as far as possible, the expected value and structure of the award will be no more generous than the amount forfeited.
In the case of an internal recruitment, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms of grant or adjusted as considered desirable to reflect the new role.
Fees for a new chairman or non-executive director will be set in line with the approved policy.
Service contracts and payments for loss of office The Company's policy is to have service contracts for Executive Directors that continue indefinitely unless determined by their notice period.
Under the Executive Directors' service contracts and in line with the policy for new appointments, 12 months' notice of termination of employment is required by either party.
Service contracts are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of two years, subject to annual reappointment at the AGM.
Appointments may be terminated with three months' notice.
The appointment letters for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors provide that no compensation is payable on termination, other than accrued fees and expenses.
In accordance with the terms of the UK Corporate Governance Code all Directors submit themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting each year.
Service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.
For Executive Directors, the Company may in its absolute discretion at any time after notice is served by either party, terminate a Directors contract with immediate effect by paying an amount equal to base salary for the then unexpired period of notice plus the fair value of contractual benefits subject to the deduction of tax.
An Executive Director's service contract may be terminated without notice for certain events such as gross misconduct or a serious breach of contract.
No payment or compensation beyond salary and the value of holiday entitlement accrued up to the date of termination will be made if such an event occurs.
There are no special provisions relating to change of control.
The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations and the Committee ensures that there are no unjustified payments for failure.
Any statutory payments required by law may be made.
External directorships The Group allows Executive Directors to hold a Non-Executive position with one other company or organisation, for which they can retain the fees earned.
Treatment of incentives At the discretion of the Committee, for certain good leaver circumstances such as death, illness, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, their employing company ceasing to be a Group company or the undertaking business or division for which he or she works being sold out of the Company's group, or any other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, a pro-rata bonus may become payable at the normal payment date for the period of employment and based on full year performance.
Should the Committee decide to make a payment in such circumstances, the rationale would be fully disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The treatment of share-based incentives previously granted to an Executive Director will be determined based on the plan rules.
The default treatment will be for outstanding awards to lapse on cessation of employment.
However, an executive will be treated as a 'good leaver' under certain circumstances such as death, illness, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, their employing company ceasing to be a Group company or the undertaking business or division for which he or she works being sold out of the Company's group, or any other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee.
Under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, if treated as a good leaver, awards will normally vest on the original vesting date and will not normally be subject to a pro-rata reduction unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Under the LTIP, if treated as a good leaver, awards will vest at the normal vesting date subject to the extent to which performance targets have been achieved.
The number of LTIP awards that would vest will be reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the three year period actually served.
64 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Report on Directors remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 How shareholder views are taken into account The Remuneration Committee is committed to ensuring an open dialogue with our shareholders and therefore, where changes are being made to the remuneration policy or where there is a material change in which we operate our policy, we will consult with major shareholders in advance.
The Remuneration Committee adopted such an approach in putting together the current policy by consulting the Company's largest shareholders and shareholder advisory bodies beforehand.
In addition, the Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Company does not actively consult with employees on Directors' remuneration.
However, when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of other employees in the Group.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION The Annual Report on Remuneration set out below together with the Remuneration Committee Chairman's Annual Statement will be put to a single advisory shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM.
The information below includes how we intend to operate our policy in 2018 and the pay outcomes in respect of the 2017 financial year.
The information from the single total remuneration figures for Directors on page 66 to the end of the section on loss of office payments on page 69 has been audited.
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2018 Salaries The Committee has determined that the Executive Directors will not receive an increase to base salary for 2018.
This is against a broadly two per cent average increase received by other employees across the workforce.
Therefore, the proposed salaries as at 1 January 2018 are: 2018 2017 Increase % Mike McCollum 511,500 511,500 1 Andrew Davies 326,700 326,700 Richard Portman 247,950 247,950 Steve Whittern 316,200 316,200 1 The amount shown in the table for Andrew Davies is his annualised salary.
Andrew stepped off the Board on 5 January 2018 and will receive his salary and contractual benefits until he ceases to be an employee of the Group on 27 April 2018.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors' fees The fees for 2018 are as detailed below.
The basic fee for serving as Non-Executive Director and the Supplementary Senior Independent Director fee have not been increased from those in 2017.
The Supplementary Audit Committee Chairman fee and Supplementary Remuneration Committee Chairman fee have not been increased either: 2018 2017 Increase % Chairman 173,350 173,350 Basic fee for other Non-Executive Directors 46,850 46,850 Supplementary Senior Independent Director fee 9,700 9,700 Supplementary Audit Committee Chairman fee 9,350 9,350 Supplementary Remuneration Committee Chairman fee 6,300 6,300 Pension and Benefits All Executive Directors will receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 15 per cent of their basic salary.
Benefits will be provided in line with the approved remuneration policy.
Overview 01 03 Strategic Report 04 43 Governance 44 74 Financial Statements 75 129 Other Information 130 132 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 65 Annual bonus For 2018, the maximum bonus potential shall be 135 per cent of salary for the Chief Executive and 125 per cent for the other Executive Directors.
Following careful consideration, the Committee has decided to add strategic objectives to the EBIT measure this year.
Therefore, 70 per cent of the 2018 bonus will continue to be based on EBIT targets and 30 per cent on strategic objectives which are common to all Directors.
Having delivered the market's financial expectation for 2017, the results for 2018 are less certain as we gauge the response to the January 2018 pricing changes announcement.
As a result, the Committee has set a wider EBIT range than in previous years reflecting this greater uncertainty.
The target range is stretching in light of current expectations and a high payout under this part of the bonus would require exceptional performance.
For this year, 20 per cent of the EBIT element will become payable for achieving a demanding target with full bonus payable for achieving a second, more demanding stretch target.
The bonus is payable on a pro-rata basis for performance between the first and second targets.
The EBIT targets themselves are deemed to be commercially sensitive and have not been disclosed prospectively.
However, full retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year's Remuneration Report.
The strategic objectives support the Group's strategy and business model as set out on page 14 of the Annual Report.
Any bonus payable in excess of 100 per cent of salary will be deferred in shares.
The deferred shares will vest after two years subject to continued employment.
Long-term incentives Last year, in line with our policy, Executive Directors received awards with a face value of 150 per cent of base salary.
In determining the award level for 2018, the Committee took account of the fall in share price following the January 2018 pricing announcement and has decided to award the same number of shares as in 2017.
Each 2018 award will therefore be over shares with a value at grant equal to approximately 50 per cent of salary, a significant reduction to our normal policy.
Our recent practice has been to apply two performance conditions, each applying to half of the award relative total shareholder return TSR against a pan-sector group of companies and stretching earnings per share EPS targets.
This balance has served the Company well.
However, the current medium term earnings outlook is uncertain although we expect greater clarity later this year as the response to our pricing strategy changes emerges.
Therefore, the Committee did not feel that robust EPS targets could currently be set.
Instead it is proposed that the whole of the 2018 awards will vest based on absolute TSR.
Full vesting will require performance broadly equivalent to returning the share price to the level it was prior to the 19 January 2018 pricing announcement 1,950 pence, being the three month average to 18 January 2018.
The targets will be as follows: Absolute TSR Equivalent share 1 Absolute TSR estimated price target Vesting Below threshold Less than 81.7% Less than 1,500p 0% Threshold 81.7% 1,500p 25% Maximum 136.3% or higher 1,950p or higher 100% 1 The base price used to calculate TSR will be averaged over the period 19 January 2018 to the dealing day before the date of grant.
The estimated TSR targets are based on the average share price over the period 19 January to 1 March 2018 the last practicable date before the printing of this report.
Because TSR takes account of reinvested dividends, the share prices that must be attained will be lower than in the table if dividends are paid.
The end averaging period will be the last three months of the 2020 financial year.
Vesting between threshold and maximum is determined on a straight line basis.
The Committee may adjust vesting downwards if, acting fairly and reasonably, in its view the outcome does not reflect the underlying performance of the Company.

b The pension benefit is set at 15 per cent of basic salary.
c The bonus relates to performance in the 2016 financial year.
The cash element, being 100 per cent of basic salary, of the bonus awarded for performance relating to 2016 was paid at the end of March 2017.
The remainder of the bonus for 2016: 35 per cent of basic salary in respect of Mike McCollum and 25 per cent of basic salary for the remaining Executive Directors was deferred in shares which have to be held for two years.
Whilst the performance criteria for the 2017 bonus were fully achieved no bonuses were paid.
d The LTIP value relates to the award that was granted 6 March 2015.
The performance period for this award ends on 29 December 2017.
The value shown is calculated by reference to the average share price in the last quarter of the 2017 financial year.
The comparative number is the value of the 2014 LTIP that vested in 2016 restated to reflect the share price which is now known.
e The other remuneration represents the gain on exercise and disposal of SAYE options granted in 2014. f Martin Pexton resigned from the Board on 3 February 2017 so his remuneration is to that date.
Mary McNamara was appointed to the Board on 1 March 2017 and her remuneration as Non-Executive Director is from that date.
Determination of 2017 annual bonus outcome The target for the 2017 annual bonus was based on the achievement of underlying EBIT targets: Target Stretch for which 70% of for which 100% of Bonus payable Weighting maximum payable maximum payable 2017 achieved out of maximum % m m m % EBIT 100 102.4 105.0 104.6 95 The strong performance of the Group during 2017 meant that the EBIT target of 102.4 million was exceeded by 2.2 million 2.1 per cent and the outcome was just below the stretch target.
This resulted in bonuses of 95 per cent of maximum becoming payable.
However the current Executive Directors have decided to waive their full bonuses for 2017 and no bonuses became payable.
The value of those waived bonuses are shown in the table below.

Determination of LTIP awards with performance periods ending in the year Half of the LTIP awards made in 2015 were subject to a relative TSR condition and half subject to EPS, both measured over the three year period which ended on 29 December 2017.
TSR condition TSR relative to FTSE 350 companies Performance required % vesting Below threshold Below median Threshold Median 25 Stretch or above Upper quartile or above 100 Actual achieved Below median EPS condition Performance required % vesting Below threshold Less than RPI 6% p. a.

Underlying EPS increased from 85.8 pence to 128.3 pence, a compound increase of 14 per cent.
Consequently 50 per cent of the 2015 awards are due to vest, subject to continued employment to the vesting date and formal ratification by the Remuneration Committee at the appropriate time.

The actual value will be the value at the vesting date and is likely to be significantly lower.
LTIP awards granted in the year LTIP awards granted in the form of nil cost options to Executive Directors on 16 March 2017 were as follows: Face maximum Number of LTIP value of awards % of award vesting at Executive awards at grant date threshold and maximum Performance period Mike McCollum 31,253 767,250 Threshold: 15% for EPS and 02.01.17 27.12.19 Andrew Davies 19,961 490,050 25% for TSR.

68 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Report on Directors remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 Half of the 2017 award will vest subject to relative TSR measured against the constituents of the FTSE 350 and the other half subject to EPS growth targets.
The performance period for both tranches is measured over the three financial years, 2017-2019.
TSR No part of this award vests if performance is below median, 25 per cent vests for achieving median, with 100 per cent vesting for upper quartile performance with straight line vesting in between.
For this part of the award, no vesting can occur unless the Committee considers that the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory.
EPS No part of this award vests if underlying EPS in 2019 is lower than 136.8 pence, 15 per cent vests for EPS of 136.8 pence, 50 per cent vests for EPS of 144.0 pence with 100 per cent vesting for EPS of 154.8 pence.
Vesting is on a straight line basis for performance in between these points.
Clawback and malus provisions apply and there is a holding period of two years.
Awards will only be released if the Groups comparative TSR performance is equal or greater than the median level of performance over the performance period at which point 25 per cent of the award will be released with full vesting occurring for an upper quartile performance.
Vesting occurs on a straight line basis between these points.
The other half of the awards are based on EPS growth targets.

No payments were made to any past Directors.
Andrew Davies retired from the Board on 5 January 2018 but remains an employee of the Group until 27 April 2018 on the same salary package as when he was a director.
As he was director throughout 2017 he would be eligible to receive the annual bonus for that year but as set out above no bonus became payable.
In addition as he was employed for the full measurement period for the LTIP options granted in March 2015 which are capable of vesting in March 2018 he will be able to exercise his options in full to the extent they are capable of being exercised.
Thereafter he will be able, under the LTIP Rules, to exercise the options granted in 2016 and 2017, to the extent that are capable of vesting based on performance and on a time apportioned basis.
No compensation or termination payment has been made or will be made to Andrew Davies.
