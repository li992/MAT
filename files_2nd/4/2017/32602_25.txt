ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC 79 Directors Remuneration Report Director Remuneration Policy continued 2017 LTIP performance conditions and targets As part of the strategic business review conducted in the year, the Remuneration Committee considered the performance conditions and targets for the 2017 LTIP award to ensure that they aligned with, and supported, the strategic business plan.
Following the findings of this review, the Remuneration Committee is proposing to make the changes set out below for the 2017 LTIP award: To ensure EPS growth is aligned with the strategic plan by introducing an additional performance measure of growth excluding historic claims performance 'Organic EPS' which will govern half of the EPS element of the award.
The existing 'Basic EPS' measure will remain unchanged.
Adjust the weighting of the performance conditions between EPS growth and comparative TSR, to increase the component subject to EPS from 50% to 60% to ensure sufficient focus is provided on the new EPS measure.
The introduction of the Organic EPS measure allows the significant acceleration of growth which is called for over and above that which has been delivered since the IPO to be recognised and targeted.
The Group has worked hard to build and develop the travel business since the IPO to provide a diversified profit stream from a range of products and services in addition to the insurance business.
An assessment of Organic EPS allows the Company to reward and incentivise the Executive Directors and the Executive Team to deliver this step change in growth.
Whilst this growth is also reflected in the Basic EPS, the Committee felt that the material impact of historic insurance claims performance on the outturn dilutes the focus on this key strategic objective of delivering a step change in growth: and therefore, that a separate measure purely focusing on this was required.
The retention of the Basic EPS growth measure ensures that the Executive Directors and Executive Team continue to also be focused on delivering the total performance of the business.
The targets for the two elements of EPS growth are as below: Threshold Maximum EPS measure 25% vesting 100% vesting Basic EPS 5% p. a.
In setting the targets for the Organic EPS performance condition, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the target range against business forecasts and the historic Organic EPS growth of the Group since the IPO.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC 80 Strategic report Governance Financial statements The chart below illustrates the proposed Organic EPS targets for the 2017 award and demonstrates a step change from the historic performance of the Company in line with the Companys strategic ambitions.

3 Under the terms of the Annual Bonus Plan, 20% for each element PBT and cash flow is payable for achieving the threshold performance increasing to 60% for target performance and 100% for achieving maximum performance.
Achievements between these points are calculated on a straight-line basis.
Ogden rate change The Committee considered very carefully whether the Group PBT should be adjusted for the additional 4m increase in insurance claims liabilities required as result of the change in the Ogden rate.
In its discussions, the Committee considered the following: The Committee felt that the provisioning undertaken by the Executive Directors and Executive Team in anticipation of the change to the Ogden rate was to a very high standard: however, the totally unexpected rate announced resulted in a modest increase in the provision by 4m.
Any adjustment would impact bonuses across the wider Executive Team, not just those involved in the insurance business, given Sagas diverse business outside insurance.
The Committee did not believe this was proportionate.
The announcement on 27 February 2017 fell outside the Companys 2016 17 financial year and therefore the Committee felt that this would be a retrospective change to performance targets at a point where the Executive Directors and Executive Team could feel justified in believing that the basis on which bonuses would be paid for the 2016 17 financial year had been determined.
The Committee also considered the shareholder experience following the announcement which has seen the Companys share price rise.
This gave the Committee comfort that shareholders felt that the Company had managed any impact well.
Further, the Company has not changed its dividend payment plans because of the modest increase in the liabilities.
After careful consideration of the above factors the Committee determined to use the Group PBT, excluding the 4m cost of the Ogden rate change, to determine the bonus outcomes.
The following table shows the impact on the level of bonus earned on the Group PBT element with and without adjustment for the additional 4m provision: Amount of bonus earned Group PBT elemet of bonus CEO CFO 1 Underlying profit before tax 369,994 189,741 Profit before tax including Ogden impact 278,233 142,683 Difference 91,761 47,058 Note: 1 Profit before tax excluding derivatives and the Ogden impact.
