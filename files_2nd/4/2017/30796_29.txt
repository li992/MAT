Prior to award, the Committee reviews the performance targets for each measure to ensure they remain sufficiently stretching.
For financial measures this includes a review of analysts forecasts.
PSP awards are subject to malus reduction in the amount of deferred and as yet unpaid compensation and clawback reimbursement of compensation that has already been paid for up to three years following the award, and can be applied during a holding period.
Circumstances that may result in a clawback or malus adjustment include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct.
In relation to PSP awards made prior to 2017, the maximum award under the PSP was 100% of base salary.
From 2017 the maximum award was increased to 150% for the Group Chief Executive and 125% for the other Executive Directors, in accordance with the Remuneration Policy approved at the AGM in 2017.
Vesting is based on two performance conditions measured over a three-year period, which have been chosen as they are aligned with our strategy: TSR relative to a comparator group: and EPS growth.
In addition, a two-year post-vesting holding period applies to PSP awards made from 2017.
PSP awards vesting over 2015-2017 In 2015 the Executive Directors received share awards under the PSP, with vesting subject to EPS growth and relative TSR performance.

In respect of the PSP awards made to Executive Directors in 2017, vesting is dependent on the following TSR and EPS performance measures.
In addition to the three-year vesting period, a two-year holding period applies.
Relative TSR performance 40% of PSP award Performance Payout Threshold TSR equal to median 25% Maximum TSR equal to or higher than the upper quartile 100% For awards made in 2017 the comparator group is the constituents of the FTSE 350 Industrial Goods and Services Supersector at the start of the performance period.
Point-to-point EPS growth 60% of PSP award Performance Payout Threshold Global Industrial Production 2% per annum 25% Maximum Global Industrial Production 8% per annum 100% With effect from 2016, the EPS element of the PSP is based on growth in excess of global industrial production growth rates, often referred to in our industry as Global IP, rather than UK RPI.
Global IP is a measure that the Board and management have used for some time as there is well documented evidence that it is the best predictor of the global and industrial markets within which the Group operates.
For these reasons, Global IP was used in the formulation of the long-term strategic plan and targets for EPS growth approved by the Board.
As a result, the Committee was of the view it made sense to incorporate Global IP into our PSP, as a means of better aligning the assessment of performance against our long-term strategic plan and market dynamics within our industry.
The Committee reviewed the historical and projected data 2007-2020, including the Groups performance, market benchmarks and analysts consensus to determine a performance range associated with this benchmark growth rate that remains sufficiently challenging across various market environments.
Accordingly, threshold vesting will occur for exceeding Global IP by 2% per annum, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for exceeding Global IP by 8% per annum.
The Global IP data source is the CHR Metals Global IP Index, providing data, that incorporates over 90% of global industrial output.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Executive Directors excluding Jay Whalen who is a US citizen are eligible to participate in an HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan known as the ESOP.

Further information is set out in the table on page 95.
The maximum annual investment in shares was increased along with eligible UK employees to the HMRC limit of 1,800 per Executive Director which can be matched by the Company on a one-for-one basis for each share that is purchased by an Executive Director and dividend shares can be reinvested.
No shares acquired under the ESOP are subject to performance measures as the aim of the ESOP is to encourage increased shareholding in the Company by all eligible UK employees.

In 2016 the guidelines were 125% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 100% for the other Executive Directors, over a maximum period of five years from date of appointment to the Board.
Following the approval of the Remuneration Policy at the AGM in May 2017, the share ownership guidelines were increased to 200% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 125% for the other Executive Directors.
This increase applies to the period from 2017.
Executive Directors are expected to achieve the increased maximums within five years.
Progress against the 2016 guidelines and the reset 2017 guidelines is illustrated below.
The value of the shareholding is taken at 29thDecember 2017 as a percentage of 2017 base salary.

Target increased from 100% to 125% with effect from May 2017.
Increased target also applies to other EDs.
In accordance with Policy, Executive Directors must use the part of bonus over 60% of base salary, 75% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive, net of tax, to buy shares until their shareholding guideline has been met.
This is, in effect, a bonus deferral mechanism.
The share ownership guidelines have been met by all Executive Directors excepting Kevin Boyd.
Kevin Boyd has made significant progress since he joined in May 2016 and will use that part of his bonus over 60% of base salary to buy more shares to reach the 2021 and 2022 targets.

1.13 Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors remuneration Operation of the Remuneration Committee in 2017 Membership and attendance Each Committee member is an independent Non-Executive Director and thus brings independence to all aspects of Board remuneration and the application of professional advice to matters relating to remuneration.
During 2017, the Committee was chaired by Jane Kingston and the members comprised: Jamie Pike, Trudy Schoolenberg and CliveWatson.
In 2017, the Committee met three times and, with the exception of Jamie Pike, all members attended each meeting.
Jamie Pike was unable to attend one meeting due to unavoidable absence because of a bereavement, but reviewed all the papers and provided his views in advance to the Committee Chairman.
Advisers to the Committee During 2017, the Committee sought advice and information from Bill Whiteley, the Chairman: Nicholas Anderson, the Group Chief Executive: and Jim Devine, the Group Human Resources Director.
None of the invitees participated in any discussions regarding their own remuneration or fees.
The General Counsel and Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
In addition, the Committee received external advice from Willis Towers Watson, who was appointed by the Committee and provided material advice to the Committee on various matters such as Executive remuneration levels and structure, performance updates in respect of the PSP, the Remuneration Report and attendance at Committee meetings.
Willis Towers Watsons fees in respect of these services totalled 32,000 in 2017.
In addition, Willis Towers Watson work with management on other matters relating to remuneration with the approval of the Committee.
A separate advisory team within Willis Towers Watson provides support and advice to management on pensions and other employee benefitrelated matters.
The Committee is of the opinion that the advice received is objective and independent, given that Willis Towers Watson are a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct, the manner in which advice is delivered and the separate teams that advise management more generally.
In 2017, Baker & McKenzie LLP provided legal advice to the Company which was available to the Committee.
Legal fees relate to advice provided to the Company and not the Committee, and are charged on a time-cost basis.

Additional details and an explanation of the changes can be found in the Statement by the Chairman of the Committee on pages 85 and 86.
Outstanding incentive awards Details of outstanding incentive awards granted to Executive Directors prior to the Policy coming into force, including awards granted in 2016, and details of the performance targets are set out on pages 89 to 92 of the Annual Report on Remuneration 2016.
All incentive awards granted prior to this Policy coming into force will continue on their existing terms including the exercise of discretion to amend such awards.
Remuneration policy for other employees The Companys approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, level of experience, responsibility, individual performance and market pay levels.
The most senior managers in the business approximately 80 people globally participate in bonus arrangements with similar targets, measures and relative weightings to the Executive Directors.
Target and maximum potential values are lower and determined by the grade of the managers role.
Performance targets are based on an appropriate combination of Group, divisional and local operating company financial measures.
Contractual terms and benefits for the wider workforce are subject to local employment legislation and best practice.
Measure selection and the target setting process Measures are selected taking into account the key strategic priorities of the Company, shareholder expectations and factors that sit within an individuals span of control.
Targets are set with reference to internal and external forecasts to ensure that they are realistic, yet sufficiently stretching.
An appropriate mix of long and short-term targets will be used, informed by the nature of the measure.
2.3 External directorships Directors are permitted to hold external directorships in order to broaden their experience, to the benefit of the Company.
Such appointments are subject to approval by the Board and the Director may retain any fees paid in respect of such directorships.
The Board ensures compliance by Directors with Code provision B.
2.4 Approach to recruitment and promotion remuneration When appointing external hires, promoting executives, or an Executive Director internally, the Committee will continue to act in the best interests of shareholders when determining remuneration, in line with the stated policy.
The main elements of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Director appointments are: Base salary will be set on appointment taking into account the factors set out in the Policy table, but also the individuals experience.
Depending on an individuals prior experience, the Committee may set salary below market norms, with the intention that it is realigned over time, typically two to three years, subject to performance in the role.
In this situation, the Committee is permitted to exceed the normal rate of annual salary increase set out in the Policy table.
On-going annual incentive pay opportunity will not exceed 350% of salary, in line with the maximums stated in the Policy table up to 150% of salary for annual bonus and an award of up to 200% of salary under the PSP.
In the year of appointment an off-cycle award under the PSP may be made by the Committee to ensure an immediate alignment of individual interests.
In addition to the standard elements of remuneration, on the appointment of an external candidate, the Committee reserves the right to buy-out incentive awards that the individual has foregone by accepting the appointment, if appropriate.
The terms of such awards would be informed by the amounts being forfeited and the associated terms for example the extent to which the outstanding awards were subject to performance, the vehicles and the associated time horizons.
Awards would be made either through the existing share plans or in accordance with the relevant provisions contained within the Listing Rules.

2.5 Service agreements and termination policy The Companys policy on service agreements and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below.
Service agreements are designed to reflect the interests of the Company, as well as the individual concerned.
Executive Directors service agreements are kept at the Companys headquarters in Cheltenham.
In accordance with the Code and guidelines issued by institutional investors, Executive Directors have service agreements that are terminable by either the Company or the Executive Director on 12 months notice.
In the event of termination or resignation, and subject to business reasons, the Company would not necessarily hold the Executive Director to his or her full notice period.
All Directors are subject to election if newly appointed in the year or re-election at the AGM.
Service agreements set out restrictions on the ability of the Executive Director to participate in businesses competing with those of the Group or to entice or solicit away from the Group any senior employees or to solicit deal with clients of the Group or interfere with supply, in the 12 months following the cessation of employment.
Salary, pension and benefits are included in the agreements and are treated as described in the policy table on pages 100 to 103.
There is no contractual entitlement to payment of an annual bonus or granting of an award under the PSP, until individual participation, level of award, measures and targets have been set for a particular year.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but serve the Company under letters of appointment, for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election at the AGM.
Group Chief Executive and new appointments from 1st January 2013 The details of the service agreements of the Group Chief Executive and for new appointments to the Board are outlined below and comply with best practice.
In the event of a material change in role, function or responsibilities, Executive Directors agreements will be reviewed and will be expected to be updated to meet the requirements outlined below.
Notice period 12 months by the Executive Director and 12 months by the Company Termination No payment if Executive Director commits a repudiatory breach of the service agreement or for gross misconduct or in certain circumstances.
No additional termination payment if notice worked.
If notice only part worked part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice, otherwise 12 months base salary only.
Company discretion to pay in lieu of notice in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control, when a lump sum will be paid.
If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits, excluding long-term incentives, earned in new paid employment in that period.
No automatic entitlement to payments under the annual bonus or PSP.
Robust post-termination restrictions on confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and non-interference with customers or suppliers.
Service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of certain events, such as gross misconduct or financial misstatement.
Clawback or Bonus payments and PSP awards are subject to clawback or malus for up to three years following award.
malus Circumstances include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct.
Executive Directors legacy agreements Within the legacy agreements of Executive Directors, termination of agreements is subject to a 12 month notice period.
Where payment is made in lieu of notice on termination, the payment of a sum in respect of lost future bonus opportunity based on an average of the preceding three years bonus payments is subject to the Committees discretion.
The Committee has the power to reduce the amount to reflect performance on the part of the Executive Director that is considered by the Committee to be unsatisfactory.
On termination of such an Executive Directors service agreement, the Committee will take into account the departing Executive Directors need to mitigate his or her loss when determining the amount of bonus.
Payment will only be made at the discretion of the Committee after taking into account individual performance in order to ensure that there will be no payments for failure.
In any event, payments will be subject to clawback or malus provisions.
Executive Directors service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of certain events, such as termination for gross misconduct or financial misstatement.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 105 Corporate Information Financial Statements Governance Report Strategic Report Governance Report Remuneration Remuneration Policy Report 2017 continued While the Executive Directors service agreements include a provision to deal with termination on a change of control, in the event of an offer being made, shareholders have discretion to accept the offer or not.
The decision to recommend acceptance, or not, is a matter for the Board, and the Committee is of the clear view that the change of control provision within the Executive Directors service agreements would have no influence on the voting pattern of those Executive Directors.
Executive Directors legacy agreements are summarised in the table below.
If notice only part worked part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice.
Otherwise 12 months base salary, the value of other benefits, plus the cost of pension credits or contributions for the period plus the average of the prior three years annual bonus payments, with Committee discretion to reduce the amount of the bonus that would otherwise be calculated, to reflect performance on the part of the Executive Director that is considered by the Committee to be below the required standards, provided that termination by the Company does not occur within 12 months of a change of control.
Committee discretion to pay in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control when a lump sum will be paid.
If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits excluding long-term incentives, earned in new paid employment in that period.
No automatic entitlement to payments under the current annual bonus or PSP.
Treatment of leavers under the incentive plans Whilst it is not an entitlement, it is expected that where an Executive Director is a good leaver ie where the cessation of employment is due to death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company business in which he she works being disposed of or where the ending of employment is instigated by the Company and is not for cause, payments will be made under the annual bonus plan if performance targets are met subject to, and in accordance with, the plan rules.
If the Executive Director is not a good leaver it is expected that no bonus will be paid.
The treatment of leavers under the PSP is determined in accordance with the shareholder approved PSP rules.
Any awards granted within six months prior to termination or the giving or receiving of notice will lapse.
Any awards granted six months or longer prior to termination of employment but prior to the end of the performance period will lapse unless the Executive Director is considered to be a good leaver.
In the case of a good leaver the award will vest on the termination date, or the normal vesting date, at the Committees discretion.
This is subject to the satisfaction of the performance targets at that date and a pro-rata reduction in the number of shares to take account of the shortening of the performance period.
For awards granted on or after 1st March 2012, if the Executive Director is a good leaver where the ending of employment is not for cause, the number of shares vested may be reduced including to zero by the Committee in its absolute discretion.
If an Executive Director ceases employment or notice is given on or after the end of the performance period but prior to the date on which the Committee has determined the extent to which the award has vested, if the Executive Director is a good leaver, his her award will be preserved and will be treated in the same way as if his her employment had continued, whereas if the Executive Director is not a good leaver, his her award will lapse on the earlier of his her cessation of employment and the giving of notice.
In relation to the ESOP, as an HMRC approved plan, where an Executive Director leaves the treatment will be in line with the approved plan rules and HMRC guidance.
Change of control Bonus: if termination occurs within 12 months of a change of control, the Executive Director is entitled to i a lump sum payment in lieu of notice and ii receive a full bonus payment calculated by reference to the average of the preceding three years bonus payments without any reduction for performance.
PSP: the rules provide that in the event of a change of control, outstanding share-based awards will vest to the extent that performance targets are met at the date of the event.
Any such vesting would generally be on a time pro-rated basis.
The Committee may, at its discretion, increase the level of vesting if it believes that exceptional circumstances warrant such treatment.
106 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 Governance Report 2.6 Illustrations of application of the Remuneration Policy Under the Remuneration Policy, a significant portion of remuneration is variable and depends on the Companys performance.
Below and overleaf we illustrate how the total pay opportunity for the Executive Directors varies under three performance scenarios: maximum, on target, and below threshold.
The scenarios for 2017, informed by the current application of our pay policy, are as follows: Element Fixed pay, Fixed pay and ESOP does not vary with performance and comprises: benefits and base salary effective 1st January 2017: ESOP benefits value based on 2016 disclosure: pension value DB 2016: as reported: cash allowance: rate applied to 2017 salary : and ESOP participation of up to 1,500 1:1 matching shares for eligible Executive Directors.

When conducting the annual salary review, the average base salary increase awarded to the UK workforce and senior managers across the Group provides a key reference point when determining levels of increase for Executive Director remuneration.
The Remuneration Policy was drawn up by the Committee without the need for any consultation with employees.
The Committee also determines the principles and policy of remuneration which shall apply to the Groups senior managers.
The responsibility for determining precise compensation packages that meet local practice and performance targets lies with the Group Chief Executive and the responsible Executive Director.
To ensure consistency in Remuneration Policy across the Group and to encourage a performance culture, senior managers participate in the PSP.
The Board believes that share ownership is an effective way of aligning the interests of managers and shareholders and to strengthen the development of the business.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 107 Corporate Information Financial Statements Governance Report Strategic Report Governance Report Remuneration Remuneration Policy Report 2017 continued 2.8 Statement of consideration of shareholder views In developing and reviewing the Companys Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and other senior executives, the Committee seeks and takes into account the range of views of shareholders and institutional shareholder advisers.
The Committee Chairman actively engages with major shareholders and institutional shareholder advisers when appropriate and takes into account their views when reviewing and implementing the Companys Remuneration Policy.
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from institutional shareholder advisers more generally.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during the year at meetings with shareholders, is considered as part of the Companys annual Remuneration Policy review.
At the AGM in 2016, the advisory vote on the 2015 Annual Report on Remuneration received 97.2% in favour.
At the AGM in 2014 the Remuneration Policy received 98.5% in favour.
In finalising the 2017 Remuneration Policy the views of shareholders and institutional shareholder advisers have shaped the: introduction of an additional two-year post-vesting holding period for PSP grants: rebalance of long-term and short-term compensation opportunities by way of the Directors PSP opportunity now being more substantive than the AIP: agreement to disclose AIP targets retrospectively: increase in share ownership requirements: removal of the Committees discretion to grant one-off awards for recruitment or retention in exceptional circumstances: keeping of the PSP performance metrics under review, including the consideration of organic growth measures: and reserving of the Committees right to adjust for the effects of divestments or major acquisitions from the EPS results, to ensure those results are in line with the primarily organic growth principles that support the EPS targets.
