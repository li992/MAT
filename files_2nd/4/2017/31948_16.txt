The total remuneration package links corporate and individual performance with an appropriate balance between shortand long-term elements, and fixed and variable components.
The policy is designed to incentivise executives to meet the Companys key objectives, and so a significant proportion of total remuneration is performance-related.

This structure results in a reported LTIP vesting value every three years with no vesting value in the two intermittent years.
The annualised vesting value calculated by dividing the three-year block LTIP award vesting value by three would be 374,102 for the chief executive and 165,551 for the finance director, making their respective 2016 17 total remunerations, 1,260,246 and 653,290 on an annualised basis.

com | 77 Governance Directors remuneration report continued Base salary Audited Salaries were subject to a review during the year with any increases applying from the salary review date, 1 April 2017.
The Committee was minded to increase executive directors salaries by the general increase of the workforce.
However, the directors requested that they should have no increase and therefore base salaries remain unchanged at 1 April 2017: 1 April 2017 1 April 2016 % change Chief executive 495,000 495,000 Nil Finance director 315,000 315,000 Nil Annual bonus plan Audited The annual bonus plan is structured as a pool funded each year as a percentage of modified profit after tax modified to exclude bonus and LTIP costs with the sharing rate dependent on performance.
Performance is based on the rate of return achieved on opening shareholding funds.
The concept of shareholders funds was introduced in July 2012 using the market value of the Company at the time.
Shareholders funds are inflated annually by the difference between continuing profit after tax and exceptional items for the year and dividends paid to shareholders.
The target rate of return is set at the beginning of each year by the Committee.
For 2016 17 the target rate of return was set at 1 10%, at which point a bonus pool of 2.25% of modified profit after tax is created for the executive directors and other executive committee members.
This pool is then subject to a bonus rate modifier adjusting the pool from 50% to 100%, dependent on performance versus benchmark return on shareholder funds.
Share of bonus pool 1 Performance against target rate of return on shareholders funds of 10% Modifier % of modified profit after tax Greater than 95% 100% 2.25% 90%-95% 85% 1.9125% 80%-90% 70% 1.575% 70%-80% 50% 1.125% Less than 70% 0% 0% The remuneration committee has the discretion to exclude items reported as discontinued or exceptional.
The bonus pool is allocated at the discretion of the Committee with regard to individual, corporate and relative performance.
2016 17 annual cash bonus Audited 1 The annual bonus payment is determined by modified profit after tax PAT for the year ending 30 June 2017, being 63.4m.
This performance resulted in a return on opening shareholders funds ROSF of 8.9%.
As this was between 80%-90% of the 10% target rate of return, a 70% bonus modifier was applied in determining the bonus pool.
1 The bonus pool for 2016 17 was based on a share of modified PAT as follows: 2016 17 bonus pool after deduction 1 Actual vs benchmark 2016 17 modified of employers 1 Actual modified PAT ROSF 10% Modifier Share of PAT PAT and ROSF 2016 17 bonus pool national insurance 63.4m 8.9% 70.0% 2.25% x 70% 1.575% 63.4m 998,000 877,000 1 Actual PAT of 63.1m modified to add back the executive annual bonus pool and deduct the credit arising from revising vesting expectations on the 2014 15 LTIP a net adjustment of 0.3m.
The bonus pool of 0.9m was significantly lower than last years pool of 1.4m, reflecting profit performance during the year.
The Committee carefully reviewed the individual performance of the chief executive and finance director during the year.
The resulting payouts were 36% of the pool for the chief executive and 12% for the finance director, or 63% and 42% of maximum opportunity for the chief executive and finance director respectively.

com | 79 Governance Directors remuneration report continued The remaining 50% of the award was based on a balanced scorecard of non-financial and strategic measures linked to business objectives.
Performance against each objective is shown below: Business objective Strategic measure Performance Building Ranks digital New digital platform in place during the Weighting: 20.4% capabilities course of the 2015 16 financial year Achievement: 20.4% A new digital platform for Mecca and Grosvenor went live at the end of February 2016.
The modules included content management system, player management, cashier, bonus, notifications etc.
The committee perceived the platform to be of a high standard and that it was delivered on time.
Therefore, this objective was met in full.
New and differentiated poker product Weighting: 7.5% Achievement: 3.8% New product from Microgaming successfully implemented with good revenue growth since launch but below the anticipated level.
The Committee therefore decided that 50% of the objective had been achieved.
Creating a multi-channel Single account and wallet functionality Weighting: 33.8% offering by the end of calendar year 2016 Achievement: 0% The single account and wallet will launch in 2017 18, and therefore the Committee decided that the objective had not been achieved.
New retail management systems for Weighting: 11.4% Mecca and Grosvenor Achievement: 5.8% Grosvenor Achievement: 0.0% Mecca The new retail management system for Grosvenor has been successfully deployed but the Mecca system was put on hold.
The Committee decided only the Grosvenor objective had been achieved.
Using technology to Mecca services app Weighting: 5.6% improve efficiency and Achievement: 2.8% customer experience The Mecca services app has been deployed but customer take-up has been lower than expected so the Committee decided to restrict achievement to 50%.
Grosvenor services app Weighting: 5.8% Achievement: 1.9% The Grosvenor services app has been deployed with less functionality than planned and customer take-up has been lower than expected, so the Committee decided to restrict achievement to one-third.
Other strategic imperatives Positive trending proposition from Weighting: 15.5% new-format bingo club Achievement: 3.5% The new format was fully developed and ready to launch but delays in securing sites and planning resulted in the first site not opening until 7 August 2017.
The Committee decided to award 3.5% to reflect the considerable progress made against the objective.
Total max 100% 38.2% Non-financial performance accounted for 50% of the overall vesting, and therefore 19.1% of the award vests.
As well as the financial and non-financial strategic targets outlined above, the Committee considered the Groups average return on capital employed ROCE over the performance period.
The Committee concluded that an average 18% return had been achieved which was in excess of the minimum 15% it had expected.
Therefore, based on the performance set out in the above table, 37.5% of the award will vest in three tranches 45% in December 2017, 30% in December 2018 and 25% in December 2019.
The Committee believes the overall vesting outcome based on performance is a fair reflection of performance over the three-year performance period.

Share ownership guidelines and directors interests in shares Audited Below we set out details of the share ownership guidelines that were in operation until June 2016.
In light of the Companys free float position see page 86, these have been re-suspended until a higher free float position is achieved.
Similarly, the Group had guidelines for executive shareholding which was set as a percentage of base salary and which executives had five years from appointment to build up.
These guidelines were as follows: Chief executive 150% Finance director 100% Other executive committee members 50% Shareholdings of directors of the Company and its subsidiaries are not considered to be in public hands for the purposes of determining the sufficiency of the percentage of shares in public hands the free float in the context of qualification for a listing on the UK Listing Authoritys premium market.
In view of the low level of free float following the completion of Guoco Group Limiteds general offer for Rank in July 2011, the non-executive director quarterly share purchase programme and the shareholding guidelines for executive directors and other members of the executive committee who are directors of Rank subsidiary companies were suspended on 14 December 2011.
The suspension was lifted on 2 March 2015 when free float was comfortably in excess of 25% but was reactivated on 22 June 2016 pending a restoration of the Companys free float to a higher level.
For further information with regard to the Companys free float position, please see page 86.
Subject to achieving a higher free float position, the Committee will review the above percentage guidelines in light of good practice in this area with a view to increasing the guideline to 200% of salary for inclusion in the next remuneration policy.

82 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Dilution limits The LTIP, being the Companys only equity-based incentive plan, incorporates the current Investment Association guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a 10-year period in relation to the Companys issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any 10-year period for executive plans.
The Committee regularly monitors the position and prior to the making of any award considers the effect of potential vesting of awards to ensure that the Company remains within these limits.
Any awards which are required to be satisfied by market-purchased shares are excluded from the calculations.
No treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended 30 June 2017.

Advisers to the committee Unaudited The Committee has access to external information and research on market data and trends from independent consultants.
During the first half of the year Willis Towers Watson were advisors to the Committee and, following a tender process, New Bridge Street NBS, part of Aon plc, were appointed as external remuneration advisors to the Committee.
They have been sole advisors to the Committee since January 2017.
NBS is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and complies with its Code of Conduct which sets out guidelines to ensure that its advice is independent and free of undue influence.
The chief executive, the company secretary, the finance director and the human resources director provided assistance to the Committee during the year.
They attended meetings of the Committee, although none of them was involved in any decision relating to his or her own remuneration.
During the year, the Committee requested NBS to advise on all aspects of Ranks remuneration policy and practice and to review its structures against corporate governance best practice.
NBS also provided the TSR performance graph for the directors remuneration report.
