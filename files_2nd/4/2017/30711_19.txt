STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY Policy Overview This report outlines the Directors Remuneration Policy the Policy, which will be applied by the Hunting Board for the executive and non-executive Directors of the Company effective from 1 January 2018, subject to approval at the AGM.
The revised Policy reflects evolutionary changes consulted on with shareholders towards the end of 2017, including simplification of the Annual Bonus plan through the removal of the personal performance adjustor, and the introduction of best practice features such as Annual Bonus deferral and a holding period on vested HPSP shares.
This revised Policy is to be tabled for approval by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 18 April 2018.
The Policy is designed to comply with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Companies Act 2006 regarding remuneration and to ensure that the Company can attract, retain and motivate talented executive Directors to promote and deliver long-term success for the Group.
The package comprises fixed and variable incentives and is structured to link total reward for both corporate and individual performance.
The remuneration structures of the Chief Executive and Finance Director are based on externally benchmarked data aimed at providing them with competitive levels of remuneration.
The Chief Executives remuneration is benchmarked to global peers who are mostly headquartered in the US, while the Finance Director is benchmarked to UK listed companies of similar size.
Non-executive Director fees are set at levels that take into account the time commitment and responsibilities of each role.
Given the small size of the Hunting Board, each non-executive Director is required to give an above average time commitment to Group matters.
The non-executive Directors do not receive cash bonuses or other variable emoluments.
The fees are benchmarked to other companies of a similar size, profile and profitability and are reviewed annually by the executive Directors.
The Chairmans fee is set by the Remuneration Committee.
The table below provides an overview of each element of the Directors Remuneration Policy.

HUNTING PLC 77 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED Amendments to the Policy The oil and gas industry has historically been a competitive marketplace, therefore recruiting and retaining the right individuals to deliver long-term shareholder growth is a key focus of management and the Remuneration Committee.
It is anticipated that recruitment and retention will remain a challenge for the sector and, therefore, the Committee will continue to keep the approved Policy under review, and will make any necessary revisions after appropriate consultation and approval from shareholders has been received.
Relevance to Employee Pay The Policy tables summarise the remuneration structure that operates within Hunting and which also applies to senior executives of the Group.
While bonus and pension arrangements are in place for most of the Groups employees, lower aggregate remuneration operates at below the executive Director and senior manager level, with total remuneration driven by market comparatives and the individual responsibilities of each role.
Choice of Performance Metrics The corporate strategy includes promoting the long-term success of the Group by investing in its existing products and services portfolio through capital investment or by acquisition and growing the business in a way that is aligned with the evolving global energy industry.
The performance of the executive Directors in executing this strategy is evaluated by the following key performance indicators KPIs, which drive the variable components of the executive Directors emoluments.
KPI Element of remuneration Reason for use Underlying Profit before Taxation Annual Bonus PBT is a management KPI used to measure the underlying performance of the Group.
PBT reflects the achievements of the Group in a given financial year and recognises sustained profitability measured against an agreed Annual Budget.
Underlying Return on Capital Annual Bonus ROCE is a management KPI used to measure the longerEmployed HPSP term performance of the Group.
ROCE reflects the value created on funds invested in the short and medium term.
Total Shareholder Return HPSP Reflects the Groups long-term goal to achieve sustained levels of shareholder return.
Underlying Earnings Per Share HPSP To encourage sustained levels of earnings growth over the long term.
Personal Strategic Objectives Annual Bonus To capture and incentivise delivery of key strategic HPSP milestones that contribute to long-term success.
The HPSP performance conditions and growth targets can be amended by the Remuneration Committee, with the targets set annually when each award is granted, following an assessment of the growth prospects of the Group.
Taken together, the Committee believes that the executive Directors are appropriately incentivised to deliver both shortand long-term performance based on these metrics.
Remuneration Committee Discretion The Committee has defined areas of discretion within the Directors Policy framework.
Where discretion is applied, the Committee will disclose the rationale for the application of discretion.
The Committee will operate the Annual Bonus plan and HPSP in accordance with the relevant plan rules and this Policy.
The Committee retains discretion as to the operation and administration of these plans as follows: Annual Bonus Discretion to adjust the amount of any bonus to reflect any fact or circumstance that the Committee considers to be relevant, and to ensure that the outcome is a fair reflection of performance.
The assessment of part-year performance in the event of the exit of a Director, including but not limited to, reviewing forecast financial performance of the Group and the outlook of the business in the context of wider market conditions.
Bonus awards for good leavers will generally be pro-rated for the proportion of the performance period completed.
The Committee may apply discretion to vary the percentage of an award settled in cash or shares.
HUNTING PLC 78 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION HPSP Selection of the TSR comparator group for the HPSP.
The Committee reviews the comparator group annually ahead of each grant made to the executive Directors under the HPSP.
The Committee also retains the discretion to make adjustments to the comparator group for subsisting awards if it believes that a constituent of the comparator group has distorted the vesting outcome if, for example, a constituent company has been subject to a material corporate action.
The Committee may amend the performance conditions applying to an award in exceptional circumstances if the new performance conditions are considered fair and reasonable, and are neither materially more nor materially less challenging than the original performance conditions when set.
The oil and gas industry is a highly cyclical industry, where sentiment is driven by oil and gas commodity prices and activity levels across the industry.
Given that these market conditions are outside managements control, the Committee retains the discretion to partially adjust the performance targets of the performance conditions adopted for the HPSP, to align with the general market outlook, while continuing to be a demanding and stretching incentive.
Any upward discretion would be subject to prior shareholder consultation.
Other The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments that are not in line with the Policy outlined above where the terms of the payment were agreed either: before the Policy came into effect: or at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
Detailed Policy Base Salaries and Fees Base salaries and fees are reviewed annually.
In considering appropriate salary levels for the executive Directors, the Committee takes into account their experience and personal performance, the remuneration paid by comparable companies in terms of asset size, revenues, profits, number of employees, market capitalisation and the complexity and international spread of Group operations, as well as Group-wide salary increases and applicable rates of inflation.
Other relocation and taxation agreements are also in place for key executives.
Base fee increases for the non-executive Directors are based on benchmarked market data for fees paid by comparable companies.
Benefits Other benefits provided to the executive Directors as part of their remuneration package include the provision of appropriate healthcare insurance, life and disability insurance, car and fuel benefits.
Pension The Group contributes to the pension arrangements of both the Chief Executive and Finance Director.
Being a US-based citizen, Jim Johnson participates in the Groups US 401K deferred savings plan.
In addition, the Group contributes to a deferred compensation scheme.
In practice, this compensation scheme is operated on a money purchase basis.
Peter Rose is a member of the Defined Benefit Section DB Section of the Hunting Pension Scheme the Scheme.
On 30 June 2016, the DB Section was closed to future accrual, with all members benefits fixed at that date.
To compensate Peter Rose for this loss of benefit, a cash sum in lieu of a Company contribution to an alternative pension scheme has been agreed by the Remuneration Committee, to a value of 25% of his annual base salary.
Richard Hunting, as a beneficiary of the Scheme, is not impacted by the closure of the Scheme to future accrual.
Under the terms of the DB Section, the normal retirement age for Directors in the Scheme is 60.
Mr Rose is able to draw his pension on an unreduced basis with the consent of the Company.
Pensionable salary is the annual salary less an amount equal to the State Lower Earnings Limit.
Richard Hunting contributed 8.5% of his pensionable salary up until his Scheme retirement date of 31 July 2006.
Peter Rose contributed a similar proportion of his salary up until 30 June 2016.
Scheme members are also provided with a lump sum death-in-service benefit of four times base salary and a spouses pension of broadly two-thirds of the members pension on the members death.
Bonuses and benefits do not qualify as pensionable salary.
Annual Bonus An Annual Bonus plan is in place for the executive Directors, which was adopted by the Board in 2010.
The plan, which is not pensionable, is designed to provide an incentive reward for performance and reflects the competitive markets in which the Group conducts its business.
As part of the revised policy, the Committee is proposing to simplify the structure of the Annual Bonus going forward by removing the personal performance adjustor.
80% of the Annual Bonus will continue to be based on financial measures, with the remainder based on Personal Strategic performance measures.
These will be selected annually by the Remuneration Committee to reflect key performance indicators for the year ahead.
75% of any Annual Bonus award will continue to be paid in cash.
25% of the Annual Bonus award will be paid in Hunting shares and are required to be held by the executive Director for a period of two years, from the end of the relevant financial period.
HUNTING PLC 79 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED Long-term Performance Related Incentives Between 2001 and 2013 the Group granted awards to the executive Directors under three long-term incentive plans, including an Executive Share Option Plan ESOP between 2001 and 2008, a Performance Share Plan PSP between 2009 and 2013, and a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP between 2004 and 2013.
The executive Directors still hold vested share options under the ESOP, as detailed in the table on page 89.
HPSP The HPSP was approved by shareholders in April 2014.
Share awards granted to the executive Directors under the HPSP have been based on three equally-weighted performance conditions: Total Shareholder Return, Earnings per Share and Return on Capital Employed.
For 2018 awards, it is intended that these measures be supplemented with an additional measure based on a Strategic Scorecard.
All performance conditions are measured at the end of the relevant three-year performance period and awards to the executive Directors will be proportional to the total vesting level achieved.
Subject to the achievement of performance conditions, awards will typically vest and be released to a participant on the third anniversary of the grant.
For 2018 awards onwards, vested shares will be subject to an additional two-year holding period subject to settlement of any tax charges on vesting.
The current face value of the grant to the Chief Executive is 450% of base salary and 210% of base salary for the Finance Director.
A cash sum equivalent to dividends paid by the Company during the vesting period is added to the awards once the final vesting levels have been determined.
Stock Ownership Policy The Company operates a stock ownership policy whereby the Directors and senior managers are required to build and maintain a minimum shareholding in the Companys Ordinary shares.
For executive Directors, the primary mechanism of building the required shareholding is retaining vested shares received from the deferred element of the Annual Bonus and from long-term incentive schemes operated by Hunting.
Those subject to this requirement have a period of five years from 1 January 2014 or, for new appointees, from the date of employment by Hunting, to comply.
The Chief Executive is required to maintain a minimum holding of shares equal to a market value of 500% of base salary, the Finance Director a minimum holding of 200% of base salary and the non-executive Directors a minimum holding of 100% of annual fees.
Certain executives of the Group are required to build and maintain a minimum holding of shares in the Company equal to a market value of between 100% and 200% of base salary.
The value of holdings in shares reported in the Annual Report on Remuneration includes Ordinary shares held by the individual and also the post-tax value of vested, but unexercised, share awards and options.
Executive Director Service Contracts All existing executive Directors Service Contracts are rolling one-year agreements and contain standard provisions allowing the Company to terminate summarily for cause, such as gross misconduct.
Jim Johnson entered into a Service Agreement with the Company on 7 December 2017.
Under the terms of the Service Agreement both the Company and the Director are required to give one years notice of termination.
Mr Johnson is entitled to receive a Performance Bonus, on an annual basis, the quantum being determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Mr Johnson is also entitled to participate in the Hunting Performance Share Plan and any other long-term incentive schemes operated by the Company.
Under the terms of the Service Agreement, Mr Johnsons benefits include the provision of a company car with fuel, participation in long-term disability and healthcare insurance programmes offered by the Company and also participation in pension schemes operated by the Company.
Following a change of control, in line with standard UK practice, all stock options and stock-based awards granted will be tested for performance and pro-rated for time unless the Committee, acting and fairly, decides otherwise.
The Finance Director entered into a Service Agreement with the Company on 23 April 2008.
The Company reserves the right to pay Peter Rose in lieu of notice whether given by the Company or by him, which provides for the payment of base salary up to a maximum of one year and a bonus, which he would have been entitled to receive under his contract between the date of termination and the earliest date the appointment could otherwise be lawfully terminated, less income tax and National Insurance Contributions.
The Company also has the option to put Peter Rose on paid leave of absence following payment of a sum equivalent to his salary and bonus based on the previous 12 month period, subject to him complying with the terms of his Service Agreement.
These conditions also apply on termination following a change of control and, in addition, Peter Rose would be entitled to an acceleration of all sharebased awards, which would immediately vest at the date of the change of control.
Non-executive Director Letters of Appointment On appointment, each non-executive Director is provided with a letter of appointment that sets out the responsibilities and time commitments for the role.
Additional duties, as requested by the Nomination Committee, including chairing a Board subcommittee, are also incorporated into the letters of appointment and fees paid.
Non-executive Director appointments are usually for a fixed three-year term, which can be terminated by either party at any time.
HUNTING PLC 80 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION External Board Appointments The Company may authorise an executive Director to undertake a non-executive directorship outside of the Group provided it does not interfere with their primary duties.
During the year neither executive Director held any external positions.
Payment for Loss of Office The Committee has considered the Companys policy on remuneration for executive Directors leaving the Company and is committed to applying an approach consistent with best practice to ensure that the Company pays no more than is necessary.
In line with normal market practice, the policy distinguishes between good leavers and bad leavers.
A good leaver is defined as an employee who has ceased to be employed by the Group due to death, ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, the employees company ceasing to be a Group member or for any other reason if the Committee so decides.
In the case of a good leaver, taking account of local conditions, the policy normally allows: payment in lieu of notice equal to 12 months base salary, pension contributions, contractual benefits and any other legal entitlements: payment of a bonus for the period worked subject to the achievement of the relevant performance conditions: and any unvested long-term incentives vest at the normal time subject to the achievement of the relevant performance conditions, and pro-rated based on the period of service as a proportion of the vesting period.
If an employee departs the Group for any other reason than those specified in the good leaver definition above then he she is treated as a bad leaver and unvested long-term incentives lapse immediately on cessation of employment.
The Committee retains discretion to satisfy bonus payments to those executive Directors deemed to be bad leavers.
The loss of office payment policy is subject to pre-existing Service Contract agreements that pre-date June 2012, which the Remuneration Committee will honour.
New Director Policies As the Board of Hunting is refreshed with new executive and non-executive Director appointments, the policy for remuneration for the new Board members will align with those detailed above.
Hunting needs to be able to attract and retain the best executive and non-executive Directors in the market place.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the proposed policy will enable the Company to achieve its recruitment aims.
For executive Director appointments, the fixed component of total emoluments will target the market mid-point, subject to geographic considerations of the candidate and the specific labour market conditions.
Where new appointees have initial basic salaries set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period of two to three years, subject to the individuals development and performance in the role.
The Service Contracts will be rolling one-year agreements with standard provisions.
The fixed component of the emoluments will comprise base salary, including any appropriate relocation or tax equalisation agreements, benefits including healthcare insurance, pension contributions, car benefits and any other components deemed necessary to secure an appointment.
The variable component to the emoluments will be implemented in line with the policies above, subject to any future amendments to these arrangements being approved by shareholders.
Annual performance-linked cash bonus arrangements will include awards up to 150% and 200% of base salary for a new Finance Director and Chief Executive respectively.
The maximum awards under the HPSP will be up to 450% and 550% of base salary for a new Finance Director and Chief Executive respectively.
The Committee anticipates applying UK market standard change of control provisions within new Service Contracts.
In addition, for new appointees, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and shareholders.
Any such payments would take account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would be structured to reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
For non-executive Director appointments, the benchmarked fees to companies of similar size and profile to Hunting will be applied.
Consideration of Employment Conditions Elsewhere in the Group The Committee considers the general basic salary increases for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary increases for the executive Directors.
Employees have not been consulted in respect of the design of the Companys senior executive remuneration policy.
Shareholder Consultation and Feedback When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into account views of leading shareholders and best practice guidelines issued by institutional shareholder bodies.
As part of the investor consultation for the new Policy to be tabled for approval, shareholder feedback was incorporated in to the revised Policy, which included increasing the weighting of ROCE in the Hunting Performance Share Plan and reducing the weighting of the Balanced Scorecard.
Following the appointment of Jim Johnson, the Committee reviewed the Remuneration Policy in 2017 and undertook a detailed consultation with major shareholders on the proposed changes outlined above.
HUNTING PLC 81 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED More generally, the Committee is always open to feedback from shareholders on remuneration policy and arrangements, and commits to undergoing consultation with leading shareholders in advance of any significant future changes to remuneration policy.
The Committee will continue to monitor trends and developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the structure of executive remuneration remains appropriate.
Remuneration Scenarios for Executive Directors The remuneration scenarios of the executive Directors for a fixed, target and maximum performance are presented in the charts below.
Potential reward opportunities are based on Huntings Remuneration Policy, applied to annualised 2017 remuneration data.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE FINANCE DIRECTOR Maximum 15% 26% 59% $5,361k Maximum 29% 30% 41% $2,053k Target 26% 23% 51% $3,086k Target 44% 23% 33% $1,320k Fixed 100% $811k Fixed 100% $588k Fixed Annual Bonus HPSP Note: These charts are indicative as share price movement and dividend accruals have been excluded.
Assumptions made for each scenario are as follows: Fixed: latest salary, benefits and normal pension contributions or payments in lieu of pension contributions.
Target: fixed remuneration plus half of maximum annual cash bonus opportunity plus 50% vesting of awards under the HPSP.
Maximum: fixed remuneration plus maximum annual cash bonus opportunity plus 100% vesting of all long-term incentives.
The Finance Director is paid in Sterling and the equivalent total remuneration scenarios are as follows fixed 456k: target 1,025k and maximum 1,594k.

Jim Johnson was appointed Chief Executive from 1 September 2017, with an annual base salary of $700,000.
Dennis Proctor stepped down as a Director on the same date.
In addition, in June 2017, Mr Roses base salary was increased to 316,050 $406,978 with effect from 1 January 2017 in line with salary increases implemented across the Group.
The average :$ exchange rate in the year was 1.2877 2016 1.3554. ii.
Benefits include the provision of healthcare insurance, a company car and fuel benefits.
Jim Johnsons and Dennis Proctors single figure pension remuneration represents Company contributions payable to their US pension arrangements.
Peter Roses pension figure represents a cash sum in lieu of company pension contribution, which is set at 25% of his annual base salary and an additional $46,368, reflecting an accrued benefit in respect of his UK Defined Benefit pension arrangements.
No employer contributions were made in 2017 to Mr Roses Defined Benefit arrangements.
In 2016, Mr Roses pension contributions were a combination of these arrangements.
As noted in the Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, given the return to underlying profitability and a positive return on capital employed, the Remuneration Committee revised the targets applicable to the Annual Bonus plan in H2 2017.
Given the strong performance of the Company against this revised target, particularly in the final months of the year, the revised bonus targets were exceeded, leading to maximum bonus payments being made to the executive Directors.
Jim Johnson received $466,690, reflecting his period of service as Chief Executive from 1 September 2017 and Peter Rose received $610,466.
Dennis Proctors bonus reflects a maximum payout, pro-rated for his period of service to 1 September 2017, totalling $1,047,467.
v. There were no annual bonus awards made to the executive Directors during 2016. vi.
The 2015 awards under the HPSP had a three-year performance period to 31 December 2017.
The awards were measured on this date against the performance conditions, with a nil vesting recorded for the EPS and ROCE performance metrics.
The TSR performance condition was measured by Kepler in line with the HPSP rules, which resulted in a 49% vesting of this portion of the award granted.
On this basis, Jim Johnson will receive 24,733 shares: Peter Rose will receive 17,234 shares and Dennis Proctor will receive 47,579 shares.
For the purposes of the single figure calculation, the average mid-market closing price of 5.22 during Q4 2017 has been applied to the number of vested shares and coverted to $ using the average :$ exchange during Q4 2017, being $1.3276.
Further, a cash payment equalling the dividends paid during the vesting period has been added to the single figure calculation, totalling 30.9 cents per vested share.
The vesting date of the 2015 award is 28 April 2018, when the final values of the awards will be determined.
The value of Jim Johnsons 2015 HPSP award included in the single figure table has been pro-rated for his time as an executive Director being 1 September 2017 to the date of vesting.
The gross value of Jim Johnsons award as at 29 December 2017 was $179,043.
The 2014 awards under the HPSP had a three-year performance period to 31 December 2016.
The awards were measured on this date against the performance conditions, with a nil vesting recorded.
No payments were therefore made to the executive Directors.
This result has led to a restatement of the 2016 table.
Following Dennis Proctors retirement from the Group on 1 September 2017, a payment of $1,688,350 was made reflecting a payment in lieu of notice and other legal entitlements due under US employment law.
Jay Glick was appointed Company Chairman on 1 September 2017 with his annual fee increasing to 175,000 $225,348 from this date.
Mr Glick does not receive any additional fee for chairing the Nomination Committee.

John Hofmeister receives additional fees as Senior Independent Director and as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
John Nicholas receives an additional fee as Chairman of the Audit Committee.

The Company contributes to Mr Johnsons pension arrangements, including a money purchase arrangement and to his US 401K deferred savings plan.
He receives standard benefits including the provision of a car with fuel and also participation in a US healthcare plan.

In addition, in June 2017, Mr Roses base salary was increased by 5% to 316,050 $406,978 with effect from 1 January 2017, in line with the base salary increases implemented across the wider workforce of the Group.

HUNTING PLC 85 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED Pensions audited Jim Johnson and Dennis Proctor are members of a deferred compensation scheme in the US, which is anticipated to provide a lump sum on retirement.
They also contribute to the US 401K deferred saving plan.
Messrs Johnsons and Proctors company contributions to the former arrangement were $42,001 2016 $nil and $104,070 2016 $65,802 respectively in the year.
There are no additional benefits provided on early retirement from this arrangement.
In the year, the Group contributed to Mr Proctors US 401K deferred saving plan, totalling $16,200 2016 $15,900.
During 2017, the Company paid a cash sum in lieu of a pension contribution to Peter Rose totalling $101,485 78,811 representing 25% of his annual base salary.
An additional $46,357 36,000 has been added to reflect an accrued benefit in relation to his final salary arrangements.
In 2016, Peter Roses pension arrangements were amended following the decision by the Group to cease contributions to the defined benefit section of the Hunting Pension Scheme the Scheme operated in the UK.
As a member of the Scheme, Mr Rose contributed to the Pension Scheme up to 30 June 2016, the date on which all Group contributions also ceased.
Mr Roses 2016 single figure pension contribution noted on page 84 reflects the Groups net increase to the accruals of the Scheme, multiplied by the HMRC multiple of 20, totalling $193,822, with his cash lump sum of $50,489 added to this figure, reflecting contributions received in lieu of a pension contribution.
Mr Roses accrued defined benefit pension as at 31 December 2017 amounted to $170,000 p. a.
He is able to retire on 24 October 2018 age 60, his normal retirement age in that scheme, without any reduction on his main scheme benefits although there is a small part of his pension that is payable only from age 62 without reduction.
With Company consent, Peter Rose is able to retire now without any actuarial reduction for early retirement applied to his accrued pension.
Annual Performance-Linked Cash Bonus Plan audited The annual performance-linked cash bonus plan entitles the executive Directors to cash bonus payments when the actual financial results of the Group achieve pre-set financial targets based on the Groups Annual Budget.
The bonus has the potential to be adjusted to reflect the delivery of personal performance targets.
The approved 2017 Annual Budget reflected the prevailing market conditions across the energy sector in Q4 2016, with the 2017 targets being set at an underlying loss before tax of $24.5m and a ROCE of negative 2%.
Given the strong performance of the Group in the final months of 2017, actual results delivered an underlying profit before tax of $10.9m and a positive ROCE of 1.1%.
On this basis the conventional method of calculation by comparing actual results to the Annual Budget could not be used to determine the bonus earned.
The conventional method operates on a sliding scale with the bonus accruing when 80% of the Budget is achieved, rising to a maximum when 120% of Budget has been achieved.
Comparing a positive actual result to a negative Budget projection fails to work arithmetically.
Accordingly, the Committee exercising its discretion agreed in H2 2017 revised pre-set profit before tax and return on capital employed target ranges to be used to calculate the executive Director bonuses.
The Committee set the following target ranges for the Annual Performance Link Cash Bonus as follows: Threshold Maximum Actual result Resultant target target 2017 bonus Underlying PBT 70% $nil $5.0m $10.9m 100% Underlying ROCE 30% 0% 1.0% 1.1% 100% Applying these target ranges results in a maximum bonus payment to the executive Directors, leading to a cash bonus of $466,690 to Jim Johnson: $610,466 to Peter Rose and $1,047,467 to Dennis Proctor.
The amounts payable to Messrs Johnson and Proctor have been pro-rated for their term in office as Chief Executive.
In January 2017, the Committee set personal performance targets for each executive Director.
The targets and outcome, including the personal performance adjustor applied to the bonus, of each executive Director are summarised below: Description of target Assessment and outcome Strategic Planning The Committee reviewed the delivery of the 2017 personal performance objectives by Dynamic Leadership in a Volatile Period the executive Directors and agreed that each Target had been delivered.
In particular Succession Chief Executive only the Committee noted the strong leadership by the executive Directors as Huntings core Organisational Effectiveness Finance markets improved.
Based on this outcome, a factor of 1.0x has been applied.
Director only Following application of the personal performance targets for each executive Director, the bonus payments to the executives are unchanged for 2017.
The 2016 actual results failed to meet the annual budgeted underlying PBT and ROCE targets, resulting in no bonus payments to the executive Directors.
2015 HPSP Vesting audited On 31 December 2017, the 2015 awards under the HPSP were measured against the performance conditions following completion of the three-year performance period.
The performance metrics are noted on page 78 and include: underlying diluted EPS: underlying ROCE: and relative TSR against a comparator group of 32 companies.
A summary of the three-year EPS and ROCE performance is detailed below: 2014 Reported three-year Required threshold % Vesting Base year 2015 2016 2017 performance vesting target outcome Underlying diluted EPS 100.0c 3.1c -45.3c 7.6c Negative 6.0% Nil Underlying ROCE 13.1% 1.1% -7.7% 1.1% Average -1.8% 12.0% Nil HUNTING PLC 86 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION The Total Shareholder Return performance condition, as set out in the award was measured by Kepler in January 2018, following completion of the three-year performance period.
Huntings TSR performance against the 32 comparator companies was then ranked, resulting in an above median position.
On this basis, 49% of the TSR portion of the 2015 HPSP award will vest on 28 April 2018, with Mr Johnson receiving 24,733 shares: Peter Rose receiving 17,234 shares and Dennis Proctor receiving 47,579 shares.
A cash equivalent of dividends paid by the Company during the vesting period, totalling 30.9 cents per vested share, will be added to the award on the vesting date.
The 2015 HPSP vesting has been calculated as follows: Value of vested Value of dividends shares at at 30.9 cents No.
The gross value of the award is noted in the table above.
Dennis Proctors vested shares reflect a pro-rating of his original award following his retirement on 1 September 2017.
Final award values will be determined on 28 April 2018, being the vesting date of the 2015 award, and will be reported in the 2018 Annual Report on Remuneration.
2014 HPSP Vesting audited On 31 December 2016, the 2014 awards under the HPSP were measured against the performance conditions following completion of the three-year performance period.
The performance metrics are noted on page 78 and include: underlying diluted EPS: underlying ROCE: and relative TSR against a comparator group of 38 companies.
A summary of the three-year EPS and ROCE performance is detailed below: 2013 Reported three-year Required threshold % Vesting Base year 2014 2015 2016 performance vesting target outcome Underlying diluted EPS 94.5c 100.0c 3.1c -45.3c Negative 6.0% Nil Underlying ROCE 12.3% 13.1% 1.1% -7.7% Average 2.2% 12.0% Nil Huntings relative TSR performance was below median and accordingly none of the awards under the 2014 grant vested to the executive Directors, with all awards duly lapsing on the 1 May 2017, being the vesting date of the award.
2017 HPSP Grant audited On 3 March 2017, the Committee approved the allocation of nil-cost share awards to Jim Johnson and Dennis Proctor and nil-cost options to Peter Rose under the rules of the HPSP.
Awards will vest on 3 March 2020, subject to the achievement of the performance metrics detailed on page 78 of the Policy.
Details of the grant are as follows: Face value Number of of award Face value of shares at threshold maximum award Award as % of under vesting of 25% vesting at 100% Director base salary grant $ $ i Jim Johnson 300% 223,533 370,905 1,483,620 ii Dennis Proctor 450% 86,970 144,308 577,232 Peter Rose 210% 115,889 192,293 769,172 i. Mr Johnsons HPSP grant reflects his role as Chief Operating Officer, prior to his appointment as Chief Executive.
As noted in the Company announcement of 1 September 2017, Mr Proctors HPSP grant was pro-rated for his period of service.
Given the loss making position of the Group in 2016, the Remuneration Committee adopted absolute EPS and ROCE targets for the grants to the executive Directors in 2017.
The targets for each performance condition are as follows: Performance condition Threshold vesting target Maximum vesting target TSR Median Upper Quartile i EPS 40 cents 60 cents i ROCE 8% 15% i.
