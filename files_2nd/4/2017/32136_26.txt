Figure 18 below summarises the award made to each of the executive directors in December 2016.
The maximum award permitted under the Plan is 300% of salary although the Committee typically makes awards of 250% of salary to executive directors.
For 2016 17, awards of 225% of salary were awarded to all executive directors.
In approving this award level, the Committee noted that award levels for executives have typically been 250% of salary.
Upon discussion, the Committee decided that, in recognition of the rebased financial plan and associated PSP performance measures, lower awards were appropriate for this particular grant only.
In line with the Remuneration Policy, awards to executive directors will vest on 5 December 2019, three years after the date of grant, to the extent that the performance conditions are met.
