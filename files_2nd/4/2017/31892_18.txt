Our business Strategic review Business review Governance Financial information Annual Report and 63 Financial Statements 2017 2017 Annual bonus outcome For the financial year to 30 June 2017, the annual bonus measures, targets and performance against those targets are set out in the table below.
Senior management was subject to similar targets, which were applied to their respective divisional or business unit performance.
The bonus outcome was subject to a scale back if certain non-financial targets in relation to health and safety were not achieved.
Performance target Threshold On-target Maximum % of maximum % of maximum % of maximum Actual Payout % of Measure bonus bonus bonus performance bonus maximum Group targets 2 Pre-exceptional full year Group profit before tax 150m 0% 155.8m 25% 161.67m 50% 157.0m 0% Pre-exceptional half year Group profit before tax 52.5m 0% 54.6m 5% 56.6m 10% 63.0m 10% 1 Group cash management 24% 24% 40% 36.3% 36.3% Total payout % of maximum bonus 24% 54% 100% 46.3% 1 Cash management related to monthly month end cash debt figures in accordance with a predetermined cash budget schedule.
2% is earned based on the month end cash figures in accordance with the budget with a further 1% at each month end except for June and December when 3% could be earned for meeting the stretch target being 10% improvement on cash budget with a further increment in December 2016 and June 2017.
The average monthly month end target was 261.47 million net debt compared to an achieved average of 239.78 million.
2 Actual performance refers to a notional profit before tax figure of 157.0 million, being the sum of reported profits before tax of 58.7 million and 98.3 million, being the one-off charge relating to legacy contracts announced in May 2017.
The Committee considered the performance against targets set at the start of the year for profit before tax and cash flow, and looked at a broader assessment of management, the key strategic decisions taken during the year and overall business performance.
While the full year pre-exceptional profit before tax targets were partially achieved during the year, the Committee considered the impact of the 98.3 million one-off charge resulting from the write down of legacy contracts in the year as announced by the Company on 3 May 2017.
Reflecting the significant reduction to the statutory profit outcome this year, the Committee felt it was appropriate to use its discretion to adjust the full year profit before tax element of the bonus downwards and therefore there will be nil payout under this element of the bonus scheme.
The half year profit target and actual profit performance were not impacted by the one-off charge and will payout in full.
The month end cash balances were above target for each month and in most cases exceeded the stretch target of 10% improvement.
As a result of this strong cash performance over the course of the entire year, the total bonus payable for the year was 46.3% of maximum.
A health and safety bonus deductor was also considered, based on a health and safety matrix in force across the entire Group that could reduce bonus by specified percentages relating to the number of accidents, incidents and other reportable events.
The Committee decided that these targets were met to the extent shown in the table above and has decided to revisit health and safety performance in the year ending 30 June 2018, following the outcome of the investigations into the two fatalities which occurred in the year.
The Committee determined that in respect of the year to 30 June 2017, the resulting annual bonus awards were as follows: Actual bonus payable for On-target bonus Maximum bonus 2016 17 Cash Shares % of salary % of salary 000 000 000 Peter Truscott 81 150 357 291 66 Graham Prothero 54 100 179 179 1 Ken Gillespie 54 100 15 15 1 Ken Gillespie stepped down from the Board on 31 July 2016 and retired on 28 February 2017.
The above value reflects the bonus earned as an executive director for the one month period of the year.
Two-thirds of the bonus earned in excess of the 50% of salary threshold is required to be deferred into restricted shares.
Although beneficially held by the participants, the allocated restricted shares are legally retained by the EST for a period of three years, and are subject to forfeiture provisions, unless otherwise agreed by the Committee.
Subject to continued employment, the restricted shares are legally transferred to participants on the third anniversary of allocation.
LTIP awards vesting in September 2017 The LTIP awards granted to Peter Truscott on 21 October 2015, which was a replacement award for forfeiting Taylor Wimpey plc long-term performance awards, and to Graham Prothero, Greg Fitzgerald and Ken Gillespie on 30 September 2014 were based on TSR and EPS performance over the three years to 30 June 2017.
50% of the base award was based on EPS performance and vesting of up to 75% of the base award was based on TSR performance against each of a housebuilding group and construction group.
EPS performance Threshold condition Stretch condition Maximum % of base award Measure % of base award 15% vesting 100% vesting condition Actual vesting 1 Cumulative notional EPS 50% 334 pence 408 pence n a 402.8 pence 0% 1 Adjusted basic EPS includes basic EPS for the year ended 30 June 2017 based on a notional profit before tax figure of 157.0 million, being the sum of reported profit before tax of 58.7 million and 98.3 million, being the one-off charge relating to legacy contracts announced in May 2017.
As set out above, on 3 May we announced a reappraisal of costs to complete certain construction contracts resulting in a 98.3 million one-off charge for the 2016 17 financial year.
50% of the base award granted in October 2015 was based on adjusted basic EPS which is not impacted by the 98.3 million one-off charge.
Notwithstanding this, to reflect the significantly lower statutory EPS outcome this year 59.1p and the impact on the share price, the Committee has exercised its downward discretion and determined that none of the EPS element should vest.
Had adjusted basic EPS been used, this would have resulted in near full vesting for this element.
64 Galliford Try plc Remuneration Committee report continued TSR performance Threshold Maximum condition Stretch condition condition % of base 1 Measure % of base award 10% vesting 33.3% vesting 100% vesting Actual award vesting 28.9% TSR v Construction 75% Median Median 24% Median 75% median 12.3% 16.5% 28.9% TSR v Housebuilders 75% Median Median 24% Median 75% below median 0% 1 Any vesting above 25% required the EPS target to be achieved in full.
As a result of TSR performance, 16.5% of the base award will vest on 30 September 2017.
The Committee considers that the revised, lower vesting outcome is a more accurate reflection of the Groups performance over the three year period.
Directors share plan interests Further detail regarding the proportion of LTIP awards subject to the three-year performance period ending 30 June 2017, and vesting in September 2017, is given in the preceding table on page 63.
Outstanding awards held by directors are detailed in the table below.
The award is subject to performance conditions over a three-year period as described on page 65.
2 Two awards in respect of forfeited 2013 and 2014 Taylor Wimpey Performance Share Plan awards were made to Peter Truscott on appointment.
The value of the awards forfeited was determined by the Committee based on an average of the Taylor Wimpey plc and Galliford Try plc share prices in a five-day period prior to the announcement of Peter Truscotts appointment to the Group.
The first award vested on 18 April 2016 and the second award of 22,884 Galliford Try plc shares, representing Taylor Wimpey awards made in 2014, shall vest on 30 September 2017, subject to the same performance conditions as awards made in 2014 under the Galliford Try plc LTIP.
3 The face values of the LTIP awards are calculated on the basis of the share price at grant of a base award, and assumes maximum vesting at 200% of award, as per the rules of the LTIP.
Our business Strategic review Business review Governance Financial information Annual Report and 65 Financial Statements 2017 Awards granted during the year On 16 November 2016, conditional LTIP awards were made to Peter Truscott and Graham Prothero.
The awards had base values of 100% of base salary and a maximum opportunity of 200% of the respective base awards.
The performance conditions attached to these awards and awards made in September 2015 are as follows: Date of grant Performance conditions Comparator group September 2015 5 Vesting based on TSR and underlying EPS performance over the three Housebuilding years to 30 June 2018.

The EPS measures attached to the 2015 and 2016 LTIP awards are based on cumulative targets and the Committee has carefully considered how to treat these awards in light of the 98.3 million one-off charge.
After considerable debate and following a thorough consultation with major shareholders and shareholder bodies, the Committee believes that it is appropriate to revert to using the pre-exceptional EPS figure ie excluding the one-off charge when determining the vesting of these awards because i the two significant legacy contracts were entered into before Peter Truscott became Chief Executive in 2015 and since his arrival and as set out in our strategy, the Company is no longer undertaking similar-type large infrastructure projects on fixed-price contracts, ii the Committee believes it is essential that there is some incentive in place for management in 2018 and 2019, and iii the impact of the one-off charge has already had a significant negative impact on the bonus outturn for 2016 17 and the LTIP vesting based on performance to 30 June 2017.
Directors share interests As at 30 June 2017, the directors held the following beneficial, legal and unvested annual bonus plan interests in the Companys ordinary share capital: 1 Legally owned Total % of salary held under share Deferred bonus ownership 2 Director 30.6.
16 LTIP unvested awards unvested Sharesave 30.6.
2 The share ownership guideline is proposed to increase from 150% of salary to 200% of salary upon approval of the 2017 Policy.
As at 30 June 2017, Peter Truscott had a shareholding representing 53% and Graham Prothero had a shareholding representing 185% of their respective base salaries.
The shareholding policy is set out on page 59.
3 Ken Gillespies shareholding is based on the number of shares held at the time of leaving the Company.

Composition of Remuneration Committee and attendance Membership of the Committee is detailed on pages 46 and 47.
The Committee was chaired by Ishbel Macpherson throughout the year.
During the financial year the other members were Andrew Jenner, Terry Miller, Gavin Slark and Peter Ventress.
The General Counsel and Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Chief Executive has a standing invitation to attend all Committee meetings, although each meeting commences with the non-executives meeting without executive management present.
No director, or the General Counsel and Company Secretary, is present when his or her own remuneration is being considered.
Remuneration advice and advisers The Committee is informed of key developments and best practice in the field of remuneration and regularly obtains advice from independent external consultants, when required, on individual remuneration packages and on executive remuneration practices in general.
New Bridge Street NBS is the Committees sole remuneration consultant, having been appointed by the Committee in January 2011 following a competitive tender.
Services provided to the Committee by NBS encompassed remuneration guidance, regulatory guidance and share plan-related consultancy.
Fees paid to NBS for services provided to the Committee during the financial year were 61,300 2016: 51,123.
NBS does not provide any other services to the Group, although NBS is part of Aon plc Aon.
Aon continues to provide advice to the Group specifically relating to private medical insurance policies.
The Committee is satisfied that these services do not impinge on the independence of NBS.
Furthermore, NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Code of Conduct which requires that its advice be objective and impartial.
The General Counsel and Company Secretary also advises the Committee as necessary and, where appropriate, makes arrangements for the Committee to receive independent legal advice at the request of the Committee Chair.
Employee Share Trust and dilution The EST is the primary mechanism by which shares required to satisfy the executive incentive plans are provided.
During the financial year, the EST purchased 151,248 shares in the market at an average price of 13.33, which resulted in a balance held at 30 June 2017 of 369,240 shares.
Including the purchase of shares, the Group provided net additional funds to the EST during the financial year of 2,016,091.58, by extending the existing EST loan facility.
In issuing only 16,034 new shares during or since the financial year, the Company has complied with the dilution guidelines of the Investment Association.
Applying the guidelines, the Group has 6.86% headroom against the 10% in 10 years rule and 3.7% headroom against the 5% in 10 years rule for discretionary plans.
Our business Strategic review Business review Governance Financial information Annual Report and 67 Financial Statements 2017 Shareholder voting on the Directors Remuneration Report The Committee takes account of annualised shareholder voting trends in connection with the Directors Remuneration Report votes.
Votes cast in support of the annual advisory resolution to approve the Directors Remuneration Report during the last five AGMs are as follows: 99.68% 2016, 99.26% 2015, 99.46% 2014, 98.52% 2013 and 99.16% 2012.
In 2016, 0.32% of the votes cast were against the Directors Remuneration Report.
In 2014 shareholders voted in support of the 2014 Policy by 98.13% in favour, with 0.08% of votes withheld.
A further resolution in respect of the 2017 Policy will be proposed at the 2017 AGM.
In 2016, shareholders voted on the renewal of the Long Term Incentive Plan.
Shareholders voted in support of the 2016 LTIP by 95.67% in favour, with 0.77% of votes withheld.
Forward-looking implementation of Policy Base salaries At the 2017 salary review completed in May, the directors carefully scrutinised pay and employment conditions across the Group.
Against the backdrop of strong underlying financial performance, industry-wide salary increases and a need to continue to retain key operational staff to deliver the strategy to 2021, the overall pay budget increased by 3%.
With effect from 1 July 2017, Peter Truscott was awarded an annual salary increase of 3% 15,450 to 530,450.
Graham Prothero was awarded an annual salary increase of 3% 11,600 to 397,850.
These increases were in line with the average pay increase across the workforce.
Annual bonus The Committee has decided that for the financial year to 30 June 2018, the existing bonus structure remains appropriately aligned to corporate strategy.
It will therefore remain in its current form, with an opportunity of 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and an opportunity of 100% of salary for the Group Finance Director.
One of the key risks facing Galliford Try is the macro-economic environment and the possibility of an economic downturn.
The Group manages the impact of this risk by building a stronger and longer construction order book and maintaining an appropriately sized landbank.
Therefore, the Committee feels it is appropriate for both the construction order book and landbank to feature in the 2017 18 bonus plan together with underlying profit before tax and cash management which will continue to determine the majority of the annual bonus.
Accordingly, 50% will be based on underlying Group profit before tax 10% in respect of the half year, 25% on Group cash management, 12.5% on landbank and 12.5% on Construction order book.
Health and safety continues to be a top priority.
Maintaining a strong health and safety record will continue to feature in the bonus plan as a downwards adjuster, enabling bonuses to be reduced by up to 10% in the event that the Groups record is not at the required standard or, for the current financial year, depending on the outcome of the investigations into the two fatalities in the year ended June 2017.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year, as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive.
Information on the targets and the level of bonuses earned will be disclosed next year.
LTIP The Committee has considered the 2017 LTIP metrics carefully and has decided to replace relative TSR with RoNA.
Sustainable profit growth continues to be our key focus and, as set out in our February Strategy to 2021 presentation, RoNA is increasingly important in ensuring that profit is delivered efficiently.
Strong achievement on both underlying EPS and RoNA should ultimately drive returns through share price growth and dividends targeting 5% per annum growth.
While the Committee can see the merits of a relative TSR condition, on balance, it felt that the measure was not appropriate due to the small size of the peer groups, the subjectivity involved in setting appropriate outperformance factors, and the lack of true peers given the Groups focus on construction, regeneration and housebuilding unlike peers who tend to focus on only one of these.
Vesting of awards granted under the LTIP for the 2017 18 financial year will be based two-thirds on underlying EPS and one-third on RoNA performance over the three years to 30 June 2020 as follows: 5 25% of the EPS element will vest if underlying EPS is 186.8 pence for the 2019 20 financial year, increasing to full vesting for underlying EPS of 228.4 pence or more.
Vesting will be determined on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum.
5 25% of the RoNA element will vest if RoNA is 32.0% for the 2019 20 financial year, increasing to full vesting for RoNA of 35.4% or more.
All-employee share schemes The Group operates a HMRC approved sharesave scheme for the benefit of all staff.
During the year, eligible employees were invited to participate in a three-or-five-year scheme which granted options to purchase shares at a 20% discount to the share price as at the grant date.
Chairman and non-executive fees Until his retirement on 11 November 2016, the fee level for Greg Fitzgerald was 190,000 per annum, together with membership of the Groups medical assurance plan.
The fee level for Peter Ventress on becoming Chairman on Greg Fitzgerald stepping down remained the same.
Peter Ventress received no benefits in connection with his position, other than membership of the Groups medical insurance plan.
The standard non-executive fee remained at 40,000 per annum throughout the financial year.
From 1 July 2017, the fee increased by 3% to 41,200.
The fee supplement for the three chairs of Board committees and for the Senior Independent Director also increased by 3% from 7,500 to 7,725 and from 4,000 to 4,120 respectively, also with effect from 1 July 2017.
Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations Amended 2013 and the Financial Conduct Authoritys Listing Rules The Directors Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Regulations 2013, the Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations Amended 2013 and the Financial Conduct Authoritys Listing Rules.
The auditor is required to report on the remuneration data disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report section and state whether, in their opinion, that part of the Report had been properly prepared in accordance with relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 as amended.
The Committee is governed by formal terms of reference agreed by the Board and is composed solely of non-executive directors, each of whom the Board considers to be independent.
The latest terms of reference are available on the Groups website www.
