Shareholding requirement Executive Directors are required to work towards holding beneficially-owned shares equivalent in value to a percentage of their salary by retaining at least one half of after-tax shares released from the PSP LTIP until this requirement is met.
For the Chief Executive this requirement is 250% of salary and for other Executive Directors this requirement is 200% of salary.
The current shareholdings, as a percentage of the requirement, for Warren East and Stephen Daintith are 26% and 42% respectively.

Pay across the organisation This section of the report enables our remuneration arrangements to be seen in context by providing: a comparison of the year-on-year percentage change in our Chief Executives remuneration with the change in average remuneration across the UK: a year-on-year comparison of the total amount spent on employment costs across the Group and shareholder payments: a nine-year history of our Chief Executives remuneration: our TSR performance over the same period: and an indication of the ratio between our Chief Executives remuneration and the remuneration of employees.
Percentage change in Chief Executive remuneration The following table compares the percentage change in the Chief Executives salary, bonus and benefits excluding LTIP to the average percentage change in salary, bonus and benefits for all UK employees from 2016 to 2017.
Change in remuneration Salary Benefits Annual bonus Chief Executive 2% 0% 25.6% 1 UK employees average 2.3% 5% 2.1% 1 UK emplo yees were chosen as a comparator group in order to avoid the impact of exchange rate movements over the year.
UK employees excluding apprentices, graduates and interns, make up 45% of the total employee population.
Chief Executive pay ratio The Committee is mindful of the relationship between the remuneration of the Chief Executive and the wider employee population.
All employees participate in a bonus plan.
We also encourage all employees to join our Sharesave plan, launched every two years.
For our recent launch around 50% of our employees globally joined the plan, sharing in 14 million shares stock appreciation rights.
Included below is the ratio of the remuneration of the Chief Executive to other UK employees in the Group during 2017.
The ratio will be higher when Group performance triggers incentive pay-outs.
The ratio could vary significantly depending on the extent that the Groups performance triggers the payment of short and long-term incentives.

John Rishton retired on 2 July 2015 and Warren East was appointed as Chief Executive on 3 July 2015.
2 John Ri shton received a special grant of shares on joining the Company on 1 March 2011 to mirror the shares he forfeited on resigning from his previous employer.
The share price had increased from 483.50p at the time this grant was made to 870p at the end of 2014.
These are the main reasons why John Rishtons remuneration in 2012 and 2013 exceeded that of his predecessor.
3 The remuneration for Sir John Rose does not include any pension accrual or contribution as he received his pension from 1 February 2008.
TSR performance The Companys TSR performance over the previous nine years compared to a broad equity market index is shown in the graph below.
The FTSE 100 has been chosen as the comparator because it contains a broad range of other UK-listed companies.
The graph shows the growth in value of a hypothetical 100 holding in the Companys ordinary shares over nine years, relative to the FTSE 100 index.

We published our gender pay gap in November 2017, which showed: 8.1% 8.3% Median gender pay gap across all Rolls-Royce UK employees Mean gender pay gap across all Rolls-Royce UK employees Overall, women currently represent 15% of Rolls-Royce UK employees.
Women are less well-represented than this figure in the higher pay quartiles due to proportionally more men being in senior level roles.
Increasing the number of women in our business and moving towards a more balanced distribution of men and women across all levels is very important.
We are making progress on this in many ways, such as increasing the proportion of women in our apprentice and graduate intakes.
