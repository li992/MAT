Consequently, RPC is no longer expected to be exposed to any material actuarial risks in relation to the accrued benefits in this plan.
Therefore, the pension arrangement is being treated as a defined contribution plan for accounting and disclosure purposes.
Simon Kesterton is entitled to receive a Group pension contribution of 20% of basic salary, paid either as a non-pensionable salary supplement or delivered partly through the Groups defined contribution arrangement employers contribution being capped at 15% of basic salary, subject to a 5% of basic salary employee contribution with any balance being paid by way of a salary supplement.

During the year Deloitte also provided some internal audit services to the Company and the Committee is satisfied that the provision of these services did not impair Deloittes ability to advise the Committee independently.
Their total fees for the provision of remuneration services to the Committee since appointment to 31 March 2017 were 22,875.

The Committee notes that a clear majority of shareholders voted to approve the Policy.
A notable minority of shareholders, however, failed to support the resolution approving the Remuneration report.
From a comprehensive and transparent shareholder consultation process, the Committee understands some shareholders noted concerns with the overall increase in quantum following the phased salary increases.
The Committee have further engaged with shareholders during the year in respect of the phased salary increases and taken all feedback into consideration when determining the approach to salaries for 2017.
PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE There were no payments for loss of office paid to any directors during the year.
POLICY IMPLEMENTATION FOR YEAR ENDING 31 MARCH 2018 BASE SALARY As highlighted last year, as part of the remuneration review, it was agreed that the base salaries of the executive directors would be increased on a phased basis over two years, subject to the continued strong performance of the Group, to bring them in line with market competitive levels.
The performance of the Group and the executive directors over the last 12 months has been very strong, both in terms of underlying financial performance and the continued delivery of the Vision 2020 strategy.
Taking this continued strong performance into account and after consultation with a number of our major shareholders, the Committee determined that it was appropriate to proceed with the salary increases as disclosed in last years Remuneration report and set out in the table below.
It should be noted that the Company has continued to grow, both in terms of size and complexity over the last 18 months since these salary levels were agreed.
However no further adjustments are proposed to be made to reflect this at this point in time.
From From Basic salary 1 April 2016 1 April 2017 Increase Pim Vervaat 743,000 850,000 14.4% Simon Kesterton 360,000 390,000 8.3% PENSION ARRANGEMENTS Recent changes in Dutch legislation have increased the standard retirement age in retirement plans and reduced the maximum amount that can be accrued under the current pension arrangement for Pim Vervaat.
The employers obligation will continue to be capped at a maximum of 20% of salary.
Simon Kesterton participates in a defined contribution pension plan in the UK with an employers maximum pension contribution of 15% up to the annual allowance and a salary supplement which in aggregate is 20% of salary.
78 STRATEGIC REPORT 0152 GOVERNANCE 5391 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 92139 SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 140148 2017 18 ABP The ABP for 2017 18 will operate on the same basis as for 2016 17 with the exception of a slight change to the bonus moderators.
Whilst RAFR continues to be a key focus throughout the organisation we have removed it as a bonus moderator to increase the weighting to the key financial metrics of ROCE and FCF.
The Committee maintains the overall discretion to reduce bonus outcomes if overall performance is unsatisfactory and this will include taking into account the RAFR performance during the year.
1 Weighting of performance measures Bonus opportunity salary% Target Maximum 62.5% 125% Adjusted Group PBIT 100% 2 Bonus moderators FCF 12.5% 12.5% reduction to bonus outcome if threshold not met ROCE 12.5% 12.5% reduction to bonus outcome if threshold not met 1 50% of any bonus will be paid in cash and 50% deferred into shares under the DBP which are held for 3 years subject to continued employment.
2 The overall bonus outcome can be reduced by up to 25% if the target levels for each of the moderators are not met.
3 Recovery and withholding provisions will apply for a period of three years from payment or vesting in relation to a material misstatement, gross misconduct, and material error in calculation or an exceptional negative event.
As the Board deems the performance targets for the upcoming year to be commercially sensitive the Committee has taken the decision to not disclose the targets in advance.
However, the targets are set on a challenging basis, requiring incremental growth to the year ending 31 March 2018, and will only be met if recent acquisitions continue to deliver as planned.
The performance targets and performance against them will be disclosed retrospectively in next years Annual report on remuneration when the Committee is comfortable that the information is no longer commercially sensitive.
2017 PSP AWARDS Awards made under the PSP in 2017 will operate on the same basis as for the 2016 awards.
Pim Vervaat and Simon Kesterton will receive awards equivalent to 200% and 175% respectively.
These will be subject to the performance measures and targets to be measured over a three year period as set out in the table below: Weighting of performance measures Performance targets Threshold 20% vesting Maximum 100% vesting Adjusted Basic EPS 2 3rds 74.8p 87.0p Relative TSR vs constituents of FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts 1 3rd Median ranking Upper quintile ranking PSP moderators RONOA 20% reduction to PSP outcome if RONOA 20% in year ending 31 March 2020 is less than 20% Awards will vest on a straight line basis between the threshold and maximum performance targets.
Following the end of the performance period awards will be subject to a further two year holding period.
Malus and clawback provisions will apply for a period of three years from the vesting date in relation to a material misstatement, gross misconduct, and material error in calculation or an exceptional negative event.
Awards will also be subject to a RONOA element to the extent that the RONOA in the year ending 31 March 2020 is less than 20%, the total vesting percentage as determined by the EPS and TSR performance targets set out above will be reduced by 20%.
The EPS performance targets which have been set as pence targets for the year ending 31 March 2020, and RONOA hurdle have been set based on internal strategy plans, incorporating recent acquisitions, and external analyst consensus and a wider view of macroeconomic factors which may act as a headwind in the next performance cycle.
The targets are considered to be challenging, particularly to achieve full vesting, but remain realistic within an acceptable risk profile.
The stretching targets will only be met if acquisitions deliver in excess of expectations.
