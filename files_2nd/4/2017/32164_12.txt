2 In light of the tragic tram incident in Croydon last year, and the ongoing investigations, the Committee decided that it would not be appropriate to award a bonus either in cash or award the deferred share element to the Chief Executive in the usual way.
The Chief Executive will not be awarded a bonus for the financial year 2016 17.
Instead, the Committee determined that a conditional award of deferred shares would be made which was equivalent in value to the bonus of 723,415 that he would have received based on achievement against the performance measures and targets agreed at the start of the 2016 17 financial year.
The Committee will determine at its discretion in 2020 the extent if at all to which the award will vest based on the outcomes and or status of the various investigations.
3 The following pension-related benefits were received during the year: Tim OToole 140,705 pension allowance and a defined benefit pension input amount, net of Directors contributions, of 56,299.
Matthew Gregory received a pension allowance of 85,000, which included a defined contribution pension input amount of 10,000.
4 Full details of Matthew Gregorys recruitment remuneration are set out on page 85 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2016.
The awards were not subject to performance conditions.
Two of the awards vested in 2016 and the third award vested on 1 April 2017.
The buyout amount was determined by the face value at the date of grant 572,000 plus a partial bonus in lieu of the amount forgone under his previous employers annual bonus plan amounting to 120,000.

2 The base salary of Matthew Gregory was increased in line with the rest of the UK workforce.
Benefits audited Benefits for Executive Directors include the provision of a company car allowance, private medical cover, life assurance and advisory fees principally relating to taxation in the UK and US for Tim OToole.
Pension audited Tim OToole participates in a defined benefit pension scheme.
His contributions to this scheme are paid via salary sacrifice with an equivalent contribution being paid directly to the pension scheme by the Company.
This provides him with 1 50th accrual for each year of service, based on average pensionable salary for the three tax years prior to retirement.
Upon reaching age 60, he has amended his normal retirement age from 60 to 65, for future service.
He will receive all his benefits at the same time, but those payable from age 60 will be increased for deferred payment, and those payable from age 65 are payable unreduced at that time.
Pensions normally increase in line with the consumer prices index and provide a dependants pension on a members death.
There is a scheme earnings cap of 140,705 above which a pension allowance of 20% of base salary is paid.
Information in the table below includes the total accrued benefit at 31 March 2017 which represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement given the length of service and salary of Tim OToole.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 67 Directors remuneration report continued An Executive Director employed after 1 April 2011 receives a pension allowance equal to 20% of their base salary.
The allowances paid during the year to Tim OToole and Matthew Gregory were 140,705 and 85,000 respectively.
Matthew Gregorys allowance included a defined contribution pension input amount of 10,000.
Performance-related pay The Committee believes it is important that for Executive Directors a significant proportion of the remuneration package is performance-related and the performance conditions applying to incentive arrangements support the delivery of the Companys strategy.
The Committee considers performance against a range of metrics, including safety, to ensure that the assessment is rounded, taking into account both qualitative and quantitative factors.
The table below outlines each of the performance measures used in the Companys performance-related incentives and how they support the Companys strategy and business objectives as outlined in the Strategic Review: Business KPIs objectives Our values 1 LTIP ROCE TSR Bonus Adjusted operating profit Revenue Cash flow Safety Customer satisfaction Individual performance 1 As mentioned on page 65, a review is being undertaken in 2017 18 of the performance metrics used in the LTIP.
Executive Annual Bonus Plan 2016 17 Executive Directors annual bonus audited For 2016 17, the annual bonus comprised six elements as set out below.
Adjusted operating profit 45% Adjusted operating profit a KPI used in managing the business.
Revenue 20% Revenue encourages management to deliver sustainable growth through pricing and volume.
Cash ow 10% Safety 7.5% Cash flow encourages management to devise operational plans focused on cash generation Customer to create options for the Board in relation to, among other uses, investment in key assets of fleet, satisfaction 7.5% systems and people.
Individual performance 10% Safety to ensure that risk controls, safety procedures and safety behaviours are constantly improved to reduce long term injuries and avoid safety incidents across all the Divisions.
Performance was assessed against a balanced scorecard across a broad range of indicators, including long-term injuries, passenger injuries and collisions.
Customer satisfaction a key focus at all levels of the Group.
Performance was assessed against a balanced scorecard of measures: customer satisfaction surveys, punctuality, cancellations and complaints across First Bus, First Rail, First Student, First Transit and Greyhound.
Individual performance recognises achievement in other significant areas.
Performance was assessed against individual objectives for the year, which were aligned with the Groups strategy and transformation plans, and the Executive Directors core areas of responsibility.
Stretching, relevant and measurable financial and non-financial annual bonus targets were set at the start of the performance period by the Committee.
The Committee assessed each element of the annual bonus separately as part of an overall balanced scorecard of measures.
Withineach element the Committee considered a number of sub-elements, including the performance of each Division and the Companys performance on a rail and non-rail basis, and formed a rounded assessment of performance of the Executive Directors at the end of the year.
In keeping with the practice applied in previous years, the original target ranges for the revenue and operating profit elements have been adjusted to reflect the actual reported foreign exchange rates changes experienced in the year under review.
68 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance As explained in the Statement by the Chair and note 2 on page 67, the Committee has determined that no bonus will be paid to the Chief Executive in respect of 2016 17.
In light of the tragic tram incident in Croydon last year, and the ongoing investigations, the Committee decided that it would not be appropriate to award a bonus either in cash or award the deferred share element to the Chief Executive in the usual way.
Instead, the Committee determined that a conditional award of shares would be made equivalent in value to the bonus of 723,415 that he wouldhave received based on achievement against the performance measures and targets agreed at the start of the 2016 17 financial year.
Indetermining the amount used to calculate the share award, the portion of the bonus relating to the safety performance measure was set to zero.
These shares will be awarded under the EABP but on condition that the Committee would determine whether the shares shall vest and, ifsodecided, the percentage that shall vest.
The Committee will make these decisions as soon as practicable after 31 March 2020, taking into consideration the outcome of the relevant investigations into the incident.
The Chief Executive fully supports this decision.

These targets were adjusted upwards to 330.9m and 5,641.7m for exchange rate gains.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 69 Directors remuneration report continued The Committee carefully reviewed the individual performance of Tim OToole and Matthew Gregory against objectives set at the beginning of the year and concluded that: Performance outcome range Executive Director Objective Assessment of 0% to 10% Tim OToole Make further progress towards the delivery of the Solid progress in delivering overall targets medium-term financial and operational targets Student and Bus efficiencies delivered through continued improvement in our bus Various strategies for growth being delivered in all divisions businesses Further strengthen the approach to talent Further developed our strategic approach to talent development and succession planning andskills Strengthened succession plans for senior roles through external hires and development of internal talent with 8% particular focus on increasing gender diversity Build a culture of innovation to improve customer Initiatives implemented across all Divisions to increase service and develop new growth opportunities innovation and the use of new technologies to improve customer experience and support growth Continue to establish close relationships with all Continued to build and maintain effective working related parties relevant to the business activities relationships with relevant stakeholders, including those innew markets Matthew Gregory Deliver cost savings and capital expenditure Implemented Group-wide cost-saving initiatives reductions set out in the 2016 17 budget Capital expenditure target achieved Present the updated Turnaround Plan to Established a strong presence in the investment community shareholders and analysts, providing a clear path to future targets through the final results presentation 8% Drive the improvement rationalisation of financial Led improvements to the quality of financial information information in the Group available to the Board and the Divisions Identify process improvement opportunities across Created a control-focused culture across the Groups the Group to generate cost-savings finance functions Cost-saving process improvement initiatives underway inthree key areas 2017 18 Executive Directors annual bonus For 2017 18 the executive annual bonus plan will incentivise improved performance against a range of financial and non-financial metrics.
Thestructure of the bonus is unchanged from 2016 17 and will be weighted such that 75% will be based on financial metrics and 25% on non-financial metrics.
The financial targets set by the Committee are based on the Groups approved plan.
The Committee also reviewed targetsat individual business unit level and took into consideration current consensus and expectations for FY2017 18.
The Committee believesthat the targets are stretching to ensure payouts only occur for strong performance over the financial year.
Specific targets will not be disclosed in advance as they would give a clear indication of the Groups business objectives, which are commercially sensitive.
Where bonus targets are no longer commercially sensitive, typically following the end of the financial year, they will be disclosed in that years Directors Remuneration Report.
Awards are subject to an underlying performance override enabling them to be scaled back to reflect the Groups performance as well as malus and clawback.
Half of any bonus earned will be deferred into the Companys shares for three years, conditional upon continued employment.
The 2017 18 annual bonus maximum and threshold levels of bonus as a percentage of base salary are as follows: Executive Director Maximum Threshold Tim OToole 120% 0% Matthew Gregory 150% 0% 70 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance Long-Term Incentive Plan 2014 Long-Term Incentive Awards audited The vesting of the 2014 LTIP awards were subject to an Adjusted EPS and a TSR performance condition.
Based on the Groups performance relative to these measures, 16.3% of the maximum award vested.
The performance in respect of each of the metrics was as follows: TSR performance worth up to 50% of maximum award was measured against the FTSE250 constituent peer group excluding financial services and extraction companies at the financial year end: actual relative performance to 31 March 2017 was below median 79th centile andno award for the TSR element is therefore payable.
Adjusted EPS of 12.4p performance for 2016 17 resulted in a payout of 16.3% out of 50% under the LTIP scheme.
Actual Adjusted EPS Threshold Maximum % of award Metrics performance entry level 5% 12.5% 50% which vested Adjusted EPS 12.4p 10p 12p 16p 16.3 TSR Below median n a Median Upper quartile 0 The Committee has taken into account the underlying performance of the Group in approving the vesting of the 2014 LTIP.
2016 Long-Term Incentive Awards audited Half of the award is subject to the achievement of stretching ROCE target figures determined at the end of the performance period and the remaining half of the award is subject to the Companys relative TSR.
Awards are subject to a two-year holding period following the three-year performance period as well as malus and clawback.
In addition, before an award vests the Committee must be satisfied that the underlying performance of the Group is satisfactory.
The Committee believes that having a performance override is an important feature of the plan as it mitigates the risk of unwarranted vesting outcomes.
Details of the performance metrics and targets for the 2016 LTIP awards are set out below.
ROCE a KPI used in managing the business as it captures both growth in earnings and the efficient allocation of limited capital.
Calculated by dividing adjusted operating profit after tax by net assets excluding cash and debit items.
To reflect those items outside managements control, the definition of ROCE will be adjusted for: use of constant currency the use of constant currency is established practice at FirstGroup and ensures that management are rewarded for improving the underlying performance of the business.
LTIP targets are based on estimated foreign exchange rates in line with those rates included in the Groups Three-Year Plan, which is updated annually.
The principal foreign exchange assumptions will be provided for each award: exclusion of pension deficit the exclusion of the pension deficit is considered appropriate as the Committee believes management should not be rewarded for movements in this element: and exclusion of non-continuing rail franchises First Rail franchises that are not contracted to be operated for the full duration of the LTIP performance period are excluded from the ROCE calculation.
Winning a franchise or being awarded an extension to an existing franchise a Direct Award within the performance period will lead to that franchise being included in subsequent LTIP awards, but not being included in the calculation of existing awards.
This ensures a like-for-like comparison across the performance period.
Due to the way in which rail franchises are included, an appropriate ROCE target range will be determined in respect of each LTIP award.
In order to provide transparency for each LTIP award, the Committee will disclose both the ROCE target range percentages and also the equivalent EPS CAGR percentages.
The Committee believes that this method of calculation results in a ROCE definition which will ensure management are rewarded for improving the effective allocation of capital across the business and then generating a return from this investment.
Details of the ROCE targets for the 2016 LTIP are set out below: Equivalent % of award ROCE EPS CAGR which vests 7.6% 9.1% 0% 7.6% 9.1% 12.5% 8.7% 16.6% 50% 1 Between 12.5% and 50% of the award will vest on a straight-line basis if ROCE at the end of the performance period is between 7.6% and 8.7%.

Relative TSR reflects actual returns delivered to shareholders.
The relative nature of the metric, with TSR measured against a comparator group of 32 companies, creates an objective measure of long-term value delivery to shareholders and rewards executives for delivering performance which is better than that of competitors.
Relative TSR will be determined over a three-year performance period commencing on 1 April 2016 using a three-month average TSR at the beginning and end of the performance period by reference to the Companys positioning amongst a comparator group of companies.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 71 Directors remuneration report continued The Committee believes that relative TSR is a suitable value metric, which takes into account performance of the Companys closest peers.
Details of the TSR targets for the 2016 LTIP are set out below: % of award TSR Ranking which vests Below median 0% Median 12.5% Upper quartile 50% 1 Between median and the upper quartile of the peer group, vesting will be on a straight-line basis between 12.5% and 50%.
The comparator group for the benchmarking of remuneration and the relative TSR metric for awards granted in 2016 comprises: Aggreko Carnival Grafton Group Serco Group Amec Foster Wheeler DCC Hays SIG Atkins WS easyJet Interserve Smith DS Babcock International Group Electrocomponents IWG Stagecoach Group Balfour Beatty G4S Kier Group Thomas Cook Group Bunzl Galliford Try Mitie Group Travis Perkins Capita GKN National Express Wolseley Carillion Go-Ahead Group Rentokil Initial Wood Group John The comparator group comprises companies in the travel, business services and industrial sectors, which are of comparable scale, complexity and activity to FirstGroup.
In the event of one or more of the constituents undergoing a takeover, merger, dissolution, variation in capital or any other event that will materially affect the calculation of a ranking, the Committee shall determine how this should be reflected in the ranking calculation.
In the event of a change of control, awards will normally vest on a pro rata basis by reference to the length of time since the award was granted, and only if the performance conditions can effectively be regarded as having been satisfied at that time, although the Committee may decide not to pro rata an award if it is inappropriate to do so in the particular circumstances.

72 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance 2017 Long-Term Incentive Awards As the Group moves out of the transformation phase and following the recent award of the South Western rail franchise, which commences on 20August 2017, the Committee is reviewing the performance metrics used for the LTIP to ensure they remain appropriate.
This will be a thorough review with the intention to consult with major shareholders in the autumn.
Therefore grants of LTIP awards will be deferred until immediately after the announcement of the Companys half-yearly results in November 2017.
Awards will be subject to a holding period of two years following the three-year performance period as well as malus and clawback.
Award levels will remain unchanged and will be as follows: Minimum threshold Face value performance Maximum performance Performance % of base salary % of maximum potential % of maximum potential period Tim OToole 120 25% 100% 1.4.
20 Directors interests in share awards audited The outstanding LTIP, deferred share bonus and SAYE awards of Directors are set out in the table below.
There have been no changes to the terms of any share awards granted to Directors.
The number of awards detailed in the table below have been adjusted, where appropriate, to reflect the rights issue in 2013 following the application of the standard rights issue adjustment formula.

Participants are entitled to receive dividends or dividend equivalent amounts once the share awards have vested.
2 The face value in the table above has been calculated by multiplying the maximum number of shares that could vest by the closing share price on the date of grant.
3 An award vests on the date the Committee determines whether performance conditions have been met, or if on that date dealing restrictions apply, the first date after dealing restrictions cease to apply.
4 These awards were made in connection with the recruitment of Matthew Gregory to replace awards he held under similar schemes with his former employer.
5 Mick Barker resigned on 17 February 2017.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 73 Directors remuneration report continued Shareholding guidelines audited Under the terms of the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM, Executive Directors are required to build up a specified shareholding in the Company.
This is to create greater alignment of the Executive Directors interests with those of shareholders.
The guidelines require Executive Directors to retain at least 75% of the shares, net of tax, vesting under a Group share incentive plan or otherwise acquire shares in the Company within a five-year period from the later of their date of appointment or the date of approval of the current remuneration policy, 16 July 2015, until a shareholding with a market value calculated by reference to the year-end share price equal to 200% of base salary in the case of the Chief Executive and 150% of base salary in the case of other Executive Directors is achieved.
The Committee reserves the right to relax or waive the application of such guidelines in certain circumstances, including the impending retirement of an Executive Director.
The table below sets out the Executive Directors and their connected persons shareholdings including beneficial interests and a summary of outstanding and unvested share awards as at 31 March 2017.

The range of the Companys share price for the year was 88.7 pence to 133 pence.
2 Tim OToole has until 16 July 2020 and Matthew Gregory has until 1 December 2020 to meet the shareholding requirement.
3 In the period 1 April to 1 June 2017, Tim OToole acquired 11,109 shares in the Company, increasing his shareholding to 950,405 shares.
No other changes in Executive Directors interests occurred in the period.
Since June 2015, Tim OToole has allocated 15,000 of his gross monthly base salary equivalent to more than 20% of his base salary to acquire shares in the Company, with shares being purchased from the post-tax and post-National Insurance NI amount.
All-employee share schemes Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Companys Sharesave SAYE and Share Incentive Plan BAYE on the same terms as other eligible employees.
SAYE The maximum participation level in the SAYE plan is 500 per calendar month as per HMRC limits with participants granted linked share options, by reference to projected savings, with a 20% discount to the prevailing share price at the time of grant.
In line with HMRC requirements, on the maturity of the savings contracts, participants can elect to use the accumulated savings to exercise their options or request the return of their savings.
BAYE The maximum participation level in the BAYE is 150 per month, as per HMRC limits.
At present the Company provides two Matching Shares for every three Partnership Shares, subject to a maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of 20 a month.
The shares are held in trust and become available for release with no tax or NI liability once held for five years.
The Matching Shares will be forfeited if the corresponding Partnership Shares are removed from the trust within three years from award.
In accordance with the applicable legislation, shares that remain subject to the plan are held on behalf of participants in a UK-based trust.
Preventing rewards for failure In respect of awards made under the EABP and the LTIP, from 2015 onwards, they are subject to both malus and clawback provisions.
The triggering events for malus and clawback are the same and include material misstatement of accounts, awards being based on an error, misleading information or inaccurate assumptions, gross misconduct or computational error.
For the EABP, annual cash bonuses may be clawed back at any time up to the end of the third financial year after that in respect of which the payment is made and share awards will remain subject to clawback for three years following the date of grant.
For the LTIP, awards will remain subject to clawback for two years following the end of the three-year performance period.
As regards malus, under the EABP and the LTIP, share awards that are yet to vest can be reduced, including to zero.
In addition, prior to the vesting of awards made under the EABP and LTIP, in respect of awards made from 2014 onwards, the Committee may reduce awards to reflect any triggering event, such as material misstatement of accounts or gross misconduct.
The malus and clawback provisions which apply to our incentive plans are standard and in line with general practice.
74 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance Dilution The Company ensures that the level of shares granted under the Companys share plans and the means of satisfying such awards remains within best practice guidelines so that dilution from employee share awards does not exceed 10% of the Companys issued share capital for all share plans and 5% in respect of executive share plans in any ten-year rolling period.
The Committee monitors dilution levels at least once a year.
At 31March 2017, less than 1% of the Companys issued share capital had been issued for the purpose of its share incentive plans over a ten-year period and no shares had been issued in respect of the executive share plans.
Employee Benefit Trust EBT The FirstGroup EBT has been established to acquire ordinary shares in the Company, by subscription or purchase, from funds provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise or vesting of awards under the Groups share-based incentive plans.
The trustee of the FirstGroup EBT has informed the Company that its intention is to abstain from voting in respect of the FirstGroup shares held in the trust.
As at 31March 2017, 247,256 shares were held by the EBT to hedge outstanding awards of 33,817,830.
This means that the EBT holds sufficient shares to satisfy 0.7% of outstanding awards.
Performance graphs The graph below shows the TSR performance of 100 invested in FirstGroup plc shares over the past eight years compared to an equivalent investment in the FTSE 250 and in our comparator group.
The FTSE 250 Index has been selected as it provides an established and broad-based index, of which the Company is a constituent.

Remuneration of the Chief Executive The table below shows the total remuneration figure for the highest paid Executive Director, the Chief Executive, during each of the past nine years.
The total remuneration figure includes the annual bonus and LTIP awards which vested based on performance in those years.
The annual bonus percentages show the payout for each year as a percentage of the maximum.
From 1 November 2010 to 31 March 2011, Tim OToole received remuneration of 357,000.
2 Relates to the remuneration of Tim OToole who was appointed Chief Executive in November 2010.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 75 Directors remuneration report continued Percentage change in remuneration levels The table below shows the movement in the salary, benefits and annual bonus for the Chief Executive between the current and previous financial year compared to that for the average UK employee First Bus and First Rail, but excluding Group.
The Committee has chosen this comparator as it feels that it provides a more appropriate reflection of the earnings of the average worker than the movement in the Groups total wage bill, which is distorted by movements in the number of employees and variations in wage practices in the US.
However, the Committee will re-assess the comparator in 2017 18 to ensure it remains appropriate.
For the benefits and bonus per employee, the figures are based on those employees eligible to participate in such schemes.
Base salary Benefits Annual bonus 1 Chief Executive 0% 14% 100 % 2 3 UK employees 1-3% 3 % 14.9 % 1 Last year the Chief Executive received an annual bonus of 161,796.
For 2016 17 he has not received an annual bonus.
2 Pay increases for the majority of UK employees in First Bus and First Rail are collectively bargained with trade unions in individual operating companies in First Bus and First Rail.
Some of these agreements are multi-year deals.
Typical increases for 2016 17 were in the range 1-3%.
3 This reflects the lower level of discretionary bonuses paid in some of our UK businesses in 2016 17 to the average UK employee compared to the previous year.
Relative importance of spend on pay The table below illustrates the Companys expenditure on pay in comparison to adjusted operating profit and distributions to shareholders by way of dividend payments.
2016 2017 m m % change Adjusted operating profit 301 339 13 Distributions to shareholders Total employee pay 2,667 2,945 10 1 Group adjusted operating profit has been used as a comparison as it is a key financial metric which the Board considers when assessing Company performance.
