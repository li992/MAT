Components of variable remuneration audited Annual Bonus Plan 2017 For the 2017 financial year, the Executive Directors Annual Bonus Plan consisted of financial and business targets aligned to the Groups operational plans.
These included: Group underlying Return on Tangible Equity ROTE, Group underlying Profit before Tax PBT, Group Combined Operating Ratio COR, a Business Scorecard and role-specific personal objectives.
The maximum bonus opportunity was 160% of salary, of which half of any award is deferred into RSA shares for three years.
Bonus awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions, as detailed on page 78.
In determining 2017 bonus awards under this Plan, the Committee considered how goals had been met and took account of key risk factors.
Financial Performance 40% weighting achieved 18.0% As shown in the following table, RSAs financial performance was better than 2016s record results and above target at EPS and ROTE level.
However, growth of underwriting profits was held back by external factors US Caribbean hurricanes, UK Ogden governmental action and UK household escape of water inflation.
As a result, the headline financial performance element overall achieved 18 40.
Had external loss factors been in line with normal averages, the score would have been 40 40. Business Scorecard 30% weighting achieved 22.5% The Business Scorecard component focuses on key areas of management activity essential to the success of the Company spanning Underlying Performance, Risk and Resilience including Capital and Business Sustainability including Customer Franchise.
Achievement is measured against a range of objective measures, with the overall Scorecard outcome being determined using judgement in the round.
The Scorecard outcome will vary from the financial metrics outcome if these are considered over or under representative of the underlying actions of management and their results.
RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 73 Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Achievement under the Scorecard was assessed to have been strong overall, although less so than in 2016.
As a result, an award of 22.5% out of a maximum of 30% in this category was made compared to 30% awarded in 2016.
In terms of Underlying Performance, underwriting profit set a new RSA record at 394 million, despite external loss pressures.
Controllable costs and cost ratio improved again, well ahead of targeted reduction levels, and cost saving ambitions were raised for a fourth time.
Attritional loss ratios improved in every overseas market, but UK results dragged the Group ratio down to broadly flat versus 2016s record level.
Strategic plan initiatives are discussed at length in the body of the Annual Report.
They support the achievement of the financial progress noted, and the potential for more in future years.
This affirms the Committees positive view of underlying progress.
From a Risk and Resilience perspective, achievements were very strong.
Capital metrics significantly exceeded targets and credit ratings are strong.
The successful sale of UK legacy liabilities reduced risk, boosted capital and allowed a major pay down of high cost debt, improving capital resilience further.
Reinsurance structures successfully protected the Company against the worst of the US Cat losses.
In terms of Business Sustainability, across the Company activities delivered successful improvements in line with RSAs Best in Class agenda.
A key achievement in 2017 was premium growth of 4%, the first return to growth since 2013.
This was accompanied by rising customer retention rates, good NPS and equivalent scores and key new business wins like the Nationwide home partnership.

Long-term incentive awards vesting from 2015-17 cycle Conditional long-term incentive awards were granted in 2015.
In 2018, these Performance Shares will partially vest at 58% of the maximum, based on the achievement of the three performance conditions described below.
Relative Total Shareholder Return 33.3% weighting no vesting While RSAs share price appreciation beat the index of comparators, Relative TSR which combines share price and dividend returns, fell 1% short of the vesting threshold.
The lower dividend return reflected the challenges of RSAs starting position and the capital constraints influencing distributions during the period.
Group underlying ROTE 33.3% weighting achieved 24.4% The Group underlying ROTE required for an on-target vesting 62.5% vesting was a three-year average of 12% as envisaged by RSAs operating plan for the period and being a level significantly in excess of the Groups cost of equity.
The average achieved was 13.1%, up from the 11.2% achieved for the 2014-16 LTIP cycle.
The target average was arithmetically less than the mid-point of the 11-16% range reflecting the nature of the turnaround where ROTE performance was targeted to improve substantially over the three year averaging period taking into account the operating plan.
For context, in the year prior to this LTIP cycle, i. e. 2014, RSAs ROTE result was 9.7%.
RSAs continuing progress allowed the on-target value required for the 2016-18 LTIP cycle to be set higher to reflect progress of the turnaround and to continue to incorporate an appropriate degree of stretch, and the ROTE target range itself was increased for the 2017-19 LTIP cycle.

Amlin and Catlin were originally included in the index, but were delisted during the performance period and so the Committee determined to exclude them from the calculation.
A straight-line calculation is applied to determine the portion of awards that vest for performance between the threshold and maximum targets.
Group underlying ROTE is calculated on a three-year average basis.
A straight-line calculation was applied to determine the portion of awards that vest for performance between threshold and on-target, and between on-target and maximum.
The average required for on-target vesting 62.5% vesting in this cycle was 12%.
Business Review Scorecard 33.3% weighting achieved 33.3% The vesting outcome on this element was determined by the Committee assessing RSAs progress during the turnaround in the round, particularly relating to capital, strategy implementation and earnings improvement.
The 2015-17 Scorecard targets were strengthened compared to 2014-16, taking account of progress made including enhanced controllable expenses targets.
The Scorecard differs from that applied to the 2017 Annual Bonus Plan both in timescale three years vs one year and some of the performance measures.
The 2015-17 LTIP period captures the bulk of the Companys turnaround activity following the recovery plan road map laid out in 2014.
The Committee reviewed how the Business Review activities that make up this plan have succeeded.
It considered that excellent progress had been made with significant improvement in capability and performance.
RSAs widely acclaimed transformation is shown across all the metrics below and drove the ROTE outperformance.
The Committees assessment of the Business Review Scorecard is therefore at the same level as for the Scorecard in the 2014-16 LTIP last year.
The Scorecards capital and business performance indicators shown in the following table form the basis of this judgement.
Despite tough markets, underwriting performance has gone from losses to two successive record years, driven by underlying performance improvement.
Cost saving targets have been beaten and raised four times and ROTE targets successfully raised also.
Credit ratings and capital ratios have been raised to well above threshold zones.
Strategic priority Key performance indicators Target Actual Capital 2015 2016 2017 1 IGD coverage ratio 175% 216% 1 ECA coverage ratio 115% 140% 1 Solvency II coverage ratio 130% 143% 158% 163% TNAV:NWP 35% 42% 45% 41% 201517 S&P credit rating Astable A stable Business performance 201517 2 Cumulative earnings 951m 975m 3 TNAV growth per share 15.4p 17.0p 4 Controllable cost savings 250m by 2017 395m 5 Total controllable expenses 5,218m 5,021m 2015 2016 2017 4 Attritional loss ratio Improvement i. e. reduction 51.0% 49.4% 49.6% on 2014 result 52.1% Notes: 1.
Solvency II coverage ratio was introduced as a measure of capital strength to reflect the new Solvency II regime implemented from 1 January 2016, replacing IGD and ECA, as noted in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts on page 67.
Cumulative earnings defined in common with the underlying ROTE measure of earnings adjusted for disposal gains and restructuring charges which were also key management activities.
The Committee assessed all other items falling outside of this definition to determine if they should adjust the Committees view of progress upwards or downwards namely non-cash, non-capital accounting items.
Comparison is versus original 2015-17 Plans incorporating the planned costs and benefits of the additional cost programmes announced subsequently.
TNAV growth per share assessed consistent with the methodology in note 2.
Market volatility FX, Bonds, Pensions have been excluded as well as the impact of capital actions beneficial to the shareholder.
These indicators were not separately listed in the Scorecard Key Performance Indicators but were key underlying targets and reviewed by the Committee as additional context on the transformation.
Defined on a Core Group basis.
Attritional loss ratio excludes Claims Handling Expenses which are captured in the expense measure.

Scott Egan was appointed effective 1 October 2015, and does not have awards in this cycle.
Long-term incentive awards granted in 2017 Conditional long-term incentive awards were made to the Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer on 3 March 2017.
These Performance Share awards will vest in 2020, subject to the satisfaction of the plans performance conditions based on Group underlying ROTE, relative Total Shareholder Return and a Business Scorecard.
The Group underlying ROTE target range has been increased compared to the 2016-18 cycle.
The Business Scorecard measures a range of indicators on an underlying basis, and includes: regulatory capital ratios, credit rating, capital actions, risk management, attritional loss ratio, total controllable costs cost ratios, key business improvement projects, customer franchise and other relevant actions related to the Companys long-term success.
Achievement will be evaluated using a performance framework whereby metrics will be reviewed against their targets, together with any other aspects connected to the business performance including material risk items.
Judgement in the round will be used by the Committee to determine the level of vesting.
The specific targets cannot be disclosed prospectively for commercial reasons, including price sensitivity.
A performance narrative will be given regarding the level of Scorecard vesting once the performance conditions have been tested.

Relative TSR index of comparators includes: Admiral, Allianz, Aviva, Chubb, Direct Line, Gjensidige Forsikring, Hiscox, Intact, Mapfre, QBE, Topdanmark, Tryg and Zurich.
Group underlying ROTE will be calculated on a three-year average basis.
A straight-line calculation is applied to determine the portion of awards that vest for performance between threshold and on-target, and between on-target and maximum.
The average required for on-target vesting 62.5% vesting is positioned requiring demanding increases in underlying performance vs 2016 and is considered commercially sensitive because it is set in line with, and therefore signals, the Groups forward plan for the period.
Disclosure will be provided retrospectively following the end of the performance period.
The awards granted are set out in the table below: 1, 2 Performance Shares 3 4 Director Basis of award Number of shares Face value Scott Egan 200% of salary 180,216 1,076,250 Stephen Hester 230% of salary 382,521 2,284,417 Notes: 1.
The performance measures are Group underlying ROTE, Relative TSR and a Business Scorecard weighting each.
The performance period is three years and ends on 31 December 2019.
If threshold performance is achieved, 25% of the number of shares shown will vest.
The face value of the award is calculated as the maximum number of shares that would vest if all performance measures and targets are met at maximum, multiplied by the mid-market closing price of an RSA ordinary share averaged over the five business days preceding the date of grant 3 March 2017, of 5.972.
RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 77 Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Malus and Clawback Policy The Group operates a Malus and Clawback Policy.
This is reviewed annually, as set out on page 88.
In summary, the Committee has the ability to reduce or forfeit awards that have yet to be paid or vest in the case of shares, to delay the payment or vesting date or to amend another form of award or benefit which has yet to be received malus adjustment.
For cash bonuses awarded for 2015 performance onwards, and long-term incentive awards granted from 2015 onwards, the Committee may also recover sums already paid to Executive Committee members if it considers it appropriate to do so clawback.
This can be applied during a two-year period after receipt in the case of cash bonuses or vesting in the case of long-term incentives.
The circumstances in which malus and clawback may apply are outlined in the table below: Malus adjustment Clawback Material financial misstatement of results for any financial year or Material financial loss of a business unit as a result of the material financial loss under-performance of a business unit circumstances that should reasonably have been risk-managed that could have been reasonably risk-managed by the individual Error or material misstatement leading to an overpayment Material error or financial misstatement of results which has resulted in an overpayment Employee misconduct, including regulatory or other breaches Gross or serious employee misconduct.
Legitimate concerns regarding an employees conduct, capability or performance Actions leading to reputational damage Deterioration in the financial health of the Company leading to severe financial constraint Any other situation as the Committee may reasonably determine.

Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2018 This section outlines how the Committee intends to implement the Directors Remuneration Policy during 2018.
The following charts illustrate how Executive Directors remuneration potential changes according to varying levels of performance achievement, and the balance between fixed and variable remuneration.
The Committees aim is that superior levels of remuneration will only be paid in return for delivering superior levels of performance.
The variable element is fully flexible such that no award is guaranteed.
The assumptions used in preparing these charts are noted in the following table.
Stephen Hester Scott Egan 6,000 6,000 5,329 5,000 5,000 4,000 4,000 44% 3,645 3,000 3,000 2,626 40% 2,000 2,000 30% 1,776 42% 1,378 22% 38% 1,000 1,000 33% 650 25% 100% 38% 26% 0 37% 25% 0 100% Maximum Below threshold On-target Maximum Below threshold On-target Fixed remuneration Variable remuneration short term Fixed remuneration Variable remuneration short term Variable remuneration long term Variable remuneration long term RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 81 000 000 Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Basis of calculation Below threshold scenario On-target scenario Maximum scenario Scott Egan Fixed remuneration Fixed remuneration Annual Bonus 80% of salary Annual Bonus 160% of salary LTIP 125% of salary LTIP 200% of salary Minimum remuneration receivable: this assumes 62.5% vesting, this assumes 100% Fixed remuneration includes the i. e. half-way between the vesting of the award value of base salary and pension 25% threshold vesting and in the 2018-20 grant for 2018, and benefits based on 100% maximum vesting the value included in the total Stephen Hester Fixed remuneration Fixed remuneration remuneration single figure for 2017 Annual Bonus 80% of salary Annual Bonus 160% of salary Annual Bonus 0% of salary LTIP 144% of salary LTIP 230% of salary this assumes 62.5% vesting, this assumes 100% LTIP 0% of salary i. e. half-way between the vesting of the award 25% threshold vesting and in the 2018-20 grant 100% maximum vesting Note: 1.
There are no assumptions relating to share price growth or dividend equivalents included in the above scenarios.
The remuneration structure is intended to promote the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The table below illustrates when each variable component of the Executive Directors remuneration package would be delivered to them once any performance conditions or other restrictions have ended.
Variable remuneration component 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Clawback may apply Annual Bonus Plan 2018: cash award Malus adjustment may apply Annual Bonus Plan 2018: deferred shares Malus adjustment may apply Share retention period, clawback may apply LTIP 2018-20: performance share award Year of cash bonus award, or share award granting Year of share award vesting Year when any restrictions or clawback provisions have ended Base salary, benefits and pension The Committee reviewed the Executive Director salary levels, taking into account the average reviews applied elsewhere in the Group, including those for employees subject to collective bargaining agreements, and UK inflation figures.
It referenced a range of information including market data from two benchmarking peer groups of listed international insurers and FTSE companies of a broadly comparable market capitalisation to RSA, excluding banks and heavy industries.
The table below shows the salaries that will apply from 1 April 2018.
The level of increase is in line with those for other UK-based employees this year: Annual base salary effective Annual base salary effective Director 1 April 2017 1 April 2018 % change Scott Egan 538,125 548,888 2% Stephen Hester 993,225 1,013,090 2% In respect of benefits and pension, the Policy will continue to be implemented the same way as it was at the end of 2017.
82 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Directors and Corporate Governance Report How will incentives be aligned to the business strategy in 2018?
The table below shows how the business strategy, and the key performance indicators which underpin it, are reflected in the Annual Bonus Plan and long-term incentive performance measures for Executive Directors in 2018: Strategic priorities Annual Bonus Plan 2018 Long-term incentive cycle 2018-20 Group underlying ROTE Shareholder Relative TSR returns Group underlying PBT Profitability Group underlying ROTE Group COR Underlying Performance Business Scorecard: Underlying Performance: Attritional loss ratio, total controllable costs cost ratios, key business improvement projects: Risk and Risk and Resilience: Regulatory capital ratios, credit rating, capital actions, risk management: Resilience Business Sustainability: Customer franchise and other relevant actions related to the Companys long-term success Business including People and Corporate Responsibility Sustainability Annual Bonus Plan 2018 The Annual Bonus Plan is aligned with the core priorities for focus in 2018.
The Executive Directors will be expected to deliver against stretching targets, which are geared towards making continued performance improvement.
They are targeted against the performance of the entire Group, taking into account their contribution thereto.
The Business Scorecard component focuses on key areas of management activity essential to the success of the Company including Underlying Performance, Risk and Resilience and Business Sustainability including Customer franchise.
The Personal Scorecard consists of SMART objectives bespoke to each Director, with a focus on both what is achieved and how goals are delivered.
Half of the total bonus will be awarded in cash where clawback can apply, the balance is deferred into shares for a three-year period where malus adjustment can apply.
The Committee will assess performance for 2018 once the financial year has ended, taking into account material risk factors.
All of the bonus targets are considered to be commercially sensitive because they signal the Groups forward plan for the year, and therefore they are not provided in this document.
Disclosure will be provided in the 2018 Directors Remuneration Report, to the extent that the targets do not remain commercially sensitive.
The table below sets out the structure of the Executive Directors bonus plan for 2018: Weighting Maximum opportunity Bonus performance measures % of bonus % of salary Group underlying Return on Tangible Equity ROTE 20% 32% Group underlying Profit before Tax PBT 10% 16% Group COR 10% 16% Business Scorecard 30% 48% Personal Scorecard 30% 48% Total 100% 160% Long-term incentive 2018-20 The plan directly supports the building of shareholder value by targeting Group underlying Return on Tangible Equity ROTE, relative Total Shareholder Return TSR and a Business Scorecard.
For the 2018 grant, performance measures will be assessed against a performance period of 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020, taking into account underlying business performance and material risk factors.
The Business Scorecard measures and assessment will be operated similarly to the 2017-19 LTIP cycle, as described on page 77.
In contrast to the Business Scorecard in the 2018 Annual Bonus, which will capture calendar year actions and outcomes relative to RSAs business plan, the long-term incentive Scorecard will capture progress over three years vs the Companys strategy and three-year Operating Plans.
Its specific targets cannot be disclosed prospectively for commercial reasons, including price sensitivity.
A performance narrative will be given regarding the level of vesting on the Scorecard once the performance conditions have been tested.
RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 83 Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued The Committee has approved in principle that Stephen Hesters Performance Share opportunity in the 2018-20 LTIP grant will be 230% of salary at maximum vesting, which is the usual level of award for the Group Chief Executive: and that Scott Egans opportunity will be 200% of salary at maximum vesting.
Executive Directors must retain all vested shares arising from this incentive plan for two years post-vesting except those sold to cover statutory deductions, and they are subject to the Groups Clawback Policy.
The table below summarises the LTIPs structure.
Performance measures 201820 Weighting Threshold target: 25% vesting Maximum target: 100% vesting 1 Relative TSR RSAs TSR is equal to the RSAs TSR outperforms the unweighted index unweighted index of of comparators by at least 7% per annum comparators 22.5% compound over three years or exceeds the TSR of the highest performing company in the index 2 Group underlying ROTE 12% 18% Business Scorecard Commercially sensitive Commercially sensitive Notes: 1.
The TSR index of comparators for this cycle includes: Admiral, Allianz, Aviva, Chubb, Direct Line, Gjensidige Forsikring, Hiscox, Intact, Mapfre, QBE, Topdanmark, Tryg and Zurich.
The average required for on-target vesting 62.5% vesting is set in line with, and therefore signals, the Groups forward plan for the period and for this reason is considered commercially sensitive.
Non-Executive Directors fees The Committee reviewed the Chairmans fee in accordance with the Remuneration Policy, and did so referencing a range of information including market data on fees taken from the same peer groups used to benchmark the Executive Directors salaries, UK inflation figures and the average reviews applied elsewhere in the Group.
An increase of 2% will be applied effective from 1 April 2018, moving the fee from 420,000 to 428,400.
Under the Companys Articles of Association, the Non-Executive Directors remuneration is determined by the Board, within limits set by shareholders.
The Chairman and Board minus the Non-Executive Directors discharges its accountability for setting and managing Non-Executive Directors remuneration: it will do this when their contractual terms or fee structure are under consideration, which is typically once a year, as noted on page 92.
The Company reviewed the Non-Executive Directors fees in accordance with the Remuneration Policy and the fees effective from 1 April 2018 are shown in the following table.
Fee structure From 1 January 2017 From 1 April 2018 Base fee 62,500 64,000 Additional fee for chairing committees: Group Audit Committee 20,000 20,000 Group Remuneration Committee 20,000 20,000 Group Investment Committee 12,500 12,500 Board Risk Committee 20,000 20,000 Additional fee for Senior Independent Director 20,000 20,000 1 Additional committee fee 5,000 5,000 Note: 1.
A fee of 5,000 applies for each committee a Non-Executive Director is a member of other than as Committee Chairman.
