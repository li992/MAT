COM 91 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The Directors Remuneration Report sets out how the Directors Remuneration Policy was put into practice in 2017 and how it will be implemented in 2018.
It is divided into three sections: Section 1: Single Figure Tables Section 2: Further information on 2017 remuneration Section 3: Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2018 The auditors have reported on certain sections of this Report and stated whether, in their opinion, those sections have been properly prepared.
Those sections which have been subject to audit are clearly indicated with an asterisk.
The Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 25 April 2017 and is available on the Companys website at www.
A summary of the key provisions for each element of the Remuneration Policy is set out on pages 108 to 113.
Section 1: Single Figure Tables This section contains the single figure tables showing 2017 remuneration for the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors and information that relates directly to the composition of these figures.
All figures highlighted in GREEN in the Remuneration Report relate directly to a figure that is found in the Single Figure Table, table 58.
Executive Directors remuneration: Single Figure Table Table 58 below shows the remuneration of the Executive Directors for the year ended 31 December 2017, and the comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Timon Drakesmith received an increase of approximately 9.3%.
As reported last year, this exceptional award was approved by the Committee in recognition of the additional responsibilities taken on by Timon Drakesmith including responsibility for the Premium Outlets business and the investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets.
Benefits Taxable benefits include a car allowance, private health insurance and permanent health insurance.
Jean-Philippe Mouton receives a seniority allowance, welfare and subsistence contributions.
UK Executive Directors participated in the Companys all-employee share plan arrangements SIP and Sharesave.
There was no award of SIP free shares to participants during 2017 which is reflected in the decreased benefits figure this year.
Jean-Philippe Mouton participated in a profit-sharing scheme in France and receives an employers contribution to a French employee saving scheme.
The Remuneration Committee used its discretion to approve a payment of 16,181 in relation to Timon Drakesmiths 2012 Sharesave Plan, the options for which lapsed on 1 November 2017, as he was unable to exercise them due to his being included on an insider list in relation to the intu transaction at the end of the exercise window.
92 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Annual bonus for 2017 The Annual Incentive Plan AIP is the Companys annual bonus scheme.
The bonus awards are based on the performance conditions that were set at the start of the financial year.
This is split 70% for performance against financial measures and 30% for performance against personal objectives.
The Committee also considers every year the overall vesting AIP outcome as determined by achievement against the financial and personal targets to check that the bonus level is appropriate given the Companys performance during the year.
The performance targets were not disclosed in advance of the year, as they were considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive information, but full details of the conditions and performance against them are now set out below.
A summary of the Remuneration Policy for the AIP and DBSS is on page 109.
The following tables Tables 59, 60 and 61 show the AIP outcomes and achievement against AIP performance targets for 2017.

Each of the AIP performance conditions is subject to a straight-line payment scale between entry, on-target and full vesting points.
Adjusted EPS is the Groups underlying adjusted profit divided by the average number of shares in issue.
The TPR performance is measured against a composite index comprising the IPD Annual Retail Property Indices for the UK and a bespoke Europe Index weighted on a 60:40 basis.
The annual data for these indices is not available at the date of this report.
Accordingly, the closing measurement for TPR for the year to 31 December 2017 is based on managements best estimate using available data see page 52 for property returns data.
The AIP is not paid until the confirmed data for these indices is available.
The actual outcome will be disclosed in the 2018 Annual Report.
Net Rental Income NRI is the percentage growth in the Group net rental income, calculated on a like-for-like basis.
COM 93 Directors remuneration report continued Achievement against personal objectives 30% weighting Personal objectives focus on the delivery of the Business Plan, strategic elements for 2017 refer to Our Strategy on page 16, an assessment of behaviours based on the Companys values and the Executive Directors capability in managing colleagues to maximise their contribution.
Personal objectives also incorporate environmental, social and governance parameters where appropriate and the assessment in 2017 considered progress to expand on diversity and inclusion plans and the commitment to progress sustainability measures.

Bonus deferral under the AIP The AIP amounts earned for 2017 will be paid 60% in cash and 40% in the form of a deferred share award granted under the DBSS.
The deferred share award is granted in two tranches: the DBSS A award relates to the bonus achieved against the EPS, NRI and personal objectives measures: and the DBSS B award relates to the TPR measure and so is only granted once the TPR result is known and at the same time as that cash element is paid.
Each award is granted with a face value equal to 40% of the bonus achieved against the relevant measures, over a number of shares calculated based on the average mid-market closing share price of a share over the five dealing days prior to the date of grant.
Details of the DBSS A and B awards granted in 2018 will be included in next years Annual Report.
94 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Long-Term Incentive Plan The Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP is an award programme for Executive Directors designed to incentivise the creation of long-term returns for shareholders.
Performance under the LTIP is assessed over differing performance periods.
TSR is assessed over a period of four years from thedate of grant, and TPR and EPS are assessed over a period of four financial years commencing with the financial year in which the award is granted.
The Single Figure Table for 2017 is required to report the value of the LTIP element for which the performance period ends during 2017.
Consequently, the LTIP values shown in the Single Figure Table comprise the value of the TSR element of the 2013 award where the performance period ended 1 April 2017 and the TPR and EPS elements of the 2014 award where the performance period ended 31 December 2017.
Achievement against targets The following table shows the level of performance achieved against the targets set for the three performance components that drive the 2017 LTIP vesting value as shown in the Single Figure Table.

The element dependent on TPR is estimated as the IPD data regarding TPR performance is not available at the date of the Annual Report.
The number of shares includes any notional dividend shares awarded to date.
The actual number of shares that vest may increase by the amount of any notional dividend shares awarded up to the date of vesting of the award.
The value shown is based on the average of the mid-market closing price of a share for each dealing day in the three-month period to 31December 2017 527.4p.
The actual value that vests, based on the closing share price on the vesting date, will be disclosed in next years Annual Report.
COM 95 Directors remuneration report continued Pension Executive Directors receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension benefits.
David Atkins and Peter Cole each receive a salary supplement of 30% of base salary.
Timon Drakesmith receives a salary supplement of 20% of base salary.
Jean-Philippe Mouton receives a salary supplement of 80,000 2016: 80,000 and a legacy collective supplementary defined benefit scheme contribution of 12,648 2016: 12,449 which is included in his total shown below.
All salary supplements paid to Executive Directors in lieu of pension benefits are subject to deductions required for income tax and social security contributions in the UK and France.
Salary supplements and the pension benefit received by Jean-Philippe Mouton do not qualify for AIP purposes or entitlements under the LTIP.
Information on the accrued pension benefits for David Atkins and Peter Cole under the Companys closed defined benefit scheme is on page 106.

In the 2016 Annual Report, the TPR element of AIP was estimated at IPD 2.3%, resulting in an estimated payout level at 100% for that measure.
The final closing measurement for TPR during 2016 was IPD 1.7%, resulting in a final payout level of 88.8%.
The final payout levels disclosed for 2016 are therefore less than the estimated levels reported last year.
The estimated TPR outcome for the 2016 LTIP figure was IPD 2.0% resulting in an estimated payout level of 100% for that measure.
The full vesting target was IPD 1.5%.
The actual TPR outcome was IPD 1.8% and therefore the final payout levels were the same as the estimated level reported last year.
In addition the 2016 LTIP figure contained a value for the TPR and EPS portions of the 2013 LTIP where the performance period ended on 31December 2016 and was calculated based on the average share price over the three months to 31 December 2016.
The 2016 LTIP figure in the Single Figure Table on page 92 has therefore been adjusted to reflect the actual share price of 593.50p on the vesting date 9 May 2017.
Sterling:Euro exchange rates Jean-Philippe Moutons salary, benefits, annual bonus and pension contributions are paid in euro.
When converted, the sterling equivalent will vary with currency movements.
The amounts paid are shown in the Single Figure Table converted into sterling using the average exchange rate for 2017 1:1.141.

A copy of the full Remuneration Policy is available on the Companys website www.
In implementing the Remuneration Policy, the Committee will continue to take into account factors such as remuneration packages available within comparable companies, the Companys overall performance, internal relativities, achievement of corporate objectives, individual performance and experience, published views of institutional investors, general market and wider economic trends.

This is in line with other senior executives but less than increases in salaries awarded across the Group which were generally in the region of 3%, reflecting the view that the Executive Directors and the senior management team should demonstrate personal leadership in a cost conscious environment.
Factors influencing the increases included the effect of inflation and evidence of salaries within the real estate sector.
The increases take effect from 1 April 2018.

Generally, the more senior the individual, the greater the variable pay offer as a proportion of overall pay due to the ability of senior managers to impact more directly upon Company performance.
As well as assessing the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors, the Committee reviews the remuneration of the senior management team and is kept informed of remuneration developments across the Group including the salary increases and employee benefits of the wider employee population.
In accordance with prevailing commercial practice, the Committee does not consult with employees in preparing the remuneration policy.
Summary of 2018 remuneration structure for employees below Board level Table 88 Element Approach Policy Base salary An assessment is made each year on pay increases across the Group.
The assessment may include bench marking exercises for different roles.
Other factors taken into consideration are Company performance, competition in the market place and general economic climate, specifically rates of inflation and wage growth.
Pay increases are expected to be in line with market rate and any increase awarded to an individual will reflect competence and experience.
Exceptional pay increases are sometimes awarded to bring pay in line with market practice or recognition of an individuals development within a role.
More usually exceptional personal performance is recognised through variable pay.
For 2018, base salary budgets have been set on average at 3% for all employees below Board and senior management team level.
Annual bonus An annual cash bonus scheme is operated throughout the Group.
Although there are some minor differences in application of the scheme according to jurisdiction of employment, the same principle applies to all employees in that there is an opportunity to receive a bonus based on personal or company performance or a mixture of both.
Generally, the more senior the employee the more the weighting is towards Company performance.
The maximum cash bonus opportunity varies according to seniority.
For more senior employees a certain proportion of the award may be deferred into shares.
Pension The pension offering forms an important part of the reward package across the Group.
All employees may participate in one of a number of defined contribution pension arrangements across the UK, France and Ireland.
Employee and employer contribution structures vary depending on the scheme.
Share schemes A variety of all-employee and discretionary share schemes are in operation across the Group.
Generally, where local legislation allows, eligible employees may participate in an all-employee share scheme such as the Sharesave scheme operated in the UK and Ireland.
In addition a number of UK employees have the opportunity to join the UK Share Incentive Plan with the potential for an annual SIP Free Share Award based on Company stretch performance.
No Free Share Award was made in 2017.
Employees of Hammerson France are eligible to participate in a profit share plan which rewards performance against certain performance measures.
Employee benefits Benefits offered by the Group include life assurance, private medical care, car allowances, permanent health insurance and health checks.
The offer of a particular benefit to an employee will depend on location within the business, their role and seniority.
