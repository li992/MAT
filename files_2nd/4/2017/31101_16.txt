Why are the current annual bonus performance measures appropriate for Capco?
Measure Reason Growth in Net Asset Value Considered by the Committee to be the most important driver of value creation for Capco at the present time.
per share Relative Total Property Return Rewards the additional portfolio value created by management over and above any changes in value from tracking the property market as a whole, as measured by the IPD Total Return All Property Index, an external benchmark widely used in the property industry.
Underlying Earnings Per Share Rewards value growth in net rental income as well as the management of financing and other costs.
Given the current stage of the Companys development, the Committee considers EPS to be relatively less relevant as an indicator of value creation than growth in Net Asset Value per share.
However, the focus on this metric has been increased for 2018.
