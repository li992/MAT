For these purposes shareholder return represents the theoretical growth in value of a shareholding over a specific period, assuming that dividends are reinvested to purchase additional shares.
The Company is a constituent of the FTSE 250 index and, accordingly, this is considered to be the most appropriate benchmark.

The Directors feel that this group of people is the most appropriate as a comparator because employee pay is determined annually by the Committee at the same time as that of the CEO and under the same economic circumstances.
The Directors believe this demonstrates the best link between the changes in average remuneration compared to the CEO.
