JONATHAN BROOKS CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE On behalf of your Board, I am pleased to present our The Committee considers that these outcomes reflect Directors Remuneration Report DRR for the year the Committees pay for performance principles and ended 31 December 2017. the stretching, objective incentive targets.
We provide transparent disclosure of our annual bonus 2017 Performance and performance targets on both a retrospective and, incentive out-turns where appropriate, prospective basis.
Details of the The Groups Return on Hard NAV for 2017 was annual bonus targets for 2017 and forward-looking 64.1m, a significant improvement on the negative targets for 2018 are contained in this report.
The acquisition of Touchstone completed in October 2017.
The Committee decided Remuneration Principles that the one-off acquisition and restructuring costs of The enlargement of the Group in 2017 necessitated 9.1m relating to the Touchstone combination as well a review of our existing approach across the entire as the 0.3m uplift in the Touchstone NAV between senior management team to ensure our principles completion and 31 December 2017 should be excluded of remuneration continued to be appropriate.
We from the determination of the Return on Hard NAV have reviewed our remuneration approach and are for the purposes of the 2017 award.
The resulting AIS pleased to conclude that, in general terms, the existing outturn for 2017 is 57.3% of maximum opportunity.
remuneration principles did not require fundamental change though it was necessary to rebalance the In contrast, the cumulative three-year return on the incentive components of remuneration for some senior Groups Hard NAV did not meet the 8% per annum managers as well as modifying the blend of individual threshold target for the Groups 2015 LTIP awards and team performance targets in determining AIS scheduled to vest in March 2018.
No changes were proposed, however, for actual absolute Total Shareholder Return TSR the longer term incentive plans, which for executive performance period for the 2015 LTIP awards runs until directors and managers remains the LTIP, while those 31 March 2018, based on the Groups share price at the employees most able to influence portfolio company date of this report, the minimum 8% annualised return performance excluding Executive Directors also has not been met.
As a result, it is currently anticipated participate in the Long Term Incentive Carry Scheme that none of the 2015 awards will vest.

Although the Group increased significantly in size and complexity during 2017, the Committee decided that increases in base salaries for 2018 should not exceed the average increase awarded to other UK-based employees at this juncture.
Instead it decided to review the salaries of the executive directors only after all of the organisational changes associated with the enlargement of the Group had been established.
The Committee therefore expects to review the Executive Directors remuneration in the second half of 2018 to ensure they remain market-competitive.
The average increase in base salaries for employees in 2018 is 4%.
The Committee has determined that the base pay increases for the executive directors, to be implemented in April 2018, will be lower than the average for the wider employee population as follows: y The CEOs base salary will be increased by 3.8% to 415,000: y The other Executive Directors salaries will be increased by 3.8% to 275,000.
More detail on the executive director salary increases is set out on page 88.

Committee Chairmanship As I described in last years report, my intention was to stand down as Chair of the Remuneration Committee during 2017.
The Nominations Committee have now determined that Professor Lynn Gladden, who has been a member of the Remuneration Committee since 2014, will assume the role of Chair with effect from the date of the Groups 2018 AGM.
I will remain a member of the Committee and look forward to continuing to work with Professor Gladden to further develop and monitor the Groups remuneration strategy.
Approval of the Remuneration Report in 2017 The 2016 Directors Remuneration Report received 98.9% of votes cast in favour at our AGM in May 2017 and, while this indicated a strong level of support, the Group remains as committed as ever to engagement and transparency and I welcome the opportunity for continued discussion of the Groups remuneration with any shareholder, either at our AGM or at any other time during the year.
I know that Professor Gladden shares this view and would herself welcome discussion on the Groups remuneration.

ii Scheme interest represents the percentage of the relevant pool of investments in respect of which the participant is entitled to participate in the realised profits assuming the relevant hurdle return has been met.
iii The schemes contain forfeiture provisions over the investment period of the fund which may reduce the scheme interest accruing to any participant.

As part of the arrangements for the acquisition of Fusion IP plc, Mr Baynes Fusion IP LTIP awards were converted into awards over IP Group shares at the same conversion price per share as the scheme of arrangement was undertaken 0.446 IP Group plc shares for every Fusion IP plc share.
The awards were originally due to vest on 31 December 2017 provided certain performance conditions were met which relate to, inter alia, the growth in value of Fusion IP plcs net asset value Fusion NAV from the date of acquisition and the continued employment of the individual by the Group.
In summary, if Fusion NAV growth of 10% per annum is achieved then 30% of an award shall vest.
Maximum vesting will occur if Fusion NAV growth of 20% per annum is achieved with straight-line vesting between 30% and 100% if Fusion NAV growth of 10%-20% per annum is achieved.
The options expired on 31 December 2017 as the vesting criteria had not been met.

Where an executive director accepts an appointment to the board of a company in which the Group is a shareholder, the Group generally retains the related fees.
In the circumstances where the executive director receives such fees directly, such sums are generally deducted from their base salary from the Group.
Fees earned for directorships of companies in which the Group does not have a shareholding are normally retained by the relevant director.
Any outside appointments i. e. excluding those companies in which the Group is a shareholder held by executive directors are set out on page 97.
Limits on the number of shares used to satisfy share awards dilution limits All of the Groups incentive schemes that contain an element that may be satisfied in IP Group shares incorporate provisions that in any ten-year period ending on the relevant date of grant, the maximum number of the Shares that may be issued or issuable under all such schemes shall not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time.
