com 69 Governance Directors remuneration report continued 1.
A description of how the Company intends to implement the above policy for 2018 is set out in the annual report on remuneration on pages 72 to 73.
The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is designed with regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole and is consistent between the Executive Directors and the remainder of the workforce.
The annual bonus plan operates on a similar profit-driven basis across the Group and there is a relatively high level of employee share ownership.
The key differences in policy for Executive Directors relate to participating in the LTIP awards, which have strict vesting conditions.
This is considered appropriate to provide a link for a proportion of performance pay with the longer-term strategy thereby creating stronger alignment of interest with shareholders.
The 2018 annual bonus is focused on profit before taxation PBT performance.
PBT is a key financial metric and is used to reflect how successful the Company has been in managing its operations.
The LTIP performance measures, EPS and TSR reward significant long-term returns to shareholders and long-term financial growth.
EPS growth is derived from the audited financial statements while TSR performance is monitored on the committees behalf by New Bridge Street.
Targets are set on a sliding scale that takes account of internal strategic planning and external market expectations for the Company.
Only modest rewards are available for achieving threshold performance with maximum rewards requiring substantial out-performance of challenging strategic plans approved at the start of each year.
The committee operates the annual bonus and LTIPs according to their respective rules, and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules whererelevant.
Consistent with market practice, the committee retains flexibility and discretions in a number of key areas.
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors remuneration policy, authority was given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into in the previous remuneration policy or with current or former Directors such as, the payment of a pension or the vesting or exercise of past share awards that have been disclosed in previous remuneration reports.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.
Directors remuneration scenarios The Companys remuneration policy results in a proportionate breakdown of total remuneration such that, in line with most other wholesale brokerage and agency companies, a very high proportion of the package is performance-related.
The charts below show an estimate of the potential remuneration payable to the Executive Directors in office on 1 January 2018 at different levels of performance.
The charts highlight that the performance-related elements of the package comprise a highly significant portion of the Executive Directors total remuneration at target and maximum performance.

Basic salary levels applying on 1 January 2018.
The value of taxable benefits is estimated at 2017 values.
The value of the pension receivable is up to 15% of basic salary.
Minimum performance assumes no award is earned under the annual bonus plan and no vesting is achieved under the LTIP.
On target performance assumes an annual bonus calculated by reference to market expectations at the start of 2018 and 50% being achieved under the LTIP.
Maximum performance assumes profit before taxation outperforms consensus and full vesting under the LTIP.
It should, however, be noted that there is in fact no upper limit as explained on page 68 and the above charts are purely for illustrative purposes.
Share price movement has been excluded from the above analysis.
70 CLARKSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Strategic report Financial statements Other information Directors recruitment and promotions The committee has the objective to attract and retain the best talent in our markets, while at the same time ensuring executive pay is aligned to the corporate plan and business goals as well as supporting the interests of shareholders.
If a new Executive Director was appointed, a capped bonus scheme will apply and any bonus would only be payable to the extent there is sufficient value to do so in the profit-based pool.
An LTIP award could be made shortly following an appointment assuming the Company is not in a close period.
Flexibility is retained to offer remuneration on appointment in respect of remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
The committee will look to replicate the arrangements being forfeited as closely as possible and, in doing so, will take account of relevant factors including the nature of the deferred remuneration, performance conditions and the time over which they would have vested or been paid.
The initial notice period for a service contract may be longer than the policy of one year, provided it reduces to one year within a short space of time.
For an internal appointment, any ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
The committee may also agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and incidental expenses as appropriate.
Directors service contracts and payments for loss of office The committee reviews the contractual terms for Executive Directors in light of developments in best practice and trends in our sector.
The remuneration-related elements of the current contracts for Executive Directors are shown in the table below: Provision Detailed terms One year by the Company or the Director.
Notice period Chief Executive Officer: Termination The Company may elect to pay in lieu of notice: payment an amount equivalent to 12 months base salary plus the cost of contractual benefits: plus an amount equivalent to 50% of the last bonus received.
In addition: if not already paid, any bonus in respect of the prior year is payable if not agreed, an amount equal to the last bonus received : and a pro-rated bonus for the period of the year worked is payable.
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer: The Company may elect to pay in lieu of notice: an amount equivalent to base salary, benefits and bonus for the relevant period of notice.
President of Broking and Investment Banking: The Company may elect to pay in lieu of notice: an amount equivalent to base salary and contractual benefits for the relevant period of notice only.
The committee recognises that it is unusual in the context of listed PLCs to pay an amount in lieu of annual bonus for the notice period for the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer but considers that the policy is appropriate for the following reasons: salary forms a lower proportion of remuneration than in most other UK companies: typically, in the shipbroking industry, income from business conducted is received over a number of years in arrears: bonuses are only payable if profit thresholds and targets are achieved i. e. there is no automatic entitlement to a bonus: and unvested awards under the LTIP are capable of vesting only subject to performance.
For unvested entitlements to share awards under the 2014 Clarkson LTIP, where a participant ceases to be employed by the Group due to ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, a sale of his employing company or business or for any other reason at the discretion of the committee good leaver circumstance, then he will be entitled to keep his award as described below: performance-related awards will normally vest at the normal vesting dates unless the committee determines that they should vest upon cessation subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions and time pro-rating unless the committee decides to disapply time pro-rating.
In the case of death or ill-health, awards will vest at cessation subject to the relevant performance conditions: and deferred bonus awards will vest in full.
com 71 Governance Directors remuneration report continued Provision Detailed terms Chief Executive Officer: Change If, within 18 months of a change of control, the Company gives the Chief Executive Officer notice except for reasons of gross of control misconduct or material breach of contract or the Chief Executive Officer gives notice as a result of a material breach of his contract or the Company limits his ability to earn future bonuses, the Chief Executive Officer will, within 30 days of termination, receive an amount equivalent to one years basic salary, 150% of the last annual bonus received and the gross annual value of contractual benefits pro-rated.
In these circumstances, the Chief Executive Officers notice period is reduced to four weeks.
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer: Within one year of a change of control, the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer or the Company may give notice of not less than four weeks in the case of the former whereupon he will receive immediately an amount equivalent to one years basic salary, contractual benefits, employer pension contributions and annual bonus.
President of Broking and Investment Banking: No change of control provisions exist.
All unvested awards under the 2014 Clarkson LTIP would vest.
In respect of performancerelated awards, the extent of vesting would be subject to any performance conditions having been achieved and any time pro-rating applied at the discretion of the committee.
In August 2008 it was contractually agreed with the current Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Woyda, that no time pro-rating will be applied to his LTIP awards.
The committee recognises that it is now unusual, in the context of listed PLCs, for service contracts to contain change of control provisions and will therefore seek to avoid such provisions for future executive appointments to the Board.

Annual bonus for 2018 For 2018, the annual bonus opportunity will remain on the same basis as previous years and will continue to be based on a bonus pool derived from Group profit before taxation as follows: below a profit floor set by the committee no bonus is triggered: and above the floor, an escalating percentage of profits is payable into a bonus pool for progressively higher profit before taxation performance.
Profit for bonus calculations may be adjusted by the committee where appropriate and do not include mark-to-market valuations or business that has not been invoiced.
As in 2017, the share of the executive bonus pool allocated to the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer will, in part, be determined by performance against a series of non-financial, strategic and operational objectives.
The profit floor and challenges for 2018 have not been disclosed on a prospective basis as these are considered to be commercially sensitive although disclosure will be provided retrospectively.
The threshold and maximum targets are higher than those that applied for 2017.
Consistent with the policy applied to the majority of senior employees, 90% of the bonus payable will be paid in cash with 10% deferred into restricted shares vesting four years after grant.
Executive Directors have agreed to this deferral, although they have no contractual obligation to defer bonuses.
Clawback provisions will continue to apply in circumstances of misstatement or error.
72 CLARKSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Strategic report Financial statements Other information Long-term incentive awards to be granted in 2018 Consistent with past practice, it is envisaged that: Executive Directors will receive LTIP awards over shares worth up to 150% of salary in 2018: the vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Companys EPS for 31 December 2020, as shown in chart i below.
The EPS for 2017 is shown grey line for reference: and the vesting of the remaining 50% will be determined by the Companys TSR performance from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020 against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts, as shown in chart ii below.
The level of TSR achieved against the FTSE 250 Index over the last three-year cycle is shown grey line for reference.
EPS and relative TSR are considered to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance for the Group, in that they ensure executives are incentivised and rewarded for the earnings performance of the Group as well as returning value to shareholders.
The awards will be subject to clawback provisions and a two-year post-vesting holding period.
