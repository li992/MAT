| 80 Our governance Our governance The link between remuneration and strategy As set out in the Strategic Report, the Group has a clear set of strategic priorities designed to drive the business towards medium term targets and to enhance shareholder value.
These priorities include people satisfaction, customer satisfaction, a healthy and safe working environment, and enhanced shareholder returns through increased profitability, ROCE and total shareholder return.
Our medium term targets, to be achieved by 2020, include 4 Star customer satisfaction measured by the Home Builders Federation survey score, 4,000 completions per annum, a 23% gross margin, administration expenses of no more than 5% of revenue, a three and a half to four year land bank, delivery of a minimum of 180 million net cash from balance sheet restructuring, and delivery of circa 25% ROCE via a focus on profitability and balance sheet optimisation.
Underlining its commitment to increasing the efficiency of the balance sheet, the Group has announced its intention to return surplus capital to shareholders in the form of special dividends totalling 180 million in the three years to 2020.
The link between remuneration and the strategic priorities and medium term targets has been carefully considered by the Committee, including the importance of driving behaviours that underpin the culture of the business and enable it to succeed.
Our medium term targets are supported and progress measured by reference to the Groups reported KPIs of pre-tax profit, operating margin, net cash, ROCE, earnings per share, private and affordable completions, the HBF customer satisfaction score, plots added to the land bank, and involuntary staff turnover, the majority of which feature in the Groups incentive schemes.
Annual bonus arrangements link to the Groups near term strategic priorities and, for 2018, the Committee selected operating margin and legal completion profile measures to sit alongside the profit before tax and customer satisfaction performance measures.
Margin improvement is critical to achievement of circa 25% ROCE by 2020 and the legal completion measure will help support a more controlled phasing of completions and assist in managing capital employed.
The LTIP takes a longer term perspective and 2017 awards saw the introduction of the HBF customer satisfaction survey score as a performance measure, in addition to the financial and share price performance measures of relative total shareholder return, earnings per share and ROCE.
The 2018 awards will use the same performance measures, with customer satisfaction reducing from one third to one quarter of the award and the usual financial and share price based metrics being used for the balance.
Balance sheet optimisation and reduction in capital employed, creating the potential to return capital to shareholders, is incentivised across all levels of senior management via the Project 200 Incentive Plan.
The CEO and GFD do not participate in the Plan, although the same measures and targets will be used to determine how much of the GFDs exceptional 2018 LTIP award of 75% of basic salary will vest.
Key remuneration decisions during 2017 During 2017, the Committee agreed severance terms for the former CEO and agreed remuneration arrangements for the Interim CEO and, subsequently, for the new CEO, including the granting to him of share awards following their approval at a General Meeting.
It set targets for the 2017 annual bonus shown on page 84 and approved 2016 bonus payments.
It also set targets for and approved LTIP awards made in 2017 and approved the level of vesting for the 2014 LTIP awards.
Malus and clawback provisions for incentive awards were strengthened and a two year post vesting holding period for LTIP awards was introduced, both from 2017 onwards.
The Committee also established the Project 200 Incentive Plan and granted awards to senior management, excluding the executive directors.
A consultation with shareholders took place in early 2018 as to the participation of the Group Finance Director in the Project 200 Incentive Plan.
Having listened to the views of shareholders and considered the outcome of the consultation, the Committee decided that it would not be appropriate to submit the Plan for shareholder approval and would instead grant an exceptional award under the LTIP to the GFD at 200% of basic salary, with the intention that the GFD be motivated to support the delivery of the balance sheet optimisation programme via the additional element above 125% of basic salary being measured against the Project 200 Incentive Plan cash generation and capital employed metrics.
The Committee also completed the 2018 remuneration review, which included consideration of the link between executive remuneration and pay and employment conditions throughout the Group including the general proposals for staff for 2018.

It has been determined by the Committees assessment of his leadership of the review of strategy and will be paid entirely in shares, to be released in April 2020 and subject to continued employment until April 2019.

8 The bonus for Earl Sibley as Group Finance Director was assessed on the reported performance with profit before tax and ROCE p erformance adjusted for the total exceptional items of 6.8 million relating to bid defence costs of 2.8 million and restructuring costs of 4 million in order to ensure consistency with the basis on which the original targets were set.
The total outturn for this element of bonus against the performance targets was 58.6%, applied to a pro-rated salary of 350,000 for the full year.
As explained on page 84 in recognition of his exceptional contribution as Interim CEO, the Committee determined to exercise its discretion to award him an additional bonus of 15% of his pro-rated salary.
36.4k of the total bonus will be delivered in shares, deferred for two years.
Greg Fitzgerald is non-executive Chairman of Baker Estates Limited, for which he received no fee during the year, and non-executive Chairman of Ardent Hire Solutions Limited, for which his personal service company receives fees of 115,000 per annum.

The 2017 Bonus is in lieu of his participation in the 2017 annual bonus and was to be determined by the Committees assessment of his leadership of the review of strategy and structure, ensuring his focus on the priorities for shareholders, in the period from his appointment to 31 December 2017, see page 86 for further information, including how the number of shares was calculated.
The Committee considered Gregs achievement since taking the role of CEO in April 2017 to have been exceptional.
In less than nine months he had achieved a full operational turnaround of the business with the development of our housing sites now well planned and efficiently managed to hand over quality product that delights our customers.
There has been a root and branch review of the overhead structure of the business with some functions now outsourced.
The appropriateness of all aspects of the balance sheet has been examined with the land bank reduced commensurate with a revised forward build strategy, stock and work-in-progress managed much more efficiently, and non-contributing assets earmarked for disposal, and in many cases, sold by the end of the year.
The business regional operating structure has been reassessed, along with its management, whilst site management, and the terms we offer, has been reviewed with the aim of our attracting and retaining the best in the industry.
As evidence of his achievement the Company delivered the operating and financial outturn that had been projected for 2017 with strong internal discipline and the business well positioned to show further improvement in 2018.
As a consequence the Committee determined that Gregs 2017 Bonus should vest in full with effect from 31 December 2017.
The shares will be released on 18 April 2020, subject to his continued employment until 18 April 2019.
The maximum opportunity for the Group Finance Director for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 100% of salary, unchanged from previous years.
Provisions that enable the recovery of sums paid clawback were strengthened for 2017 onwards, as set out in the policy table.
A breakdown of the performance against the measurement criteria is shown below.
Focussing on the need for the Group to reset the business during the year and drive operational priorities, the Committee adjusted the balance of financial and non-financial metrics from 70%:30% for 2016 to 50%:50% for 2017.
The Committee then agreed that an operational gateway would apply to the Home Builders Federation HBF survey score customer satisfaction measure, so that at least 70% customer satisfaction was achieved before either of the financial measures could pay out.
The HBF survey year runs from October to September and, following the operational difficulties at the end of 2016, the Committee decided that measurement for the 2017 bonus should run from February to September 2017 to provide an appropriate window and level of incentive to drive improvement.
A quantifiable measure was also introduced for build programme delivery, to place operational focus on controlled delivery of quality homes in accordance with build programme targets.
In addition, the Committee agreed that, should above target performance be achieved for the financial measures, payment would be in the form of shares for the above target element, with a two year holding period.
All targets were set at the beginning of April 2017 following the fundamental review of the Groups operational processes and controls.

Alongside Greg Fitzgerald he had been instrumental in developing the turnaround strategy launched in September 2017 which had been well received recognising its relevance and clarity.
Consistency of reporting had much improved across the group whilst Earl had played a leading role in reducing capital employed both as a principal leader educating and reinforcing the change of mindset, but also himself taking charge of many of the specific cash initiatives.
The Group is now well placed to achieve its targeted overhead of 5% with Earl again leading on many of the Group-wide cost reduction initiatives.
Without Earls contribution the Committee felt that the Group would not have achieved the progress it had during the year and awarded him 90% of the award designated to these objectives.
For Earls contribution as interim CEO for the three months or so between David Ritchies resignation and Greg Fitzgeralds appointment the Committee considered that he had surpassed expectations of what could be achieved against a very difficult backdrop of the Group having fallen significantly short of market expectations for 2016 and also being in receipt of two unsolicited approaches.
With enormous energy and strong leadership he took personal charge of resolving the issues the business had created for its customers in the run up to the end of 2016, at the same time focussing management on reassessing all aspects of its operations, in particular its build quality and customer service, to develop a programme of work that would address past deficiencies and reset the business to deliver quality houses efficiently and cost-effectively.
Earls achievement as interim CEO created the platform on which Greg Fitzgerald then built so successfully once he joined the business.
The Committee considered that recognising this achievement as just one of five personal objectives gave insufficient credit to what he had contributed to the business and, therefore, determined to use its discretion to award him an additional bonus of 15% of salary in this regard.

Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan Long term incentive awards are made in the form of performance shares or nil-cost options under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting.
Each award is made subject to the achievement of performance criteria as set out below and will ordinarily vest after three years.
A two year holding period following vesting was introduced for the 2017 awards onwards, which extends to five years the time between awards being granted and when they can be exercised.
Provisions that enable the withholding of payment or the recovery of sums paid malus and clawback were also strengthened for 2017 awards onwards.
Discretions available to the Committee contained in the LTIP rules are set out in the policy table on page 96 and also in the exit payments policy in the remuneration policy, available on our website.
| 84 Our governance Our governance Awards vesting in respect of 2017 The LTIP awards made in 2015 were measured over the three year period to 31 December 2017 and will lapse in full.
One third of the award was measured against each of EPS performance, TSR performance against an index of the UKs leading housebuilders, and ROCE performance.
The threshold EPS target was 320p and the maximum target was 400p measured on a cumulative three year basis.
Absolute cumulative EPS over the three year performance period was 253.5p.
The threshold TSR target was performance equal to the annualised median of the index and the maximum target was performance equal to the annualised median of the index, plus 10%.
Actual TSR was 57% which was below the median of the index of 95%.
The threshold ROCE target was 19.4% and the maximum target was 23.3% measured in the third year of the performance period 2017.
Awards granted during 2017 audited For the 2017 awards, the Committee decided to introduce customer satisfaction as a performance measure, using the HBF customer satisfaction survey score rating, alongside the financial and share price performance measures.
The financial and share price measures comprise two thirds of awards and the customer satisfaction measure, which is independently and objectively assessed, makes up one third.
An award of 111,972 shares was made to Greg Fitzgerald at 200% of basic salary in accordance with the circular to shareholders dated 7 April 2017 at a grant price of 11.61 on 8 September 2017.
The award is subject to a three year performance period ending on 31 December 2019 and exercisable in 2022, following a two year holding period, as follows: Number Face value % of face value of shares of award that would vest at Executive director Type of award awarded 000 threshold Greg Fitzgerald Performance share award 111,972 1,300 20 1 An award of 49,342 shares was made to Earl Sibley at 125% of basic salary at a grant price of 7.60 the closing middle market share price on 21 February 2017 on 8 September 2017, subject to a three year performance period ending on 31 December 2019 and exercisable in 2022, following a two year holding period, as follows: Number Face value % of face value of shares of award that would vest at Executive director Type of award awarded 000 threshold 1 Earl Sibley Performance share award 49,342 375 20 1 The Groups usual practice is to make the main grant of awards for a current year following the announcement of the results for the preceding year.
The granting of the 2017 awards was delayed from 21 February 2017, being the day following the announcement of the 2016 results, pending the completion of the strategic and structural review, and the subsequent determination of performance measures and targets by the Committee.
As circumstances delayed the granting of awards until 8 September 2017, the Committee determined to use the closing middle market share price on 21 February 2017 for the grant to all employees including the GFD but excluding the CEO, as would have been the case had the awards been granted in accordance with usual practice.
Therefore for the GFD, the face value of the shares on the date of award was 572,860.
The performance measures for all 2017 awards are Customer Satisfaction 33.3%, TSR 22.2%, EPS 22.2% and ROCE 22.2%.
6.67% of the total award vests for achieving threshold performance for any of the financial and share price performance measures.
The proportion of the total award relating to the customer satisfaction measure lapses in its entirety should the performance target not be achieved.
The performance targets are: Customer satisfaction HBF customer satisfaction rating for the period October 2018 to September 2019 to be at least 4 Star 80% to 89.9%.
TSR threshold performance equal to the annualised median of the index and maximum performance equal to the annualised median of the index, plus 10% unchanged from the prior year, with the exception of the addition of Countryside Properties PLC to the comparator group.

Dividends paid to shareholders totalled 55.4 million in 2016 and 60.4 million in 2017, representing an increase of 9.0%.
Implementation of remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December 2018 Changes in the way that the remuneration policy will be implemented in 2018 versus 2017 are as follows:- Base salary increases, In the annual bonus, the addition of operating margin and legal completion profile measures, to sit alongside the profit before tax and customer satisfaction measures, and the removal of ROCE, build delivery and individual performance measures, together with a rebalancing of the weightings.
For the LTIP, the financial measures will comprise at least three quarters of awards, as opposed to two thirds, and the HBF Customer Satisfaction rating will make up one quarter.
The TSR performance target will be adjusted so that maximum performance is more closely aligned with upper quartile performance of sector peers.
The award for the Group Finance Director will include an element linked to the Project 200 Incentive Plan performance measures.
These consist of a cash target to be achieved by 31 December 2018 and net capital employed targets to be maintained over 2019 and 2020, calculated based on the closing position as at 31 December 2018.
The cash target range is currently confidential, although the threshold is 190 million, and the targets will be fully disclosed in our 2019 and 2020 directors remuneration reports.
Executive directors base salaries and benefits The salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 2018 were as follows % increase Executive directors Position 2018 base salary from 2017 Greg Fitzgerald appointed 18 04 17 CEO 666,250 2.5% Earl Sibley GFD 325,000 8.3% The salary of Greg Fitzgerald, the Chief Executive, was increased by 2.5%, in line with the wider employee population.
The Committee carefully considered the increase for Earl Sibley, in line with the phased approach set out in the 2015 Remuneration Report, and on which shareholders were previously consulted.
In summary, Earl Sibley was appointed in April 2015 on a salary of 250,000 with the expectation that his salary would be increased to an appropriate market rate for a strongly performing experienced individual over the first three years of service, subject to individual performance and increased experience.
In view of the ongoing strong performance delivered by Earl Sibley, his pace of development, increased level of experience and his contribution to the Group, including a period as Interim Chief Executive, the Committee decided to progress his salary by 8.3% for 2018, following the increase of 9.1% for 2017 and 10% for 2016.
This is the final stage of the phased approach and the Committee considers that it has contributed to his being fully motivated to meet the challenges in continuing to deliver operational improvement and the Groups strategy to the benefit of shareholders.
An allowance of just over 3% of salary roll was provided for general staff increases.
Benefits will continue on the same basis as for 2017.
| 90 Our governance 6% 4% 10% 7% 18% 13% m Our governance Approach to annual bonus Following the regular annual review, the Committee determined that, having focussed particularly in 2017 on operational delivery and customer satisfaction, the annual bonus scheme for 2018 should be adjusted to align more with our medium term targets, whilst at the same time maintaining focus on strong operational delivery and high levels of customer satisfaction.
The Committee has, therefore, adjusted the balance of financial and non-financial metrics from 50%:50% to 60%:40% and has introduced an operating margin measure in place of the ROCE measure and a legal completion profile measure in place of the quantifiable build programme delivery measure.
The weightings for the performance measures have also been rebalanced.
There is no change to quantum.
2017 Weighting 2018 Weighting Measure as a % of maximum as a % of maximum Profit before tax 20% 40% ROCE 30% n a Operating margin n a 20% Financial measures 50% 60% Customer satisfaction HBF survey score 20% 20% Build programme delivery 20% n a Legal completion profile n a 20% Individual performance 10% n a Non-financial measures 50% 40% Margin improvement is seen as critical to achieving our medium term targets for both ROCE and operating margin and the legal completion profile measure is designed to deliver more controlled phasing of completions across the year, and to drive a progressive build profile across sites and operating efficiency.
The profit measure will also link to the controlled phasing of activity across the year, as measured by the legal completion profile measure, so that, should the pay-out for the legal completion measure be below 10%, the profit measure will be subject to an equivalent reduction e. g. the legal completion profile pays out 8%: the profit measure is reduced by 2%.
The operational gateway relating to the Home Builders Federation HBF survey score customer satisfaction measure continues to apply, such that at least 70% customer satisfaction must be achieved before any of the bonus measures can pay out, as opposed to only the financial measures.
Provisions that enable the withholding of payment or the recovery of sums paid malus and clawback apply to the annual bonus in circumstances of i a serious misstatement of results: ii an error in assessing a performance condition or in the information on which the award was granted: iii serious misconduct: iv a material failure of risk management: v serious reputational damage: or vi any other circumstances that the Committee considers to be similar in nature or effect.
Malus can apply prior to the bonus payment date and clawback can apply for a two year period thereafter.
| Bovis Homes Group PLC 91 Remuneration report The Committee has decided not to disclose the detail of performance targets in advance as they are considered commercially sensitive, being closely indicative of the Groups strategy, but will disclose them retrospectively in the 2018 annual remuneration report.
The 2018 performance measures and weightings are described below.
Measure Rationale link to strategy % weighting Financial measures 60% Profit before tax Explicitly ties reward to financial performance.
40% Challenges management to deliver and out-perform profit target, with a link to the controlled phasing of completions.
Operating margin Aligns the way the business is managed with interests of 20% shareholders in challenging management to increase operating margin and hence profitability.
Non-financial measures 40% Legal completion profile Improving build operating practices and delivering quality homes in a 20% phased completion profile is key to operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, reputation and future success.
Measured by delivery against the legal completion profile agreed as part of the annual business plan.
Customer satisfaction Quality of service is key to reputation and future success, both in 20% terms of customer demand and achieved selling prices.
Measured by the HBF survey score for legal completions between 1 October 2017 and 30 September 2018.
Total opportunity 100% Approach for Long Term Incentive Plan awards The key features of the long term incentive arrangements as outlined on page 85 are expected to remain the same as those for 2017.
The financial measures will comprise at least three quarters of awards, as opposed to two thirds, and the HBF Customer Satisfaction rating, which is independently and objectively assessed, will make up the balance.
The TSR performance target will be adjusted so that maximum performance, intended to reflect upper quartile performance against an index of the UKs leading housebuilders, is set at annualised median of the index, plus 7.5%.
Provisions that enable the withholding of payment or the recovery of sums paid malus and clawback can apply in certain circumstances as set out in the policy report.
Malus can apply prior to the award vesting date and clawback can apply for a two year period thereafter.
A two year holding period following vesting extends to five years the time between awards being granted and when they can be exercised.
As noted on page 79, the Project 200 Incentive Plan was implemented for members of the executive management team during 2017.
The Plan has been designed to support our programme of balance sheet optimisation and reduction in capital employed which, in turn, will create the potential to return capital to shareholders in the form of special dividends.
The CEO does not participate in the Plan.
However, the Committee recognised that the Plan would require specific AGM approval to enable Earl Sibley to participate.
Following extensive consultation and having considered the views of shareholders, the Committee decided that it would instead make an exceptional award of a further 75% of basic salary under the LTIP to incentivise Earls vital contribution as a leader in influencing the change of mindset the Plan is designed to achieve and in taking charge of many of the specific cash initiatives that form part of the programme of balance sheet optimisation and the Groups strategy of achieving a material improvement in the Groups Return on Capital Employed.
Achievement against this exceptional element will be entirely measured against the same cash generation and capital employed metrics as adopted within the Project 200 incentive Plan.
The exceptional award will only vest if at least 190m of additional cash is realised from specific cash initiatives of the Group by the end of 2018.
The specific cash target range is currently confidential and will be fully disclosed in the 2019 directors remuneration report.
Additionally, the exceptional award will only vest if the lower levels of capital employed at December 2018 are maintained through the subsequent two balance sheet dates.
The capital employed targets will be disclosed in the 2019 and 2020 directors remuneration reports and will be consistent with the Groups objective of delivering circa 25% Return on Capital Employed by 2020.
Although sub-optimal from the Committees perspective in not aligning Earl with senior management below the Board via participation in the Project 200 Incentive Plan, it considered the granting of an exceptional LTIP award justified given the potential to enhance shareholder value through special dividends and an improved Return on Capital Employed.

Remuneration of senior management and other below board employees In addition to responsibility for executive directors, the Committee is also involved in consideration of the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Leadership Team below the Board, in conjunction with the Chief Executive.
Alignment is delivered by ensuring that senior management and executive directors participate in the same bonus and incentive schemes as far as possible, with similar performance measures and targets.
