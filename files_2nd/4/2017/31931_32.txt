The plan for 2017 for Executive Directors and Less than RPI 3% 0.0 RPI 3% 1.0 senior executives was based on three equally weighted measures which RPI 4% 1.25 were identified by the Committee as being key indicators of performance RPI 5% 1.5 driving growth for our business and returns to our shareholders: More than RPI 5% 1.5 Revenue growth Straight-line interpolation between points Operating profit ie.
on equivalent gross basis Operating cash flow The average adjusted basic EPS growth rate was 6.2% per year over the three-year period.
RPI over the same period was 2.0% per year, which We believe the concept of threshold, target and maximum performance includes the sharp post-Brexit increase in inflation over the final months of would compromise the drive for growth so the Committee sets one clear the performance period.
The Committee agreed that the matching shares stretch target for each performance measure each year, after careful under the 2014 CIP will vest at 1.3 times on 1 September 2017, which is 87% consideration of the business plan and of consensus analyst forecasts.
Performance is measured on an adjusted basis, as reported externally, in order to capture underlying performance.
The table below sets out the Committees assessment of performance versus the three measures for the last performance period.
The Committee sets stretching targets which must be delivered to achieve the business plan and for the Executive Directors to receive the maximum bonus.
There are no payments above maximum for performance above these stretch targets.
The Committee will use its judgement to assess the level of bonus if a stretch target is not met, taking into account personal performance, the performance of the other measures, the underlying performance of the business, and other factors which the Committee considers to be material to the results achieved.
Payments are earned in direct correlation to performance achieved.

However the Committee used its discretion to pay the Executive Directors 93% of maximum, equivalent to 186% of base salary for the Group CEO and 140% for the Group COO & CFO.
60 Sky plc Governance Vesting of shares under the Executive Long Term Incentive Plan 20142017 The Executive Directors were awarded LTIPs in two tranches for the performance period 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2017, on 25 July 2014 and 29 July 2015 respectively.
The performance conditions for vesting of these awards were originally operational targets comprising 70% of the award and relative TSR performance comprising 30% of the award.
In light of the 21st Century Fox Offer, the Committee concluded that the TSR performance metric is no longer a fair measure of the Companys performance due to the effective distorting impact of the share price by the Offer, and that it would therefore be appropriate to remove TSR and have the awards vest solely based on the operational metrics.
The Committee believes that these metrics are no more difficult nor easier to achieve than the TSR conditions were intended to be in the absence of the Offer.
It also concluded that these metrics would be most appropriate to ensure that management remained focused on the key operational metrics that drive the business.
The decision applied to all holders of LTIPs in the business.
Operational targets There were three equally weighted operational performance measures, each of which was determined to be a key indicator of Skys continued success: EPS growth measures our bottom line performance Operating cash flow measures our ability to generate and manage cash Revenue growth key to our growth strategy Performance is measured on an adjusted basis, as reported externally, in order to capture underlying performance.
The Committee will make retrospective disclosure of the targets for operating cash flow and revenue growth when they are deemed to be no longer commercially sensitive.
We anticipate this to be two years after the end of the performance period.
This means that subject to the outcome of the 21st Century Fox Offer we will review disclosure of performance targets in our 2019 implementation report, with a view to publishing unless the Committee believes they are still commercially sensitive in the context of the market in which the company operates.
For EPS, two points are awarded for growth of RPI 3% per year, with the maximum ten points awarded for RPI 5% per year or more.
For operating cash flow and revenue growth, one point is awarded for 75% achievement of target on a sliding scale up to ten points for 105% or more.
One point equates to 10% of the award vesting, with maximum vesting for 21 points or more, vesting on a straight-line basis between these points.
There is no additional award for achievement above 21 points.
If the minimum range is met each year for all measures, 26% of the shares vest.
The Committee sets a high threshold vesting level in line with our policy of rewarding success not failure.
Maximum vesting is not achievable if performance is below threshold for any one measure.
To earn the minimum of one point on any one of these measures requires the achievement of 75% of target.
Missing two targets would represent a significant and disproportionate reduction in total compensation.
Annual performance measures are shown in further detail in the table below: Average EPS growth Operating cash flow Revenue growth Performance achieved Performance achieved Performance achieved Points awarded % of target Points awarded % of target Points awarded RPI 5% p. a.
0 75% 1 75% 1 Less than 75% 0 Less than 75% 0 The committee gave careful consideration to consensus analyst forecasts and the business plan before setting stretching performance targets.
Actual performance is described as follows: Revenue growth: average annual revenue growth over the three-year period was 5.6% p. a.
Operating cash flow: Average annual operating cash flow over the performance period was 1.3 billion EPS growth: actual growth in earnings per share over the three-year period was 6.2% p. a. with average RPI over the period of the scheme of 2.0% p. a.
Maximum points would have been achieved for average EPS growth of 7.0% p. a.
Actual points awarded for the period for these measures are: Actual points awarded Average EPS growth Operating cash flow Revenue growth 6.48 9.64 7.23 The total of 23.35 is in excess of the 21 points required for full vesting of the award.

Slightly below stretch target The strong performance for revenue growth and operating cash flow over the three-year performance period was sufficient to offset the slight underperformance versus the maximum for EPS growth.
The total overall vesting for the LTIP was therefore 100%.

2 Market price at date of CIP matching award was 8.64 on 31 August 2016.
Performance conditions for the Long Term Incentive Plan Awards made in July 2016 were Year 1 nil-cost awards.
That is, they relate to the three-year performance period beginning on 1 July 2016 and ending on 30 June 2019.
Vesting is subject to the following performance conditions: 1.
Operational targets 70% of the award There are three equally weighted operational performance measures, each of which is a key indicator of Skys continued success: EPS growth Operating cash flow Revenue growth Performance is measured on an adjusted basis, as reported externally, in order to capture underlying performance.
This means that we will review disclosure of performance targets in our 2021 implementation report, with a view to publishing unless the Committee believes they are still commercially sensitive in the context of the market in which the company operates.

0 75% 1 75% 1 Less than 75% 0 Less than 75% 0 The top end of the EPS growth range was set for awards in 2016 at RPI 5% p. a.
This is equivalent to absolute growth in earnings of 26% over three years if RPI is 3% a year.
This level of growth in earnings was set at a level which exceeded consensus research analysts estimates.
Relative TSR performance 30% of the award The Companys TSR performance is measured relative to the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE 100.
If the Companys TSR performance is below median, the TSR element of the award lapses in full.
For median performance, one-third of the shares subject to the TSR condition may vest, with all of the shares vesting for upper quartile performance.
Vesting is on a straight-line basis, between these points as shown below.

Performance conditions for the Co-Investment Plan CIP awards made in 2016 are subject to the performance conditions set out in the table below.
EPS growth performance Match awarded annual average growth number of matching shares over three-year term awarded per investment share Less than RPI 3% 0.0 RPI 3% 1.0 RPI 4% 1.25 RPI 5% 1.5 More than RPI 5% 1.5 Straight-line interpolation between points ie.
on equivalent gross basis Annual Report 2017 63 Median Upper Quartile Directors remuneration report Annual remuneration implementation report continued What did we pay our Executive Directors during the year?
The table below sets out total remuneration received by the Executive Directors for the financial year ended 30 June 2017 and the prior year ended 30 June 2016.
The vesting pattern of awards under the LTIP is biennial: shares vest every other year over a three-year performance period.
This means that every other year no payment is due as there is no vesting of awards.
The following year, assuming performance conditions are met, there will be a payment which covers the equivalent of two years vesting.
2017 was a year in which the LTIPs awarded for the performance period 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2017 vested, so the single figure for 2017 is higher than for 2016, which was a non-vesting year.
The average increase for employees at that time was 2.0%, rising to 2.7% for those earning less than 31,000 per year, with a range of 2% to 10% for performance, promotions and market adjustments.
2 Taxable benefits include company car or car allowance, healthcare, provision of tax advice and other expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business which are deemed to be taxable benefits on the individual.
Taxable benefits for Jeremy Darroch for 2016 have been restated to include benefits received in that year for which the cost was not known at the time.
3 Pension comprises a cash allowance in lieu of company contributions.
4 Bonus shows the full amount earned shortly after the year end in which the performance measures applied, including amounts deferred through the CIP.
The payout for the 2016 bonus was 200% of base salary for the Group CEO and 150% for the Group COO & CFO.
The figures for 2017 are 186% for the Group CEO and 140% for the Group COO & CFO, which is 93% of maximum.
The Executive Directors deferred 50% of their bonus into shares through the CIP in 2016 and it is anticipated they will do so for 2017.
5 Fixed Pay and Bonus is the total of salary, taxable benefits, pension and bonus for 2016 and 2017.
6 Long Term Incentive Plan shows the market value of the awards that vested immediately following the end of the relevant performance period.
No LTIP shares vested for the performance period ended 30 June 2016.
The figure for 2017 is the estimated value for LTIP shares which vested on 25 July 2017 using the average share price over the period 1 April 2017 to 30 June 2017 of 9.83.
7 Co-Investment Plan shows the market value of the matching shares that were exercised on 30 August 2016 with a share price of 8.60.
Previously the value of these shares was estimated using the average share price over the period 1 April to 30 June 2016 of 9.40.
It also shows the estimated value of matching shares that are due to vest on 1 September 2017, using the average share price over the period 1 April to 30 June 2017 of 9.83.
Percentage change in Group CEOs remuneration 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017 The table below shows the percentage change in Group CEO remuneration from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017 compared to the average change for all employees.

TSR performance The graph below shows the Companys TSR for the eight years to 30 June 2017, measured as the value of a 100 holding in ordinary shares at the start of the period.
The performance is shown relative to the FTSE 100, which represents the broad market index against which the Companys shares are traded.
TSR is a measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders, reflecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends.
Data is averaged over three months at the end of each financial year.
TSR against major indices 400 Sky FTSE 100 350 300 281 250 232 200 150 100 50 0 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Group CEOs remuneration The table below provides a summary of the total remuneration for the Group CEO over the past eight years including bonus payout, LTIP and CIP vesting levels.
The table highlights the unique structure of our remuneration policy, in which vesting of LTIP shares occurs every two years rather than the customary 12-month cycle.
As our LTIP awards are made as a fixed number, the realised value is purely reflective of delivery against performance measures and any share price growth over this period, keeping it aligned to shareholders interests.
It should be noted that total remuneration for 2013 includes vesting of the one-off additional LTIP award of 300,000 shares made in 2011 at the time of the then possible News Corporation bid.
The average annual total remuneration paid to the Group CEO over this eight-year period, excluding this one-off award, is 9,574,911.
2 Includes vesting of the one-off additional LTIP award of 300,000 shares made in 2011 at the time of the then possible News Corporation bid.
3 Includes value of CIP matching shares which were exercised on 30 August 2016 at 8.60, previously reported using the average share price over the period 1 April to 30 June 2016 of 9.40.
4 Includes valuation of LTIP shares that vested on 25 July 2017, and CIP shares due to vest on 1 September 2017, both using the average share price over the period 1 April to 30 June 2017 of 9.83.
