We will be seeking approval for the 2017 DRR, the new Directors Remuneration policy and the new Man Group plc share plans the Long Term Incentive Plan and Deferred Share Plan at the AGM in May 2018.
Chairmans annual statement 1.1 Introduction During the past year, we have reviewed our Directors Remuneration policy, which shareholders will be asked to approve at the AGM in May 2018.
During that review, it has been my pleasure to speak to many of our shareholders, and their representative bodies, as we have consulted widely on the most appropriate approach for executive remuneration in our business.
In proposing the new policy, under which the maximum variable opportunity is substantially reduced from the previous maximum, the Committee has sought to respond to concerns raised by the Companys shareholders.
We believe our new policy addresses More detail about both the new policy and the application of the current historical shareholder concerns and policy to the remuneration outcomes for 2017 is covered below and in the sections that follow.
Before that, I thought it was important to provide delivers a clear link between executive some context about Mans business and strategy.
This has been at the pay, company performance and centre of our thinking in developing the new policy and we have, therefore, incorporated metrics that reflect: shareholder experience i critical inputs that drive both short and long term performance: Richard Berliand ii key outputs that measure performance: and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee iii the alignment of shareholder experience with management remuneration.
Mans business today is pure asset management, providing a comprehensive and diverse suite of strategies.
The complementary approaches of those strategies work collectively to deliver better solutions for our clients and diversify risk for our business.
The Groups overall priority remains delivery of superior risk-adjusted performance for our clients which should result in their choosing to allocate further capital to the firm, driving improved profitability and value creation for our shareholders.
The combination of: net inflows, which reflects new client business: and our relative investment performance, which monitors whether our strategies are outperforming competitors, is therefore critical to our overall growth and profit delivery.
Our total profitability in any given year will be impacted by the absolute performance we deliver, particularly in products eligible for performance fees.
However, over the cycle, strong relative performance for our clients results in increased client demand and improved profitability.

The introduction of the new relative TSR measure seems to have polarised This excellent performance has been achieved despite the ongoing views amongst our shareholders with some being strong critics, and headwind from the run off of the structured product business and other others welcoming the introduction of a measure they regard as improving non-core revenues.

We have remuneration committee set a stretching maximum target of $168 million substantially reduced the maximum incentive available, both in absolute for Core Management Fee PBT in the short term annual bonus, requiring a and expected value terms.
The reduction reflects a recognition by the year-on-year growth rate of 27%.

That said, the including performance fees the Committee took into consideration the Committee also feels that it is extremely important to ensure that the range of performance fee profitability over the cycle, and did not focus remuneration for our management team remains competitive and on growth from the depressed performance in 2016.
The rebound in therefore considered the risks of being unable to attract the talent performance fees, with 2017 performance fees and gains on investments required.
It was acknowledged by the Committee that the pool from which of $333 million, was 46% above the average of the preceding five years.

This good outcome was below the maximum target set by finalising the maximum opportunity at 600% of salary reduced from 825% the Committee, reflecting the stretching nature of the overall target.
This also represents a real reduction in the expected value of variable pay, taking into account that the expected value of a forward-looking LTIP is inherently lower than the performance on grant model of the DEIP.

Remuneration for 2016, therefore, reflects four months service only.
2 Luke Ellis is a director of Ferox Master Fund and Ferox Fund Limited.
For 2016 and 2017, he received fees of $7,500 per annum in respect of these directorships.
The figures in Table R1 do not include these fees.
3 Mark Jones became CFO on 1 January 2017.
Accordingly, the remuneration that he received for the financial year ending 31 December 2016 has not been disclosed.
4 Taxable benefits include private medical insurance and gym membership subsidy.
5 See table R2 for details of the short term variable compensation.
6 Long term variable remuneration is subject to deferral under the Deferred Executive Incentive Plan.
Please refer to Tables R3 to R6 for further information.
7 Pension benefits are paid into the Man Group Self-Invested Personal Pension with any contributions exceeding the annual or lifetime allowance paid as cash on a cost neutral basis to the Company.
8 Other includes non-taxable benefits e. g. life insurance, Group income protection and fund fee rebate.
3.2 Short term annual bonus in respect of 2017 performance The short term annual cash bonus is based on the Committees assessment of executive directors performance against objectives agreed by the Board at the beginning of the year, split 75% based on quantitative metrics and 25% on qualitative performance.
The threshold, target and maximum ranges are considered to represent appropriately stretching levels of performance and are set by reference to internal budgets and strategic plans, industry backdrop and external expectations.
The targets for Core Management Fee PBT and Core PBT including performance fees have been adjusted to exclude non-core management fees relating to discontinued business in order to ensure the directors are incentivised only using stretching targets for metrics over which they have direct control.
2017 has seen the Company deliver record net inflows and broad-based performance across the business, while maintaining discipline on cost control and capital returns.
The combination of strong performance across these areas has resulted in exceptional growth in core profitability with Core Management Fee PBT increasing by 35% and performance fee profits coming in above their long term average despite a weak environment for the trend-following strategies that have historically driven Mans performance fee profits.
Table R2 shows the results of the Committees assessment of the exceptional performance delivered in 2017.

Tables R3 to R5 show the result of this assessment for the awards to be granted in 2018.
For the financial metrics, performance is normally measured against Mans financial KPIs for each of the three preceding reporting years 2015, 2016 and 2017 and then averaged.
Transition rules ensure that participants are only rewarded for performance to which they have contributed as an executive director.
Performance was measured based on 2016 and 2017 only for Luke Ellis.
The Committee considered the outcome for Mark Jones when measured only on performance delivered in 2017 and determined it was more appropriate to base the outcome on the two years ending 31 December 2017 to reflect his transition into the role of CFO from September 2016.
Consequently, the percentage achieved under the financial KPIs was reduced from 64.6% to 44.1% see below.

5.4 2017 Committee evaluation Following a mid-year review of the 2017 priority actions identified in the Committees 2016 evaluation, the Chairman undertook at the year-end a full year evaluation of the operation and effectiveness of the Committee during 2017.
The topics covered included progress on the priorities for 2017 and the conduct and outcomes of specific areas of Committee activity and focus during the year, including the support and advice available to the Committee.
In the evaluation feedback, the Committee recognised the contribution made by its new advisers since their appointment in July 2017 and the thorough process which had been undertaken to support the review of the new Directors Remuneration policy.
It had also welcomed the streamlining and rescheduling of Committee business and meetings.
The following specific areas of focus were agreed for 2018: deliver the 2017 Directors Remuneration report: continue the Committees engagement with shareholders to deliver the new Directors Remuneration policy and ensure its seamless implementation, subject to shareholder approval: review the compensation models below Board level: this area of focus previously agreed in 2017 had been deferred to allow the Committee to concentrate on developing the new Directors Remuneration policy: and keep the remuneration advice and industry knowledge available to the Committee under review as a matter of ongoing good governance.
86 Man Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 5.5 Benchmarking and peer groups Benchmarking is one of a number of factors considered by the Committee in its deliberations on remuneration as it is important that the Committee understands the level of remuneration paid by Mans competitors for similar positions and which they may be offering in the market place.
Man variously uses three separate peer groups as detailed in the tables below.
These are: 1. a group of asset managers and related businesses listed on the London Stock Exchange: 2. a group of similar businesses listed on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq: and 3. businesses within the privately owned hedge fund industry.
All three of these sources are relevant.
UK LISTED PEER GROUP US LISTED PEER GROUP PRIVATE MANAGER PEER GROUP 3i Affiliated Managers AKO 1 Aberdeen Asset Management Apollo Investment AQR Ashmore Ares Arrowgrass Close Brothers Artisan Partners Brevan Howard 2 Henderson Blackrock Bridgewater TPICAP Blackstone Capula ICG Carlyle Citadel Investec Asset Management Eaton Vance Lansdowne Partners Jupiter Federated Investors Marshall Wace 2 M&G Prudential Janus Capital Millennium Schroders KKR Two Sigma Legg Mason Winton Oaktree Capital Waddell & Reed Notes to peer companies 1 Following the merger of Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life on 14 August 2017, the peer group company to be used from 2018 onwards will be StandardLifeAberdeen 2 Following the merger of Henderson and Janus Capital on 30 May 2017, the peer group company to be used from 2018 onwards will be Janus Henderson Many of Mans senior staff are geographically mobile, particularly between London and New York, and an explicit consideration of remuneration levels in both of these geographies is relevant.
Man is one of the few listed companies anywhere in the world that operates in the hedge fund industry.
The majority of businesses in this industry are privately owned and systematic remuneration data is not publicly available.
Nevertheless, Man competes for talent against these businesses and staff move between Man and these private companies.
Man operates globally witnessed in the geographic footprint of its operations, the spread of its client base and in the breadth of assets it manages.
It also creates and distributes a wide range of products: hedge funds, long only funds and quantitative funds.
None of the companies referred to above have these same characteristics and, although some of them are larger than Man, the Committee believes that, while they are broadly comparable, Man tends to be more diverse geographically and have a wider range of fund strategies.
However, these groups share some of Mans characteristics and, in some cases, information regarding the remuneration of directors is publicly available.
The privately owned hedge fund market is made up of a large number of participants, some of them small and single product and others very large.
As noted earlier, little information is available publicly on the compensation quantum and structures in these businesses.
The senior management of those few hedge fund companies which are publicly listed are generally the founders of the original private company who retained very significant shareholdings at the time of listing.
Man endeavours to make up this gap in publicly available data by reviewing available information on privately owned peers, some of whom are listed in the table above.
Man has also obtained direct information about remuneration in those privately held companies that Man has acquired.
Interpreting peer group data and benchmarking involves a number of complexities and the Committee looks at this data to provide important market context for its decisions.
Unless otherwise stated, all information in the Directors Remuneration report is unaudited.

Directors remuneration policy 6.1 Executive directors remuneration policy Aligning the interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders and with Man Groups strategic goals is central to Man Groups remuneration policy.
During 2017, the Directors Remuneration policy has been reviewed and the proposed changes, including a significant reduction in the variable pay opportunity, discussed during detailed consultations with the Companys largest shareholders and their main representative bodies.
The principal changes proposed are: Introduction of significant deferral into Man Group plc shares and funds, once the increased shareholding requirement has been met from the annual bonus, to ensure even greater alignment with shareholders: the bonus opportunity has been reduced to 250% of salary.
Introduction of a forward-looking performance share plan the Man Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan with a range of financial metrics to be measured over a three-year performance period, with a subsequent two-year holding period: this is also intended to ensure even greater alignment with shareholders.
The maximum award is 350% of salary compared to a maximum of 467% previously reduced by the Committee from 525% for the DEIP.
An increase in shareholding requirements to 300% of salary for the CEO from 200% and 200% of salary for other executive directors from 100%, again to ensure greater alignment with shareholders.
On leaving the Man Group Board, directors will be expected to retain a shareholding for two years, with 100% retained for the first year and at least 50% for a further year.
An absolute cap on an executive directors salary of $1.1m demonstrating the Committees commitment to respond proactively to previous shareholder concerns about lack of transparency on base salary intentions.
A reduction in the pension provision available as a percentage of salary, from 20%, to align executive directors opportunity with the maximum available under the employee policy, currently 14%.
Enhanced malus and clawback provisions to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the interests of the Company and shareholders.
In line with shareholders interests being managed within a robust governance framework, the Company continues to aim to retain and incentivise high calibre executive directors: it will do this by paying competitive base salary and benefits, together with a short term annual bonus, with significant deferral, and a long term incentive plan collectively linked to a range of financial and non-financial metrics to deliver the Companys strategy and ensure alignment with shareholder interests.
This section of the report sets out the new Remuneration policy for executive and non-executive directors which will be put to shareholders for approval and, if approved, be effective from the conclusion of the 2018 AGM on 11 May 2018.

In addition, it can apply malus if the director fails to meet the required standards of fitness and propriety, the director participates in or was responsible or accountable for a material failure of risk management, or the director has caused or contributed to a material extent to censure by any regulatory authority or a significant detrimental impact on the Companys reputation.
Notes to the policy table: In implementing the above remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee shall have regard to all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the UKLA Listing Rules, the Financial Conduct Authority Remuneration Codes and to leading investor representative body guidelines.
Any commitments made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, the approval and implementation of the revised remuneration policy approved by shareholders including under the previously approved policy will be honoured.
In addition to the elements of remuneration detailed in the policy table, the Remuneration Committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a different structure in order to facilitate the recruitment of an individual, exercising the discretion available under the UKLA Listing Rules see details in the paragraph Approach to recruitment remuneration.
Where employees hold units in funds managed by the Group, the fund may rebate fees to the employee.
6.2 Illustrative pay for performance scenarios The chart below provides an illustration of some of the potential reward opportunities for executive directors in respect of the first year of the new Directors Remuneration Policy showing the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: minimum, mid-point and maximum.

The mid-point scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus a target pay-out of 50% of the maximum annual bonus and 50% vesting for the LTIP.
The maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus full pay-out of the both the annual bonus and LTIP.
The illustrations are based on initial award value and do not, therefore, reflect potential share price appreciation or any dividend equivalent received over the vesting deferral periods.
Annual bonus includes both the cash bonus and the amount of the bonus deferred.
6.3 Performance measures selection and approach to target-setting Annual objectives are set according to immediate priorities identified by the Board and management and will be reviewed and adjusted annually to reflect changing priorities.
The long term performance metrics are in line with the long term strategic focus of the Company and will be reviewed as required in line with any changes in strategic direction.
Targets will be set by reference to internal budgets and strategic plans, industry backdrop and external expectations to ensure they represent appropriately stretching levels of performance.
6.4 Differences between executive directors and employees remuneration Executive Committee members participate in an annual bonus scheme with significant levels of deferral, to align their remuneration with the long term interests of share and fund holders.
However, in line with market practice in alternative investment funds, their incentive pay-outs are uncapped.
Employee remuneration includes base salary, pension capped at 14% of salary and benefits which include private health, subsidised gym membership, the opportunity to participate in charitable activities during working hours and a range of flexible benefits which can be purchased from salary, an annual performance bonus and, for senior contributors, long term share and fund-based deferrals.
The level of deferral increases as total compensation increases.
This provides alignment with shareholders and the future performance of the Company and with the interests of investors in funds managed by the Company.
Sales staff have a specific bonus scheme to incentivise appropriate asset raising and retention, whilst aligning interests on costs.
6.5 Approach to recruitment remuneration External appointment APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION TABLE R25 Component Approach Maximum grant value Base salary Base salary will be determined to provide competitive total compensation in relation to $1.1m relevant market practice, experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and their current compensation.
1 Pension Pension contributions or an equivalent cash supplement will normally be set in line with 14% of salary existing policy.
Benefits Benefits may include but are not limited to private medical insurance, life assurance, n a permanent health insurance, Group income protection and any necessary relocation expenses.
Sharesave New appointees will be eligible to participate in any all-employee share schemes the n a Company offers.
Annual Bonus The remuneration structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with 250% of salary the relevant maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment overthe year.
Long term Incentive Plan New appointees may be granted awards under the long term incentive plan, on the same 350% of salary terms as other executive directors, as described in the policy table including in respect of the first part-year of service.
Notes 1 The directors maximum pension contribution is aligned to the maximum available to all employees, currently 14% of salary In determining the appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both Man Group and its shareholders.
With respect to a new appointment, the Remuneration Committee may buy out incentive arrangements, including bonuses, forgone on leaving a previous employer, and awards made under such buy out arrangements may be in addition to the remuneration outlined in the table above.
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to those incentive arrangements and the likelihood of those conditions being met.
In defining the size of this buy out award, the Remuneration Committee would ensure that its fair value is no higher than the fair value of the incentive arrangements forgone.
The Remuneration Committee may also consider it appropriate to structure any such buy out award differently to the structure described in the policy table including whether appropriate performance conditions should apply, exercising the discretion available under the UKLA Listing Rules.
The Remuneration Committee does not intend that such buy out awards will be made as a matter of routine: on the contrary, although the Remuneration Committee cannot anticipate every circumstance which it might face in the future, it is expected that any such awards made under the UKLA Listing Rules will only be contemplated in exceptional circumstances, will be reviewed and approved by the full Board and described fully in the subsequent years DRR.
Man Group plc Annual Report 2017 91 Corporate governance DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Internal appointment For the appointment of a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the Remuneration Committees approach will be consistent with the policy for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the Board, the Company will continue to honour these commitments.
6.6 Service contracts and exit payment policy SERVICE CONTRACTS TABLE R26 Element Condition Contract dates Luke Ellis: 1 September 2016 Mark Jones: 1 January 2017 Jonathan Sorrell: 28 September 2012 Current appointment No fixed term Notice period by either Company or director Luke Ellis: 12 months Mark Jones: 6 months Jonathan Sorrell: 6 months The Companys policy is that notice periods will not exceed 12 months Contractual entitlement to fixed bonus or shareNone based incentive Provisions for contract termination Under all contracts the Company can opt to terminate immediately by making a payment in lieu of the notice period or part of it.
Luke Ellis contract requires payment of base salary only in lieu.
Jonathan Sorrells contract requires payment of base salary plus the value of pension contributions or alternative cash allowance and certain other insured benefits in lieu.
Mark Jones contract requires payment of base salary plus a cash sum in lieu of pension contributions and other insured benefits.
Payments in lieu are to be made in monthly instalments unless the Company and the executive director agree otherwise.
Unless the Company decides otherwise the executive directors have a duty to mitigate their losses arising from termination of their employment in which case any replacement earnings earned in what would otherwise have been the notice period would reduce the obligation on the Company to make payments in lieu.
Annual Bonus The service contracts do not oblige the Company to pay any bonus to executive directors and bonuses are awarded at the Remuneration Committees discretion.
Payment of any bonus is conditional upon the executive director being in employment and not under notice at the payment date, except in certain good leaver circumstances.
Where the director is deemed to be a good leaver, deferred bonus awards are retained by participants and release would follow the normal vesting schedule except in the case of death where the Remuneration Committee may allow early vesting.
The treatment will be decided by the Committee taking into account the circumstances of the departure including the performance of the executive director.
Long Term Incentive Plan The treatment of long term awards is governed by the relevant Plan rules, as approved by shareholders.
Where an individuals employment terminates, the LTIP rules provide for unvested long term incentive awards to lapse except as set out below: Under the LTIP rules, where an individual is determined to be a good leaver, unvested long term incentive awards will vest at the normal vesting date subject to performance against applicable performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, pro-rating for time.
Any Committee determination will take into account a number of considerations, in particular performance and other circumstances relating to their termination of employment.
Good leaver reasons include death, retirement, ill-health, injury or disability, redundancy, sale of the Company or business in which the individual was employed and cessation of employment on terms agreed with the Company.
The Remuneration Committee may also decide, in its discretion, to grant good leaver status in other circumstances and will take into account the reason for leaving and the executive directors performance up to the date employment ceases.
Where the post-departure shareholding requirements have not been met, after exit post-vesting holding periods will continue to apply.
The treatment in relation to DEIP awards is as set out in the policy approved in 2015.
92 Man Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements To protect Man Groups business interests the executive directors service contracts contain covenants which restrict the executives ability to solicit or deal with clients and their ability to solicit senior employees.
Luke Ellis has also entered into a broader non-compete covenant for an agreed period post termination.
Further, the Board has the right, at its discretion, to require Jonathan Sorrell and Mark Jones to comply with a broader non-compete covenant for up to six months post termination to provide additional protection for the Company.
If the Board exercises this right, the Company will pay an additional amount up to six months base salary and the value of pension contributions or alternative cash allowance and certain other insured benefits so that they are not left without income during the time when the Board wishes the non-compete to operate.
This amount is paid in two equal instalments and is reduced by any payments made in lieu of notice.
The Company may make a contribution to reasonable legal fees and provide outplacement services in connection with termination of a directors contract.
Executive directors service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.
6.7 External appointments With the approval of the Board in each case, and subject to the overriding requirements of the Company, executive directors may accept a limited number of external appointments as non-executive directors of other companies and retain any fees received.
Details of external directorships held by executive directors, including associated fees, are provided in the Directors Remuneration report for the relevant year.
6.8 Non-executive directors remuneration policy Non-executive directors have formal letters of appointment.
The Chairman has a contract with the Company which provides that his appointment is terminable on six months notice and Dame Katharine Barkers letter of appointment contains a three month notice period.
The letters of appointment of the other existing non-executive directors do not contain any notice provisions or provision for compensation in the event of early termination, but it is intended that all future non-executive directors will be given a three month notice period.
The Boards policy is to appoint non-executive directors for an initial three-year term, subject to retirement and reappointment by shareholders annually at the AGM, which may be followed by a further three years by mutual agreement.
Any further extension will be subject to rigorous review.
The initial dates of appointment of the non-executive directors to the Board are shown on pages 45 to 47 of this 2017 Annual Report, and their current fee levels are provided in the DRR on page 79.
Non-executive directors are encouraged to build a shareholding in the Company.

Man Group plc Annual Report 2017 93 Corporate governance DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 6.10 Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company In assessing executive director remuneration, internal relativities within the Company are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee.
These internal reviews cover the individual elements of base salaries, benefits and total compensation.
6.11 Consideration of shareholder views The Remuneration Committee values engagement with shareholders and their representative bodies and has consulted extensively in developing this policy to be put to shareholders for approval at the 2018 AGM.
The consultation covered the structure of remuneration, the appropriate maximum opportunity, in the context of the current executive remuneration environment and the industry sector, as well as the short and long term measures and weightings in the incentive arrangements.
In arriving at the policy presented for approval here, the views of a majority of shareholders have been considered and, we believe, reflected in the final Directors Remuneration policy.
