Malus adjustments and clawback apply to all variable pay: 98 Virgin Money Group Annual Report 2017 I Directors Remuneration Report Summary of Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors Base salary Purpose and link to strategy Base salary reflects the role of the individual taking account of responsibilities and experience.
Operation Base salaries are normally reviewed annually.
When determining and reviewing base salaries, the Committee considers: corporate and individual performance: the skills, experience and responsibilities of the Executive Director and their market value: the scope and size of the role: base salary increases for colleagues throughout the Group: and external market factors.
Maximum potential Whilst there is no maximum base salary, any salary increases in percentage terms will normally be in line with increases awarded to other colleagues, but may be higher in certain circumstances.
The circumstances may include but are not limited to: where a new Executive Director has been appointed at a lower salary, higher increases may be awarded over an initial period as the Executive Director gains experience in the role: where there has been an increase in the scope or responsibility of an Executive Directors role: or where a salary has fallen significantly below market positioning given current size and scale of the Group.
Base salary levels may be amended to take into account any regulatory changes.
Performance measures N A Fixed Allowance Purpose and link to strategy To ensure that total fixed remuneration is commensurate with the role and to provide a competitive reward package for Executive Directors with an appropriate balance of fixed and variable remuneration.

The Fixed Allowance is not pensionable.

Performance measures N A Annual Bonus and Deferred Bonus Share Plan Purpose and link to strategy The annual bonus is designed to reward performance, scored against annual weighted financial and non-financial measures.
Operation Annual bonuses are discretionary and are based on Group and individual performance within the year.
The determination of measures and their weighting are set annually and awards are determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the financial year.
The Committee has discretion, in exceptional circumstances, to amend targets, measures, or number of shares under award if an event happens for example a major transaction or capital raising that in the opinion of the Committee, causes the annual targets or measures to no longer be appropriate or such adjustment to be reasonable.
The Committee also has the discretion to reduce the vesting level of any award if it deems that the outcome is not consistent with performance delivered.
The annual bonus may be delivered partly in cash and partly deferred into cash, shares or other instruments.
The mechanism for making the bonus deferral is the Deferred Bonus Share Plan DBSP.
Deferral levels are set at the time of award and in line with regulatory requirements.
At present this means that at least 60% of total variable pay is deferred, at least 50% of variable pay is paid in shares or other instruments, and vested shares post taxation are subject to a retention period.
The deferral and holding periods may be amended to take into account any regulatory changes over the life of the policy.
The Remuneration Committee may adjust awards or amend the terms of the awards in accordance with the DBSP rules.
At the time of the shares being released and as long as this remains permissible under the regulatory rules, Executive Directors may receive an amount in cash or in shares equal to the dividends paid or payable between the date of grant and the vesting of the award on the number of shares which have vested.
All awards will be subject to malus and clawback provisions.
Maximum potential The normal maximum bonus for Executive Directors is 100% of fixed pay.
Under the DBSP rules, there is scope to award a bonus up to 300% of total fixed remuneration in exceptional circumstances, normally linked with recruitment.

Performance measures Performance measures are determined by the Remuneration Committee each year.
At least 50% of the annual bonus opportunity is based on performance against key financial measures determined at the beginning of each financial year.
The remainder of the annual bonus is based on performance against non-financial measures, which will normally include a scorecard of brand, culture, control measures and personal strategic objectives.
