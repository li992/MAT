Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration outcomes align with delivery of the first year of the turnaround Dear Shareholder I would like to set out how the Remuneration Committee has determined the outcome of remuneration decisions for the Executive Directors, along with how we intend to implement our Remuneration Policy in 2018.
As outlined earlier in this report, 2017 has been a critical year of transition.
TheCommittee has, throughout 2017, been focused on the key issue of pay forperformance and ensuring that the performance metrics against which our Executive Directors and senior management team are assessed, are closely aligned with our turnaround strategy and to the commitments given to our shareholders during the Rights Issue process.
During the year we have welcomed a new Board member to the Committee, John McAdam.
General Norton Schwartz also joined us earlyin 2018.
Remuneration Policy Shareholders were asked to approve a new Remuneration Policy at our AGM in April 2017.
Given the degree of change in the business at the time, both in terms of key executives and business challenges, the Committee determined that it was not the right time to be undertaking a significant overhaul of pay.
Instead, some minor revisions were incorporated to reflect developing best practice.
The Committee is conscious that our new executive team should have time to thoroughly embed the new strategic direction for Cobham, and that pay should then align fully with this direction.
Given timings, we will continue to operate under our 2017 Policy for 2018, with the expectation that a thorough review of remuneration will be performed during 2018, with the potential for a new Policy to be presented to shareholders at the 2019 AGM.
Some modest changes which we are making to our arrangements are set out in more detail in the 2018 remuneration framework section below.
How company performance during the year is reflected in the remuneration outcome The Committees primary focus was to ensure that the targets set for the 2017 annual bonus and LTI were fully aligned with the commitments made to shareholders at the time of the May 2017 Rights Issue.
Recognising the review of the Balance Sheet and re-baselining of the financial plan by the incoming CEO and CFO at the start of 2017, the Committee gave particular scrutiny to Salaries for all the setting these 2017 targets to ensure these were appropriately stretching.
Executive team will With that backdrop, the CEO and CFOs bonus targets were set to achieve, at threshold payout, an operating profit of 200m and an operating cash remain unchanged flow of100m.
in 2018 In line with the reported performance of the Group, the CEO and CFO have therefore achieved a 2017 bonus award at 81.1% and 79.6% respectively of the maximum opportunity of 150%.
Further details on the bonus performance measures are given later in this report.
The Committee deferred setting the LTI targets until May to ensure that the targets set fairly reflected the outcome of the Rights Issue and that the CEO and CFO would therefore receive no benefit from the short term volatility in the share price.
No salary increases for the Executive Directors or fee increases for the Chairman and Non-executive Directors have been made during 2017.

would be based at Wimborne his predecessor had been based in London.
The Board believed it was important that both the CEO and CFO be based at Leaving arrangements for the departing CEO and CFO Wimborne to enable them to drive the necessary re-structuring and culture In line with our disciplined approach to the principle of pay for performance, change and provide the visible senior leadership that the Group required.
neither of the departing CEO or CFO received any payment in respect of their 2016 annual bonus, and all outstanding incentive awards lapsed on cessation of It was agreed that the CEO would permanently relocate to Wimborne in 2017 employment.
Full details of the leaving arrangements are detailed on page 69. and the Company provided an appropriate relocation package to support this.
The CFO is not able to permanently relocate so the Committee agreed to Key issues to be addressed by the Committee during 2018 provide funding to support the CFOs costs of working from Wimborne.
The Committee will undertake a detailed review of remuneration strategy to address aligning reward at all levels of the Group with delivering the next phase The Board has seen a significant improvement in senior leadership and wider of the turnaround.
employee engagement, as evidenced by a recent senior staff survey, so the Committee are satisfied these relocation expenses are justified.
Comment on stakeholder engagement conducted I will write to our top 20 shareholders in March 2018 to engage with 2018 remuneration framework them regarding the LTI targets for 2018 set by the Committee.
We would As outlined above, substantial changes are not proposed to the overall expect greater engagement in 2018 as part of the Remuneration remuneration framework for Executive Directors, which is considered to remain Policy strategy review.
Instead, the Committee has taken the opportunity to review whether any minor modifications are required to ensure that we Conclusion continue to align pay with performance.
Throughout 2017, as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I have sought to ensure that we exercise rigour and discipline in all remuneration decisions During internal discussion over the course of 2017, there was consensus that and have continued the drive for transparency.
The priority for 2018 will be to the performance measures under the LTI should be refined to ensure that they ensure that the remuneration structure supports the evolving strategy as the align with the key areas of focus communicated to the market.
In particular, the Group works through the turnaround.
Committee considers that the long term incentive framework should reflect the importance to Cobham at the current time of earnings progression, margin improvement and cash generation.
As such, the 2018 LTI awards will be based on an even split of underlying EPS growth and cumulative free cash flow.
TheCommittee considers that EPS remains the single most important financial Alison Wood metric for the business, encompassing the aggregate impacts of revenue Remuneration Committee Chair growth, operating margin progression and financing costs.
Meanwhile cash 1 March 2018 flow reflects the importance of this measure to the business over the next fewyears.
These performance conditions are subject to a quality of earnings assessment, under which awards will not vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company.
This provides assurance that achievement of the EPS and cash flow targets does not put at risk the ability of the Company to generate sustainable future value.
We recognise that some shareholders may question the removal of relative Total Shareholder Return TSR from the framework.
On balance though, the Committee believes that its attractions are outweighed by a number of challenges that it presents for Cobham: selecting a relevant comparator group is difficult given that Cobham has few direct peers: it can reward share price volatility, rather than the incremental growth that we are aiming to deliver: and it provides limited line-of-sight for participants.
Given this, we consider that replacing it with more strategically relevant financial measures for 2018 is a positive step.
