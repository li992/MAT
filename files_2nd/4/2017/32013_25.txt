Salary Salary increases to be applied in the year ending 30 June 2018 As outlined in the 2016 Annual report on remuneration, base salaries for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer were increased by 2%, effective from 1 October 2016.
In June 2017, the Remuneration Committee reviewed base salaries for senior management and agreed new salaries which will apply from 1 October 2017.
In determining these salaries, the Remuneration Committee took into consideration a number of factors including general employee salary budgets and employment conditions, individual performance and experience, and salary positioning relative to internal and external peers.
The overall budgeted salary increase for the salary review in October 2017 is 2.5% of base salary for employees in the United Kingdom and 3% in North America.
The Committee considered very carefully the total remuneration positioning of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, the salary budget for all employees in the United Kingdom and the expectations of shareholders with respect to continuing pay restraint.
As a result, it was agreed that there would be a 2% salary increase for both the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer, effective from 1 October 2017.

The vesting outcomes will be disclosed in the 2019 annual report.
80 DIAGEO ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Directors remuneration report The face value of each award has been calculated using the award price at the time of grant.
In accordance with the rules, the number of performance shares and share options granted under the DLTIP was calculated by using the average closing share price for the last six months of the preceding financial year 1861 pence for ordinary shares and $106.96 for ADRs.
In accordance with the plan rules, the exercise price was calculated using the average closing share price of the three days preceding the grant date 2113 pence for ordinary shares and $113.66 for ADRs.
The share price on the date of grant was 2126.5 pence for ordinary shares and $115.77 for ADRs.
DLTIP awards to be made in the year ending 30 June 2018 The long-term incentive plan measures are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are selected to reward long-term consistent performance in line with Diageos business strategy and to create alignment with the delivery of value for shareholders.
The Committee has ensured that the incentive structure for senior management does not raise environmental, social and governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The Committee has considered the mix and appropriateness of performance measures under the DLTIP, in view of the uncertainty of the tax environment and the unpredictability of the effective tax rate in years to come.
As a result, for DLTIP awards to be granted in September 2017, the measure on earnings per share eps growth will be replaced with one on profit before exceptional items and tax PBET growth, and the allocation of measures between the performance share and share option elements of the plan will be shifted, as outlined in the table below.
Eligibility 2016 DLTIP awards 2017 DLTIP awards Share options Executive Directors 100% on adjusted eps growth 50% on relative TSR vs peer group and Executive Committee 50% on organic PBET growth Executive Directors, 1 3rd on Relative TSR vs peer group 1 3rd on organic PBET growth Performance shares Executive Committee 1 3rd on cumulative free cash flow 1 3rd on cumulative free cash flow & senior leaders 1 3rd on organic net sales growth 1 3rd on organic net sales growth The performance share element of the DLTIP applies to the Executive Committee and the top 50 senior leaders across the organisation worldwide, whilst the share option element is applicable to a much smaller population comprising only members of the Executive Committee.
The structure for the performance share element of DLTIP using PBET instead of relative TSR will embed a focus on long-term earnings growth deeper in the organisation.
This enables performance to be driven against a measure that the senior leadership group can directly influence.
Relative TSR, which reflects the value of share price growth plus dividends, is still seen as an important measure of long-term performance, and one that provides alignment with shareholder value, and this measure will therefore be retained under the share option element of the DLTIP, where it is a more appropriate focal point for the Executive Committee.
It is proposed to also introduce PBET under the share option element of DLTIP to provide a more balanced view of long-term performance by capturing both internal and external, and relative and absolute performance.
Although the impact of any changes to the tax rate will not be directly incentivised under the DLTIP, management of the tax rate will continue to be part of the accountabilities of the Chief Financial Officer and the Head of Group Tax.
The table below outlines the targets and the vesting profile for these awards to the Executive Directors and the relative weightings of each performance measure as a percentage of the total award in performance share equivalents.
Performance will be tested over three financial years, beginning with the year ending 30 June 2018.
