Governance Directors Remuneration Report 2017 Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for 2017.
As you are no doubt aware, once again the management team have excelled in delivering a further period of continuing substantial growth for the Company.
I would like to take this opportunity to provide you with an overview of the major decisions that the Committee has taken during 2017 and to provide the context in which these decisions were taken.
Our strategy centred on increasing capacity, growing our capabilities and expanding our geographic reach continues to deliver significant and sustainable long-term growth.
In 2017, we have delivered against all these strategic objectives.
We have materially expanded our market position beyond the UAE, now having operations in 13 countries.
In addition, we have continued to improve the operational efficiency of our facilities and maintained a disciplined approach to EBITDA growth.
This strategy has delivered long-term double digit sales and earnings growth driving the increased market value which is demonstrated in the chart shown here that provides a succinct view of our performance since 2012.
The chart below shows NMCs TSR growth since mid-2012, compared to the median and upper quartile TSR growth of the current FTSE 150 over the same period.
TSR PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE FTSE 150 1,600 1,200 1,000 800 600 400 200 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 NMC Health Median Upper quartile NMC is recognised for, and committed to, delivering high quality standards in our facilities and we are similarly proud of our quality performance in 2017, which in turn ensures our value creation for shareholders is sustainable over the long-term.
To sustain these levels of performance, remuneration must be competitive to attract and retain the appropriate talent to grow our business.
We place a strong emphasis on linking pay to performance, particularly performance that benefits the Group over the longer-term and reflects our core remuneration principles.
OUR REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES Alignment between executives and long-term shareholders Focus on long-term value creation Transparency in our approach to remuneration In 2016, we introduced a new Remuneration Policy.
This years Remuneration Report shows how we applied the Policy, closely aligning executive pay with performance.

V. CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT 2017 2017 was another year of strong performance.
We successfully delivered EBITDA of US$353.4m, on a revenue base that grew 31.3% to US$1.6bn over 2016-2017.
Our market capitalisation is now 7.1b, as of the end of February 2018.
Quality measures are also key to a healthcare business, and we are proud that we now have 7 JCI accredited hospitals across the Group and these facilities achieved excellent ratings against JCI performance measures.
Given this excellent performance, further details of which are provided in the business overview and financial review sections on pages 21 and 24 of this annual report, the Remuneration Committee has approved 100% of the bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive Officer 200% of salary, Executive Vice Chairman 175% of salary, and the Chief Investment Officer 150% of salary.
Awards for the latter two Directors are pro-rated for their length of service in the year.
In line with our principle of transparency, we have provided a detailed summary of the measures and targets associated with these STIP outcomes on page 66.
In respect of vesting under the 2015 LTIP, performance is assessed against three-year relative TSR and three-year compound annual growth in EPS.
Our TSR for this period was 509.26% significantly ahead of the peer group median and upper quartile of 4.83% and 50.71%, respectively with compound annual growth in EPS of 30.23%.
This strong level of performance has, unsurprisingly, resulted in 100% of the 2015 LTIP awards vesting.
EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION IN 2017 Notwithstanding the Companys performance, the Committee is acutely conscious of how executive remuneration remains under close scrutiny in the public arena and we therefore carefully consider how our executives are paid.
While our performance justifies the incentive outcomes detailed above, we believe the Committee has exercised both restraint in remuneration decisions, as well as enhanced disclosure over the course of 2017.
This is evidenced in the following ways: CEO SALARY REMAINS UNCHANGED No change to the Chief Executive Officers base salary.
Prasanth Manghat assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer in March of 2017 and along with the management team, has made an outstanding contribution to the Companys success.
Despite this promotion and associated increase in his role scope, the Committee did not make any adjustment to his fixed or variable remuneration.
As a result, his base salary is less than that paid to the previous CEO, Dr Shetty, before he stepped down from his Executive role.
BOARD APPOINTMENTS As announced on 29 June 2017, the Board appointed two new Executive Directors, with the appointment of an Executive Vice Chairman and a Chief Investment Officer.
These Directors STIP incentive opportunity was set below the potential cap of 200%, at 175% and 150% for the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Investment Officer, respectively.
ENHANCED STIP DISCLOSURE The Company has committed to enhanced bonus disclosure and we have provided increased detail in our disclosure of 2016 and 2017 STIP outcomes as shown on pages 66 to 67.
This includes a detailed breakdown of non-financial measures, which is more detailed than that provided by most FTSE 100 companies.
In line with the majority of other FTSE 100 companies, ex ante bonus disclosure is regarded as inappropriate given commercial sensitivity.
In NMCs case, this is particularly so for the individual metrics and underpins relating to quality and capacity, which would provide competitors with market competitive information about our business.
SHAREHOLDERS FEEDBACK AND REMUNERATION FOR 2018 Prior to the 2017 AGM, the Remuneration Committee wrote to our larger institutional shareholders to explain our remuneration rationale in both 2016 and 2017.
In early 2018, the Committee consulted with our larger shareholders on remuneration practices.
Two recurring themes became apparent from these exercises: i without exception all shareholders congratulated the Company on our extra-ordinary progression from the FTSE 250 to becoming a constituent of the FTSE 100, and ii the method in which we played catch-up with our new peer group as we progressed to the FTSE 100 could have been handled differently with large one-off adjustments being preferred.
The Committee also received feedback in relation to STIP metrics not being sufficiently oriented towards financial measures, as well as our EPS targets.
In light of this feedback, the Committee has made some changes to the operation of remuneration for 2018, while remaining within the parameters of our existing Remuneration Policy and keeping our fixed and variable remuneration relevant for the Group at its current point of evolution.
RESTRAINT ON MANAGEMENT REMUNERATION AND BOARD FEES It is not the Committees current intention to make any adjustment to the remuneration of the CEO or other Executive Directors for 2018.
NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 59 Governance Directors Remuneration Report 2017 continued Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman continued SHAREHOLDERS FEEDBACK AND REMUNERATION FOR 2018 CONTINUED REBALANCING OF STIP MEASURES A rebalancing of STIP measures to be financial in focus but with the addition of demanding underpins reflecting quality and capacity metrics.
As shown on pages 70 and 71, for 2018 the Committee has determined that EBITDA and EBITDA margin will be retained along with specific operational measures for the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Investment Officer.
In line with our commitment to quality, for 2018 we have introduced underpins relating to stretch standards of facility quality performance, growth in patient numbers within existing facilities, and as well as occupancy levels.
All three underpins must be met before any bonus is payable.
INTRODUCTION OF AN EBITDA GROWTH MEASURE IN THE LTIP The Group is focused on sustainable EBITDA growth.
Indeed, a key driver of our success is the ability to acquire and ramp up assets efficiently.
In this respect EBITDA growth is an appropriate metric.
In addition, the underlying drivers of EBITDA are cascaded to management to enhance value from both existing and acquired businesses as efficiently as possible.
Given the focus on EBITDA as a metric within the organisation, the Committee is confident that it is both prudent and in shareholders interests to enhance the focus on this measure by including it in the LTIP.
The Committee has therefore determined that the EPS element of the LTIP, currently weighted at 50% will be replaced with an EBITDA CAGR measure, with the current TSR element remaining unchanged.
The Committee regards this measure as a stretching requirement, particularly on the back of continuing EBITDA growth which has been achieved over many years.
Through our approach to remuneration, NMC has evidenced our commitment to applying best practices in remuneration policies and to listen to shareholder feedback.
As we look to 2018, and beyond, we remain committed to delivering continued long-term sustainable growth and, we look forward to shareholders support by voting in favour of the Directors Remuneration Report at the 2018 AGM.

V. THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE IN 2017 Details of the members of the Committee during the 2017 financial year, and its role and responsibility within the Groups Board and governance structure, is set out on page 51 of the Governance report.
PRINCIPAL MATTERS CONSIDERED IN 2017 The Committee met formally four times during the year.
Principal items discussed by the Committee included: A new tiered remuneration structure for Executive Directors and Senior Management under which different roles attract differing incentive opportunity levels: Voting and voting recommendations in relation to the Directors Remuneration Report resolution put to the 2017 AGM: and Current remuneration trends and corporate governance developments in relation to remuneration related matter.
SUPPORT AND EXTERNAL ADVICE The Remuneration Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers when discussing and setting Executive Director and Senior Management salary levels.
Deloitte was appointed by the Remuneration Committee and acted as advisors to the Company since 2012 and were re-appointed by the Committee following a competitive tender process in 2016.
The Committee have reviewed and considered Deloittes independence, and consider them to be independent advisers to the committee notwithstanding that Deloitte, as an international firm, provide the following services to the group: Some tax advisory services to the Group in Spain: Internal Auditors to our IVF businesses, Clinica Eugin and Fakih IVF: and transaction services and accounting advice to the Group in the UAE, both before and after some of the Groups acquisitions.
It was noted that none of this advice has related to remuneration matters in the Group, all teams providing these services are based in countries other than the UK where the remuneration advisory team are based and none of these teams have any connection with the engagement partner and team advising the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice they have received from Deloitte during the year has been objective and independent and that the Deloitte LLP engagement partner and team, which provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with NMC that might impair their independence.
The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.
Deloitte are signatories to the remuneration consultants group code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
The Remuneration Committee has direct access to Deloitte as and when required.
The Group Company Secretary liaises with Deloitte where necessary to ensure that all Committee requests and decisions are dealt with and implemented, but does so under the guidance of the Remuneration Committee Chairman.
Deloitte attend meetings of the Committee as required.
Deloitte received fees of 86k charged on a time plus expenses basis for advice received during the year.
RESULTS OF VOTING ON REMUNERATION MATTERS AT GENERAL MEETINGS OF THE COMPANY The following summarises voting in relation to the approval of the 2016 Directors Remuneration Report at the Annual General Meeting in 2017: Meeting Date Resolution Resolution type For Against Number of votes withheld To approve the Directors 23 May 2017 Remuneration Report Advisory 71.36% 28.64% 255,623 The Committee noted and discussed the level of voting received against the Companys Directors Remuneration Report at its 2017 Annual General and the resulting inclusion of the Company in the Public Register implemented later in 2017 by the Investment Association.
The Committee believes that its approach to Executive Remuneration during the 2012 to 2016 financial years was in the best interests of the Company and all its shareholders.
Following a pay freeze during the initial three years following IPO, which resulted in Executive Remuneration being significantly below lower quartile levels, Executive Remuneration was re-aligned in 2015 and 2016 to competitive market levels.
The Committee believe that this was both a conservative and appropriate approach in ensuring that management were not rewarded until successful execution of the first phase of the Groups strategic growth plan and until improved performance had been reflected in increased shareholder confidence in the Company.
Pay then increased as performance improved at a time of transformational growth for the Company and in shareholder value, ensuring that management were appropriately incentivised during this crucial period.
NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 63 Governance Directors Remuneration Report 2017 continued THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE IN 2017 CONTINUED The following 5-year charts reflect the appropriate and necessary actions taken by the Committee during recent financial years: FTSE 100 SALARY AND PERFORMANCE COMPARISON $1,600k 6,000m $1,200k 5,000m $1,000k 4,000m $800k 3,000m $600k 2,000m $400k 1,000m $200k 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 NMC CEO salary NMC Market cap Upper quartile salary Median salary Lower quartile salary FTSE 250 SALARY AND PERFORMANCE COMPARISON $1,200k 6,000m $1,000k 5,000m $800k 4,000m $600k 3,000m $400k 2,000m $200k 1,000m 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 NMC CEO salary NMC Market cap Upper quartile salary Median salary Lower quartile salary The Committee noted that a number of shareholders were not supportive of this approach, preferring pay levelling to take place over an even longer period of time, hence the level of votes against the Companys 2016 Directors Remuneration Report.
The Committee is of the view that this would not have been a sustainable position to properly incentivise and reward management in achieving excellent performance and growth on shareholders behalf.
In early 2018, the Committee have been discussing the Companys remuneration structure with shareholders and shareholder representatives, both the above past practices and future intentions, and we look forward to the support of shareholders in relation to our remuneration practices going forward.
64 NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 I. II.
V. REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE GROUP The remuneration philosophy is the same throughout NMC that individuals should be remunerated based on their role, responsibilities, experiences and market practice.
NMC has a variety of different roles from senior executives, to doctors and nurses and to administrators and support staff, and therefore remuneration levels and structures vary to reflect the different requirements, expectations and geographic locations of these roles.
The Committee does consider that it is important, however, that Executive Directors and senior executives as a group are remunerated in a similar way to ensure that they are incentivised to collectively deliver the Groups strategy and create long term value for shareholders.
Executive Directors and senior management therefore all participated in the STIP and LTIP arrangements in 2017.
SHAREHOLDER VIEWS AND CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP COMMUNICATION WITH OUR SHAREHOLDERS Some members of the Committee met with our larger institutional shareholders and the Investment Association in early 2018 to discuss the operation of Executive Remuneration in 2018.
The Committee remains available to discuss remuneration matters concerning shareholders at any time.
CONSIDERATION OF PAY AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYEES The Committee considers the correlation between Executive Director remuneration and that of Senior Management, as well as pay levels externally for similar roles, when determining individual remuneration levels.
However, given the Groups wide geographic reach in relation to both its business interests and shareholders, and the significant corporate and public company responsibilities which are not reflected in roles in the rest of the Group, the Committee do not feel that Executive Director and Senior Management remuneration needs to be aligned with other remuneration within the business.
The Committee did not consult with employees when setting Executive Director pay.
2017 REMUNERATION THIS SECTION IS SUBJECT TO AUDIT This section outlines how the remuneration policy was applied in 2017, together with the outcomes for actual remuneration paid in relation to the financial year under review.
This is shown in two parts Remuneration paid to Executive Directors and a separate section in relation to Non-Executive Directors.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION 2017 Remuneration paid in 2017 single pay figure The table below sets out the remuneration paid to or received by each Executive Director of the Company who served during the financial year ended 31 December 2017.
The value shown in the 2016 LTIP awards column is the award which vested on 29 October 2017 and is valued using the execution share price on 30 October 2017 of 2877.0p per share.
2 The value shown in the 2017 column is the award which will vest on 6 March 2018, the date of this report.
As it is not practical to provide an actual value attributable to these shares, the value shown above is calculated by reference to the average closing share price of the Company in the Quarter ended 31 December 2017, which was 2867p per share.
3 Participants also receive additional shares equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period on any shares that vest.
Therefore included in 2016 and 2017 LTIP values above are the value of such shares received or to be received.
Base salaries The base salaries of the Dr B R Shetty as Executive Vice Chairman & CEO, of $1.2m AED 4.485m per annum, and Mr Prasanth Manghat, as Deputy CEO, of $1.0m AED 3.798m per annum, were set effective from 1 January 2017.
In the case of Dr Shetty, there was no change to his base salary in 2017 until he stepped down from his Executive Director role and was appointed Non-Executive Joint Chairman.
In relation to Mr Manghat, there has been no change in his base salary during the 2017 financial year despite his change of role and promotion to Chief Executive Officer in March 2017.
The base salaries for Mr Khalifa Bin Butti, of $680k AED 2.518m per annum, and Mr Hani Buttikhi, $650k AED 2.390m per annum, were set from their date of appointment as Directors, and are unchanged since that date.

The JCI accreditations measure required the Group to achieve a JCI accreditation score of greater than 95% in two of its Speciality Hospitals for a threshold pay-out and in four of its Speciality Hospitals for maximum pay-out.
The Group received a JCI accreditation score of greater than 95% in all four of its Hospitals who had JCI accreditation for the whole of 2017, resulting in a maximum pay-out under this measure.

Based on the above performance, the Committee approved 100% of maximum pay-outs for the Executive Directors.
For the CEO, one-third of the award achieved is being paid in cash with two-thirds delivered in the form of a deferred share award, which vests equally after periods of one year and two years.
For the Executive Vice Chairman and CIO whose awards were pro-rated for time served in the year, for this initial year of participation the amounts payable are being paid wholly in cash.

Given the strong level of relative TSR and EPS performance delivered over the three-year performance period, the Committee determined that 100% of the 2015 LTIP awards will vest.
As the share price at the date of vesting was not known at the date of publication of this report, the value included within the single figure table is based on the number of shares that vested multiplied by the average share price over the quarter ending 31 December 2017, which is 2,867p per share.
Awards made in 2017 During 2017, LTIP grants were made to the Executive Directors as follows, within the levels permitted by our approved Policy applying during the 2017 financial year.
Mr Prasanth Manghat, Chief Executive Officer 250% of salary Mr Khalifa Bin Butti, Executive Vice Chairman 225% of salary Mr Hani Buttikhi, Chief Investment Officer 175% of salary Performance targets The following performance targets were used in relation to all LTIP awards granted in 2017.
Companys Earnings per Share EPS growth This measures the Companys annual compound growth in EPS and represents 50% of the total award.
The table below sets out the EPS targets for the 2017 award and the corresponding level of vesting: Annual compound growth in EPS over the three-year Performance Period Vesting percentage of target 15% or more 100% Between 8% and 15% On a straight-line basis between 25% and 100% 8% 25% Less than 8% 0% Total Shareholder Return TSR growth This measures the Companys TSR compared against a comparator group of companies and represents 50% of the total award.

V. Pension contributions There were no pension contributions in 2017.
During 2016, the Committee considered its policy not to provide executive directors with a pension arrangement.
The Committee considered that a one-off payment of 20% of salary for 2016 in lieu of pension contributions was appropriate to compensate for a lack of an ongoing pension arrangement.
The Committee considered this appropriate in light of the normal practice of other UK listed companies of comparable size and scope.

R. Shetty, Non-Executive Joint Chairman, as a Non-Executive Director is included in the Single Pay Table for Executive Directors as he was an Executive Director for part of the year.
None of the NonExecutive directors received any benefits, pension, STIP or LTIP entitlements or payments during FY2016 and FY2017.
In 2017, there was no increase in the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors with the exception of: An increase of 10k per annum to 210k for the position of Joint Chairman with effect from 1 January 2017: and An increase from 5k to 10k per annum paid to each Board Committee Chair.
Therefore, with effective from 1 January 2017, the annual fees of the Non-Executive Directors have been structured as follows: Base fees: Joint Chairman 210k Senior Independent Director 85k Non-Executive Director 75k An additional fee of 10k per annum is paid to the Chair of each board committee A fee of 5k paid to each Non-Executive Director who attends meetings of the Board, in person, in a country which is not their primary residence.
The Executive Directors decided to adjust the way in which this attendance allowance is paid with effect from 1 October 2017, and from this date Non-Executive Directors are paid 4k for each meeting attended irrespective of location.
This reflects the significant time commitment required for NEDs to attend meetings, often away from their own country of residence.
The above fee structure is reflected in the fees paid to each NED during 2017.
Payments to past directors There were no payments made to past directors during the 2017 financial year Payments for loss of office There were no payments made for loss of office to past directors during the 2017 financial year NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 69 Governance Directors Remuneration Report 2017 continued 2018 REMUNERATION EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION IN 2018 This section summarises how the Committee intends to implement the Companys existing remuneration policy in 2018.
Executive Director base salaries Annual base salaries payable with effect from 1 January 2018 remain as follows: Chief Executive Officer US$1,033.4k AED 3.795m Executive Vice Chairman US$685.6k AED 2.518m Chief Investment Officer US$650.8k AED 2.390m The base salary of the Chief Executive Officer was set with effect from 1 January 2017 whilst in the role of Deputy CEO and was not increased upon the promotion of Mr Manghat to CEO in March 2017 or since.
The base salary of the CEO therefore currently remains at a level lower than that paid for the same position in 2016.
The base salary of the Executive Vice Chairman and the Chief Investment Officer were set on appointment of each individual during the 2017 financial year and remain at the same level.
It is not the Committees current intention to make any adjustment to the remuneration of the CEO or other Executive Directors for 2018.
Benefits There is no change to the structure of benefits in 2018 which will be paid in line with the arrangements in place for the 2017 financial year.
Operation of the STIP for 2018 The maximum STIP opportunity for each of the Executive Directors in 2018 will be as follows: Chief Executive Officer 200% of base salary Executive Vice Chairman 175% of base salary Chief Investment Officer 150% of base salary The way in which any award from the 2018 STIP will be delivered will be one-third of any STIP award being made in cash and two-thirds deferred into shares, half of which will vest one year after any award is made and the other half two years after any award.
The performance targets that will apply for the 2018 financial year have been set, as in previous years, after considering the Groups priorities for the year.
EBITDA and EBITDA margin will remain as key measures for the year for each Executive Director, with the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Investment Officer both also having specific individual targets in relation to their areas of strategic focus in 2018.
The Remuneration Committee considers that ex-ante disclosure of the specific targets are commercially sensitive at this stage as they could disclose details of strategy and operations for 2017 to the Companys competitors.
The Remuneration Committee will disclose details in respect of the targets when it is satisfied that these are no longer commercially sensitive.
2018 STIP Targets As noted in the Remuneration Committee Chairmans letter, the Board consulted with shareholders ahead of determining STIP measures for 2018.
Further, the Board will continue to disclose actual performance against targets when they are considered to be no longer commercially sensitive.
For 2018 targets will be set against the following measures.
Weighting Measure CEO EVC CIO Rationale EBITDA 50% 33% 33% Directly linked to the Groups strategy.

V. In addition before any bonus is payable, the following underpin conditions apply all three underpins must be met.
Underpin Rationale Facility quality performance The quality scores obtained across our facilities in different countries remains fundamental to sustainable growth.
As such, a zero tolerance approach will be applied such that all facilities undergoing an accreditation process must pass that process.
NMC has not failed an accreditation to date, nonetheless the Committee is minded to adopt this tough stance to reinforce the importance of quality.
Growth in patient numbers Growth in patient numbers in existing facilities is in line with our focus on efficiency and effective use of our assets.
Occupancy levels A minimum standard will be applied across facilities, again in line with our focus one efficient growth and use of assets.
The Committee has selected these measures and underpins in light of feedback from shareholders and is confident that performance against stretch targets on these metrics aligns management performance with shareholders interests.
Operation of the LTIP for 2018 Within the limit of the provisions set out in the Companys Directors Remuneration policy approved by shareholders on 29 December 2016, the LTIP award levels for the Executive Directors in respect of 2018 will be granted at a maximum level of 250% of base salary.
For 2018, the Committee is providing a tiered approach to LTIP grants for Executive Directors and Senior Management.
The grants applicable to each Executive Director will be as follows: Maximum opportunity % of base salary Chief Executive Officer 250% Executive Vice Chairman 225% Chief Investment Officer 175% The performance targets that apply for awards to be made under the plan in the 2018 financial year will be as follows: Percentage Weighting for Purpose and link relevant Measure to remuneration strategy Performance measure Target individuals Total shareholder return To incentivise TSR growth compared to 25% of this element of the 50% TSR management to deliver a comparator group of award will vest for long term returns companies.

Vesting is on a straight line basis between these points.
Awards under the LTIP for 2017 and beyond are subject to a clawback provision, on top of the existing malus provision.
In addition, in the event of an acquisition or disposal during the performance period, the Committee will assess whether the financial performance of the acquired disposed business should be included or excluded, with targets adjusted accordingly.

In addition, it is not the Executive Directors current intention to make any adjustment to the fees payable to the non-executive directors for 2018.
Given that the location of the Companys Board Meetings varies during the year, and also due to the geographic diversity of the country of residence for Board members, an additional fee is also payable for attendance at Board meetings.

Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus or incentive plan or other form or performance-related remuneration.
