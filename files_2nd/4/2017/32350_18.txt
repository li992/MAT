TR Property pp33-57 08 06 2017 15:49 Page 48 Directors Remuneration Report Introduction The Board has prepared this report and the Directors Remuneration Policy, in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2013.
Ordinary resolutions for the approval of this report and the remuneration policy will be put to the members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The law requires the Companys Auditors, KPMG LLP, to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated as such.
The Auditors opinion is included in the Independent Auditors Report.
Annual Statement from the Chairman of the Committee The Management Engagement Committee MEC comprises all the Directors of the Company.
The Chairman of the Committee is Hugh Seaborn.
As the Company has no executive Directors, the MEC meets, at least annually, to review the remuneration and terms of appointment of the Investment Manager, and the level of the Directors fees, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The MEC met in March 2017 and considered the feedback received as part of the Board evaluation alongside other factors.
Non-executive fees of listed companies continue to rise, and the regulatory burden continues ever upwards.
Following the MEC meeting in March 2017, it was agreed that Non-executive Directors fees would be increased from 32,000 to 33,000 with effect from 1 April 2017.
It was also agreed that those Directors holding the role of Audit Chairman and Senior Independent Director would continue to receive an additional 5,000 to reect their responsibility.
It was further agreed that the Chairmans fee would remain at 70,000 per annum.
Directors Remuneration Policy The Companys policy is that the fees payable to the Directors should reect the time spent by the Board on the Companys affairs and the responsibilities borne by the Directors and should be sufficient to enable candidates of high calibre to be recruited.
The policy is for the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Senior Independent Director to be paid higher fees than the other Directors in recognition of their more onerous roles.
This policy was approved by the members at the 2014 AGM, and the Directors intention is that this will continue for the year ending 31 March 2018.
In accordance with the regulations, an ordinary resolution to approve the Directors remuneration policy will be put to Shareholders at the upcoming AGM on 25 July, as required every three years.
The Directors are remunerated in the form of fees, payable monthly in arrears, to the Director personally or to a third party specified by that Director.
There are no long-term incentive schemes, share option schemes or pension arrangements and the fees are not specically related to the Directors performance, either individually or collectively.
The Board consists entirely of Non-executive Directors, who are appointed with the expectation that they will serve for a period of three years.
Directors appointments are reviewed formally every three years thereafter by the Board as a whole.
None of the Directors have a contract of service and a director may resign by notice in writing to the Board at any time: there are no notice periods.
The terms of their appointment are detailed in a letter to them when they join the Board.
As the Directors do not have service contracts, the Company does not have a policy on termination payments.
There is no notice period and no payments for loss of ofce were made during the period.
The Companys Articles of Association currently limit the total aggregate fees payable to the Board to 300,000 per annum.
Shareholders views in respect of Directors remuneration are communicated at the Companys AGM and are taken into account in formulating the Directors remuneration policy.
At the last AGM, over 98.7% of Shareholders voted for the resolution approving the Directors Remuneration Report 1.3% against.
At the 2014 AGM over 97% voted for the resolution approving the Directors Remuneration Policy 2% against, showing significant shareholder support.
