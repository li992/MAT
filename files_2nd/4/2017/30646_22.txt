Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Governance Directors Remuneration Report 83 Directors Remuneration Report The Directors' Remuneration Report the Report describes how the Group applies the principles of good governance relating to Directors' remuneration.
This Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee of RELX Group plc the Committee in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the UK Listing Rules, the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 the UK Regulations and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code the Dutch Code.
The Report was approved by the Boards of RELX PLC, RELX NV and RELX Group plc.
Introduction from the Remuneration Committee Chairman The attached Report reects the annual incentives earned and the vesting outcomes for multi-year incentives granted under the remuneration policy applicable to the 2015-2017 cycle of the multi-year plans.
For 2017, underlying revenue growth was 4%.
Underlying operating profit growth was 6%, and adjusted earnings per share EPS atconstant currencies grew 7%.
The performance measures used in our incentive plans annual and multi-year are based on adjusted gures as they provide relevant information in assessing the Groups performance, position and cash ows.
We believe that our adjusted measures track the core operational performance of the Group and how it contributes to shareholder value creation.
The RELX Annual Report includes a reconciliation of adjusted measures to IFRS measures.
These results carry forward the strong financial results of the company over the preceding six years, with consistent revenue, profit and earnings per share growth.
With more predictable revenues, a higher growth prole and improving returns the company continues to improve its quality of earnings.
This consistent strong financial performance is reected in good achievements against targets under the multi-year incentive plans.
2017 Outcomes The 2017 annual incentive payments to the Executive Directors were just above target, resulting in payouts of around 69% of the maximum opportunity, which is a level that has been relatively consistent over the past seven years and is in line with the consistent annual financial progress made by the business during this time.
The 2015-17 cycle of the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP vested at 88.1%, with the return on invested capital ROIC target having been fully achieved, EPS just below the middle of the target range and total shareholder return TSR above the upper quartile of the sterling and euro comparator groups and just below the upper quartile for the US dollar comparator group.
On average, over thethree-year period, adjusted EPS growth at constant currencies was 7.6% p. a. ROIC and EPS performance in respect of the 2015-17 cycle of the Bonus Investment Plan BIP and the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS resulted in respective vesting percentages of 92.8% and 95.7% of the awards granted.
These outcomes reect the strong and consistent returns and earnings growth achieved by the business and how the challenging targets set by the Committee have been perceived by the market.
Over the 2015-17 period, ROIC increased from 12.8% to 13.1% while in the eight years since it was introduced as a metric into our multi-year incentives, ROIC has increased from 10.4% to 13.1%, demonstrating the Groups commitment to improved returns.
In line with increases for the wider employee population, the Committee has approved 2018 salary increases for the Executive Directors of 2.5%.
2018 Implementation of simplied Remuneration Policy In April 2017 our shareholders approved a new remuneration policy for Executive Directors by a vote of 95% of the shares voted.
The new policy simplies the incentive framework for Executive Directors by reducing the number of incentive plans in which they participate from four one annual and three multi-year incentive plans to two one annual and one multi-year incentive plan.
Accordingly, commencing with the 2018 grants, the Executive Directors will no longer receive grants under the BIP and the ESOS.
A description of the Remuneration Policy as approved by RELX PLC and RELX NV shareholders at the April 2017 Annual General Meetings is included on pages 96 to 102 of this Report.
The audited sections of the Report are clearly marked.

The gure for performance-related share based awards includes share price appreciation since the date the award was granted.
In the case of Erik Engstroms gures, the amount included that relates to share price appreciation is 4.2m for 2016 and 2.9m for 2017.
For Nick Luff, the amount included that relates to share price appreciation is 1.9m for 2016 and 1.4m for2017.
The gures for 2016 in column e disclosed in last years Report were, as required by the UK Regulations, based on an estimate using prescribed average share prices and exchange rates and have been restated in this Report to reect the actual amount vested and the actual share prices and exchange rates on the vesting dates of the 2014-16 cycle of BIP, LTIP and ESOS.
The vesting percentages under these plans were determined on 24 February 2017 and were in line with those disclosed on page 94 in the 2016 Remuneration Report.
Using the share prices and exchange rates on the vesting dates and the actual dividend equivalents paid in respect of this cycle increased the 2016 disclosed gure by 836k for Erik Engstrom and by 529k for Nick Luff.
The 2017 gures reect the vesting of the 2015-17 cycle of BIP, LTIP and ESOS.
As the BIP, LTIP and ESOS vest after the approval date of this Report, the average share prices and exchange rates for the last quarter of 2017 have been used to arrive at an estimated gure under the UK statutory basis in respect of these awards.
2 Dutch Civil Code basis columns f and h : These gures comply with the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code.
The gures for share based awards comprise the multi-year incentive charges in accordance with IFRS 2 Share based Payment.
These IFRS 2 charges do not reect the actual value received on vesting.
3 Exchange rates used for share based awards column e : The exchange rates used to convert share based awards to pounds sterling are i for the UK statutory basis, those that applied at the vesting dates or, if vesting has not occurred at the time of sign off of this Report, the average exchange rates for the last quarter of 2017: ii for dividend equivalents, the actual gross pounds sterling payment: and iii for estimated dividend equivalents in respect of awards for which vesting has not occurred at the time of sign off of this Report and which are yet to be paid, the average exchange rates for the last quarter of 2017.
4 Benets: Each Executive Director receives a car allowance, private medical dental insurance and the company meets the cost of tax return preparation.
5 Pension: The gures are calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in the UK Regulations.
For dened benefit schemes, in which Erik Engstrom participates, the calculation in the table is reduced by the Director's contributions and participation fee.
For Erik Engstrom both of these charges increase each year.
Details of the increases are set out in the Remuneration Policy Report on page 96.
Nick Luff receives a cash allowance in lieu of pension which reduced to 29% of salary effective 1 March 2017 from 30% of salary previously and will reduce by a further two percentage points on 1 March 2018 and 2019 respectively down to 25% on 1 March 2019.

These share prices are used to determine the number of awards granted, as well as to set option exercise prices.
The face value of the ESOS options shown in this column has not been reduced to reect the fact that the aggregate option price is payable on exercise.
The face value of the BIP matching award to Erik Engstrom, who invested in NV ADRs, is calculated using i the closing price of a NV ADR $17.695 : and ii the GBP:USD exchange rate on the trading day before grant 24 February 2017.
The face value for Nick Luffs BIP matching award, who invested in PLC and NV ordinary shares, is calculated on the same basis as the LTIP and ESOS face values.
2 For BIP, LTIP and ESOS, vesting in line with expectations is as per the performance scenario chart disclosed on page 83 of the 2013 Remuneration Report, i. e. 67% for BIP and 50% for LTIP.
For ESOS, vesting in line with expectations means that 80% of the face value of the award at grant vests to which a valuation factor of 20% has been applied.
3 Threshold payout levels for each measure have been included.
Where there are multiple measures, it is possible to achieve threshold, and hence payout, in respect of just one of the measures or, for TSR, in respect of one of the three TSR comparator groups.
The LTIP awards granted in 2017 are based on ROIC, EPS and TSR and the 2017 BIP awards on EPS and ROIC, with the respective metrics weighted equally in each plan and assessed independently.
The targets and vesting scales applicable to these awards are set out on page 103 of the 2016 Remuneration Report.
In respect of ESOS awards granted in 2017, 33% of the award vests for achieving average growth in adjusted EPS over the three-year performance period of 4% p. a. : 80% vests for 6% p. a. and 100% for 8% p. a.

ANNUAL BASE SALARY Purpose and link to strategy To recruit and retain the best executive talent globally to execute our strategic objectives at appropriate cost.
Operation Salaries for Executive Directors are set and reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee the Committee with changes typically taking effect on 1 January.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee may review salaries more frequently.
When reviewing salaries, the Committee considers the executives role and sustained value to the company in terms of skill, experience and overall contribution and the companys guidelines for salaries for all employees for the year.
Periodically, competitiveness with companies which are comparable in respect of industry, size, international scope and complexity is also considered in order to ensure the companys ability to attract and retain executives.
For the last six years, Executive Directors salary increases have been 2.5% per annum.
Performance framework N A Maximum value Salary increases to Executive Directors will remain within the range of increases for the wider employee population.
However, the Committee has discretion to exceed this to take account of individual circumstances such as change in responsibility, increases in scale or complexity of the business, ination or alignment to market level.
Recovery of sums paid No provision.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS Purpose and link to strategy Retirement plans are part of remuneration packages designed to recruit and retain the best executive talent at appropriate cost.
Operation Our policy is to offer competitive long-term sustainable dened contribution plans.
Any amount above applicable limits, for example HMRCs annual allowance in the UK, will be paid in cash and will be subject to tax and social security deductions.
In certain circumstances, executives can take cash instead of pension contributions.
The UK dened benefit schemes are closed to new hires.
Continued membership of legacy dened benefit schemes requires annual increases to contributions and participation fees from all members, who have a choice to switch to the dened contribution plan at anytime.
th The CEO is a member of a UK legacy dened benefit pension arrangement, accruing 1 30 of final year pensionable earnings for each year pro-rated for part years of service, with a normal retirement age of 60.
In line with all UK dened benefit scheme members, the CEOs contributions have been increasing annually since 2011 and were 11% of pensionable earnings up to the base schemes earnings cap as of 1 March 2017.
The contribution rate increases by two percentage points each year during the policy period to 13% as of 1 March 2018, 15% as of 1 March 2019 and 17% as of 1 March 2020.
The CEO also pays a participation fee which, from 1 March 2017, was 10% of the amount of his pensionable earnings in excess of the base schemes earnings cap.
The participation fee increases by three percentage points each year during the policy period to 13% as of 1 March 2018, 16% as of 1 March 2019 and 19% as of 1 March 2020.
In addition, sinceMarch 2017, a cap applies of 2% per annum on the increase in the CEOs pensionable earnings.
Performance framework N A Maximum value Dened contribution plan maximum company contribution of 25% of salary per annum or equivalent cash in lieu.
The CFO received 30% of salary under an arrangement which was made pursuant to the previous remuneration policy, which contained a 30% ofsalary maximum.
During the policy period, the CFOs company contribution decreases by one percentage point to 29% from March 2017, by two percentage points to 27% from March 2018 and by a further two percentage points to 25% from March 2019. th Dened benefit scheme accrual of 1 30 of final year pensionable earnings for every year of service up to a maximum of 2 3rds of pensionable earnings.
As noted above under Operation, the CEO is subject to increases in his contributions and in the participation fee, as well asacap on annual increases in pensionable earnings, as part of his ongoing membership of this scheme.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Governance Directors Remuneration Report 97 OTHER BENEFITS Purpose and link to strategy To provide competitive benets at appropriate cost.
Operation Other benets, subject to periodic review, may include private medical and dental cover, life assurance, tax return preparation costs, car benets, directors and ofcers liability insurance, relocation benets and expatriate allowances and other benets available to employees generally, including, where appropriate, the tax on such benets.
Performance framework N A Maximum value The maximum for ongoing benets for Executive Directors will not normally exceed 10% of salary excluding relocation benets and any tax related charge on benets which is met by the company.
However, the Committee may provide reasonable benets beyond this amount in exceptional situations, such as a change in the individuals circumstances caused by the company, or if there is a significant 1 increase in the cost of providing the agreed benefit.
AIP ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN Purpose and link to strategy The annual incentive provides focus on the delivery of annual financial targets and the achievement of annual objectives and milestones which are chosen to align with the companys strategy and create a platform for sustainable future performance.
The compulsory deferral of one-third of any annual incentive earned into RELX shares for three years promotes longer-term alignment of Executive Directors interests with shareholders interests, including an element of post-termination shareholding.
Why performance measures are chosen and how targets are set Performance measures include a balanced set of financial targets and Key Performance Objectives KPOs, which are appropriately weighted and which support current strategy and incentivise the Executive Directors to achieve the desired outcomes without undue risk of focusing on any one financial measure.
The targets are designed to be challenging.
They are set with reference to the previous years performance and internal and external forecasts for the following year.
Operation The Committee reviews and sets the financial targets and KPOs annually, taking into account internal forecasts and strategic plans.
Itapproves four to six KPOs for each Executive Director, reecting critical business priorities for which each is accountable.
At least one KPO will relate to the achievement of sustainability targets.
Following year end, the Committee compares actual performance with the financial targets and assesses the achievement of individual KPOs.
Two-thirds of any annual incentive earned is paid in cash to the Executive Director and the remaining one-third is deferred into RELX shares, which are not released to the Executive Director for three years.
Dividend equivalents accrued during the deferral period are payable in respect of the shares that vest.
On a change in control, the default position is that deferred shares vest.
Alternatively, the Committee may determine that deferred shares will not vest and will instead be exchanged for equivalent awards in the acquiring company.
Performance framework The measures include financial targets, which have a weighting of at least 70%, and individual KPOs, with each element assessed separately.
The minimum payout is zero.
If threshold is reached for each of the financial measures, the overall payout for the financial measures is 10.5% of salary.
If the financial measure with the lowest weighting pays out at threshold and the others do not pay out at all, the overall payout for financial measures is 1.5% of salary.
There is no threshold level for KPOs.
Payout for target performance is 150% of salary.
Following an assessment of achievement and scoring of KPOs, the Committee agrees the overall level of earned incentive for each Executive Director.
Maximum value The maximum potential annual incentive is 200% of annual base salary.
This includes the deferred share element but excludes dividend equivalents payable in respect of the deferred shares.
Recovery of sums paid 5 Claw-back applies.
98 RELX Group Annual reports and financial statements 2017 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN Purpose and link to strategy The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP is designed to provide a long-term incentive for Executive Directors to achieve the key performance measures that support the companys strategy, and to align their interests with shareholders.
Why performance measures are chosen and how targets are set Our strategic focus is on continuing to transform the core business through organic investment and the build out of new products into adjacent markets and geographies, supplemented by selective portfolio acquisitions and divestments.
The performance measures in the LTIP are chosen to support this strategy by focusing on sustained earnings growth, return on invested capital and shareholder return.
Targets are set with regard to previous results and internal and external forecasts for the performance period and the strategic plan for the business.
They are designed to provide exceptional reward for exceptional performance, whilst allowing a reasonable expectation that reward at the lower end of the scale is attainable, subject to robust performance.
Operation Annual awards of performance shares, with vesting subject to: performance measured over three financial years continued employment subject to the provisions set out in the Policy on payments for loss of ofce section meeting shareholding requirements 400% of salary for the CEO and 300% of salary for the CFO Executive Directors are to retain their net after tax vested shares for a holding period of two years after vesting.
Dividend equivalents accrued during the performance period are payable in respect of the performance shares that vest.
On a change of control, the default position is that awards vest on a pro-rated basis, subject to an assessment of performance against targets at that time.
Alternatively, the Committee may determine that the awards will not vest and will instead be exchanged for equivalent awards in the acquiring company.
Performance framework The performance measures are EPS, ROIC and relative TSR, weighted 40%:40%:20% respectively and assessed independently, suchthat a payout can be received under any one of the measures or, for TSR, in respect of one of the three comparator groups.
If each of the measures vests at threshold, the overall payout is 25% of the award.
If the measure with the lowest weighting vests atthreshold and the others do not vest at all, the overall payout is 2% of the award.
Payout in line with expectations is 50% of the maximum award.
Dividend equivalents are not taken into account in the above payout levels.
Maximum value The maximum grant in any year is up to 450% of base salary for the CEO and up to 375% of base salary for other Executive Directors notincluding dividend equivalents.
Other benets: Maximum value was increased from 5% under the previous policy to 10% under the current policy to reect increases in the cost of providing the agreed benets.
The level of benets provided to Executive Directors was not changed.
Discretion in respect of AIP and LTIP payout levels: In determining the level of payout under the AIP and vesting under the LTIP, the Committee takes into account RELXs overall business performance and value created for shareholders over the period in review and other relevant factors.
It has discretion to adjust the vesting and payout levels subject always to the maximum individual limits if it believes this would result in a fairer outcome.
This discretion will only be used in exceptional circumstances and the Committee will explain in the next Remuneration Report the extent to which it has been exercised and the reasons for doing so.
Discretion to vary performance measures under the AIP and the LTIP: The Committee may vary the financial measures applying to a current annual incentive year and performance measures for LTIP awards already granted if a change in circumstances leads it to believe that the arrangement is no longer a fair measure of performance.
Any new measures will not be materially less, or more, challenging than the original ones.
Discretion on termination of employment under the AIP and the LTIP: The Committees discretion on termination of employment is described under the Policy on payments for loss of ofce section on page 101.
Malus and claw-back under the AIP and the LTIP: Under the AIP and the LTIP, the Committee has discretion to apply malus and claw-back i if the payout including the AIP deferred shares element was calculated on the basis of materially misstated financial or other data, in which case it can withhold a payout and can seek to recover the difference in value between the incorrect payout and the amount that would have been paid had the correct data been used or ii if there has been serious misconduct on the part of the individual, in which case the Committee may withhold an AIP payout, lapse unvested LTIP awards and may require repayment of AIP and LTIP gains arising during a specified period.
Under the LTIP, the Committee also has discretion to apply malus and claw-back if a participant breaches post-termination restrictive covenants, in which case unvested awards would lapse and the Committee may require repayment of gains arising during the period beginning six months before termination and ending on the date the post-termination restrictive covenants are stated to expire.
Serious misconduct has been added as a trigger event under the AIP and the LTIP since the previous policy to increase the circumstances in which we can apply malus and claw-back.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Governance Directors Remuneration Report 99 6.
Explanation of differences between the companys policy on Executive Directors remuneration and the policy for other employees: Incentives: A larger percentage of Executive Directors remuneration is performance related than that of other employees.
All managers participate in an annual incentive plan, butparticipation levels, measures and targets vary according to their role, seniority and local business priorities.
Approximately 100 senior executives currently participate in the LTIP and about 1,000 participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
Grant levels under the plans vary according to role and seniority.
In considering the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, under which the Executive Directors only participate in the AIP and the LTIP, the Committee considered the incentive plan participation for the wider senior management population.
Other benefits: The range and level of retirement and other benets provided to employees vary according to role, seniority and local market practice.
This is to ensure that we provide competitive packages which are appropriate to specic roles.
In reducing the maximum company contribution for Executive Directors under the dened contribution pension plan, the Committee took into account the contribution rates for Executive Directors and for the wider employee population.
Changes to pay components: The changes which were made since the previous remuneration policy, together with the rationale for the changes, are described in the Committee Chairmans introduction on pages 81 to 83 of the Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2016 and in notes 1 and 5 above.
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios The Committee considers the level of remuneration that may be paid in the context of the performance delivered and value added for shareholders.
The charts below are an illustration of how the CEOs and CFOs regular annual remuneration could vary under different performance scenarios.
The salary, benets and pension levels are the same in all three scenarios in each chart.
Salary is based on 2017 salary.
Benets is based on the 2016 Single Total Figure table.
Pension, annual incentive and LTIP are all based on the policy tables award levels and percentages applied to the 2017 salary.
Annual incentive amounts include the one-third portion which is subject to compulsory deferral into RELX shares for three years, although the deferral portion is separately identied within the annual incentive amount in the charts.
The performance assumptions which have been used are as follows: Minimum means no AIP payout and no LTIP vesting.
In line with expectations means AIP payout at 150% of salary of which one-third is deferred into shares and LTIP vesting at half of the award.
Maximum means AIP payout at 200% of salary of which one-third is deferred into shares and LTIP vesting at 100% of the award.
No share price movement is assumed and any dividend equivalents payable in respect of the AIP deferred shares and the LTIP are notincluded.

However, on an internal promotion to the Board, any existing contractual obligations and commitments may continue to be honoured, even if not consistent with the prevailing policy.
For example, if the individual is a member of the legacy dened benefit pension scheme, the Committee will consider the pension arrangements in the context of the package as a whole and may allow continued participation.
The Committees general principle on recruitment is to offer a competitive remuneration package to attract high-calibre candidates from a global talent pool.
Basic salary would be set at an appropriate level for the candidate, taking into account all relevant factors.
Asadata analytics and technology-driven business, with half of its revenue in the US, the company primarily competes for talent with US-based information and technology companies.
The various components and the companys approach are as follows: Standard package on recruitment To offer remuneration in line with the policy table including the limits, taking into account the principles set out above.
Compensation for forfeited entitlements The Committee may make awards and payments on hiring an external candidate to compensate him or her for entitlements forfeited on leaving the previous employer.
If such a decision is made, the Committee will attempt to reect previous entitlements as closely as possible using a variety of tools, including cash and share based awards.
Malus and claw-back provisions will apply where appropriate.
If necessary to facilitate the grant of awards, the Committee may rely on the one person exemption from shareholder approval in the UK Listing Rules.
Relocation allowances and expenses The type and size of relocation allowances and expenses will be determined by the specic circumstances of the new recruit.
The standard package comprises annual base salary, retirement benets, other benets, AIP and LTIP.
Shareholding requirement The Executive Directors are subject to shareholding requirements.
These are a minimum of 400% of annual base salary for the CEO and 300% of annual base salary for other Executive Directors.
On joining or promotion to the Board, Executive Directors are given a period of time, typically up to five years, to build up to their requirement.
Policy on payments for loss of ofce In line with the companys policy, the service contracts of the existing Executive Directors contain 12-month notice periods.
The circumstances in which an Executive Directors employment is terminated will affect the Committees determination of any payment for loss of ofce, but it expects to apply the principles outlined in the table on the next page.
The Committee reserves the right to depart from these principles where appropriate in light of any taxation requirements to which the company or the Executive Director is subject including, without limitation, section 409A of the US Internal Revenue Code, or other legal obligations.
Treatment of legacy awards granted under multi-year incentive plans in which the Executive Directors no longer participate will be in accordance with those plans and the policy on payments for loss of ofce summarised in the Remuneration Policy Report in the 2013 Annual Reports and Financial Statements.

Contributions to this Retirement Account ceased when he became a member of the UK dened benefit arrangement.
In cases where the approved leaver treatment applies, the AIP and LTIP have a default position as well as giving the Committee discretion to adjust the default treatment within certain parameters.
The Committee would only expect to exercise such discretion where the Committee believes the personal circumstances of the Executive Director so require.
