DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Aligning incentivisation with the long-term success of the Group 2017 was a year of exceptional performance for the Group.
The banking business outperformed against all of its targets and many of the groups investments demonstrated outstanding performance.
Mr Gilauri met or exceeded expectations in respect of his KPIs and oversaw a significant new strategic initiative in relation to the demerger, whilst still ensuring significant growth in total shareholder return.
The Committee and the Board rated Mr Gilauris overall performance in 2017 as exceptional and consequently the Committee were of the strong opinion that he deserved the maximum bonus that we awarded him.
We also considered the performance against KPIs of the appropriate bonuses of senior management.
The Committee also received training from the Company Secretary on the recent developments in remuneration in the industry and in governance.
The priorities for 2018 will be setting remuneration for the Company in respect of the demerger of the Bank and the Investment Business.
AL BREACH If the planned demerger goes ahead, it is envisaged that the separate CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE companies would seek shareholder approval for their remuneration policies at the general meetings after the demerger in 2019.
In the meantime, the companies intend to keep to the principles set out in the Dear Shareholders, current shareholder approved policy with appropriate changes.
Further details will be set out in the shareholder circular regarding the demerger.
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our Directors Remuneration Report for 2017 comprising this statement, the Al Breach Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 which Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is subject to an advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM, and our 7 March 2018 Remuneration Policy as approved at the 2017 Annual General Meeting which applies to the Companys remuneration arrangements for the period up until the Companys 2020 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee was encouraged by the strong shareholder approval of the Remuneration Policy, with over 94% of voting in favour of the Policy at the 2017 AGM.
This letter summarises the remuneration decisions taken in the year and, in the remainder of the report, I aim to set these decisions in the context of the Companys performance this year.
During the year, the Committee continued to seek to align remuneration targets with the Companys strategic priorities and shareholder returns.
In preparation for the demerger of the Company and the Investment Business, the Committee has reviewed and enhanced the selfdevelopment and mentoring of KPIs and the scope of the management performance evaluation.
The Committee also made its annual determination of the discretionary remuneration for our CEO, Irakli Gilauri, and the executive management team.
I would remind shareholders that the majority of Mr Gilauris salary is awarded in deferred shares which vest over a period of five years.
This structure provides alignment with the Company and its shareholders over the long term.
This Directors Remuneration Report describes the implementation of BGEO Directors Remuneration Policy and discloses the amounts earned relating to the year ended 31 December 2017.

Mr Gilauri receives no additional remuneration for any role at a subsidiary or affiliate within the Group.
Mr Gilauris current service agreements provide for salary in the form of cash and deferred shares.
In addition, Mr Gilauri is eligible to receive discretionary deferred share remuneration up to a maximum of 75% of total salary cash and deferred shares.
Approximately 85% of Mr Gilauris remuneration for 2017 set forth in the table below is in the form of deferred shares, for which the average vesting period exceeds four years.
Expressed in Dollars but paid in British Pounds and Lari, as applicable, converted into the respective currency as at the date of payment.
Accordingly, there may be variations in the numbers above and those provided in the accounts.
The figures show the value of the BGEO shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of the relevant year.
For both 2017 and 2016, the award was 90,000 BGEO shares.
A new service agreement that Mr Gilauri signed on 24 August 2015 came into effect on 1 May 2016.
For 2016, the value of the deferred share salary payable is calculated as follows: a from 1 January 2016 until 1 May 2016 when the prior service agreement was in effect, the share price used is at the date the prior service agreement was signed, being US$ 21.71 per share based on the official share price of GBP 14.06 per share converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5443, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date : and b from 1 May 2016 until 31 December 2016 when the new service agreement was in effect, the share price used is at the date the new service agreement was signed, being US$ 25.43 per share the official share price of GBP 16.16 per share as at 24 August 2015 converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5738, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date.
For 2017, the new service agreement continues and therefore the figures in part b of the previous sentence apply.
Under the deferred share programme, the option awards in respect of deferred share salary are formally granted in January of the year following the year to which the award relates the work year even though the number of deferred salary shares is fixed in the contract.
The terms and conditions applying to deferred share salary are described in section 1 a of the 2017 Policy available at http: bgeo.
com uploads annualreports 2016-804. pdf and consistent with the Policy table on page 100 and Note 1 to the Policy table on pages 101 to 102.
The figures show the value of BGEO shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of bonus awards in the relevant year.
For 2017, options were awarded over 45,548 BGEO shares.
The discretionary remuneration in respect of 2017 is deferred and vests over three years in equal amounts in each of the second, third and fourth years following the work year.
The value was calculated by reference to the share price on 8 December 2017 the working day before the meeting at which the award was determined which was US$ 44.89 based on the official share price of GBP 33.56 per share converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.3376, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date.
For 2016, options were awarded over 37,450 BGEO shares.
The value was calculated by reference to the share price on 28 February 2017 which was US$ 34.91 based on the official share price of GBP 28.05 per share converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.2445, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date.
The discretionary remuneration in respect of 2016 is deferred and vests over three years in equal amounts, beginning in January of the second year following the work year.
Both the 2017 and 2016 awards are subject to the leaver provisions described on pages 105 to 106 of the 2017 Policy available at http: bgeo.
The means of determining the number of shares underlying this remuneration and the terms and conditions are described in Note 2 of the 2017 Policy on page 102 and available at http: bgeo.
The basis for determining Mr Gilauris 2017 discretionary award is described on the next two pages.

Under the Groups defined contribution pension scheme, normal retirement age is 65.
The figure shows the dividend value paid in respect of nil-cost options exercised in the relevant years.
Mr Gilauri was reimbursed for reasonable business expenses, on provision of valid receipts.
No money or other assets are received or receivable by Mr Gilauri in respect of a period of more than one financial year, where final vesting is determined by reference to achievement of performance measures or targets relating to the relevant period.

The objective elements largely track the Groups KPIs as he is expected to deliver on the Groups strategy, but the KPIs also include non-tangible factors such as leadership, strategy development and implementation, as well as corporate and social responsibility.
Strict weighting is not imposed on the KPIs below for the reasons mentioned in Note 2 of the 2017 Policy table on page 102 available at http: bgeo.
The following table sets out the objective KPIs set for Mr Gilauri in respect of 2017 as well as Mr Gilauris performance against them.

In addition to these preset KPIs, Mr Gilauri has instigated and been preparing the Group for the demerger of the Banking and Investment Businesses which the Committee recognises as a huge project and a pivotal point in the Groups development.
The project involves a massive reorganisation of the businesses and people in addition to stringent regulatory requirements.
The project ran on schedule through the second half of 2017 and was generally well received by shareholders and stakeholders.
100 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 2017 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS 2017 business highlights include: Outperformance of the banking business against its targets: Excellent performance of many of the groups investments together: and Ongoing strategic development of all underlying businesses: For 2017, the Committee found that Mr Gilauris overall performance was exceptional.
As a result, the Committee determined that Mr Gilauri should be awarded discretionary deferred share remuneration at maximum opportunity 75% of total salary, being total cash salary and total deferred share salary as listed in the table above based on the share price when it made its determination.
The Committee therefore agreed to award Mr Gilauri 45,548 shares.

In the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2016, we presented Mr Gilauris unvested and unexercised shares inclusive of all options granted in respect of that work year.
In the above table, we have presented only the number of unvested and unexercised shares as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017.
Further details of the awards made and determined in respect of those work years up to 6 March 2018 are in Notes 2 and 3 below.
In 2017, Mr Gilauri received awards of 90,000 salary deferred shares and 37,450 discretionary deferred shares for the 2016 work year.
In March 2017, Mr Gilauri exercised options in respect of 126,000 BGEO shares, of which 25,200 were withheld to satisfy tax liabilities.
The net gain on exercise of these share options was US$2,395,190.
In January 2018 Mr Gilauri was granted 90,000 nil cost options in respect of deferred salary shares for the 2017 work year pursuant to the executive equity compensation plan.
On 20 February 2018, Mr Gilauri exercised options in respect of 125,983 BGEO shares, of which 25,197 BGEO shares were withheld to satisfy tax liabilities.
Whilst the Remuneration Committee has determined the award for discretionary deferred share compensation, being options over 45,548 shares to be received as per Note 3 to the single total figure of remuneration table above, this will be reported in the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts and is not included in the table above, which is as at 31 December 2017.
At 2017 year-end, NeilCo Limited, a company wholly-owned by Mr Janin, held 10,000 BGEO shares.
At 2017 year-end, Gemsstock Growth Fund, which Mr Breach manages, held 20,000 BGEO shares.
On 28 February 2018, Al Breach personally purchased 7,600 BGEO shares.
The Remuneration Policy is heavily weighted towards remuneration in deferred salary shares and deferred discretionary shares.
In respect of 2017, 85% of Mr Gilauris compensation was in the form of deferred shares.
The long vesting periods, particularly for deferred salary shares five years, result in executive management having large holdings of shares.
Accordingly, the Group does not apply a shareholding guideline or impose a holding period on Mr Gilauris shares.
The Policy naturally results in our executives holding a significant number of unvested shares and achieves a delay between performance and vesting.
We believe these results are consistent with the principles of the Investment Management Association.
As at the date of this Annual Report, Mr Gilauris vested and unvested shareholding is 680,868 BGEO shares, representing approximately 1.73% of the share capital of BGEO.
The vesting period for the majority of unvested shares exceeds three years.
None of Mr Gilauris connected persons have interests in any BGEO shares.
The Group does not require Non-Executive Directors to hold a specified number of shares in BGEO.
Notwithstanding this, some Non-Executive Directors have chosen to become shareholders.
Several of our Directors chose to subscribe for shares in the GHG IPO on 12 November 2015.
The following table sets forth the respective holdings of GHG shares of each Director as at 31 December 2017.

104 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY Our Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by our shareholders in June 2017 the 2017 Policy with a vote of 94% in favour.
The Remuneration Committee appreciated the support of shareholders in approving the Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration will outline how we have implemented the Policy in 2017.
The principles of our Policy as it applies to Executive Directors are: i heavily weighting salary to long-term deferred share remuneration rather than cash: and ii paying performance-based remuneration in the form of deferred shares only and no cash.
Pension and benefits are only a very small part of the remuneration package less than 5%.
These key principles have remained the same since 2010.
Our simple and strategically aligned remuneration structure means that Executive Directors are completely focused on delivering shareholder value.
Mr Gilauri continues to be BGEOs sole Executive Director.
Mr Gilauri entered into a new three-year service agreement with JSC Bank of Georgia the Bank on 24 August 2015, which became effective on 1 May 2016, consistent with the terms of the 2014 Policy.
In connection with the Board adopting the new Policy, Mr Gilauri agreed to amend this service agreement to extend the reflected vesting period for discretionary shares to three years after award, which he has also voluntarily agreed to apply to the 2016 work year and which is reflected in an amendment to his service agreement.
As to remuneration of our Non-Executive Directors, our Policy moderately increased the fees solely cash payable commensurate with the increased volume of work and time commitment required in respect of the growing business, now diversified in various sectors.
Fees for Non-Executive Directors had remained static since listing in 2012 while the business had tripled in size and expanded into different industries through our Investment Business.
The Policy took effect from the date of the 2017 AGM and is intended to apply until the earlier of Mr Gilauri entering into a new service agreement with any principal subsidiary of BGEO, the terms of which differ from the Policy, or the 2020 AGM, at which time we will seek shareholder approval.
Please also refer to the 2016 Annual Report for the full text of the approved Directors Remuneration Policy, which is also available on our website, http: bgeo.

106 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC NOTES TO THE 2017 POLICY EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 1 Salary Deferred share salary is the most important element of the Executive Directors fixed annual remuneration and is commensurate with his or her role within the Group.
By heavily weighting salary to deferred share remuneration that vests over five years rather than cash, the Executive Directors day-to-day actions are geared towards achievement of the Groups strategic goals and sustained Group performance over the long term.
The deferred share salary component is neither a bonus nor an LTIP: it is salary fixed at the outset of each three-year service agreement and is therefore not subject to performance targets or measures.
That salary 40% of which vests a full five years after the work year increases or declines in value depending on Group performance over the five-year vesting period, aligning the Executive Directors interests directly and naturally with those of shareholders.
Specific malus and clawback are not applied to salary.
Natural clawback and malus are built in to the structure, given that shares are deferred over a long period and are subject to a number of vesting conditions which, if breached, would result in the Executive Directors salary shares fully lapsing, unless the Board otherwise agrees.
An Executive Directors service agreement may be terminated for cause, a definition which is broadly defined and extends beyond standard malus and clawback triggers to include, for example, gross and wilful misconduct having a material adverse effect on the Group, fraud, material repeated failure to perform duties, breach of obligations or conviction of a felony.
An Executive Directors unvested shares may also lapse if they terminate their service agreement early in the absence of repeated material wrong-doing by the company.
By way of example, an Executive Director terminated by the Board for cause in 2018 would normally give up because their shares would fail to vest : their entire deferred share salary for 2018 and 2017 and 80%, 60% and 40% of their deferred share salary for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
As a result, an Executive Director is motivated to perform to the best of their ability and to act in the long-term interest of and remain with the Group to ensure that salary shares vest.
2 Performance-based remuneration The Group does not operate an LTIP because it believes there is sufficient long-term incentive built into its deferred share salary and discretionary deferred share remuneration.
No cash bonuses are paid to Executive Directors.
Instead, individual and Group performance are rewarded through an award of discretionary deferred share remuneration that vests over three years beginning in the second year following the work year.
As discretionary deferred share remuneration is awarded to reward past performance over the work year, it is not subject to any performance measures over the period from award to vesting.
After the end of each work year, the Remuneration Committee will determine the aggregate number of shares based on the share price at the time of the award, if any, available to award in respect of discretionary deferred share remuneration for all members of executive management, including Executive Directors, in relation to the defined maximum opportunity and based on the Groups performance and the individuals KPIs.
The Remuneration Committee does not utilise strict weighting of performance measures to ensure that flexibility is encouraged if, for example, strategic objectives evolve as the Group does or business circumstances change during the year.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this flexibility ensures that the Board can work with an Executive Director so that they do not take excessive risk to achieve KPIs when, for example, markets have turned.
Even in a good year for an Executive Director e. g. achievement of most KPIs, if this coincides with a bad year for the Group e. g. poor financial performance, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to award little or no discretionary remuneration to the Executive Director.
If at any time after awarding discretionary deferred share remuneration, it has been determined that there was a material misstatement in the financial results for the work year in respect of which the award was formally granted, the Board has the right to cause some or all of the Executives unvested discretionary deferred shares at the time of its determination, not to vest and to lapse.
Similar to deferred share salary, natural clawback and malus this measure.
Discretionary deferred shares are also subject to vesting conditions which, if breached, would result in the Executive Directors salary shares fully lapsing, unless the Board otherwise agrees.
3 Discretion The Committee retains certain discretion in relation to discretionary share remuneration.
This includes: The determination of the award, if any: Selection of KPIs, which may vary from year to year in order to align with strategy and financial objectives: and Any adjustments required to an Executive Directors KPIs during the work year when, for example, there has been a change in strategy or business circumstances which results in one or more of the KPIs becoming an inaccurate gauge of performance.
EQUITY COMPENSATION TRUST AND DILUTION LIMITS An equity compensation trust Trust, was established for the purposes of satisfying deferred share remuneration awarded to Executive Directors and members of executive management.
In 2017, the Group provided additional funding of US$ 30,543,886 to enable Sanne Fiduciary Services Limited Sanne, acting as trustee of the Trust, to purchase shares in the market to satisfy awards in respect of the 2016 and 2017 work years.
In 2017 a total of 784,084 shares were purchased in the market for the Trust.
We intend for Sanne to continue purchasing additional shares in the market, but may need to issue new shares, in order to ensure that there are a sufficient number of shares committed to the Trust in order to satisfy awards.
The Group continues to commit to shareholders that new shares issued in satisfaction of deferred share remuneration from the time of the Companys listing on the premium segment of the LSE will not exceed 10% of BGEOs ordinary share capital over any ten-year period.
LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS It is a provision of this Policy that the Group will honour all pre-existing obligations and commitments that were entered into prior to this Policy taking effect.
The terms of those pre-existing obligations and commitments may differ from the terms of the Policy and may include without limitation obligations and commitments under service agreements, deferred share remuneration schemes and pension and benefit plans.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received on our remuneration structure each year as well as guidance from shareholder representative bodies, as we view shareholder input as key when shaping remuneration policy.
In 2014, 2015 and 2016 we met with a number of our significant shareholders to discuss our remuneration structure and engaged directly with several shareholder advisory groups.
The feedback we received was positive and our shareholders were widely supportive of our executive remuneration structure, understanding that although it varies from a typical UK remuneration structure in that we do not operate an LTIP or give cash bonuses, the absence of cash bonuses and the dominance of deferred share remuneration in the overall remuneration package create a direct and natural alignment of shareholder and executive management interests.
Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 107 Additional Financial Governance Strategic Report Strategic Report Strategic Report Information Statements Performance Strategy Overview DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP When determining an Executive Directors remuneration, the Remuneration Committee considers: i the pay and employment conditions of executive management other than Directors : ii any changes in pay and employment conditions across the Group as a whole: iii whether employees across the Group are personally satisfied with the way they are remunerated: and iv any feedback received during the year from the Human Resources department, executive management and other employees on the executive remuneration structure.
We frequently benchmark remuneration at all levels within the Group in order to ensure that our remuneration is competitive, so as to attract the right candidates and remain competitive in order to motivate, satisfy and retain our talent.
The remuneration of employees in the Group, other than Executive Directors and executive management, is benchmarked against the Georgian labour market as this is the most relevant comparator.
Each year, the Bank participates in the largest salary survey in Georgia.
Survey results are used to offer competitive remuneration packages when recruiting as well as benchmark the salaries of the Groups employees on an annual basis in order for the Group to upwardly adjust the remuneration of current employees and remain competitive.
Our employees remuneration packages are comprised of cash salary, bonus opportunity, benefits as well as the opportunity to participate in the pension scheme on the same terms as applicable to Mr Gilauri and executive management.
For a FTSE 250 company of our size and depth, our Executive Directors and executive management must have the skills, experience, work ethic and attitude required to successfully execute our strategy, meet our objectives and create value for shareholders over the long term.
In order to recruit and retain this talent, we must benchmark the value of remuneration against other FTSE companies of similar size and sector in the UK.
Our executives are not paid cash bonuses and therefore remuneration in the form of deferred shares will comprise nearly all of total remuneration.
As it is not possible for a direct comparison to be made between executive remuneration and remuneration of other employees in the Group, the most important consideration for us is whether other employees are satisfied with their remuneration packages.
In 2015, 2016 and 2017 employee surveys were conducted by the Human Resources department, targeting a large number of employees of varying skill, seniority, department, among other factors.
The results confirmed that employees consulted were satisfied with the manner in which they were compensated.
Our retention rate of employees is high and in 2017 the survey also confirmed that we remain a competitive employer.
COMPARISON WITH REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EMPLOYEES GENERALLY As mentioned above, the components of the remuneration package for Executive Directors as provided for by the Policy are broadly the same as those for non-Board members of the executive management team.
Members of senior management below the executive management level and middle management receive their entire salary in cash and do not receive a deferred share salary.
Their bonuses may be either in the form of cash and or shares which vest over a three-year period following the award.
All other employees within the Group receive a cash salary and may be eligible to receive cash bonuses, portions of which may be deferred until the publication of the audited annual results for the work year and or based on continuous employment with the Group.
The deferred portion of the cash bonus may also be reduced if it is revealed, upon completion of the annual audit, that the annual results published by the department where the employee works were incorrect in any material respect.
Natural clawback, including normal lapse of shares upon termination for cause also applies.
All employees receive a competitive benefit package in line with Georgian market practice and are entitled to participate in the pension scheme on the same terms as applicable to Executive Directors.
TOTAL REMUNERATION OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR SOLE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR The chart below shows the remuneration which Mr Gilauri, our sole Executive Director, could receive in respect of 2018 under the Policy at three different performance levels.
It should be noted that, at the maximum level, 91% of Mr Gilauris 2018 remuneration will be in the form of deferred shares for which the average vesting period exceeds four years.
At the minimum level, 84% of Mr Gilauris 2018 remuneration will be in the form of deferred shares.
A full explanation of the demerger and any changes to the total remuneration of the sole executive director will be provided in the circular to be announced shortly after the release of this report.
Maximum 43% 48% 9% US$ 4,774,585 Target 34% 55% 11% US$ 4,161,190 Minimum US$ 2,729,935 84% 16% Discretionary deferred shares compensation Fixed share salary Fixed cash salary Notes: 1.
Salary is comprised of cash and deferred share salary.
Mr Gilauris total cash salary in 2018 in respect of his service agreements with the Group will be US$ 437,450.
The value of the deferred share salary payable is US$ 2,288,700, calculated by reference to the share price as at the date Mr Gilauris most recent service agreement with the Group was signed on 24 August 2015, being US$ 25.43 per share the official share price of GBP 16.16 per share converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.5738, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date.
The price is the value at which the shares were committed to the Trust and underlies the determination of remuneration expense in the Groups accounts.
Deferred share salary in respect of 2018 will be formally granted in 2019 and will vest in January 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.
For the purposes of this graph, we have added the value of pension and benefits only about 0.1% of total salary to cash salary.
The value used is the same as 2017 as we assume pension and benefits in 2018 will be substantially the same.
The means of determining the number of shares underlying the discretionary deferred share remuneration and terms and conditions applicable to this remuneration are described in the Policy table.
Discretionary deferred shares in respect of 2018 will be formally granted in 2019 and will vest in January 2020, 2021 and 2022.
Minimum opportunity reflects a scenario whereby Mr Gilauri receives only fixed remuneration which is salary cash and deferred shares, pension contributions and benefits and the Remuneration Committee considers that the Groups and or Mr Gilauris performance in 2017 does not warrant any award of discretionary deferred shares.
On-target opportunity reflects a scenario where Mr Gilauri receives fixed remuneration and discretionary deferred shares with a value of US$ 1,431,255, being 70% of the maximum opportunity as described in 5 below.
In this scenario, the Remuneration Committee considers that the Groups and Mr Gilauris performance in 2018 are in line with the Groups expectation, which is excellent performance.
Maximum opportunity reflects a scenario where Mr Gilauri receives fixed remuneration as described in iii above and discretionary deferred shares with a value of US$ 2,044,650, being 75% of total salary.
In this scenario, the Remuneration Committee considers that the Groups and Mr Gilaurils performance in 2018 warrant the highest possible level of discretionary deferred share remuneration.
The value of deferred shares does not take into account any increase or decrease in share price over the vesting period or any dividend equivalents payable on vesting upon exercise of the nil-cost options.
108 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY Our 2017 Policy proposed the increase of Non-Executive Directors fees which had remained static since BGEOs listing in February 2012.
Since listing, the market capitalisation of BGEO has more than tripled and the Groups business has expanded in both size and scope.
Each NonExecutive Director also serves as a member of the Supervisory Board of the Bank and since 2016, each has devoted an increasing amount of time to the Investment Business arm through JSC BGEO Group.
The Policy reflects a moderate increase in fees to reflect the volume of work and time commitment required for the complexity of our Group.
The Policy will apply in each year that the Policy operates from the date of approval of the Policy.
In the second half of 2017 a top-up payment was made to Non-Executive Directors to increase the level of fees to those in the 2017 Policy.
PURPOSE AND OPERATION OPPORTUNITY LINK TO STRATEGY To attract and retain high All fees are paid in cash.

Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for reasonable business expenses, including travel and accommodation, which are incurred in the course of carrying out duties under their Letters of Appointment, on provision of valid receipts.
The maximum amount payable depends on the cost of providing such expenses in the location at which the Non-Executive Director is based.
Shareholders should note that the cost of providing comparable expenses in different jurisdictions may vary widely.
POLICY ON THE APPOINTMENT OF EXTERNAL HIRES AND INTERNAL APPOINTMENTS The Policy provides for a new Executive Directors remuneration package to be comprised of the elements set out below.
ELEMENT POLICY AND OPERATION Overall The Committee intends that the components of remuneration set out in the above Policy tables, and the approach to those components as set out in the Policy tables, will subject to the remainder of this recruitment policy be equally applicable to the annual package provided to new recruits.
Any new Executive Director would be paid no more than the Committee considers reasonably necessary to attract a candidate with the relevant skills and experience, taking into account where appropriate either the annual total monetary value or the total number of shares awarded to executives at an equivalent level of seniority.
Relocation benefits and buy-out awards may also be required to recruit the right candidate, subject to the conditions and restrictions outlined below.
For internal promotions, any commitments made prior to the appointment may continue to be honoured as the executive is transitioned to new remuneration arrangements.
Any pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment, as appropriate, within the parameters set out in the Policy tables.
The rationale for the compensation package offered will be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration published after commencement of the appointment.
Base salary In accordance with the Policy and the Overall summary above.
Discretionary In accordance with the Policy and the Overall summary above.
deferred shares Malus and or clawback would operate in respect of discretionary share remuneration.
Pension Pension provision would be in line with normal policy and the Overall summary above.
Benefits In accordance with the Policy and the Overall summary above.
Relocation support for an incoming Executive Director and, where relevant, his or her family may be provided depending on the individuals circumstances.
BGEO has not set a maximum aggregate amount that may be paid in respect of any individuals relocation support, but it will aim to provide support of an appropriate level and quality on the best terms that can reasonably be obtained.
The Group may make a contribution towards legal fees in connection with agreeing employment terms.
The Group may also agree to pay certain expenses and taxes should an Executive Director be asked to relocate to a different country, such that they pay no more than would have been required in the home location.
Buy-out awards In addition to other elements of remuneration described above, buy-out awards may be made to reflect value forfeited through an individual leaving their current employer.
If a buy-out award is required, the Committee would aim to reflect the nature, timing and value of awards forgone in any replacement awards.
Awards will only take the form of deferred shares.
The value of these deferred shares would be capped to be no higher, on recruitment, than the awards which the individual had to surrender in order to be recruited and the vesting period of such deferred shares would be a similar timeframe to the awards being bought out.
The application of performance conditions and or clawback provisions may also be considered, where appropriate.

In consideration for this vesting treatment, Mr Gilauri will be bound by a two-year non-compete period during which he may not be employed by, provide consultancy services to or otherwise found or be a partner or associate of a commercial bank in Georgia save that he may hold less than 5% of shares of a publicly listed bank.
If Mr Gilauris service agreement expires and: i is not renewed upon substantially similar terms, or ii he does not accept a new service agreement, but he continues as a member of the BGEO and or JSC BGEO Group Board, 50% of his unvested shares vest immediately and the remaining 50% shall continue to vest as normal.
If he subsequently ceases to be a member of the Bank and or BGEO Board, at Mr Gilauris discretion, unvested shares either continue to vest as normal or he may acquire some or all of the underlying shares for the specified price as described above.
MALUS If at any time after awarding discretionary deferred share remuneration, it has been determined that there was a material misstatement in the financial results for the work year in respect of which the award was formally granted, the Board has the right to cause some or all of the Executives unvested discretionary deferred shares at the time of its determination, not to vest and to lapse.
3 Termination of Non-Executive Directors appointments The Letters of Appointment for Non-Executive Directors provide for a one-month notice period although BGEO may terminate the appointment with immediate effect without notice or pay in lieu of notice if the Non-Executive Director has committed any serious breach or non-observance of his or her obligations to BGEO, is guilty of fraud or dishonesty, brings BGEO or him herself into disrepute or is disqualified as acting as a Non-Executive Director, among other circumstances.
Upon termination, the only remuneration a Non-Executive Director is entitled to is accrued fees as at the date of termination together with reimbursement of properly incurred expenses incurred prior to the termination date.
4 Approach to termination and payments for loss of office for new Executive Directors Any payment upon termination of a new Executive Directors service agreement would not exceed 12 months cash salary under the relevant service agreement, plus any accrued and unpaid cash salary, benefits and holiday pay and reimbursement of any business expenses.
The Group may assign the Executive Director garden leave for a period of up to four months following the termination of their employment during which they will be compensated only in the form of regular cash salary with all other benefits, bonuses, incentive or reimbursements excluded.
The Executive Director may also be required to adhere to non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions for a period of six months following termination.
It is expected that the vesting provisions listed below will apply to deferred share remuneration in the case of termination of a new Executive Directors service agreement.
Unvested deferred share remuneration would lapse upon termination of the service agreement by BGEO or material subsidiary of BGEO for cause or if the Executive Director terminated their employment for any other reason than good reason.
Unvested deferred share remuneration would continue to vest in the normal way during the respective vesting period s upon termination by BGEO or material subsidiary of BGEO without cause: if the Executive Directors service agreement expired and they were not offered a new service agreement on substantially similar terms on expiration: or if the Executive Director ceased to be an Executive Director by reason of injury, disability, redundancy or retirement at normal retirement age.
Unvested deferred share remuneration would vest immediately upon death of the Executive Director: termination of the service agreement by the Executive Director for good reason: or a change of control.
Notwithstanding the above vesting terms for current and future Executive Directors, the Board reserves the right to permit unvested deferred share remuneration to vest irrespective of the Executive Directors departure when such Executive Director departs on good terms with the Group.
Share ownership guidelines The Company has not put in place share ownership guidelines due to the significant portion of the CEOs remuneration being in deferred shares.

112 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC Natural clawback and further malus are built in to the structure of Mr Gilauris remuneration above, given that both salary shares and discretionary shares are deferred and are subject to a number of vesting conditions which, if breached, would result in Mr Gilauris salary shares fully lapsing, unless the Board otherwise agrees.
His service agreement may be terminated for cause, a definition which is broadly defined and extends beyond standard malus and clawback triggers to include, for example, gross and wilful misconduct having a material adverse effect on the Group, fraud, material repeated failure to perform his duties, breach of his obligations or conviction of a felony.
His unvested shares may also lapse if he terminates his service agreement early in the absence of repeated material wrong-doing by the Company.
Further malus applies to discretionary deferred shares if it is determined that there was a material misstatement in the financial results.
In this case, the Board has the right to cause some or all of the award for that financial year or for any subsequent financial year that is unvested at the time of its determination, not to vest and to lapse, as set out in the Policy.
