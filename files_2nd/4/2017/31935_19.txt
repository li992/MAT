| 64 Genus plc Annual Report 2017 CORPOR ATE GOVERNANCE Section D: Annual Report on Remuneration Introduction We comply with extensive legal and best practice disclosure obligations in this section of the Directors Remuneration Report, which is subject to an advisory vote at the AGM.
Balancing this formality with a desire to have a clear and understandable report, we have split this section into the following chapters: 1.
What the Executive Directors Were Paid in 2017.
What the Executive Directors Can Earn in 2018.
The Process the Committee Followed to Arrive at These Decisions.
How the Chief Executives Pay Compares to Shareholder Returns Over the Past Eight Years and to Employees Pay.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors Fees.
Details of the Directors Shareholdings and Rights to Shares.
Details of the Executive Directors Contracts and Non-Executive Directors Letters of Appointment.
What the Executive Directors Were Paid in 2017 Executive Directors Single Total Remuneration Figure Audited The following table shows a single total figure of remuneration for the 2017 financial year for each of the Executive Directors and compares this figure to the prior year.
Insured benefits include life assurance, private medical insurance and a medical screen.
2 Executive Directors receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension, which is shown in the Pension column.
3 Bonus earned includes the 25% of the Core Bonus element which is deferred into Company shares.
4 All awards under the Company Milestone element are made in shares deferred for three years.
5 The value of the PSP is determined by the number of awards vesting in relation to performance in the period ended 30 June 2017. Dividend equivalents are not added to awards made under the PSP.
The value shown for 2017 is based on the average share price for the final three months of the 2017 financial year which was 1,821.95p.
6 The 2016 values shown as estimated in the previous Annual Report have been restated to reflect the actual value at vesting.
The share price was 1,926p on 27 September 2016 when awards vested for the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
How the Bonuses for 2017 Were Calculated Annual Bonus: Core Element The 2017 bonuses for Executive Directors were calculated by reference to performance against a challenging sliding scale of profit, cash flow and personal targets.
As in 2016 and as previously communicated to shareholders, the Committee exercised discretion to exclude costs relating to gene editing incurred in the year when calculating awards under the plans.
These costs were unforeseen at the time of setting targets for these awards and the Committee believes that the targets remain as stretching as when the awards were originally made.
This ensured managements reward was not unfairly affected by decisions to make the right long-term investment decisions on behalf of the business.
The following are the results achieved in each element of the annual bonus incentive.
Proportion of salary Actual 2017 Extent to which targets were met 1 Bonus target Strategic objective maximum performance Threshold Target Stretch % Adjusted profit Year-on-year 80% 52.4m 50.6m 55.6m 58.2m 18.1% 2 before tax profit growth Generation of Generate cash for 20% 25.4m 12.4m 15.4m 18.4m 100% free cash flow reinvestment and dividend Personal To build the 25% See Chief Executive 90% objectives foundation for page 66 Group Finance Director 90% future growth 1 The financial elements of the bonus are payable on a straight-line basis between each threshold, target and stretch level.
2 Adjusted profit before tax in constant currency was 49.0m actual currency was 56.4m.
For purposes of measuring growth for the annual bonus the agreed policy is to exclude gene editing costs which were 3.4m 2016: 0.9m, giving a 2017 performance of 52.4m.
Without this adjustment the award level would have been below threshold for this part of the bonus.
Overall extent to which targets for the Core Element of the annual bonus were met: Chief Executive 45.6% Group Finance Director 45.6% | Genus plc Annual Report 2017 65 Annual Report on Remuneration continued Section D: Annual Report on Remuneration continued Personal Objectives Performance against personal objectives related to targets set in a number of areas that included customers, people, and product and service improvement.

| 66 Genus plc Annual Report 2017 CORPOR ATE GOVERNANCE Annual Bonus: Company Milestones The Committee included this element of the annual bonus for 2017 as disclosed in our 2016 Directors Remuneration Report.
We set a target related to securing the ability to deploy our sexed semen technology, producing our first product Sexcel delivered to customers through our ABS business.
This would represent the culmination of multiple years of development and be the first case of Genus developing its own proprietary technology to offer to customers.
The Committee believed that this was fully in line with the intended purpose of the Company Milestone element: an example of a significant strategic achievement that will change our industry and build long-term value for shareholders.
The maximum opportunity under the Company Milestone was an award of shares deferred for three years worth up to 75% of salary for the Chief Executive and 50% of salary for the Group Finance Director.
The performance criteria and resulting awards as determined by the Committee are as follows: Performance criteria Outcome progress made Resulting award Remove threats and barriers Gained a permanent injunction enabling The Committee concluded so the business can launch the freedom to launch new technology to that 80% of the possible award Genus sexed semen technology in market should be made for each of the targeted markets Demonstrated that a competitor had wilfully Executive Directors.

As a result of this performance, the total annual bonus both the Core Element and Company Milestone awarded to the Executive Directors was: Annual bonus: Annual bonus: Core Element Company Milestone Total bonus Extent Extent to which to which targets Cash Deferred targets Deferred Total Deferred 1 were met bonus shares were met shares cash shares Total Karim Bitar 45.6% 234,236 78,079 80% 328,868 234,236 406,947 641,183 Stephen Wilson 45.6% 158,728 52,909 80% 148,569 158,728 201,478 360,206 1 The number of shares will be calculated in September when bonuses are paid.
How the Performance Share Plan Figure was Calculated in the Single Total Remuneration Table Karim Bitars and Stephen Wilsons PSP awards granted on 20 November 2014 were subject to a performance condition, based on the growth in adjusted earnings per share from 2014 to 2017.
The range of targets applicable to the awards, which had a value of 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and 175% of salary to the Group Finance Director, was as follows: % of award 1 Average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share vesting Less than 6% p. a. Nil 6% p. a.
100% 1 Straight line vesting between the points in the above table.
As with the short-term award, the Committee exercised discretion to calculate the long-term award after excluding gene editing costs incurred during the performance period, to avoid an unintended impact on the Executives remuneration.
The adjusted 2017 earnings per share after the cost of share based payments and adjusting for costs relating to gene editing was 68.1p.
This represents an average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share of 16.4% compared to the comparable 2014 adjusted earnings per share figure after the cost of share based payments.
The resulting level of 1 vesting is therefore 79.4% of maximum for both the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
Karim Bitars award was over a maximum of 86,271 shares, so the actual level of vesting is 68,499 shares and these will vest on 20 November 2017.
Stephen Wilsons award was over a maximum of 51,153 shares, so the actual level of vesting is 40,615 shares and these will vest on the same date.
The Companys average share price for the period from 1 April 2017 to 30 June 2017 was 1,821.95p, meaning that the values shown for these awards within the single figure table are 1,248,021 for Karim Bitar and 739,994 for Stephen Wilson.
1 The average annual earnings per share growth including the gene editing costs would be 13.7% and the associated vesting level would be 64% of maximum.

As previously communicated, the Chief Executive Karim Bitar has been appointed as a Non-Executive Director of Spectris Plc with effect from 1 July 2017.
Any fees or payments made in connection with this appointment will be disclosed in future remuneration reports.
What the Executive Directors Can Earn in 2018 A summary of this chapter is given on page 63.
Base Salary The Committee reviews the Executive Directors base salaries, taking into account factors such as individual and corporate performance, an assessment of market conditions and, most importantly, the salary increases applicable to the Groups other UK employees.

Annual Bonus: Company Milestone Element Value of bonus A Company Milestone element of up to 75% and 50% of salary for the Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director respectively.
Performance measures Company Milestones represent pivotal and significant events in the Companys development, which reposition the Company as an agricultural biotechnology pioneer.
Such events would be significant strategic achievements and long-term value creating.
The Committee has determined that this element of the annual bonus will be included for 2018 for the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
Due to commercial sensitivity the target and achievement against it including any resulting award will be disclosed retrospectively.
Bonus deferral For achievement of the Company Milestone element, any award will be deferred into shares for three years and will vest subject to continued employment, other than in certain good leaver circumstances.

What the Executive Directors Can Earn in 2018 continued Long-Term Incentives Awards to be granted in 2018 will be granted in line with the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders and under the 2014 PSP.
The Chief Executive will be granted an award over shares worth 200% of salary and the Group Finance Director will be granted an award over shares worth 175% of salary.
These awards are in line with those awarded in 2015, due to vest in 2018.
The performance targets for the awards to be granted in 2018 will primarily relate to average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share, measured over three years and excluding gene editing costs.
The same approach will govern awards due to vest in 2018.
The range of targets for the 2018 awards is as follows: Vesting 1 Average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share % award Less than 5% p. a.
100% Straight-line vesting between performance points.
1 Growth in adjusted earnings per share over the three-year performance period will be calculated on a simple average annual growth rate after the cost of share based payments and gene editing.
The Committee remains convinced that using adjusted earnings per share is the correct approach and is consistent with awards made in 2016.
The Committee believes the above targets are appropriately challenging, that they incentivise Executives to deliver the Companys growth strategy and are therefore aligned with shareholders interests.
They also adhere to the principles of transparency and simplicity, to maximise the incentive provided to participants by the 2014 PSP.
As with awards currently granted under the 2014 PSP, the Committee will retain the ability to scale back vesting based on earnings per share performance if it does not consider the vesting result to be consistent with the progress achieved against the Companys strategy during the performance period.
This is considered appropriate to broaden the Executive teams focus beyond financial performance.
2014 PSP awards granted in 2018 will continue to require the Executives to retain the after-tax number of shares vesting in 2020 for two years.
Clawback and malus provisions may be applied at the Committees discretion, if the Companys results are found to have been materially misstated within three years of vesting.
The Process the Committee Followed to Arrive at These Decisions The Committee complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
It makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on remuneration for the Executive Directors and other members of GELT.
The Committees full terms of reference are available on the Companys website at www.

The Group HR Director facilitates this process, presenting to the Committee on the pay structures across the organisation and how they fit the Groups Remuneration Policy.
The process includes a staff engagement survey that includes questions on pay, as well as consulting employees informally on their views of the current overall Remuneration Policy.
This forms part of the feedback provided to the Committee and is used by the Group HR Director to assess the Remuneration Policys ongoing effectiveness and the changes that should be made.
When setting the Executive Directors base salaries, the Committee compares the salary increases proposed for each Executive Director within those proposed for employees in their geographical location, as well as considering the typical increase proposed across the Group as a whole.

We were pleased to receive over 96% support for the changes which you will see referred to elsewhere within this Report.
There are no proposed changes to the Policy this year and therefore there will be no resolution seeking shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM.
We will continue to have the annual resolution seeking shareholder approval on how we have implemented the Remuneration Policy.
The table summarising the Remuneration Policy is shown below for information.
The full details of the revised Remuneration Policy can be found within our 2016 Annual Report which can be viewed through our website at www.
Directors Remuneration Policy Report The key objectives of the Remuneration Policy are that: pay should be competitive, so we can attract and retain the best people: fixed pay base salary, pension and benefits should take account of appropriate external benchmarks both in the UK where we are listed and globally and pay for our other employees: short and long-term incentive pay should provide the opportunity to earn upper quartile total remuneration, subject to delivering our above-market long-term growth aspirations: we can recognise significant biotechnology and strategic Company Milestones: incentive pay should be directly linked to the Groups strategy, with targets relating to our key performance indicators using non-financial input measures and or output measures such as earnings per share and should be stretching, in light of our strategic plan: incentive structures should be simple, reward long-term sustained growth and key strategic milestones, rather than volatile performance: the policy should be clearly aligned with shareholders interests, take due account of current best practice and not encourage undue risk taking: and policy principles for Executive Directors should apply to the members of the GELT, with appropriate tiering through the wider workforce.
