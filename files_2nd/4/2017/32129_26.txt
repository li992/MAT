Incentive outcomes for 2017 Annual bonus in respect of 2017 In 2017, the maximum bonus opportunity for executive Directors was 125% to 150% of salary, solely linked to performance as measured by an Economic Value Added EVA calculation.
For the CEO and FD 150% maximum and Group Talent and Communications Director 125% maximum, bonuses are calculated based on Group profit exceeding a target calculated fromthe profits for the three preceding financial years after charging cost of capital, including the cost of acquisitions.
As the EVA for each year is utilised for a further three years in the comparator calculations, executives must consider themedium-term interests of the Group otherwise there is the potential for an adverse impact on their capacity to earn a bonus.
EVA calculation: Minus Minus Plus minus Minus Profit for Equals a charge a charge on unrealised the resultant each year the EVA for on cost of working profit bonusitself acquisitions capital ininventory tomake it eachyear self-financing In the case of a Sector CEO 125% maximum, a bonus is earned if the profit of the sector for which they are responsible exceeds a target calculated from the profits of the three preceding financial years.
The profits calculated for this purpose regard each sector as a stand-alone group of companies charging it with the cost of capital it utilises including the cost of acquisitions.
Bonuses for 2017 are based on the sectoral allocation that existed throughout 2017.
Transitional provisions exist for restructuring to ensure Sector CEOs remain appropriately incentivised.
Subsidiary executives participate in bonus arrangements similar to those established for senior executives.

Directors pensions As noted below, two UK executive Directors are deferred members of the Halma Group Pension Plan Plan.
Their benefit is a funded final salary occupational pension from a plan registered with HMRC providing a maximum pension of two thirds of final pensionable salary after 25 or more years service at normal pension age 60.
Up to 5 April 2006, final pensionable salary was the greatest salary of the last three complete tax years immediately before retirement or leaving service.
From 6 April 2011, final pensionable salary was capped at 139,185 and is increased annually thereafter by CPI 155,528 for 2016 17.
Bonuses and other fluctuating emoluments and benefits-in-kind are not pensionable nor subject to any pension supplement.
The Plan also provides pensions in the event of early retirement through ill-health and dependants pensions of one-half of the members prospective pension.
Where an executive has a form of pension protection, life cover is provided by a separate trust.
Early retirement pensions, currently possible from age 55 with the consent of the Company and the trustees of the Plan, are subject to actuarial reduction.
Pensions in payment increase by 3% per annum for service up to 5 April 1997, by price inflation subject to a maximum of 5% through to 31 March 2007 and 3% thereafter.
Two UK executive Directors receive pension supplements to compensate them for the fact that their pension accrual entitlement under the Halma Group Pension Plan is limited by the pensionable salary cap introduced from 6 April 2006 or the Lifetime Allowance.
The Company introduced a pensionable salary cap in order to address changes affecting the Plan made in the Pension Act 2006.
The Company closed the DB section to future accrual with effect from 1 December 2014.
The Company obtains external advice regarding the changes to the Plan and executive pension arrangements and provides educational seminars on the impact of pension legislation changes annual and lifetime allowances on individuals.
Otherwise, executive Directors are responsible for obtaining advice specific to their circumstances.
Prior to drawing his pension, to the extent that a DB executives current salary exceeds the Plan salary cap, the Company compensates him at an annual rate of 26% of the excess.
In April 2006, Kevin Thompson chose to cease future service accrual in the Plan in return for the pension supplement on his full salary.
In April 2014, Andrew Williams chose to cease future service accrual in the Plan in return for the pension supplement on his full salary.
This change is, broadly, cost neutral.

Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension plan.
The transfer values are Gilt-related and depend upon the relative standings of the Gilt market at the respective valuation dates.
The increase in transfer values in recent years is predominantly due to the significant reduction in the yields available on UK Gilts.
Other factors that have increased thetransfer values are the impact of any additional service, revaluation in line with inflation and any real salary increases as well as the anticipated ageing of the member.
These values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
Adam Meyers is a member of the US 401k money purchase scheme.
