B5 REMUNERATION REPORT This report covers the activities of the Remuneration Committee for the year ended 30 September 2017 and sets out the remuneration details for the executive and non-executive directors of the Company.
It has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2008, as amended in August 2013, and the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
This report consists of the Statement by the Chairman of the Committee B5.1 and the Annual Report on Remuneration B5.2.
The policy summary tables extracted from the detailed Remuneration Policy are reproduced for reference as Section B5.3.
The full Remuneration Policy is set out in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 September 2016, a copy of which can be found at www.
B5.1 S tatement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee: Dear Shareholder Introduction Following my appointment as Remuneration Committee Chair on 20 September 2017, I am pleased to present Fiona J Clutterbuck the Companys remuneration report for the year ended 30 September 2017 to shareholders.
Chairman of the Audit Committee I have been a member of the Board and Remuneration Committee since 2012 and I recognise and support the philosophy the Group has adopted towards pay throughout the organisation: seeking to recognise fairly and equitably the contributions to the Group of all employees.
For executive directors, the aim is to ensure that their rewards are aligned with the interests of shareholders through the achievement of the Groups strategic objectives and with a focus on appropriate risk management.
These were the principles underpinning the remuneration policy which was put to shareholders at the 2017 Annual General Meeting and the Committee and I were pleased and encouraged by the high level of shareholder support.
An active dialogue with shareholders has been maintained throughout the year.
As part of our annual governance review myself, the Chairman, the former Chairman of the Committee, the People Director and the Company Secretary met with a number of major shareholders in October 2017.
We also engaged with shareholders earlier in the year to discuss proposed changes to fide-risk pension arrangements for the executive directors and more widely in the Group.
I should like to express my sincere thanks to my predecessor as Chairman of the Committee, Alan Fletcher, for his tireless efforts in chairing the Committee, and for developing Paragons remuneration policy over a period of significant change for both the business and for remuneration reporting, since his appointment in 2011. Business performance The year saw the completion of the Groups strategic reorganisation with most of the Groups activities moving under its banking subsidiary, which involved a significant amount of management time.
Underlying profits rose by 1.0% to 145.2 million 2016: 143.8 million.
Profits on the statutory basis increased by 1.1% to 144.8 million 2016: 143.2 million and basic earnings per share increased by 6.4% to 43.1p 2016: 40.5p whilst absorbing over 10 million of Tier 2 Bond related costs.
The year has seen continued strong growth levels in organic business generation and further debt purchase activity.
Although the level of portfolio acquisitions was lower at 98.0 million 2016: 208.8 million, group wide organic originations rose 28.8% to 1,853.4 million 2016: 1,439.1 million.
PAGE 80 Corporate Governance PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC 2017 Annual Report and Accounts Remuneration outcomes for the year The Committee recommended salary increases for the executive directors of 3.0%, in line with the average increase of 3.2% for the wider workforce, which came into effect from 1 October 2017.
Strong financial performance and risk management resulted in bonus out-turns of 90% of maximum opportunity for Nigel Terrington and Richard Woodman and 82.5% for John Heron.
Details of the performance relating to these bonuses are provided in section B5.2.
In assessing personal performance, the Committee took into account the continued excellent growth and focus on an expanding portfolio at a time when a major Group legal and regulatory re-structuring was also taking place.
As stated last year, full retrospective disclosure of the target range for the bonuses for the year ended 30 September 2017 will be included in the 2018 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Awards granted under the Performance Share Plan PSP in 2014 and which vested in respect of performance in the three years ended 30 September 2017 were subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition, measured against the FTSE-250 Index 50% of the award, and an EPS growth condition 50% of the award.
Following the delivery of EPS growth above expectation, and share price improvement, the Companys TSR performance over the period ranked above median and EPS exceeded the upper target.
This resulted in the awards vesting at 63.51% of maximum.
During the year, the Committee gave careful consideration to the existing pension obligations of the Group to the executive directors and other senior staff who had participated in the Groups defined benefit pension plan the Plan which was closed to new members from 5 February 2002.
These individuals received a pension supplement in exchange for ceasing future accrual in 2006 2007, as a method of fide-risking the Plan.
Certain employees including Richard Woodman also received a supplement for breaking their salary link in 2011, again as a method of fide-risking the Plan.
These are contractual benefits and the supplement payments are cost neutral to the Group: calculated triennially by Mercer, the Groups actuarial adviser, to be the same as the cost of the benefits surrendered.
This legacy pension arrangement reflects the unique tenure of the management team whose combined experience with the Group is approaching 90 years.
Workforce tenure generally is also exceptionally high nearly twice the national average for financial services and three times for management.
The most recent review by Mercer, concluded that changes in financial conditions, particularly over 2016, have significantly increased the supplements for the executive directors: Nigel Terrington from 38% to 55%, John Heron from 38% to 54% and for Richard Woodman from a combined total of 49% to 103% the revised supplements.
This level of increase is due to his promotion to Group Finance Director in June 2014 and consequent increase in base salary, contrasted with the previous actuarial assumptions of small increments in salary.
The review also resulted in similar increases for certain senior staff below executive director level.
The changes were due to apply from 1 April 2017 and whilst these are contractual rights and cost neutral to the Group, the Committee is aware that the actual percentages are increasingly out of line with peer groups, which mainly consist of individuals in receipt of a company contribution to a defined contribution pension scheme.
Taking into account the Groups unique situation, the Committees overriding concern was that this legacy pension issue may continue and worsen over time if it was not addressed.
The Committee therefore proposed the following.
Firstly, that the part of the supplement payable to Richard Woodman, which relates to his past service i. e. what the Group would legally be required to pay him if he left the Group should be settled as a lump sum, recognising that this is a contractual liability related to past not future service.
This amounted to 1.006 million and is disclosed in the single figure table.
This reduced the revised pension supplement figure to 63%.
Secondly, that the revised supplements for all three executive directors should be reduced and fixed at 45% with effect from 1 April 2017.
There is no compensation proposed for any of the executive directors for the reduction in their pension provision despite the contractual nature of these arrangements.
To ensure equal treatment for everyone in the same situation, where settlement payments were due to other senior managers, similar arrangements were offered i. e. Richard Woodman was not treated any more favourably than those below Board level.
The revised supplements for these employees were also fixed at 45% with effect from 1 April 2017.
However, in contrast to the executive directors, these individuals did receive compensation for the difference between their revised pension supplement and 45%, as calculated by Mercer.
Finally, the three executive directors transferred their pension funds out of the Plan, effective 30 September 2016, at no gain or loss to the Group.
Details of this transfer are provided in section B5.2.
The Plan actuary has advised the Pension Trustee that the transfers will benefit the Plan in the long-term by reducing scheme size and improving the funding position relative to a buyout and self-sufficiency basis.
Shareholders will be aware that the pension contribution payable for any new external executive director appointments was capped at a maximum of 25% in the 2017 remuneration policy, although as communicated in the Chairmans statement in the Directors Remuneration Report last year, this is likely to be 10% to 15% in practice.
These changes reflect the very specific position for Paragon with a legacy pension issue arising from the unique long term tenure of the management team.
Changes proposed for 2018 Changes proposed for the coming financial year are minimal.
The TSR comparator group has been reviewed to reflect the changes in the finance sector over the last few months and as a consequence constituents have been amended slightly.
The Committee reviewed the fees payable to the Chairman and agreed to an increase from 240,000 to 255,000 in recognition of the absence of an increase in fees since October 2015 in a role which has become increasingly involved and complex as the Group has expanded.
Non-executive directors base fees were also increased in recognition of the greater complexity involved in a banking group.
The Committee will continue to engage with shareholders and hopes that it can rely on your continuing support at the AGM on 15 February 2018.

The pension settlement relates to a legacy payment due to Richard Woodman for past service.
Further detail is provided in the pensions note below.

PAGE 84 Corporate Governance PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC 2017 Annual Report and Accounts Pension allowance and pension accruals Nigel Terrington, Richard Woodman and John Heron were members of the Paragon Pension Plan the Plan, the Groups defined benefit pension plan, until 30 September 2016.
Following which time, they took a cash equivalent transfer of benefits in the Plan, receiving a lump sum value on a no gain, no loss basis.
These transfer values were 6.1 million, 2.0 million and 3.4 million respectively.
Their entitlements under the Plan are shown below.
Accumulated total accrued annual pension at 30 September 2017 2016 Director Description of entitlement 000 000 N S Terrington Benefits were transferred out of the Plan during the year based on - 178 accumulated pension at 30 September 2016.
Formerly entitled to 1 48.375th of final salary per year of service, payable from age 60.
Could take reduced early retirement from age 55.
Ceased pension accrual on 6 April 2006 but retained final salary linkage.
R J Woodman Benefits were transferred out of the Plan during the year based on - 62 accumulated pension at 30 September 2016.
Formerly entitled to 1 46.625th of final salary per year of service, payable from age 60.
Ceased pension accrual on 9 October 2007 and opted out of final salary linkage from 1 April 2011.
J A Heron Benefits were transferred out of the Plan during the year based on - 100 accumulated pension at 30 September 2016.
Formerly entitled to 1 49.125th of final salary per year of service, payable from age 60.
The entitlements shown above represent the weighted average of service years for which accrual was earned at 1 60 of final salary and those for which accrual was earned at 1 37.5.
The executive directors had previously ceased pension accrual, as shown in the table above.
This was in return for a cash supplement calculated, as a percentage of salary, to equate to the cost of the Groups contributions towards future service benefits had each individual stayed within the Plan for his future service accrual.
This supplement was assessed every three years and was assessed during the current year by the Groups actuaries.
The outcome of this assessment is set out below and, recognising the substantial cost to the Group of meeting these obligations, the Committee asked the executive directors to agree to fix this cash supplement at 45% of base salary going forward, so that the Group would have known costs associated with pension provision.
For all three directors, the fixed percentage was a lower amount than their actual contractual entitlement based on the most recent figures presented by the Groups actuaries.
These contributions in respect of further pension provision for each of the directors are shown as pension allowance in the single total figure of remuneration table.
The change to 45% was made with effect from 1 April 2017, and no compensation was paid or payable to the executive directors in respect of this change.
% of salary Contractual pension supplement entitlement Fixed pension supplement based on most recent actuarial assessment with effect from 1 April 2017 N S Terrington 55% 45% R J Woodman 103% 45% J A Heron 54% 45% In assessing these values, the percentage due to Richard Woodman was higher due to an outstanding amount owed which related to past service i. e. what the Group would legally be required to pay him if he left the Group.
This outstanding entitlement owing to Richard Woodman amounted to 1.006 million and this was paid to him during the year.
It is shown in the single figure remuneration table as pension settlement.
The consequence of settling this legacy contractual liability, which related to past not future service, was to reduce the pension supplement to 63% from the 103% shown above.
As explained above, Richard Woodman agreed to reduce this supplement to 45% without compensation.

For any new external appointment, however, the Committee has introduced a holding period of two years to encourage share participation.
