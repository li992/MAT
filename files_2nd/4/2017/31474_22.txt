Governance Remuneration report A statement to Shareholders from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Douglas Caster Committee Chairman I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended For the 2018 LTIP cycle, it is proposed to retain the ROIC measure, first 31 December 2017. introduced in 2017.
This measure includes total intangible assets in the definition of capital employed.
This is felt to be a more complete measure 2017 has seen significant progress in the implementation of the Groups of the return on capital employed and so will incentivise better capital new strategy, with Morgan investing in sustainable, long-term growth as management across the Group.
The range being applied to the ROIC well as implementing portfolio re-shaping as first outlined by Pete Raby measure remains unchanged at 16%-19%.

Policy report Key principles of the executive Directors Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that all the remuneration packages offered by Morgan are competitive and designed to promote the long-term success of the Company by ensuring that we are able to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior executives of the right calibre to create value for shareholders.
The policy of the Committee is to ensure that a significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity is performance-related, with an appropriate balance between shortand long-term performance, and is based on the achievement of measurable targets that are relevant to, and support the business strategy.
The Remuneration Committee will keep the Remuneration Policy under periodic review to ensure it remains aligned with the Groups strategy, and in line with the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to Directors remuneration.
This includes ensuring that performancerelated elements are transparent, stretching and rigorously applied, as well as reflecting the guidance of institutional investors and their representative bodies.
Summary of Morgan Advanced Materials plcs Remuneration Policy for executive Directors This section of the Report sets out the current Remuneration Policy for executive Directors and non-executive Directors.
This Policy remains unchanged from that which was approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM and which is effective for a period of up to three years from that date.
The only amendments to the Policy Report published in the 2016 annual report are: To update the data used in the pay-for-performance scenario analysis to provide figures for 2018.
To remove references to pension arrangements for executive Directors who joined before 1 August 2011 as both executive Directors joined after this date.
To remove references to the move from ROCE to ROIC in the LTIP from 2017 onwards.

Cash bonuses will be subject to clawback, with deferred shares subject to malus over the deferral period.
LTIP awards are subject to malus over the vesting period and clawback from the vesting date to the fifth anniversary of grant.
Payments under existing awards The Company will honour any commitment entered into, and Directors will be eligible to receive payment from any award granted, prior to the approval and implementation of the current Remuneration Policy detailed in this Report ie before 6 May 2016, even if these commitments and or awards fall outside the above Policy.
The Company will also honour any commitment entered into at a time prior to an individual becoming a Director if, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
Details of these awards are, and will be, disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Difference in policy between executive Directors and other employees The Remuneration Policy for other employees is based on principles broadly consistent with those described in this Report for the executive Directors.
Annual salary reviews across the Group take into account business performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in comparable companies.
All executives are eligible to participate in an annual bonus scheme.
Opportunities and performance measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individuals role.
Other senior executives participate in the LTIP on similar terms to the executive Directors, although award sizes and performance measures may vary according to each individual, and by organisational level.
Below this level, executives are eligible to participate in the LTIP and other share-based incentives by annual invitation.
Use of discretion To ensure fairness and align executive Director remuneration with underlying individual and Group performance, the Committee may exercise its discretion to adjust, upwards or downwards, the outcome of any shortor long-term incentive plan payment within the limits of the relevant Plan Rules for corporate or exceptional events including, but not limited to: corporate transactions, changes in the Groups accounting policies, minor or administrative matters, internal promotions, external recruitment, terminations, etc.
Any adjustments in light of corporate events will be made on a neutral basis, to not be to the benefit or detriment of participants.
Any use of discretion by the Committee during the financial year under review will be detailed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance measure selection The Committee considers carefully the selection of performance measures at the start of each performance cycle, taking into consideration the macro-economic environment as well as specific Group strategic objectives.
Annual bonus measures are selected to closely reinforce the Groups short-term KPIs.
Because these can change from year to year in line with the Remuneration Policy, information on the rationale for the selection of bonus measures for each year has been moved to the Annual Report on Remuneration.
LTIP performance measures are reviewed periodically to ensure they continue to align with the Companys strategy, as well as provide an appropriate balance between growth and returns, internal and external performance, and absolute and relative performance.
For 2018 awards, the TSR element of the LTIP award will continue to comprise two parts.
One half of the TSR element will vest subject to the Groups performance relative to a TSR benchmark comprising the 109 constituents of the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index.
This benchmark is robust to merger and acquisition activity and comprises companies that are subject to the same market influences as Morgan Advanced Materials plc.
The remaining half of the TSR element will vest subject to Morgans performance relative to a TSR benchmark comprising 16 listed international carbon, ceramics and other materials companies.
This benchmark was selected to complement the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index with a group of companies that better reflect Morgans business, the markets in which Morgan operates and the geographical footprint of the Group.
For each part of the TSR award, the vesting performance range is calibrated to be stretching and in line with common market practice for FTSE TSR-based long-term incentives.
EPS targets are set taking account of multiple relevant reference points, including internal forecasts, external expectations for future EPS performance at both Morgan Advanced Materials plc and its closest sector peers, and typical EPS performance ranges at other FTSE 350 companies.
LTIP EPS performance ranges are set to represent demanding and challenging performance targets over the three-year performance period.
For 2018, it is proposed to continue to use ROIC first introduced to the 2017 LTIP cycle.
The Board considers ROIC to be the most appropriate measure of value creation because it measures the efficiency of Morgans total capital base.
For the 2018 LTIP cycle, ROIC will continue to be calculated as follows: EBITA pre-specific adjusting items 12-month average third-party working capital total fixed assets total intangible fixed assets ROIC targets are set using a similar approach to the EPS targets, after consideration of external reference points and reflecting the returns required to meet and exceed the Groups internal strategic plan.
Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 75 Governance Remuneration report continued Share ownership guidelines In order to encourage alignment with shareholders, individual shareholding guidelines are operated for executive Directors.
Under such guidelines, executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain over time a shareholding in the Company equivalent to at least 200% of basic salary.
Current executive Director shareholdings are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 86.
External appointments With the approval of the Board in each case, and subject to the overriding requirements of the Group, executive Directors may accept external appointments as non-executive Directors of other companies and retain any fees received.
Details of external directorships held by executive Directors along with fees retained are provided on page 83.
Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis The graphs below provide detailed illustrations of the potential future reward opportunity for executive Directors, and the potential mix between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Below threshold, Target and Stretch.
These have been updated to illustrate the potential opportunity under the 2018 packages proposed for executive Directors.

For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for 2018 before mandatory deferral into shares.
The LTIP is based on the face value of awards to be granted in 2018 150% of salary.
It should be noted that any awards granted under the LTIP in a year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant.
This illustration is intended to provide further information to shareholders on the relationship between executive pay and performance.
The value of the LTIP assumes no increase in the underlying value of the shares, and actual amounts delivered will be further influenced by changes in factors such as the Companys share price and the value of dividends paid.
The following assumptions have been made in compiling the above charts: Scenario Annual bonus LTIP Fixed pay Stretch Maximum annual bonus.
Performance warrants full vesting 100% of the award.
Latest disclosed base salary, Target On-target annual bonus.
Performance warrants threshold pension and benefits.
Below threshold No annual bonus payable.
Details of executive Directors service contracts The executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment with Morgan Advanced Materials plc.
Contracts may be terminated on 12 months notice given by the Company or on six months notice given by the executive Director concerned.
The following table shows the date of the contract for each executive Director who served during the year: Notice period Date of service Executive Director Position Date of appointment agreement From employer From employee Pete Raby CEO 1 A ugust 2015 30 January 2015 12 months 6 months Peter Turner CFO 1 1 April 2016 30 March 2016 12 months 6 months 76 Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Exit Payments Policy The Groups policy on exit payments is to limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements comprising base salary and any other statutory payments only.
In the event that the employment of an executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
The Group may terminate the employment of an executive Director by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to base salary, together with the fair value of any other benefits to which the executive is contractually entitled under his or her service agreement, for the duration of the notice period.
The Remuneration Committee will exercise discretion in making appropriate payments in the context of outplacement, settling legal claims or potential legal claims by the departing executive Director, including any other amounts reasonably due to the executive Director, for example, to meet the legal fees incurred by the executive Director in connection with the termination of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement and the individual must seek independent legal advice.
On termination of an executive Directors service contract, the Remuneration Committee will consider the departing Directors duty to mitigate his or her loss when determining the timing of when any payment in lieu of notice will be made.
There is no automatic entitlement to bonus or the vesting of long-term incentives on termination.
However, the table that follows summarises the Policy on how awards under the annual bonus and LTIP will normally be treated in specific circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to Committee discretion: Treatment of awards on cessation of employment and a change of control Reason for cessation Calculation of vesting payment Time of vesting Annual bonus All reasons The Committee may determine that a bonus is payable on cessation of employment, and the Committee retains discretion to determine that the bonus should be paid wholly in cash.
The amount of bonus payable will be determined in the context of the time served during the performance year, the performance of the Group and of the individual over the relevant period, and the circumstances of the Directors loss of office.
If Group or individual performance has been poor, or if the individuals employment has been terminated in circumstances amounting to misconduct, no bonus will be payable.
Mandatory deferred bonus share awards Injury, disability, death, redundancy, Awards will normally vest in full ie not pro-rated for time.

The Remuneration Committee retains discretion, where permitted by the scheme rules, to alter these default provisions on a case-by-case basis, following a review of circumstances and to ensure fairness for both shareholders and participants.
Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 77 Governance Remuneration report continued Approach to recruitment remuneration External appointment In cases of hiring or appointing a new executive Director from outside the Group, the Committee may make use of all existing components of remuneration, as follows: Pay element Policy on recruitment Maximum Salary Based on: the size and nature of the responsibilities of the proposed role: current market pay levels for comparable roles: the candidates experience: implications for total remuneration: internal relativities: and the candidates current salary.
Pension Option to join the defined contribution scheme, and or to receive a cash allowance.

Annual bonus As described in the Policy table and typically pro-rated for proportion of 150% of salary.
year served: performance measures may include strategic and operational objectives tailored to the individual in the financial year of joining.
LTIP New appointees may be granted awards under the LTIP on similar terms 250% of salary.
Other The Remuneration Committee may make an award under a different structure under the relevant Listing Rule to replace incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Any such award would have a fair value no higher than that of the awards forfeited, taking into account relevant factors including performance conditions, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
Details of any such award will be disclosed in the first Annual Report on Remuneration following its grant.
Internal promotion to the Board In cases of appointing a new executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Policy will be consistent with that for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to executive Director, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements even if there are instances where they would not otherwise be consistent with the prevailing executive Director Remuneration Policy at the time of promotion.

Rob Rowley stepped down from the Board on 31 July 2017.
Jane Aikman was appointed a Director on 31 July 2017 and a resolution to propose her election will be voted on by shareholders at the 2018 AGM.
Consideration of employment conditions The Group seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodies including trade unions and works councils as part of its broader employee engagement strategy, and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
In making remuneration decisions, the Remuneration Committee also considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group, but the Committee does not currently consult with employees specifically on the executive Remuneration Policy and framework.
Prior to the annual salary review, the Remuneration Committee is briefed by the Director of Group Human Resources about pay increase data that individual business units will consider when deciding local pay awards for their specific businesses and countries.
This also forms part of the considerations for determining executive Director remuneration.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee considers shareholder views received during the year and at the AGM each year, as well as guidance from investor representative bodies more broadly, in shaping its Remuneration Policy.
The Committee keeps the Remuneration Policy under regular review, to ensure it continues to reinforce the Groups long-term strategy, and aligns executive Directors interests with those of shareholders.
It is the Remuneration Committees policy to consult with major shareholders prior to any major changes to its executive Remuneration Policy.
Annual report on remuneration The following section provides details of how the Remuneration Policy was implemented during the year.
Remuneration Committee membership in 2017 The Remuneration Committee is currently composed of five non-executive Directors.
Each of the non-executive Directors is regarded by the Board as independent, except the Chairman of the Company who was considered independent upon appointment.
The Remuneration Committee met four times during the year.
Attendance at meetings by individual members is detailed in the Corporate Governance Report on page 59.
Committee members Douglas Caster Chairman Andrew Shilston Helen Bunch Laurence Mulliez 1 Jane Aikman 2 Rob Rowley 1.
Jane Aikman was appointed to the Board and the Committee on 31 July 2017.
Rob Rowley stepped down from the Board and the Committee on 31 July 2017.

P ension: the figure is a cash allowance of 20% of base pay in lieu of pension.
Other: for Pete Raby comprises the value of Sharesave options granted in the year, based on the embedded value at grant 20% of the grant-date share price multiplied by the number of options granted.
Full details of executive Director Sharesave options are available on pages 87 to 88 of the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Incentive outcomes for the year ended 31 December 2017 Annual bonus in respect of 2017 performance Targets for the annual bonus are set by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the shortand long-term requirements of the Group.
Challenging goals are set, which must be met before any bonus is paid.
This approach is intended to align executive reward with shareholder return by rewarding the achievement of stretch targets.
For 2017, the bonus targets for the executive Directors were split between Group EBITA before restructuring weighted 40%, cash generation weighted 40% and individual strategic personal objectives weighted 20%.
The targets were set to incentivise the executive Directors to deliver stretching profit and cash performance for the Group.
In addition to the achievement of the targets set, in considering any awards to be made, the Committee also takes into account the quality of the overall performance of the Group.
The table that follows sets out retrospectively the assessment of performance relative to the 2017 bonus targets for the executive Directors.
Actual bonus payments are shown in the single total figure of remuneration table above.
80 Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Performance range Actual % of maximum Threshold Maximum performance % payout % salary Performance measure bonus element 0% payout 100% payout outcome of element earned 1 Group EBITA 40% 105.6m 121.1m 116.4m 70% 42% 1 2 Cash generation 40% 133.9m 149.0m 160.7m 70% 42% Personal objectives Pete Raby 20% Please see narrative below for further details 77% 23% on objectives and performance against these Peter Turner 20% 77% 23% % of salary earned Maximum bonus Group Cash Personal Total Total 1 1 Overall outcome % salary EBITA generation objectives outcome payable Pete Raby 150% 42% 42% 23% 107% 529,650 Peter Turner 150% 42% 42% 23% 107% 420,189 1.
For both the EBITA and cash generation metrics, there was a straight-line payout between the threshold and maximum figures and all figures were calculated using 2017 budgeted exchange rates.
Not withstanding the excellent performance as a whole for cash generation, three of the quarterly cash targets, introduced in 2017, were missed.
As a result, pay out of this element was reduced from 100% to 70%.
Pete Rabys personal objectives were based on seven main priorities: 1 drive improvement in the safety culture and behaviours for the Group, 2 talent management, 3 review the top level structure of the business, 4 technology priorities and performance, 5 sales effectiveness, 6 portfolio management and 7 operational improvements.
Payout of this element was adjudicated at 76.7% of the maximum, reflecting that Pete delivered against the majority of these priorities during 2017.
This notably included the development of the talent pool, the delivery of operational improvements across the Group and the review and development of the top level structure of the Group and wider organisation to support strategy execution, optimise capability levels and enhance growth.
Peter Turners personal objectives were based on six main priorities: 1 drive improvement in the safety culture and behaviours for the Group, 2 strengthen financial controls 3 support operational improvement, 4 execute pension strategy, 5 develop the finance team and 6 improve cash management.
Payout of this element was adjudicated at 76.7% of the maximum, reflecting that Peter delivered against the majority of these objectives.
This notably included the strengthening of financial controls across the Group and the execution of the pension strategy.
Further, Peter Turner supported the continued development of the Group corporate strategy and execution against that, partnering with the CEO.
2015 LTIP award vesting Awards granted to executive Directors in 2015 were subject to relative TSR performance, EPS growth and Group ROCE over a three-year period ended 31 December 2017.
The EPS target applying to one-third of each award required three-year EPS growth of 6% per annum for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting for EPS growth of 15% pa or higher.
Over the period Morgan Advanced Materials plcs actual EPS growth was below threshold and accordingly none of the EPS element of the award will vest under this criterion.
The TSR target applying to one-third of each award required Morgan Advanced Materials plcs three-year TSR performance to rank at median against constituents of the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Advanced Materials plcs TSR ranked at or above the upper quartile against this Index.
Morgan Advanced Materials plcs TSR was 23.6%, which was at the 37th percentile versus the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index.
Accordingly, none of the TSR element of the award will vest under this criterion.
The Group ROCE target applying to the remaining one-third of each award required three-year Group ROCE of 27% for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting for Group ROCE of 33% or higher.
Morgan Advanced Materials plcs Group ROCE was 28.4%, which resulted in 46.3% of this element vesting.
This combined performance resulted in a partial vesting of the 2015 awards based on 15.4% achievement of maximum.
Details of the awards to executive Directors are set out in the table below: Maximum Maximum potential potential LTIP-CSOP LTIP award LTIP-CSOP LTIP-CSOP 1 Director LTIP award award vested award vested award exercised Date of vesting Pete Raby 127,543 8,696 19,641 1,339 3 August 2018 1.
Peter Turner had not joined the Board in 2015 and therefore did not participate in this cycle.
For the purposes of the 2015 LTIP award, the financial results were adjusted to neutralise the effects of divestments in 2017.
Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 81 Governance Remuneration report continued The interest in the 2015 LTIP retained by Andrew Hosty who left the Group on 8 January 2016 will vest in line with performance conditions and has been pro-rated according to time served.
The vested amount of Andrew Hostys 2015 LTIP award will be 15.4% of 31,905 shares.
2015 recruitment award to Pete Raby As disclosed in the 2015 Remuneration Report, an award of 114,351 Ordinary shares in the Company valued on the date of award at 400,000, calculated using the share price on 3 August 2015 of 3.4980 was made to Pete Raby on 3 August 2015 in connection with his recruitment.
This award was granted in accordance with the Recruitment Policy, and was made in recognition of the fair value of incentive awards which he forfeited on leaving his former employer.
The second tranche of this award comprising 57,175 shares vested on 31 December 2017.
There were no performance conditions attached to this award, reflecting the structure of the award forfeited by Pete Raby on joining Morgan.

82 Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The Committee discusses and reviews the performance criteria for new three-year LTIP awards before they are granted.
For the awards granted in 2017, the Committee considered the balance of measures in light of the Groups business plan and shareholder feedback, and decided to maintain the equal one-third weighting of the three performance criteria.
For the 2017 LTIP award, the TSR element was split into two parts.
One-half of this element will vest based on Morgans TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Industrial Index comprising 115 companies and one-half will vest based on Morgans TSR performance relative to a tailored comparator group of 16 industry comparators.
The table below sets out the targets attaching to the 2017 LTIP awards: TSR vs FTSE All-Share % of award TSR performance % of award % of award % of award Industrials Index that vests vs peer group that vests EPS growth that vests Group ROIC that vests Upper quartile 16.67% Upper quartile 16.67% 11% pa 33.33% 19% 33.33% Median 4.17% Median 4.17% 4% pa 8.33% 16% 8.33% Below median Nil Below median Nil 4% pa Nil 16% Nil For executive Directors, a two-year holding period was introduced in relation to the 2017 LTIP.
Dividends accrue over the vesting period and are paid on any shares that vest.
2017 Deferred Bonus Plan awards In 2017, 33% of the annual bonus results for Pete Raby and Peter Turner for performance in the 2016 financial year were deferred into shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan DBP, in line with Morgans Remuneration Policy.
The following DBP awards were granted: Value of awards at grant Number of DBP shares Value of award Date of Executive Director granted vesting Pete Raby 21,751 68,709 3 March 2020 Peter Turner 15,173 47,930 3 March 2020 Calculated using the award price of 3.1588, being the average share price for the five days prior to the award date.
Exit payments made in year The auditor is required to report on this information.
No exit payments were made to executive Directors during the 2017 financial year.
Payments to past Directors The auditor is required to report on this information.
As disclosed in the 2016 Remuneration Report, Kevin Dangerfield was eligible for a time pro-rated cash bonus for the period 1 January to 31 March 2016.
The resulting bonus was paid on 28 February 2017.
External appointments No external appointments were held by either executive Director in the 2017 financial year.
Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2018 Base salary In line with the Remuneration Policy, executive Directors salaries were reviewed by the Committee and increased for 2018.
The table below shows the base salaries in 2017, and those that took effect from 1 January 2018: Base salary at: 1 January 1 January Executive Director Position 2018 2017 Increase Pete Raby CEO 520,000 495,000 5.05% Peter Turner CFO 400,600 392,700 2.00% The increase awarded to Pete Raby reflects the Committees policy to bring Petes salary into line with market over time, reflecting his continued strong performance in the role.
Future above-inflation increases will continue to be based on Pete Rabys performance in the role and the performance of the Group.
The rationale for any future increases will be disclosed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
In agreeing the increase awarded to Peter Turner, the Committee has been mindful of the range of increases to be awarded across the Group of 2% 2.5% on average in 2018, as well as Peter Turners strong performance in the role.
Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 83 Governance Remuneration report continued Pension Pete Raby and Peter Turner will continue to receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension worth 20% of salary.
Annual bonus in respect of 2018 performance The maximum bonus opportunity remains at 150% of salary with 33% of any bonus result deferred into shares for a further three-year period.
The performance measures attached to the annual bonus remain unchanged from 2017, as follows: EBITA 40% Cash generation 40% measured against quarterly cumulative targets as well as over the complete financial year.
For every quarterly target that is missed, the payout warranted for full-year performance under this element will be reduced by 10% Strategic personal objectives 20% The actual performance targets set at the beginning of the performance period are not disclosed as they are considered commercially sensitive at this time, given the close link between performance measures and the Groups longer-term strategy.
This is particularly relevant in the context of some of the Groups close and unlisted competitors who are not required to disclose such information, and for whom the assumptions in our targets would provide valuable information in the current trading year.
We will disclose these targets retrospectively, at such time as these targets have become less commercially sensitive, and within three years of the end of the performance year.
2018 LTIP awards In March 2018, Pete Raby and Peter Turner will be granted awards under the 2018 LTIP with face value of 150% of their respective base salaries for 2018.
The three-year performance period over which performance will be measured began on 1 January 2018 and will end on 31 December 2020.
Further details of the awards will be disclosed in next years Report.
The performance measures are detailed below: The relative TSR element of the LTIP will remain equally split between two comparator benchmarks to ensure the relevance and robustness of the TSR element.
The two comparator benchmarks are the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index and the following tailored group of international sector comparators: BASF, Carborundum, Ibiden, Imerys, Krosaki Harima, LyondellBasell, Magnesita, Mersen, Minerals Technologies, RHI, SGL Carbon, Sumitomo Chemical, Toyo Tanso, Vesuvius, Victrex and Worley Parsons.
Each TSR element will operate independently, with vesting determined based on Morgans TSR rank relative to constituents of each TSR benchmark.
The performance range for each element will remain median to upper quartile.
The EPS and ROIC performance ranges will remain unchanged, at 4%-11% p. a. for EPS and 16%-19% for ROIC.
The Committee believes these ranges appropriately support the Groups strategy for sustainable long-term growth over the next three years whilst continuing to represent suitably demanding targets.
For all three measures, awards will continue to vest on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum, with 25% of each element vesting at threshold.
For the 2018 LTIP cycle, and in response to shareholder feedback, executive Directors will be required to hold any vested 2018 LTIP awards for an additional two-year period.
Vested awards that are subject to the holding period will remain subject to clawback in line with our Policy, but will not be forfeitable on cessation of employment.
Chairman and non-executive Director fees The Chairmans and non-executive Directors fees were reviewed in December 2017.
The following fees will apply in 2018: Role 2017 fee pa 2018 fee pa Increase Chairman 182,100 185,750 2.0% Non-executive Director 47,940 48,900 2.0% Committee Chairman additional fee, excluding Nomination Committee 8,000 8,000 0% Senior Independent Director additional fee 8,000 8,000 0% 84 Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Percentage change in CEO remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from 2016 to 2017 compared to the average percentage change in remuneration for other UK-based employees over the same period.

Details of plans LTIP Plan Details 2015 awards granted to executive Directors are subject to relative TSR, EPS and ROCE.
The EPS target applying to a third of each award requires three-year EPS growth above a threshold of 6% pa of that element to vest, commencing at 30% vesting for that element, and rising to full vesting for EPS growth of 15% pa or higher.
The TSR target applying to another third of each award requires Morgan Advanced Materials three-year TSR performance to rank at median against the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Advanced Materials TSR ranks at or above the upper quartile against the companies in this Index.
The ROCE element was set at a 27%-33% range, vesting on a straight-line basis, with 30% of the measure vesting at the 27% threshold.
ROCE is measured in the final year of the performance period.
2015, 2016, 2017 The 2016 awards were on the same basis as the 2015 awards described above, except that the EPS target range was 4%11% pa.
