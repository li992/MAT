Policy and principles The current Directors remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the AGM on 31 January 2017 remains in force.
The Committee will consider the remuneration policy annually to ensure that it remains aligned with business needs and is appropriately positioned relative to the market.
There is no intention to revise the policy more frequently than every three years, unless amendments to the policy are required in the interim, in which case appropriate shareholder approval will be sought.
An abridged version of the policy which includes the remuneration tables for Executive and Non-Executive Directors is included in the following pages for reference.
This does not replace or override the full approved policy which is available on pages 106115 of the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts available at: www.
com investor-centre annual-reports Details on how the policy will be applied in 2018 are included on pages 108 to 109 of the report.
In applying this policy the Group remuneration approach remains to: provide competitive, transparent and fair rewards, benefits and conditions: reward achievement of shortand long-term individual objectives and business strategy: align the interests of colleagues and shareholders through colleague share ownership: deliver outcomes over shortand long-term horizons with appropriate performance and risk adjustments, ensuring performance assurance principles are applied: support the RMF with regard for the risk appetite of the Group: and attract, recognise, motivate and retain high performers.
Remuneration arrangements are fully compliant with, and will be operated in line with, all regulatory requirements, including the PRA Remuneration Code and are in line with UK listed financial services sector best practice.
CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 99 Governance Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration policy abridged continued Our peer group companies The CYBG comparator peer group was reviewed by the Committee and is defined as other UK-based banks and wider financial services firms of a comparable size, divisional heads in larger UK banks and other FTSE companies reflecting our market capitalisation.
Elements of package fixed remuneration The policy in relation to each element of Executive Directors remuneration is set out in the following tables.
Base salary Purpose and link to strategy Recruit, reward, retain and recognise leadership position and responsibility for delivering strategy.
Operation Base salaries are paid in 12 equal monthly instalments during the year and are reviewed annually.
Any changes are effective from 1 January.
When determining and reviewing base salaries, the Committee considers: Group and individual performance: the skills, experience and responsibilities of the Executive Director and their market value: the scope and size of the role: base salary increases for colleagues throughout the Group: and external benchmarks data for peer banks, the divisional heads of larger UK banks and FTSE data reflecting our market capitalisation.
Maximum potential The Committee will seek to limit pay increases for Executive Directors, where there is no change in role, to those applied to colleagues generally across the Group.
However, where an Executive Director is relatively new in role the Committee reserves flexibility to provide increases that are greater than those applied across the Group to bring the individuals salary into line with the market and reflect the gaining of experience.
Other colleagues The approach takes into account affordability, economic factors, external market data, business and personal performance.
Pension Purpose and link to strategy Recruit, reward, retain key talent and contribute towards individuals funding for retirement.
Operation Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the Group defined contribution pension scheme or may receive a cash allowance in lieu of some, or all, of the employer pension contribution.
The Groups defined benefit pension scheme is only available to existing members.
Maximum potential The maximum cash allowance for Executive Directors will be set at 20% of an Executive Directors base salary.
Contributions to the Groups defined benefit pension scheme are capped by reference to the Scheme earnings cap.
Only one Executive Director was a member of the Groups defined benefit scheme during 2017 and they ceased to accrue benefits from 31 July 2017 in line with other colleagues.
Other colleagues All new colleagues are automatically enrolled in the Groups defined contribution pension scheme.
The defined benefit scheme closed to new entrants in 2004 and closed to the future accrual of benefits for the majority of colleagues from 31 July 2017.
Benefits Purpose and link to strategy To provide benefits consistent with role.
Operation The Group provides a range of benefits which can include private medical insurance, health assessments, life assurance and car allowance car.
The Committee retains the discretion to provide additional benefits as may be reasonably required.
These may include relocation benefits such as but not limited to accommodation, family relocation support and taxable travel.
The Executive Directors are entitled to a maximum of 30 days holiday in addition to applicable bank public holidays.
Maximum potential The CEO has a cap of 250,000 on his benefits, including pension contributions and any cash allowance in lieu of pension contributions.
For the other Executive Directors, the maximum value of benefits is set by the nature of the benefits and the cost of providing them.
Other colleagues The Group provides a range of benefits based on colleagues roles, which include private medical insurance, health assessments, life assurance and car allowance car.
Colleagues receive between 25 and 30 days holiday annually depending on their role.
100 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information Elements of package variable remuneration Bonus Purpose and link to strategy The annual bonus is designed to reward Group and personal performance in line with strategic objectives.
Operation Annual bonuses are discretionary and are based on Group and individual performance within the year.
The measures, their weighting and targets are set annually with awards determined by the Committee at the end of the financial year.
The annual bonus may be delivered in cash and shares, which, in combination with the LTIP awards and any relevant awards under the all-employee Share Incentive Plan SIP will be structured in line with the requirements on the deferral of variable pay under the PRA Remuneration Code.
The equity-based element of the award will be made as rights to CYBG shares or other instruments, which are released at the end of the required holding period.
The mechanism for making these awards will be the Deferred Equity Plan DEP.
The amount and deferral period for bonus will be determined in line with regulatory requirements and to the extent that the LTIP award does not fully meet the deferral requirements.
Dividends or dividend equivalents accrued on deferred annual bonus shares are paid on vesting, subject to the extent permitted under the relevant remuneration regulations.
Discretion may be exercised by the Committee to ensure that the bonus outcomes are a fair and accurate reflection of the business and individual performance and consider any riskrelated issues but may not exceed the maximum opportunity.
The Group can, in specific circumstances, apply malus and or clawback to all or part of any bonus award.
Maximum potential Taken together with the LTIP awards, total variable remuneration is limited by the 2:1 ratio of variable pay to fixed pay, subject to the LTIP award being at least half of the total variable pay award.
Performance conditions Performance measures are set by the Committee each year and are set out in the Annual report on remuneration, normally this would be: 80% of the annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors is based on performance of the Group against key financial and non-financial measures: and 20% is based on personal performance and behaviours.
When determining the outcome of the performance measures, the Remuneration Committee will seek the advice of the Risk Committee to ensure all relevant risk factors are identified and the bonus pool and or individual awards adjusted accordingly.
Specific measures, targets and weightings will be set by the Remuneration Committee annually and disclosed on a retrospective basis.
Other colleagues All colleagues within the Group are in a single Group-wide scheme with target opportunities ranging from 8% to 50% of base salary depending on role.
Awards will be funded from a bonus pool reflecting the same financial and non-financial measures that apply to Executive Directors.
When determining the outcome of the performance measures the Remuneration Committee will seek the advice of the Risk Committee to ensure all relevant risk factors are identified and the bonus pool and or individual awards are adjusted accordingly.
CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 101 Governance Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration policy abridged continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Purpose and link to strategy Delivery of the Groups strategy and growth in shareholder value.
Operation Awards are based on a three-year performance period reflecting a basket of business and shareholder measures aligned with strategic goals.
Awards will vest a minimum of three years after being awarded, or longer, for example where required by the PRA Remuneration Code.
Where a period of deferral extends beyond three years, awards will only be subject to service requirements for the first three years, thereafter awards will only be subject to forfeiture for reasons of gross misconduct or malus.
The value of awards for the purposes of determining total variable remuneration will be in line with the rules set by the Regulator.
The Committee, in its absolute discretion, will determine the level of the LTIP awards made under the LTIP after taking account of the Executive Directors individual performance and business performance.
Any LTIP award, when combined with any deferred element of the annual bonus, will meet the deferral requirements under the PRA Remuneration Code.
Malus and clawback also apply to the whole of the LTIP award in line with the requirements of the PRA Remuneration Code.
Awards are made as conditional rights to CYBG shares, or other instruments, which will be released at the end of the holding period or later where required under the PRAs Remuneration Code.
Dividends or dividend equivalents accrue on the LTIP awards and, to the extent that the award vests, are paid on vesting, subject to the extent permitted under the relevant financial services remuneration regulations.
Maximum potential Taken together with the bonus award, the total variable remuneration is limited by the agreed 2:1 ratio of variable pay to fixed pay, subject to the LTIP award being at least half of the total variable pay award.
Performance conditions Service and performance conditions must be met over a three-year period.
Measures aligned with strategic goals are proposed for future LTIP awards, including the 2016 awards to be made following the AGM: Sustainable Customer Growth: Efficiency: Capital Optimisation: and Prudent Risk Management and Governance.
The weighting of metrics will be determined before each award and those for the 2017 award are set out in the Annual report on remuneration, with 25% of the maximum vesting for each measure for threshold performance.
The measures reflect a balanced approach between financial and non-financial.
The Committee has discretion to vary the weighting of performance metrics, or to substitute the metrics over the life of this Directors remuneration policy.
Shareholders will be consulted should the metrics themselves be varied.
In determining the outcome, the Remuneration Committee will seek the advice of the Risk Committee to ensure all relevant risk factors are identified and the level of vesting adjusted accordingly.
Other colleagues Members of the Executive Leadership Team and other senior managers are eligible to participate in the LTIP with awards made solely at the discretion of the Committee.
102 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information Shareholding requirement Purpose and link to strategy To align Executive Directors interests with those of shareholders Operation Executive Directors are expected to build up a specified holding of CYBG shares equivalent Executive Directors to a percentage of salary.
60% of the shares vesting after settling tax and National Insurance liabilities from CYBG share plans must be retained until the shareholding requirements are met.
Executive Director Shareholding requirement % of salary CEO 200% CFO and COO 150% When assessing an Executive Directors shareholding against the requirement, vested awards which are held as rights rather than shares will be included based on the anticipated net number of shares that would be released to the Executive Director at the end of the holding period.
Other colleagues Additionally, members of the Executive Leadership Team are expected to build up a holding of CYBG shares equivalent to 100% of salary.
50% of the shares vesting after settling tax and NIC liabilities from CYBG share plans must be retained until the shareholding requirement is met.
Performance measures The Committee selected the shortand long-term performance measures to ensure an appropriate balance between short and long term strategic goals and aligning the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders.
Targets are set each year having regard to the strategic plan and consensus forecasts.
Measures and targets for both the bonus plan and LTIP are aligned to the strategic plan and have been approved by the Board.
The Committee may apply discretion, in exceptional circumstances for example, if there is a major corporate event, to amend or vary targets or the weighting of performance metrics measures, or to substitute the metrics over the life of this Directors remuneration policy if these are no longer appropriate to ensure alignment with strategy and any risks within the business.
The Committee will consult with the Groups risk management and control functions to ensure changes are appropriate and do not inadvertently encourage irresponsible or inappropriate behaviour.
The Committee will consult with shareholders in advance of any change to performance metrics.
The Committee retains discretion to adjust outcomes to ensure these are consistent with corporate performance.
The Committee proposes to use the measures described in the Policy Table for the 2016 LTIP award to be made after the AGM and future awards, but will reassess these annually based on the Groups performance and strategy.
In determining the 2016 measures, the Committee consulted with major shareholders.
Risk adjustments, malus and clawback For MRTs, which include the Executive Directors, bonus and LTIP awards may be reduced before they are released malus or may be subject to clawback where the Committee determines that an adjustment should apply.
Clawback may be applied up to seven years from the award date, or 10 years for those holding a senior management function where an investigation has commenced.
Malus may be applied where: there is evidence of colleague misbehaviour, misconduct, material error, where a colleague participated in conduct which resulted in losses for the Group or they failed to meet appropriate standards: any material failure of risk management at a Group, business area, division or business unit level: if the financial results at a Group, division or business unit level are restated: if the financial results for a given year do not support the level of variable remuneration awarded: or any other circumstances where the Committee consider adjustments should be made.
The Committee is supported in this by the Board Risk and Audit Committees and the CYBG Risk function.
Clawback may be applicable where there is reasonable evidence of colleague misbehaviour or material error, or there is material failure of risk management at a Group, business area, division or business unit level.
Other CYBG share plans The Executive Directors are invited to participate in all-employee share plans on the same basis as other Group colleagues.
These plans encourage share ownership, aligning colleagues interests with those of shareholders and allowing them to benefit from the long-term success of the Group.
The CYBG Share Incentive Plan SIP provides for the purchase of shares, in line with HMRC participation level rules, on a monthly basis from gross pay and is also the vehicle used to allow for awards of free or matching shares.
Each Executive Director received 256 free shares following the demerger and the CFO participates in the monthly purchase of shares through the SIP.
If operated in the future, Executive Directors will also be eligible to participate in all employee share plans operated by the Group.

The level of vesting for these awards is determined by the NAB Board, and in 2017 the NAB Board determined that the 2012 NAB LTIP should be lapsed in full.
The 2013 and 2014 LTIP awards are due to be released in June 2018 and June 2019 respectively, and are based on NABs relative TSR performance with half measured against the S&P ASX Top 50 Index peer group and half against a selection of financial companies in the ASX Top 200 peer group.
Awards that do not vest at the end of the first performance period will be retested after 12 months.
The final decision on the level of vesting will be taken by the NAB Board, with value at the date of vesting included in the Directors single table figure in the year they vest.
Illustration of the application of remuneration policy The chart below illustrates the potential remuneration of the Executive Directors based on the policy in the following three scenarios: minimum remuneration based on fixed elements of package only salary, pension, benefits : target outcome assumes the actual bonus award is 50% of the maximum opportunity with 60% of the LTIP vesting: and maximum outcome which assumes the actual bonus award is 100% of the maximum opportunity and 100% vesting of the LTIP.
The amounts do not allow for share price appreciation and do not include dividends or payments in lieu of dividends.
Salary figures are as at 1 October 2017 and in line with policy the maximum bonus and LTIP awards are 100% of base salary.

Details of the targets used to determine annual bonus in respect of the 2017 financial year and the extent to which they were satisfied are shown in the table below.
These figures are included in the single figure table on the previous page.
2017 saw a strong performance from the Group, with significant change as a result of the transformation programme and a focus on building a high-performing, customer-centric organisation with strong productivity and efficiency.
In our first full year as CYBG we have demonstrated good progress in delivering against the key performance measures set by the Committee: underlying profit before tax up by 33% on last year and 15% ahead of target: underlying RoTE increased to 7.5%: underlying CIR improved by 7% from 74% to 67%: underlying costs for the year of 675m were below our target range of 690m to 700m.
while our engagement score fell by 7% from last year it benchmarks well when compared to organisations going through similar levels of transformation: The table below sets out the performance of the Group element for determining Executive Directors bonus awards.

The bulk of this reduction is driven by a combination of legacy conduct issues in respect of PPI, other conduct matters, separation costs and restructuring expenses.
The underlying PBT was not adjusted by the incremental year-on-year change in the prudent valuation adjustment PVA figure for 2017.
The PVA figure reduced by 3m year on year from 7m in 2016 to 4m in 2017.
No upward adjustment to underlying PBT has been considered.
2 To reflect the under performance of NPS and Colleague Engagement the Committee reduced the arithmetic out turn of 64.3% to 62% for calculating Executive Directors bonus awards.
110 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information The Committee determined the personal award for each Executive Director should be at the maximum as set out below.

CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 119 Governance Directors remuneration report Other remuneration disclosures continued The mix of fixed and variable reward is balanced to ensure that fixed remuneration provides a sufficient level of remuneration so that the variable reward components can be fully flexible, including the possibility of paying no variable reward.
The remuneration mix at target is based on market information and practices.
In any year, the actual mix may vary from target, given the overlay of business performance and individual performance.
All variable pay awards to MRTs are subject to malus and clawback in line with regulatory requirements.
Control functions Colleagues engaged in control functions i. e. Risk, Internal Audit and Compliance colleagues are critical to effective management of risk across the Group.
Independence from the business for these colleagues is assured through: setting the reward mix so that variable reward is not significant enough to encourage inappropriate behaviours while remaining competitive with the external market: and scorecards which are specific to the function.
The Committee reviews remuneration structures for control function colleagues.
Risk adjustment In addition to the Committees review of risks that impact on the level of the bonus pool and the application of malus and clawback as outlined above, individual bonus awards are also subject to meeting all compliance requirements and awards made can be reduced to nil where these are not met, or where colleagues are subject to disciplinary sanction.
Deferral arrangements Variable rewards bonus, LTIP and retention awards are subject to deferral and retention for all MRTs in line with UK regulation: at least 60% of total variable reward will be deferred where the total variable reward is 500,000 or more: and at least 40% of total variable reward will be deferred where the MRT does not meet fide minimus conditions.
The period of deferral ranges from one to three years to three to seven years depending on role in line with UK legislation.
