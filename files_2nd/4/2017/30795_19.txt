Operation of Policy in 2018 Base salary The Committee approved a 2.5% salary increase against 2017 Reference Salaries for the Executive Directors for 2018, effective 1 March 2018.
The base salaries of the Executive Directors effective 1 March 2018 are therefore as follows: Group Chief Executive Officer: 289,000 p. a. : Group Deputy Chief Executive Officer: 255,000 p. a. effective 1 May 2018 : and Group Chief Financial Officer: 221,000 p. a..

For the 2018 performance-related profit share, 75% of award potential will reflect the Groups UPBT performance and 25% of award potential will reflect delivery against a mix of personal, strategic and operational objectives.
The Committee considers prospective disclosure of individual objectives to be commercially sensitive and disclosure will therefore be on a retrospective basis.
The Committee retains a general discretion to reduce the pay-out level to reflect exceptional events over the performance period.
Performance Share Plan The remuneration policy is for maximum awards of 200% of base salary.
The PSP awards for 2018 will be up to two times each Executive Directors base salary.
Awards will vest subject to the satisfaction of EPS targets for 50% of the award as follows: 25% ie threshold of the element to vest if the Companys EPS growth is RPI plus 3% p. a. compounded: 100% ie the maximum of the element to vest if the Companys EPS growth is RPI plus 8% p. a. compounded or more: and with straightline vesting between the two points.
The Committee considers that if EPS growth of RPI plus 8% p. a. were achieved from the strong 2017 EPS base starting position, this would represent outstanding performance for shareholders.
The other 50% of the award will vest subject to the satisfaction of relative TSR performance versus the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts the Index as follows: 25% ie threshold of the element to vest if the Groups TSR performance equals that of the Index: 100% ie the maximum of the element to vest if the Groups TSR performance outperforms the Index by 8% p. a. : and with straight-line vesting between the two points.
The awards made to Executive Directors will also be subject to a holding period so that any PSP awards for which the performance vesting conditions are satisfied will not normally be released for a further two years from the third anniversary of the original award date.
Dividend accrual for PSP awards will continue until the end of the holding period.
