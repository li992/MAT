In particular, the Committee noted that two measures, covering 75% of the award, had not achieved threshold vesting, by some margin.
In taking this decision, it also took into account that the regulatory fine recently incurred resulted from actions during the performance period, which reinforced the Committees view that performance, overall, was insufficient to allow vesting of any part of the award.

Promoters those who answered 9-10 are the most loyal segment who will enthusiastically recommend us, passives those who answered 7-8 are neutral and detractors those who answered 0-6 are those that are not likely to recommend WilliamHill as a place to work.
Our eNPS score is calculated by subtracting the number of detractors from the number of promoters.

In setting targets, the Committee took into consideration a number of factors, including: the Board-approved business plan, in what was a year of transformation where a significant investment in IT, people, processes, location and change management, was required: that 2017 was a year in which there was no major international football tournament: consensus view amongst investment analysts: and known regulatory changes including, in Online, the application of the Horserace levy and Point of Consumption Tax on gaming free bets.
Threshold performance was set at a level requiring a substantial year-on-year performance improvement and in excess of consensus at the time the performance range was set.
The table below shows the percentages payable.
Each of the elements of performance was assessed against the targets set.
In addition, the Committee formed a rounded assessment of performance of each executive director including responsibilities to our regulators, customers and colleagues.
The Committee noted the encouraging financial performance.
This included growth in adjusted operating profit of 11%, with year-on-year profitability growth in evidence across all divisions except for Retail, which was still slightly ahead of plan and achieved year-on-year net revenue growth of 2%.
This performance was achieved in a year where there was significant investment in colleagues, technology and marketing, which will continue into 2018, uplifts in our NPS scores see page 17 and encouraging progress against the transformation goals, which has, as an example, directly supported the increased revenue growth in Online and significant cost efficiencies across the Group.
As a result, the Committee determined that overall performance justified the following bonus outcomes for the financial elements of the 2017 bonus plan.

direction of WilliamHill Improved engagement with 89% of colleagues participating in YourSay survey which showed understanding of strategy as one of the areas with most positive improvement.
Current indicative outcome The Committee considered that Philip had performed well against his objectives but determined that the personal element of his bonus should be limited to 13% out of a possible 20% in light of the severity of the regulatory fine received by the Company.
The Committee noted that Philip was not employed for the majority of the period to which the fine related and has made progress in rectifying the identified issues, but nonetheless considered that it would be inappropriate for this event not to be reflected in the CEOs pay outcome.

Ruth will also receive a payment in respect of her bonus forfeited at the point of her resignation from Worldpay.
This likely payment was fully disclosed at the time of Ruth Priors appointment and based on information provided by Worldpay, Ruth is entitled to a bonus payment for the period to 31 August 2017 of 356,544.
This is based on Worldpays assessment against three performance measures: underlying EBITDA, cash and personal performance.
In line with the Companys approved remuneration policy, 50% of all bonus payments will be deferred into shares for two years.
Long-term incentives vesting in relation to performance ending in 2017 No awards granted to executive directors were eligible to vest in 2017.
Grants under the PSP, made to other members of senior management in 2014 when a four-year performance period was introduced, were eligible to vest at the end of 2017.

William Hill PLC 88 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Directors Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Committee Review of Vesting In assessing EPS performance over the period and in line with our approved remuneration policy, the Committee took into account the impact of industry specific taxes and new regulations.
The regulatory impacts over the period included the increase in Machine Games Duty from 20% to 25%, which was implemented from April 2015, the application of Point of Consumption Tax to Online on gaming free bets in 2017 and also the extension of the horseracing levy to Online.
The impact of these and other smaller changes would have had the effect of increasing EPS CAGR by just under 2%.
However, these adjustments had no effect on the outcome as EPS growth still did not achieve the threshold level of performance set.
The Committee is also required under its remuneration policy to consider whether the overall vesting outcome is consistent with the Groups performance over the four-year period.
In arriving at its decision, the Committee noted that two measures, covering 75% of the award, had not achieved threshold vesting, by some margin.
The moderate vesting achieved related to mobile Sportsbook and mobile gaming in Online.
The Committee also considered the regulatory fine recently incurred which resulted from actions during the period, including in Online, and determined that taking all of the above factors into consideration, the performance achieved was insufficient to allow vesting of any part of the award.

Awards of salary will vest to participants on the third anniversary of grant subject to continued employment 1 Awards have been valued using the 3 day average share price as at the date of grant for Philip Bowcock, i. e. 7 August 2017.
In last years report we confirmed that the 2017 PSP award would be made after the Companys interim results in August.
This delay was for two reasons: the appointment of the permanent CEO Philip Bowcock at the time of publication was still the Interim CEO and to ensure that the PSP award measures reflected key strategic priorities and, in particular, the goals of the transformation programme then under development its achievements over 2017 are described in more detail on pages 91 to 92.
We also committed to consult with leading shareholders before we made the award.
The structure of the PSP award was in the form of nil-cost options and three, equally weighted, performance conditions Relative TSR, EPS growth and BPMs.
We commenced consultation in May 2017 on the proposed design and received a good level of engagement.
In some cases there were differing views, for example on the use and weighting of TSR.
However, we were pleased that a majority of major shareholders who responded to the consultation were supportive of the proposed approach and the degree of alignment with our strategic priorities.
During these discussions, we acknowledged the importance of transparency, particularly as the Committee had proposed that one third of the award should be based on efficiency and revenue improvements, which were directly linked to the transformation programme.
These were commercially sensitive and therefore the specific targets could not be disclosed at the time of the award.
The Committee recognised that shareholders would want annual assurance of progress and also full disclosure of the targets when vesting was determined.
We also emphasised the importance the Committee placed on an overall assessment of performance and not just a formulaic review of each performance condition.
Strategic report Financial statements Governance William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 89 The specific terms of the PSP award are as follows: Measure Link to strategy Details of performance condition Relative TSR 33.3% This supports our objective The Companys TSR is measured over the period 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2020 1 to create superior value for against the returns of a group of 16 travel and leisure companies.
If TSR is: below median, none of this element will vest: at median, 25% vests: at upper quartile or better, 100% vests.
For performance between median and upper quartile, vesting is on a straight-line basis.
The chosen measurement period reflects Philip Bowcocks appointment as the permanent CEO in March 2017 as well as the announcement that Ruth Prior would join as CFO, later in 2017, which was also announced in March 2017.
Adjusted EPS 33.3% A Group KPI the key indicator Based on compound annual growth in EPS over the three-year performance of the Groups growth after period commencing on 28 December 2016 to 31 December 2019. allowing for all costs including If EPS growth is: interest and tax.

25% vests: growth in the Groups long- 13% p. a. or above, 100% vests.
For performance between 6% and 13%, vesting is on a straight-line basis.
The Committee believes that these targets are appropriately challenging in light of the Groups earnings projections over the three-year period: earnings will have to significantly exceed analyst consensus forecasts for full vesting to occur.
This is based on the information available, including tax and regulation, at the time the targets were set.

A financial target has been defined for circa 250 individual initiatives, which make up the broad categories of revenue growth and cost reduction described above.
The threshold level of performance is 80% of the aggregate financial target for each BPM, for which 25% of the award will vest.
Full vesting will occur for outperformance of the target by 10%.
None of the award relating to each measure will vest if performance is below threshold.

When determining the vesting outcome, the Committee will ensure that it is consistent with the Groups overall performance taking account of any factors it considers relevant, in line with our approved remuneration policy.
This will apply particularly in relation to its assessment of the degree of vesting achieved for the BPM element.
EBMS awards In 2016, no bonus was payable as the threshold level of adjusted operating profit target was not met.
As a consequence no EBMS awards were made in 2017.

The transformation programme is enabling WilliamHill to get fit for the future by improving core capabilities essential for delivering a successful and sustainable business for the long term.
As transformation is essential, we emphasised the importance of the programme by changing theBPM weighting to represent 33.3% of the total award.
The Board established a new Committee, chaired by John O'Reilly, to oversee progress and benefit realisation.
The Remuneration Committee works closely with this new oversight committee ensuring strong governance is in place to determine the level of performance achieved and vesting potential.
There are 250 initiatives, of varying quantum, in the programme split between cost reduction and revenue generation.
Focusing on two BPMs covering 250 initiatives Revenue growth initiatives, covering Cost reduction initiatives, covering 1.

Delivery of accelerated revenue growth 2.
Driving efficiencies in customer-facing functions... to drive strategy Grow UK market share Transformation and technology projects Near-term priority Transformation programme to increase efficiencies Our largest market Deliver savings to support investment Worlds largest regulated market Deliver a global technology platform In an ever-evolving digital world, strong management focus on reducing costs to reinvest in strategic capabilities is crucial.
The management team in 2017 concentrated on optimising third-party spend, rationalising back office and support functions, digital marketing spend optimisation and the utilisation of lower-cost development hubs resulting in significant annualised savings.
Key cost initiatives include: Initiative not exhaustive Description Optimisation of external spend base Significant reduction of third-party spend through: Renegotiation of vendor contracts including rate and policy terms: Reducing internal demand for services and cost: Purchasing centralisation across business: and Consolidation of major IT contracts.
Agile transformation in product development The business is on track to transform product development and delivery through Agile ways of working and a new operating model.
This will yield productivity benefits and allow the business to deliver product at greater speed.
Rationalisation of business and support functions and location Significant optimisation is underway in location footprint and support footprint function design.
This is illustrated by our new London hub which opened at the end of January 2018 and the closure of the Tel Aviv location announced in 2017.
It also extends to significant systems upgrades and organisation re-design.
Efficiency in marketing spend Reduced spend in lower ROI campaigns particularly in pay-per-click PPC and affiliates.
This has been backed up by a full reorganisation and modernisation of the marketing function.
William Hill PLC 92 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Directors Remuneration Report continued All of the savings were reinvested into enhancing WilliamHills digital marketing, product development and technology capabilities areas, over the last few years, where the Company has struggled to compete.
Reinvestment has led to accelerated revenue growth demonstrated through innovative product launches such as Bet Boost, hiring of 100 new product developers to create much improved customer service and product offerings and reallocating resources to invest in a scalable and efficient digital marketing platform.
Keyrevenue initiatives include the following: Initiative not exhaustive Description Omni-channel Staged programme over 2017 now delivering revenues for the business, covering several key delivered milestones including: Completed a full estate roll-out of SSBTs during the course of the year and increased the number of sports available including cricket, horse racing and greyhounds: The successful launch of our PLUS product in April including the PLUS app and bet tracker: and Introduced Omni Wallet functionality to our PLUS product at the end of November.
Marketing reinvestment In 2017 the business built, tested and launched programmatic marketing capability allowing us to serve potential and existing customers with personalised content.
In 2018 we will scale up the use of this capability across the customer base enabling the further reinvestment of banked marketing savings athigher ROI.
There were significant further marketing reinvestments at higher ROI and performance including PPC and affiliate marketing.
Holistic improvements to gaming product Wide-ranging improvements to the Gaming product now being seen in the top line including: Specific product and feature developments e. g. daily drop and the redesign of the Vegas app : and Cross-sell enhancements between Sportsbook and gaming and the single-wallet launch.
New feature development across Online products Accelerated product feature development including: #Yourodds: Launch of BetBoost: and Progressive transition to the new Sportsbook desktop.
Conversion and journey optimisation Rapid improvements to the onboarding journey to convert potential customers to playing customers.
By saving to reinvest, the management team are focusing on the health of the business in the long-term.
By the end of 2017, progress against cost reduction initiatives was over 40% ahead of the plan, all of which all has been reinvested into capability improvements resulting in good prospects for revenue growth in 2018.
Progress against specific revenue improvement initiatives was c. 37% ahead of the in-year target.
In total, this means c. 40% of the 3-year P&L targets under cost reduction and c. 35% under revenue growth were achieved during 2017 and both elements of this measure are currently tracking above plan.

These shares will vest on 16 October 2018 and are not subject to performance conditions.
During the period 26 December 2017 to 22 February 2018, there have been no changes in the directors share interests.
Recruitment to the Board in 2017 Towards the end of 2016 we announced a number of appointments to the Board for 2017 John OReilly, Robin Terrell, Mark Brooker and in 2017 a further three appointments were made.
Executive appointments Philip Bowcock was appointed as permanent CEO with effect from 10 March 2017, having previously held the role of Interim CEO since July 2016.
Since his appointment as Interim CEO, Philip had received a base salary of 550,000 per annum, in line with the base salary of the previous CEO, which had not been increased since his appointment in July 2014.
The Committee requested information on salary levels within our benchmark group and also more direct competitors.
It determined that an increase to 600,000 was appropriate.
No further review of salary has taken place in 2018.
No additional remuneration or awards have been made in connection with Philips appointment.
Ruth Prior was appointed CFO with effect from 2 October 2017.
Her remuneration package was set on appointment, broadly in line with that offered to her predecessor: base salary of 425,000: pension allowance of 20% of base salary: other benefits provided in line with the Company's remuneration policy: bonus opportunity of 150% of salary: and annual awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan to the value of 175% of salary.
William Hill PLC 94 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Directors Remuneration Report continued The Committee determined that Ruth would be eligible to participate in the WilliamHill annual bonus plan for the period of service at WilliamHill from appointment to 26 December 2017.
In addition a pro-rated amount of bonus would be paid to Ruth in recognition of the annual bonus forfeited on resignation and covering the relevant period of the financial year when she was employed at Worldpay.
Both elements to be awarded on an aggregate basis by the Committee in 2018 and subject to the usual deferral, malus and clawback provisions as set out in the remuneration policy.
"The Committee also agreed to make an award in replacement for that forfeited under the Worldpay Transitional Award Plan the ""Replacement Award""."
This award does not have any associated performance conditions or post-vesting holding requirements, mirroring the Worldpay award it replaced and will be released on the original vesting date of 16 October 2018.
The Committee determined, at the time of Ruths appointment, that the Worldpay share price used in calculating the value of the award should be the 30-day average immediately prior to the announcement of Ruths appointment or the 30-day average immediately prior to joining WilliamHill, whichever was the lower.
Accordingly, an award over 348,345 restricted shares was granted to Ruth on 2 October 2017, using a market value of 2.51 per share, being the average WilliamHill closing share price in the 30-day period immediately prior to the announcement of Ruth's appointment.
Non-executive appointments On 20 December 2017, we announced the appointment of Roger Devlin as Chairman Designate and a Non-executive Director with effect from 1 February 2018 and he will take over as Chairman on 2 April 2018, when Gareth Davis steps down.
Rogers remuneration was approved by the Nomination Committee on appointment in December, in line with a recommendation from the Remuneration Committee, and comprises an annual fee of 295,000.
Roger will not receive any additional compensation or benefits in respect of the appointment.
