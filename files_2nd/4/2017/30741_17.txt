of D-EPS ROCE Share price LTIP awards performance performance on vesting Outcome granted 75% 25% The performance criteria for the LTIP awards granted in 2015 were as follows: 75% of the award is based on three-year cumulative D-EPS as compared to three-year compound growth in real RPI-adjusted D-EPS.
No performance shares will be awarded against this element if performance is below an equivalent ofRPI 3% per annum growth.
Awards will then start to vest above that level and will increase straight-line to a maximum atanequivalent of RPI 15% per annum growth: and 25% of the award is based on average ROCE over the performance period in a range of 20% to 25%.
No performance shares willbe awarded against this element if performance is less than 20% and awards will increase on a straight-line basis to the maximum at25% ROCE.
The performance period for the 2015 LTIP awards ended on 31 December 2017.
Over the period: Aggrekos aggregate D-EPS was 187.6 pence, which is the equivalent of no growth.
Since this was less than the threshold ofRPI 3%, no shares will vest under this performance measure: and Aggrekos actual average ROCE for the period was 13.3%.
Since this was less than the threshold of 20%, no shares will vest underthis performance measure.
As a result, all 2015 LTIP awards lapsed in full.

It is an inherent part of the new Remuneration Policy that the Committee will review and set the scale prior to each grant rather than the previous approach of fixing the scale for the life of the policy.
It will also determine the approach to calculation, e. g. three year average performance or final third year performance for each grant.
The degree of stretch proposed for 2018 awards is judged to be appropriate in relation to our current 2017 base performance.
Third year ROCE measurement reflects Aggrekos planned capital investments in fleet and technology over the next three years as well as the distance of travel from where we are now to the target threshold.
The Committee also has the ability to include additional or alternative performance measures, weightings and or targets in future years to take account of the Groups key strategic and operational aims and targets, and business outlook atthat time.
