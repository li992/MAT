REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT Dear shareholders, The Committee has I am pleased to present our remuneration report for 2017.
We have continued to be as transparent as possible with this years continued to ensure remuneration report, aiming for a report that is easy to read, follow and understand.
that executive The report is made up of three key sections: This annual Chairs letter.
remuneration is Our remuneration policy report, which sets out a summary of the Directors remuneration policy for all Directors of closely aligned to the Greggs.
This policy was formally agreed at our AGM held on 19 May 2017.
Our annual remuneration report, split into two sections that delivery of Greggs set out: how our remuneration policy will be implemented in 2018: and business strategy how our remuneration policy was implemented in 2017.
This is an audited section of the report outlining the remuneration of the Companys Executive and NonExecutive Directors during the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017.
The annual remuneration report is subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM.
Remuneration policy We are in year one of a three-year policy, and in developing this policy the Committee was very aware that executive remuneration continues to be a key focus for shareholders, as well as being a topic that is regularly discussed in the public domain.
Throughout 2017 the Committee has continued to assess the effectiveness of overall levels of remuneration and continues to review emerging market practice and best practice expectations in line with the business strategy.
The Committee has taken into account a number of reference points, both internal and external.
Independent advice was also sought, where appropriate, from the Committees advisors.
Remuneration structure and philosophy The existing remuneration framework consists of the following elements: fixed pay base salary, pension and benefits: and variable pay annual bonus paid in both cash and deferred shares and performance share plan PSP.
The Committee believes that the current structure works well and remains fit-for-purpose.
It is simple and consistent, with pay outcomes dependent upon performance linked to our business strategy.
It ensures a significant proportion of pay is delivered in shares to provide alignment with investors and incorporates a number of best practice features, including a two-year postvesting holding period for PSP awards.
Since announcing our five-year strategic plan in 2013, transforming the business from a traditional bakery into a modern , we have delivered excellent operational and financial performance.
In the four years since 2013 our company-managed like-for-like sales have grown by 17.1 per cent and pre-tax profit excluding exceptional items has increased by 98 per cent, reflecting sales growth combined with significant savings arising from structural changes and investment in better processes and systems.
This is reflected in strong EPS growth averaging 21 per cent p. a. since 2013.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 54 Directors Report Policy report review Our remuneration policy report sets out our policy for the three years from 2017 and was put to a binding vote of shareholders at the AGM on 19 May 2017.
This policy was approved with a majority vote of 93.91 per cent.
Our related amendment to the PSP rules was also approved with a majority vote of 97.14 per cent.
Approval of this policy has ensured that we have strengthened the alignment between Executive Directors and shareholders and kept the team focused on long-term, sustainable value creation for our shareholders.
We have reviewed the policy again and are comfortable that it remains appropriate to ensure the team running our business are incentivised going forwards, whilst at the same time ensuring the policy is flexible to remain applicable over the remaining two years of the policy period.
Accordingly there are no changes to our policy proposed in 2018.
Performance in 2017 and incentive payments Despite challenging conditions, including significant cost headwinds, a busy change agenda and the continued major investment in line with our strategic plan, the Company has delivered another year of solid performance.
The business has performed well against the stretching financial targets as described in the financial review on pages 24 to 27.
Against the targets set at the beginning of the year for the annual bonus the profit element resulted in 22.54 per cent of the maximum being achieved with 12.53 per cent of the maximum sales performance being achieved.
Despite significant cost challenges facing the business a strong control on costs resulted in 9.25 per cent of the maximum being achieved.
There was a stronger performance in the strategic objectives that were set and we made excellent progress with our technology and supply chain change programme.
This resulted in 100 per cent bonus payment against these strategic elements.
Overall annual bonuses representing 80.4 per cent out of a maximum possible of 125 per cent and 57.9 per cent out of a maximum possible of 90 per cent of salary will be payable to the Chief Executive and Finance Director, respectively.
Any element of the bonus earned above 50 per cent of the maximum will be paid in shares and will be subject to a two-year holding period.
Under the Performance Share Plan, awards made in March 2015 are due to vest in March 2018.
These awards are based on EPS growth over the three years to 30 December 2017 and average annual ROCE over the three-year performance period 2015 to 2017.
EPS has grown by 12.86 per cent and our average annual ROCE was 27.3 per cent, which meant that the performance condition was achieved in full.
For the purpose of calculating total remuneration payable we have therefore assumed full vesting of the award.
The Committee is very comfortable that this performance justifies a full vesting level for this award.
Approach for 2018 The salary increase for both the Chief Executive and Finance Director was in line with that of the base increase for the workforce generally and was 2.8 per cent.
Increases to salaries and Non-Executive Directors fees took effect from 1 January 2018.
As part of the Committees ongoing review of best practice and a review of the market, the target-setting process for the annual bonus has been reviewed.
The Committee believes that the nature of the current measures profit, sales and strategic objectives remains appropriate and no changes are proposed to the measures or the mix.
Financial targets for these measures for the 2018 annual bonus have been set in line with the financial plan for the business for the year and the rolling five-year strategic plan, and continue to be stretching.
We will also continue to require any bonus earned over 50 per cent of the maximum to be payable in shares and be subject to a two-year holding period.
The Committee has reviewed the percentage pay out for on target performance for the profit and sales element of the bonus and has decided to move this to 50 per cent increased from 30 per cent in 2017.
This change recognises the challenging nature of the targets we have set for 2018 and, more generally, we have a record of setting very demanding targets in the context of prior year performance and market expectations.
We believe this has been demonstrated by the 2017 bonus outcomes as discussed above, where outcomes were well below the maximum, notwithstanding Greggs strong performance during the year.
We have also been cognisant of wider market practice, where a 50 per cent payout for target performance is the norm even in bonus schemes where the maximum opportunity is greater than at Greggs.
The 50 per cent level remains lower than the 60 per cent level which we applied prior to 2017.
Threshold performance will remain at ten per cent pay out.
Due to the commercial sensitivity of the 2018 bonus targets they are not disclosed within this report, but will be disclosed retrospectively in next years report.
Under the PSP the Committee has considered the performance conditions and has determined that EPS and ROCE should continue to apply with an equal weighting given to each.
The Committee has ensured that targets have been set for the year ahead which reflect the strategic plan and business outlook over the performance period.
Consequently, the ROCE ranges have been increased to ensure that they remain appropriately stretching in light of our business strategy, without encouraging undue risk taking.
Concluding remarks I hope that you will find this report transparent, clear and informative.
The Committee has continued to ensure that executive remuneration is closely aligned to the delivery of Greggs business strategy as well as remaining relevant to market and best practice.
I look forward to receiving your continued support at this years AGM.

Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for pension scheme membership, bonus or incentive arrangements.
They are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses and tax thereon.
They may also receive limited travel or accommodation related benefits in connection with their role as a Director.
Difference in remuneration policy across the Group The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is designed having regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole.
There are differences in salary levels and in the levels of potential reward depending upon seniority and responsibility, although a key reference point for executive salary increases is the average increase across the general workforce.
A higher proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration package is delivered through performance-related pay and in share-based form, which provide a good link to long-term Company performance.
All colleagues, with one-years service or more, may participate in the SAYE scheme and in the SIP that are run annually.
Under the SAYE scheme, at the end of a three-year saving period, colleagues can buy Greggs shares at a discounted rate.
With the SIP, all colleagues may purchase Company shares from pre-tax salary subject to HMRC limits.
After six months service all colleagues are eligible to participate in the profit-sharing scheme in which they share ten per cent of our profits.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 57 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED Policy discretion The Committee will operate incentive plans in accordance with their respective rules, the Listing Rules and the HMRC limits where relevant.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plan rules.
These include but are not limited to the following: who participates: the timing of the grant of award and or payment: the size of an award up to plan policy limits and or a payment: discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction: determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes and the treatment of leavers: adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends : and the ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports.
Details of any of these payments to former Directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.
Policy on recruitment remuneration The Committee will aim to set a new Executive Directors remuneration package in line with the Companys approved policy at the time of appointment.
The Committee will take into account, in arriving at a total package and in considering the quantum for each element of the package, the skills and experience of the candidate, the market rate for a candidate of that experience as well as the importance of securing the best available candidate.
Annual bonus and PSP awards will not exceed the policy maxima not including any arrangements to replace forfeited deferred pay.
Participation in the annual bonus plan and PSP will normally be pro-rated for the year of joining.
The Committee may make one-off additional cash and or share-based awards as it deems appropriate, and if the circumstances so demand to take account of deferred pay forfeited by an Executive Director on leaving a previous employer.
Awards to replace deferred pay forfeited would, where possible, reflect the nature of awards forfeited in terms of delivery mechanism cash or shares, time horizons, attributed expected value and performance conditions.
Other payments may be made in relation to relocation expenses and other incidental expenses as appropriate.
Any buyout awards would be made under existing arrangements where possible or as permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according to its terms and any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment would continue.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy at that time.
Service contracts and policy on cessation Executive Directors service contracts contain the following remuneration-related aspects: Provision Detailed terms Remuneration Salary, pension and benefits: company car or cash allowance: private medical health care for the Director: permanent health insurance: participation in annual bonus and profit share subject to scheme rules : participation in long-term incentive schemes or similar arrangements subject to scheme rules : and life assurance.
Notice period Chief Executives contract is terminable on 12 months notice served by either the Company or the Director: other Executive Directors service contracts are terminable on 12 months notice served by the Company or by six months notice served by the Director: and any future Executive Directors service contracts will be terminable on 12 months notice served by either party.
Termination payment Payment in lieu of notice equal to any unexpired notice of termination given by either party: and payment in lieu shall not include: any bonus payment: any payment in respect of benefits which the Director would have been entitled to receive: and any payment in respect of any holiday entitlement that would have accrued during the period for which the payment in lieu is made.
Details of the circumstances in which the Committee has the ability to exercise discretion with regards to Termination Payments are set out opposite.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 58 Directors Report The Companys policy is that current Executive Directors service contracts do not have a specific duration but may be terminated with twelve months notice from the Company and six months notice from the Executive Director.
Any future Executive Directors service contracts will be terminable on 12 months notice served by either party.
Under their service contracts the Executive Directors are entitled to salary, pension contributions and benefits for their notice period save where a payment in lieu is to be made.
The Company would seek to ensure that any payment is mitigated by use of phased payments and offset against earnings elsewhere in the event that an Executive Director finds alternative employment during his notice period.
There are no contractual provisions in force other than those set out above that impact any termination payment.
Areas where the Committee can exercise discretion with regards to Termination Payments: annual bonus may be payable pro-rated for that part of the year worked: deferred bonus shares must normally be retained in trust until the end of their two year holding period and will be subject to recovery and withholding in the event of misstatement of performance, error or misconduct, where this has led to an overpayment in the view of the Committee for a period of three years from the payment date: any unvested awards held under the PSP will lapse at cessation, unless the individual is leaving in good leaver circumstances defined under the plan as death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement, his office or employment being with either a company which ceases to be a Group member or relating to a business or part of a business which is transferred to a person who is not a Group member, a change of control or any other reason the Committee so decides.
In these circumstances, unvested awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date other than on death or where the Committee decides they should vest at cessation subject to performance conditions being met and scaling back in respect of actual service as a proportion of the total vesting period unless the Committee decides that scaling back is inappropriate.
Vested awards will normally be subject to the mandatory two-year holding period although the Committee will have discretion to waive this in exceptional circumstances: and the Committee may agree to payment of disbursements such as legal costs and outplacement services if appropriate and depending on the circumstances of cessation.
The table below sets out the details of the Executive Directors service contracts: Director Date of contract Roger Whiteside 4 February 2013 Richard Hutton 7 April 2006 Raymond Reynolds stepped down from the Main Board on 19 May 2017.
The service contracts are available for inspection during normal business hours at the Companys registered office, and are available for inspection at the AGM.

How our remuneration policy will be implemented in 2018 Executive Directors The section below summarises the implementation of our remuneration policy for 2018.
Base salary 2018 The annual base salaries for the Executive Directors were reviewed with effect from 1 January 2018: increases and current salaries are outlined below: Salary as at Salary as at Director 1 January 2017 1 January 2018 % increase Roger Whiteside Chief Executive 534,163 549,120 2.8% Richard Hutton Finance Director 305,145 313,689 2.8% Increases are in line with the average base salary increase for the workforce as a whole.
Pension contribution 2018 The pension contribution rates both of which are cash in lieu are: Roger Whiteside 22.5% Richard Hutton 13% Annual bonus 2018 The annual bonus opportunity for 2018 is outlined below: Chief Executive Maximum opportunity of 125% of base salary.
Bonus in excess of 50% of maximum will be payable in shares deferred for two years.
Finance Director Maximum opportunity of 90% of base salary.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 62 Directors Report The bonus metrics are: Measure Profit Sales Strategic objectives Weighting 50% of total 20% of total 30% of total Detail and link to strategy.

at an underlying level before shop like-for-like sales tax.
This will be based on excluding any additional meeting and exceeding shops opened during the budget for the year.
The strategic objectives for each bonus cycle are based on measures which will provide a strong link to future value creation.
For the 2018 bonus the three strategic objectives, each relating to ten per cent of the bonus opportunity, will be: i.
Cost savings ten per cent of the measure : ii.
Specific project delivery within our change programme regarding processes and systems with two elements measured independently, both elements being worth five per cent each.
These measures will be based on delivery of new systems and processes into two of our supply chain operations five per cent payable on each element: a total of ten per cent and iii.
Specific project delivery within our programme for supply chain restructuring, specifically the transfer and operation of product platforms with three elements measured independently: one element being worth five per cent, one element being worth three per cent and one element being worth two per cent.
The annual bonus is based on performance against a range of financial and strategic performance measures.
This range of metrics measures achievement of the Companys key operational objectives.
The Committee reviews the key performance indicators KPIs each year and varies them as appropriate to reflect the priorities for the business in the year ahead.
Where appropriate a sliding scale of targets is set for each KPI to encourage continuous improvement, or sustained high performance.
There will be an underpin to the sales and strategic objectives elements of the bonus whereby any payment under these elements may be scaled back potentially to zero at the discretion of the Committee, if the profit performance for the year is judged to be running significantly below that required for the achievement of the long-term strategy.
Bonus targets for the forthcoming year are considered to be commercially sensitive and so have not been disclosed.
Retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be made in next years annual report on remuneration.
PSP award 2018 PSP awards will be granted as follows: Chief Executive 115% of base salary Executive Directors 95% of base salary Performance conditions will be based on an equal split of two different financial measures, EPS and ROCE for discrete parts of an award.
EPS and ROCE are two of our eight strategic KPIs and together provide a rounded assessment of our overall profitability against stretching targets set in line with the strategic plan and business outlook over the performance period.
For these awards the ROCE ranges have been increased to ensure that they remain appropriately stretching in light of our business strategy without encouraging undue risk taking.
The EPS targets require the same level of growth as for last years award, albeit the base point from which the growth is measured is higher than last year.
For the 2018 awards the target ranges will be as follows: The EPS performance condition will require average annual growth of EPS of 5 per cent to 11 per cent over three financial years measured from the 2017 financial year end.
The ROCE condition will require average annual ROCE over the three-year performance period 2018, 2019 and 2020 to be in the range 25 per cent to 29 per cent.
In both cases 25 per cent of an award will vest on achieving threshold performance and thereafter straight-line sliding scales will apply until stretch performance is achieved.
In order to improve alignment of interest between Executive Directors and shareholders, a holding period is attached to vested PSP awards granted in the policy period, requiring the vested shares to be held net of tax and other deductions for a further two years.
EPS and ROCE are measured excluding exceptional items.
