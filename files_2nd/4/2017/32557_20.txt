74 Governance Report Directors Remuneration Report Key remuneration decisions for 2016 17 Total remuneration for the Executive Directors has decreased by 11 to 16 per Annual cent as a result of our incentive arrangements reflecting our performance during the year.
Annual bonus Our Executive Directors are committed to developing our strategy and driving the performance of our business in the challenging Statement environment.
The profit and sales targets set at the start of the year were not achieved.
However, good progress was made on a number of key strategic, operational and customer initiatives and there was strong from the performance against individual objectives.
In light of the overall results, the Committee determined that no cash annual bonus should be paid in respect of the year.
Deferred Share Award The Committee determined that awards Remuneration under the DSA should be granted at 70 per cent of the maximum for all participants recognising, in particular, the continued performance of the business in relative terms and the significant achievements made on our Committee strategic goals.
This award is deferred into shares.
2014 Future Builder Following two consecutive years of no payout, an element of the 2014 Future Builder vested as a result of our performance Chairman against the cash flow and relative sales measures.
A performance multiplier of 0.9x was applied to the core award for all participants resulting in vesting of 22.5 per cent of the maximum.
Half vests in May this year and the remaining half will vest in May 2018 after a further holding period.
2017 Remuneration Policy The previous policy was approved by shareholders in 2014 and, therefore, we are bringing a revised Remuneration Policy for shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM, in line with the regulatory requirement to renew our policy at least once every three years.
We have consulted extensively with our major shareholders regarding the new policy and as part of this review process we looked at alternative long-term incentive structures which could adapt to the dynamic nature of the grocery sector.
While the Committee saw the merits of alternative structures, we recognised that shareholder views on these remain mixed at this stage.
Consequently we have opted to maintain the key features of the Remuneration Policy previously approved by shareholders in 2014.
Dear Shareholder, While the overall approach and pay levels remain unchanged, we have taken With changing customer expectations and a the opportunity to make a small number of technical changes to reflect evolving market and best practice.
These include: rapidly evolving business, the incentive pay Introduction of a two-year holding period for Future Builder awards, outcomes for 2016 17 reflect our performance meaning that shares will not normally be released until five years after grant: in the context of a volatile UK retail grocery market.
Shareholding guidelines increased from 1.5 times to 2.0 times salary for Executive Directors CEO will remain at 2.5 times : Reduction in retirement benefits for any future appointment from 30 per cent to 25 per cent: and Strengthened recovery provisions malus and clawback.
It is important for senior executive pay to be performance-based and to encourage sustainable long-term value for our shareholders.
It is also in shareholders interests for the Company to be able to attract and retain the talented leaders required to deliver strong performance in challenging markets.
However, as a business with around 195,000 colleagues, we are also acutely aware of the wider context in which the Committee makes key decisions.
We continue to consider wider colleague reward when determining pay arrangements for the Executive Directors, and this remains a fundamental part of our approach to pay.
There is a strong focus on core values across the business, and this is reflected in the strategy.
Taking a responsible and sustainable approach to business is a defining characteristic of the Sainsburys culture and this extends to the approach to executive remuneration.
Governance Report 75 Looking ahead Salary review In line with our policy, we have followed our normal approach to the review of salaries for the Executive Directors and have awarded both Mike Coupe and The Remuneration Committee John Rogers a salary increase of 1.5 per cent effective March 2017, in line with remains firmly committed to the other management colleagues.

Overall financial results for the year were good in the context of a challenging and competitive trading environment.
However, the profit and sales outcomes were below the threshold performance hurdles due to the stretch of the targets.
The targets were set at the beginning of the financial year prior to the acquisition of Home Retail Group plc and so performance has been measured excluding the impact of the transaction to allow for a comparison on a like-for-like basis.

The Committee, therefore, agreed that for 2016 17 awards would be made at 70 per cent of the maximum level, compared with 80 per cent last year.
It also determined that the profit gateway for the plan was achieved.
Although some of the specific measures and targets are commercially sensitive, the table below presents a selection of performance highlights which the Committee took into account within each of the four categories.

Around 250 senior managers across the business participate in this arrangement.
Awards were originally granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in 2006.
A renewed Long-Term Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM, which is now being used.
Future Builder awards have been granted under the same structure for a number of years.
A core award of shares is granted, generally calculated as a percentage of salary and scaled according to level of seniority.
Vesting of the core award is dependent on performance against specific targets common for all participants tested at the end of a three-year performance period.
The core awards can grow up to four times at stretch levels of performance.
Historically, awards have been structured so that half of any awards vest following the end of the performance period, with the remaining half vesting after a further year.
For awards granted to Executive Directors from 2017 onwards, awards will normally be subject to a new two-year holding period following the end of the three-year performance period.
This will result in future awards to Executive Directors normally only being released five years after grant.
The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the Companys underlying performance over the period justifies the level of vesting.
Vesting will be reduced if the vesting outcome is not considered to be justified.
At vesting, when making this judgement the Committee has scope to consider such factors as it deems relevant.
The Committee believes that having a gateway is an important feature of the plan and mitigates the risk of unwarranted vesting outcomes.
This gateway applies to all outstanding Future Builder awards.
2017 Future Builder awards 2017 18 to 2019 20 performance period Award levels will remain unchanged for the coming year.
In 2017 Mike Coupe will receive a core award of 62.5 per cent of salary maximum 250 per cent of salary and the other Executive Directors will receive core awards of 50 per cent of salary maximum 200 per cent of salary.
The 2017 awards will be subject to the same scorecard of metrics used for the 2016 awards.
The Committee consulted with major shareholders regarding the targets for 2017 awards and the proposed target ranges were subsequently updated to reflect shareholder feedback.
The cost savings and synergies targets for 2017 have been updated to align with the strategy communicated to shareholders for the period to March 2020.
The ROCE targets have also been recalibrated in order to provide realistic but stretching goals reflecting the current and future prospects of the business as well as the retail sector as a whole over the next three years.
Overall the Committee is of the view that these targets provide an appropriately stretching incentive for participants.
The agreed measures, targets and weightings for 2017 awards are as follows: Threshold Maximum target target 1.0x core 4.0x core Measure Weighting award award ROCE 20% 8% 11% Underlying basic EPS 20% 23p 30p Cumulative underlying cash flow from retail operations after capex 20% 3,500m 5,150m Cumulative strategic cost saving 20% 450m 550m Home Retail Group plc acquisition synergies 20% 160m 200m 2014 Future Builder 2014 15 to 2016 17 performance period audited information The 2014 Future Builder award was subject to ROCE, cash flow and relative sales performance targets, excluding Argos.
In addition, a performance gateway must be achieved before any element could vest.
The following table sets out the extent to which each performance measure was achieved and this resulted in a performance multiplier of 0.9x which is applied to the core award, i. e. 22.5 per cent of the maximum available award vested.
