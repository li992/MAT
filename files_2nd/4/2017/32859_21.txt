Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 93 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Additional disclosures in respect of the single figure table Annual bonus Our annual bonus framework is intended to ensure an increased transparency of outcomes, in line with best practice developments.
Financial elements comprise 60% of the framework, while performance against a balanced scorecard of measures comprises the remaining 40%.
The table below sets out the outcomes for the Executive Directors against our financial targets: Pay-out Performance targets Actual 2017 as % of Measure Weighting Threshold Target Maximum outcome maximum Group net income 20% US$335m US$380m US$431m US$382m 52.0% 1 Group order intake 20% US$4,880m US$6,100m US$7,320m US$4,695m 0.0% Group free cash flow 20% US$200m US$0m US$200m US$281m 100.0% As a % of maximum 50.7% As a % of salary earned out of 120% for financial elements 60.8% 1 The actual 2017 Group order intake of US$4,695 million, used in the annual bonus framework, includes the negative impact of certain variation order reversals.
These variation order reversals were not excluded from the order intake metric of US$5.2 billion reported elsewhere in this Annual Report but were instead deducted from the closing 2017 backlog position.
As the table above highlights, our financial performance resulted in a pay-out against the financial measures of 51% of maximum 61% of salary.
This out-turn reflects the strong progress the business made on cash conversion, good delivery on our net income goals, and new orders that fell short of the targets set at the start of the year, despite a good recovery in absolute terms in a competitive marketplace.
The Group net income outturn of US$382 million pre-exceptional items and certain remeasurements includes an adjustment to reverse the impact of a US$38 million derecognition of deferred tax.
The Committee considered it fair and appropriate to adjust for this impact, which largely reflect reforms to corporation tax loss relief that were enacted in October 2017.
These changes were not known at the time the targets were set and were not considered to be reflective of underlying business performance by the Committee.
This explains the difference between the figure shown above and those presented in the Financial review on pages 42 to 45.
The remainder of the annual bonus 40% is subject to a balanced scorecard of measures, aligned with our business plan and key corporate objectives.
The scorecard ensures that the Committee considers not only the financial performance measures achieved but also the wider health of the Company, safeguarding future years performance, and the manner and behaviours by which our performance has been delivered.
In particular, the scorecard captures performance under five areas: health & safety and compliance: operational and project delivery: financial performance: capability: and strategic growth measures.
Under each of these areas, Executive Directors have a number of tailored performance objectives based on their particular areas of focus, performance against which is assessed at year-end based on a 1-5 scored system.
The overall score for each Executive Director is used in determining their individual score under the balanced scorecard element.
Examples of performance against the individual measures on which the Executive Directors were assessed in determining their performance against the scorecard include: Ayman Asfari Delivered Group financial performance: drove compliance and HSSEIA culture and values throughout Petrofac and placed strong emphasis on the Code of Business Conduct, mandatory training completion rates improved, site visits and lost-time metrics: delivered succession planning objectives and organisational design: and successfully communicated Group strategy and the investment proposition to all stakeholders.
Alastair Cochran Provided resilient financial operations and controls: drove the successful enhancement of processes across enterprise risk management and assurance: successfully implemented plans to reduce Petrofacs capital intensity and streamline the business: and refreshed and delivered finance succession plans.
Marwan Chedid Delivered Group financial performance: drove HSSEIA performance in our operations: and supported collection of commercial settlements.
Based on aggregate performance against the financial metrics and their balanced scorecard, the table below provides an overview of the annual bonuses received by each Executive Director in office during 2017: Performance Financial Balanced element scorecard element 2017 As a % of 60% 40% Overall annual bonus base salary 1 Ayman Asfari 75% of maximum 60.4% of maximum 785,098 120.8% 50.7% Alastair Cochran 100% of maximum 70.4% of maximum 563,137 140.8% of maximum 1, 2 Marwan Chedid 50% of maximum 50.4% of maximum $272,565 39.8% 1 Recognising that the outcome of the SFO investigation may not be known for some time, Mr Asfari and Mr Chedid have both agreed that their 2017 bonus payment be subject to a clawback provision in the event that either is found guilty of any charges brought as a result of the SFO investigation.

Details of the actual number of shares granted are set out on page 97.
The following table provides details of the awards made under the PSP on 13 September 2017.
These awards were made later in the year than usual as a result of operational restrictions, which included adherence to the Companys Share Dealing Code.

TSR element 70% of the 2017 award is based on relative TSR, reflecting the importance we place on creating sustainable long-term shareholder value.
The TSR peer group was updated for this cycle to more accurately reflect the changing nature of the companies against which Petrofac competes and, in addition, we simplified the TSR measure by moving to a ranked instead of an indexed approach, to create a simpler and more transparent TSR metric.

For the 2017 awards, the measures focused on i protecting our core E&C business: ii growing our reimbursable services offering: iii reducing capital intensity by improving working capital and cash management: and iv delivering back to our core strategy.
Each measure is subject to stretching underlying targets.

No payment for loss of office was made to any Director during 2017.
The Company does not have any agreements with any Director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover.
There are, however, provisions included within the Companys share plans that may cause awards to vest.
In addition, the Restricted Share Plan award granted to Mr Cochran in October 2016 prior to his appointment as a Director, is subject to an additional provision that would enable full vesting of the award in the event of a change of control.
Full details of these provisions are included in the Directors Remuneration Policy, which was approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2017.

Historical TSR performance and Group Chief Executive remuneration outcomes The chart below compares the TSR performance of the Company over the past nine years with the TSR of the FTSE 250 Index.

Governance The Board and the Committee consider that, throughout 2017 and up to the date of this report, the Company has complied with On behalf of the Board the provisions of the UK Governance Code relating to Directors remuneration.
In addition, relevant guidelines issued by prominent Matthias Bichsel investor bodies and proxy voting agencies have been presented Chairman of the Remuneration Committee to and considered by the Committee during its discussions.
28 February 2018 The Committee endeavours to consider executive remuneration matters in the context of alignment with risk management and, during the year, had oversight of any related factors to be taken into consideration.
The Committee believes that the remuneration arrangements in place do not raise any health and safety, environmental, social or ethical issues, nor inadvertently motivate irresponsible behaviour.
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2017 101 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Policy report Looking forward Our Directors Remuneration Policy the Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 11 May 2017 for a period of up to three years.
In order to provide the context in which individual remuneration decisions have been made during the year, the approved policy table, and notes to the table, have been included below.
The full Remuneration Policy, as approved, is available at www.
The policy for Executive Directors is designed in line with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration for the wider Group and all reward arrangements are built around common objectives and principles.
As a Jersey-incorporated company, Petrofac does not have the benefit of the statutory protections afforded by the UK Companies Act 2006.
While the Policy Report was not submitted as a binding resolution at the 2017 AGM, the Committee considers the vote of shareholders to be binding in its application.
However, if there is any inconsistency between the Companys Policy Report as approved by shareholders and any contractual entitlement or other right of a Director, the Company may be obliged to honour that existing entitlement or right.
