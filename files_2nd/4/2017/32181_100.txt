116 Johnson Matthey Annual Report & Accounts 2017 4.
Governance Implementation of the Directors Remuneration Policy for 2017 18 The table below sets out how the Remuneration Committee intends to apply the Directors Remuneration Policy, subject to approval of the Remuneration Policy by shareholders, for the year ended 31st March 2018.
Salary The salary review date has been moved from 1st August to 1st April.
Salaries for the Executive Directors for 2017 18 have been increased in line with the budgeted increase for all other UK employees of 2.25%, albeit pro-rated to reflect the Executive Directors period of service since their last increase.
The salaries of Robert MacLeod and John Walker have therefore increased by 1.5% to 798,000 and 456,750 respectively and Anna Manzs salary has increased by 1% to 490,000.
Benefits and pension No change to policy applied in 2017 18.
The maximum limit on pensions has been retained at 25%, the level paid to the current Executive Directors.
However, as set out in the recruitment section of the Directors Remuneration Policy, it is the committees intention that pension for future hires would be aligned with the level for other senior managers.
Annual incentives The maximum bonus opportunity for 2017 18 remains unchanged at 180% of salary for the Chief Executive and 150% of salary for the other Executive Directors.
As explained in the Chairmans introductory letter, bonuses for 2017 18 will be based on underlying profit before tax 80% and working capital 20%.
Targets for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer will be based on group performance.
For the Sector Chief Executive, Clean Air, targets will be based on a mix of group and Clean Air Sector performance.
The addition of a working capital measure into the bonus is new for 2017 18 and is designed to provide a broader framework for assessing the performance of the company.
The Remuneration Committee considers the forward looking targets to be commercially sensitive, but full details of the targets and performance against them will be disclosed in next years report.
As set out in the Policy Report, 50% of any bonus paid will be deferred in shares for three years and the payment of any bonus is subject to appropriate malus and clawback provisions.
Long term incentives Award levels remain unchanged at 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and 175% of salary for the other Executive Directors.
The long term Performance Share Plan awards will be based on EPS growth targets, subject to achieving a satisfactory level of return on capital employed.
The EPS targets will be the same as those applying to the 2016 awards, namely 15% vesting for 4% p. a. underlying EPS growth, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% vesting for 10% p. a. underlying EPS growth or above.
Vested awards are released in equal tranches over three, four and five years.
