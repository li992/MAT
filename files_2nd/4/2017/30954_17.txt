Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017 Governance 55 Directors Remuneration Report At the AGM in May 2017, a binding vote approved our new Remuneration Policy which reflected developments in markets and good remuneration practice, with the key changes being: replacement of adjusted operating profit with adjusted earnings per share as a performance target for future awards made under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP : the introduction of a two year post-vesting holding period for future awards made under the LTIP: and an increase in the share ownership guidelines to 200% of salary for all Executive Directors.

Annual Report on Remuneration This report describes the details of the Remuneration Policy for our Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors and sets out how this Policy has been used and, accordingly, the amounts paid relating to the year ended 31 December 2017.
The report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the FCAs Listing Rules and The Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008, as amended.
The report has also been prepared in line with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Various disclosures of the detailed information about the Directors remuneration set out below have been audited by the Groups independent auditor, KPMG LLP.
Total remuneration Executive Director single figure audited In line with regulatory requirements, the total remuneration table contained within the Annual Report on Remuneration section covers the financial period 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.
As we are required to do so by the regulations, the single figure includes the value of long-term awards vesting in respect of the financial year within the single figure table.
Therefore, pre-merger LTIP plans for Just Retirement awarded in 2014 for Rodney Cook and Simon Thomas and Partnership Assurance David Richardson are included.
The latter had a performance period ending 31 December 2016 but vested in 2017.
As mentioned in the Remuneration Chairmans statement, the tables below show a 12 month comparison with the 12 month period from 1 January to 31 December 2016, and also as required by law with the original 18 month financial reporting period as shown in the 2016 Remuneration Report.

Included is the actual vest value of 108,104 relating to 20% vesting of the Partnership Assurance LTIP 2015 for the performance period ended 31 December 2016, the terms of which were set out in the merger agreement.
An estimated value of this award was omitted in the 2016 Directors Remuneration Report.

Accordingly, the 18 month period figure of 111,118 reported in the 2016 Directors Remuneration Report has been restated.

Risk consideration The Committee reviewed a comprehensive report from the Group Chief Risk Officer to ascertain that the Executive Directors objectives had been fulfilled within the risk appetite of the Group.
In addition, the Committee received feedback from the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance function and from the Group Legal Counsel that there were no material issues to consider around regulatory breaches, customer outcomes or litigation that would prevent payment of any STIP award or trigger any malus.
The Committee was satisfied that the STIP awards should be paid.

As previously disclosed to shareholders, operating profit performance was measured from the year ending 30 June 2015 as operating profit from the year ended 30 June 2014 was considered by the Committee to be an inappropriate base from which to measure growth in light of the changes to the previous annuity market announced in the budget for that year.
In line with the policy, the Committee considered the pre and post-merger performance of the companies, including risk considerations, and saw no reason not to allow the LTIP to vest in accordance with the performance conditions.
At grant, the end of performance period for the 2014 award was intended to be the three financial years from the year ended 30 June 2014.
The change to the Companys financial year, which resulted in an 18 month financial reporting period from 30 June 2015 to 31 December 2016, would have resulted in a 42 month performance period which ended after the vesting date of the awards.
The Committee therefore determined that performance should be measured over the original 36 month period.
In order to measure OP growth to 30 June 2017, pro forma OP figures for the half year to 31 December 2016 and the half year to 30 June 2017 were combined as shown in the table below.

Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017 66 Directors Remuneration Report continued 2017 LTIP awards granted audited As outlined in last years report, in order to take account of the change to the Companys year end from 30 June to 31 December, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the timing of the annual grant of long-term incentive awards, bringing forward the grant of the 2016 awards from November to April 2016.
As a result of this and the change of timing in the grant of awards, the aggregate value of awards granted to the former Executive Directors of Just Retirement was greater than the level that might normally be expected under the Policy in an 18 month period.
The Committee was aware that this situation was anomalous and when determining award levels for the grant of the 2017 LTIP ensured that, when considered over the 30 month period from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2017, the aggregate level of awards granted is appropriate.
As a result, the following awards were made: % of salary at End of 1 2 2 1 Date of grant Type of award grant Number of shares Face value Threshold vesting performance period nil-cost 170% of Rodney Cook 17 May 2017 options 650,000 846,613 1,105,000 25% 31 December 2019 nil-cost 150% of David Richardson 17 May 2017 options 454,000 521,759 681,000 25% 31 December 2019 nil-cost 127.5% of Simon Thomas 17 May 2017 options 380,000 371,207 484,500 25% 31 December 2019 1 Awards were granted at a share price of 130.52p, being the average of the middle-market quotations of shares over the five consecutive dealing days immediately prior to the date of grant.
2 Half of the award is subject to growth in the Groups adjusted earnings per share EPS performance target.
If the adjusted EPS growth target for the 12 months ending 31 December 2019 exceeds the adjusted EPS growth target for the financial year ending 31 December 2016 by 6% p. a. equivalent to 19.1% cumulative growth, 25% of the award will vest.
The award will vest in full for growth of 12% p. a. equivalent to 40.5% cumulative growth with payment on a sliding scale in-between these points.
No award will vest if cumulative growth is below 19.1%.
Half of the award is subject to TSR performance relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts, mining companies and oil and gas producers.
Vesting of 25% of these awards will occur for median performance and the maximum 100% will vest for upper quartile performance or above, with straight-line vesting between these points.
None of these awards will vest if TSR is below the median.
Directors shareholding guidelines audited To align the interests of the Executive Directors with shareholders, each Executive Director must build up and maintain a shareholding in the Group equivalent to 200% of base salary, in line with the Policy.
Until the guideline is met, Executive Directors are required to retain 50% of any LTIP and DSBP share awards that vest or are exercised, net of tax and NICs.
Details of the Directors interests in shares are shown in the table below.

David Richardson was appointed Executive Director on 4 April 2016.
2 Vesting of the LTIP awards made in November 2015 is based half on adjusted operating profit growth and half on relative TSR performance.
Half of the award is subject to growth in the Groups adjusted operating profit.
If adjusted operating profit for the 12 months ending 30 June 2018 exceeds adjusted operating profit for the financial year ending 30 June 2015 by 7.5% p. a. equivalent to 24.2% cumulative growth, 25% of the award will vest.
The award will vest in full for growth of 15% p. a. equivalent to 52% cumulative growth with payment on a sliding scale in-between these points.
No award will vest if cumulative growth is below 24.2%.
Half of the award is subject to TSR performance relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts.
3 Vesting of the LTIP awards made in April and September 2016 is based 25% adjusted operating profit growth, 50% on relative TSR performance and 25% cost-synergy targets.
25% of the award is subject to growth in the Groups adjusted operating profit.
If adjusted operating profit for the 12 months ending 31 December 2018 exceeds adjusted operating profit for the 12 months ending 31 December 2015 by 9% p. a. equivalent to 29.5% cumulative growth, 25% of the award will vest.
No award will be made if cumulative growth is below 29.5%.
50% of the award is subject to TSR performance relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts, mining companies and oil and gas producers.
25% of the award is subject to cost-synergy targets.
Where the Companys total pre-tax realised cost savings per annum over the performance period are at 40m, the Annual Synergy Saving Performance percentage shall be 25% threshold.
The Committee has set the 100% vesting level at a stretching target which is above the 45m advised to the market.
Between each point, intermediate results shall be calculated by interpolation.
4 Vesting of the LTIP awards made in May 2017 is based half on growth in the Groups adjusted earnings per share EPS and half on relative TSR performance as described earlier in this report.
5 These were issued in Partnership Assurance Group plc and converted into the Just Group plc scheme on acquisition at 4 April 2016.
6 Dividend shares are included in the SIP total.
The closing share price of the Groups ordinary share price at 31 December 2017 was 1.704 and the closing price range from the start of the financial year to the year end was 1.215 to 1.704.
Dilution The Committee supports the Investment Association guidelines regarding dilution and regularly monitors the Groups compliance with these requirements.
Assuming that all awards made under the Groups share plans vest in full, the Group has utilised 2.15% of the 10% in ten years dilution limit and 1.68% of the 5% in ten years dilution limit.

Remuneration for employees below the Board General Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Policy for the wider Group is designed to attract, retain and motivate new and existing employees.
It is in line with the sector in which we operate and our overall total remuneration approach is to pay a market competitive level of remuneration that is structured to appropriately reward employees, align them with the interests of our shareholders, customers and be relevant to the markets geographies in which we operate.
We define total remuneration as base salary, annual incentive STIP, and any benefits, for example pension.
For those eligible to participate in the LTIP this will also be included.
Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017 Governance 71 Summary of the remuneration structure for employees below Executive Director Remuneration element Policy approach To attract and retain key employees we pay salaries which deliver market competitive total remuneration.
We Base Salary take into account the following when determining the base salary: the size of the role, and its scope, the required skills, knowledge and experience, relevant pay in terms of the wider organisation and appropriate market comparative data.
For 2017 the salary average increase for all employees was set at 2.5%.
This is an average figure, with individual increases varying within a range depending on the factors above.
Most of our employees participate in a discretionary bonus plan, unless an alternative plan, for example in Short term relation to sales roles, is in operation.
This plan is based on the achievement of corporate Company incentive plan performance and personal performance, the latter is based on objectives, behaviours in line with our culture and STIP conduct in the role.
For regulated roles, for example in risk, audit or compliance roles, an element of the financial performance may be replaced by functional performance.
The Group also operates bonus plans for certain types of roles, for example sales, based on objectives, behaviours in line with our culture and conduct in the role.
The Remuneration Committee has the ultimate discretion on all incentive plans and these are reviewed on an annual basis.
Bonuses for all of the Executive team who are not Board members have an element of bonus deferred into shares for three years.
Participation in the LTIP is for a small number of executives and key roles each year in recognition of the strategic Long term and critical roles that they hold in supporting the strategic direction of the business and delivering Company Incentive Plan performance.
In 2017 fewer than 50 people were granted awards.
LTIP The Company operates a deferred share bonus plan DSBP which provides the vehicle for the deferral of the Other Share Plans STIP award.
All employees are provided with the opportunity to participate in the Group defined contribution pension plan.
Pension All employees are able to participate in the private medical cover scheme.
