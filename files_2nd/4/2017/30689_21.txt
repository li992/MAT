Connecting for Growth ambitions Overview of 2017 Extension of shareholding There have been significant achievements and developments this year.
On 1 January 2017, requirements to the direct as announced last year, Rajiv Sharma was appointed to the position of Chief Executive Officer reports of the Group and in June 2017 Coats Group plc entered the FTSE 250.
The strength of the companys Chief Executive performance has been reflected in the increase in the share price and the commencement of dividend payments during 2017.
I am pleased to note that at the 2017 AGM the Directors Remuneration Policy received overwhelming support from our shareholders.
I did write to major shareholders prior to The strong financial performance the meeting to outline the Committees approach to the policy and I was encouraged by of the group is reflected in the the constructive comments that we received during this process.
The Committee remains bonus outcomes for 2017. committed to ensuring an open and proactive dialogue with shareholders on all aspects of the remuneration policy.
Following the adoption of the new policy there is now a greater proportion of annual bonus that is deferred and awarded in shares with an increase in deferral from 25% to 33%.
The Committee also increased the Minimum Shareholding Requirement from 100% to 200% of salary for Executive Directors and a requirement at 75% of salary has been adopted from 1 July 2018 for the first time for other members of the Group Executive Team.
The strong Over this three-year period the financial performance of the group is reflected in the bonus outcomes for 2017.
Continued TSR performance of Coats Group plc growth in the sales and profitability of the Industrial Division from both Apparel and Footwear th was at the 98 Percentile versus and Performance Materials segments and conversion of profit to free cash flow has resulted its comparator group of FTSE 250 in bonus payments that are in excess of the target level of payout.
Also reflected in the report is the vesting of the Long Term Incentive award for the performance period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017.
Over this three-year period the th TSR performance of Coats Group plc was at the 98 Percentile versus its comparator group of FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts and the Attributable Profit growth exceeded the compound annual growth target of 20%.
The minimum Free Cash Flow target was not achieved which is largely a reflection of the ambitious nature of the targets originally set.
The LTIP award for the three-year period ending on 31 December 2017 vests at 60% of maximum and the value of the award is enhanced by the increase in the share price from 25.25 pence on the grant date of 7 April 2015 to 89.125 pence on 31 December 2017.
Outlook for 2018 Looking forward to 2018 the group has announced a transformation programme Connecting for Growth that will support the business on its next stage of development.
The programme is expected to have some initial exceptional costs that will be predominantly weighted to 2018 but will produce longer term benefits for shareholder value over the forthcoming three-year period.
55 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 CONTINUED Outlook for 2018 continued Accordingly, the Committee have decided that for the 2018 LTIP award the threshold EPS I acknowledge the increasing desire Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR target should be increased from 5% to 7% and from stakeholders and shareholders a mid-range target of 10% CAGR should be introduced to increase the challenge of the that Remuneration Committees should continue to consider remuneration vesting scale.
The maximum EPS CAGR target remains unchanged at 15%.
Further details for executives in the context of the are provided in the forward-looking statement for 2018 contained in the Annual Report rest of the workforce.
No other significant changes are proposed for 2018 other than the adoption of a Minimum Shareholding Requirement for senior positions below the Board, as described above.
Corporate Governance I acknowledge the increasing desire from stakeholders and shareholders that Remuneration Committees should continue to consider remuneration for executives in the context of the rest of the workforce.
In particular, there is an increasing focus on the publication of the ratio of CEO pay to the rest of the workforce.
This does present some challenge to Coats as the Group has fewer than 200 employees in the UK but employs some 19,000 employees in over 50 countries.
Although the UK government have announced an intention to require UK companies to publish a CEO pay ratio no methodology has been yet been released.
We have in the meantime adopted our own methodology to compare the 2016 Single Figure CEO remuneration to the average and median employee based in the UK.
The CEO multiple versus the average is 16 times and versus the median is 25 times.
We will continue to monitor developments and to adhere to requirements as they become clearer.
I am pleased to welcome Echo Lu who joined the Committee on her appointment to the Board on 1 December 2017.
On behalf of the Committee I would like to thank shareholders for their continued support.

For other Non-Executive Directors no changes were proposed during 2017 and the base fees have remained at the same level since 1 October 2013.
Non-Executive Directors, excluding the Chairman, who are required to travel long haul more than 5 hours one-way to meetings are entitled to an additional travel allowance of 1,500 for each round-trip subject to a maximum of five trips per annum.

2 Or date of resignation, if earlier.
3 This target was increased to 200% on 1 January 2017.
The target number of shares is based on the average share price for 2017 which was 72.1p.
The Executive Directors shareholding requirement must be met within five years of their appointment to the Board which is by 2 March 2020 for Rajiv Sharma and 4 July 2021 for Simon Boddie.
For the purposes of achieving this target the total number of shares beneficially owned by the Director or a closely associated person is considered as well as the estimated post-tax number of vested but unexercised share options or deferred bonuses that are not subject to a performance condition.
All Long Term Incentive awards granted to Executive Directors from 29 July 2016 onwards include a requirement to retain any vested shares save for any shares that may be sold to satisfy income tax liabilities until a minimum of the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
The table above indicates shares beneficially owned by Directors or closely associated persons: deferred bonus shares are the compulsory proportion of the annual bonus that are still subject to a holding period and LTIP share options are the performance related awards which are still subject to performance conditions.
Deferred bonus and LTIP awards were granted on 7 April 2015, 26 February 2016, 29 July 2016 LTIP only to Simon Boddie on joining and 27 February 2017.
The share options with no performance conditions remaining represents the 43.6% vesting of the LTIP 14 award that was disclosed in the 2016 report and which have not yet been exercised.
The LTIP 14 award was originally subject to 3 year performance conditions for the period to 31 December 2016.

64 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 CONTINUED Review of performance The graph shows the difference between investing 100 in the Company and the constituents of the FTSE All Share Index and FTSE 250 from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2017.
It is assumed dividends are reinvested over that period.
The Board feels the FTSE All Share Index and the FTSE 250 each provide an appropriate comparator given the Companys market capitalisation and its presence on the London Stock Exchange.
To enable comparison with the TSR performance measure for the Long Term Incentive Plan award an additional graph is shown that reflects the three year performance period ending 31 December 2017.

The increase in CEO remuneration from 2015 to 2016 is therefore largely influenced by the 2015 single figure data being part year data.
The CEO figures for 2017 reflect the appointment of Rajiv Sharma and in particular the increase in benefits reflect the relocation and expatriate support that was offered to him following his appointment as CEO on 1 January 2017.
2 The average of all employees reflects the total number of employees based in the UK.
The UK has been chosen as the most appropriate comparator group because the CEO is based in the UK and the majority of Coats employees who are employed outside the UK are working in locations with very different inflationary and market pressures.
The UK employee population includes employees across all levels of the organisation.

66 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 CONTINUED The cumulative Free Cash Flow target is subject to adjustment and is calculated before dividends and before any deficit repair contributions to UK pension schemes.
EPS growth is based on EPS growth adjusted to exclude the impact of any variation in the pension finance charge.
The Committee have decided to increase the challenge of the Long Term Incentive targets that will apply for the three-year performance period commencing on 1 January 2018.
The Company announced to shareholders on 27 February 2018 the commencement of a Connecting For Growth C4G programme that is intended to increase the profitability and efficiency of the Group going forward and to support its stretching growth plans.
The programme will, in the short term, initially incur certain exceptional costs which have been disclosed to shareholders but will result in longer term improvement to shareholder value.
Accordingly, the Committee feels that it appropriate to increase the challenge of the EPS growth targets for the 2018 LTIP award: the threshold EPS CAGR target for the 2018 award will be increased from 5% to 7% and a mid-point target of 10% EPS CAGR will be introduced with will vest at 47.5%.
The Free Cash Flow targets have been based on plans that anticipate future benefits of the C4G programme.
The future benefits should be reflected in the TSR performance of the company and so no adjustment is required to the targets for the TSR measure.
