Enhanced bonus deferral arrangements under which any bonus in excess of 75% of salary is deferred in shares for three years.

BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance Governance 79 Annual bonus for the year to 31 March 2017 audited For the year ended 31 March 2017, bonuses were subject to a maximum of 150% of base salary for executive directors and up to 75% for other senior staff.
Bonus targets were set at the start of the financial year for both Louise Makin and Rolf Soderstrom based on the achievement of targets for revenue growth, trading profit, cash generation and individual KPIs intended to drive future growth in the business.
The Committee set threshold and stretch as well as intermediate targets.
The bonus is calculated on base salary, with a percentage pay out against the maximum of 150% of between 25% at threshold, 50% at on-target and 100% of the maximum at stretch.
The trading profit measure is a normalised measure relating to earnings before amortisation of intangibles, restructuring and acquisition costs, Group foreign exchange movements and movements in the fair value of derivatives.
The cash flow measure adjusts for restructuring and acquisition related costs only.
The Committee may adjust the final outcome upwards or downwards in the event that an exceptional event occurs, which, in the Committees opinion, materially and unreasonably affected the bonus out-turn.
During 2016 17, the Committee assessed that adjustments should be made for each of the following: i exclusion of the impact of the Galil Medical acquisition that occurred during the year, as its performance was not included in the original bonus targets.
ii exclusion of the positive impact from foreign exchange translation as a result of the weakening GBP against USD: iii exclusion of realised losses on derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, consistent to the principle of excluding the positive impact from foreign exchange translation that these contracts hedge: iv exclusion of the charge of 28m in relation to the settlement of the US Department of Justice investigation into the historic marketing of LC Bead : and v exclusion of the above budget performance from the Groups licensing income.

Vesting of LTIP Awards Audited Core awards granted on 1 June 2012 together with the associated Multiplier awards granted on 1 June 2015 and Core awards granted on 9 June 2014 under the Performance Share Plan will vest in June 2017 based on performance to the year ended 31 March 2017 subject to a decision by the executive directors to roll over 50% or 100% of the 2014 Core awards.
The performance conditions and estimated vesting outcomes for these awards are as follows: 2012 LTIP Core and Multiplier included in the single figure for total remuneration The Core awards granted in June 2012 were subject to 50% cumulative trading profit and 50% TSR targets over the three years to 31 March 2015.
At that time, full vesting was achieved on both elements due to performance of 198.1m trading profit compared to a stretch target of 177.4m, and TSR performance of 130.4% compared to an upper quartile target of 110.5%.
Vesting of all Core awards were deferred by each executive director and put at risk in 2015 and in return each director was eligible to receive Multiplier awards, with both elements capable of vesting in June 2017, subject to TSR performance over the five years to 31 March 2017, as detailed in the tables below: Target 100% vesting Core Stretch Target Threshold Target 0% vesting 100% vesting Metric Condition 0% vesting Multiplier Core and Multiplier Median Actual BTG % Vesting TSR 2012 Five-year Core and comparison Median minus Median plus 86.87% Core Multiplier with index 66.66% Median 100% 77.43% 68.67% 0% Multiplier BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance Governance 81 TSR has been calculated for the Committee by NBS.

2013 LTIP Core awards elected for roll over in 2016 included in the single figure for total remuneration As disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report last year, 100% of the 2013 Core awards were eligible to vest in July 2016.
These awards are subject to the multiplier mechanism approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGM.
As a result, the number of shares that were capable of vesting in 2016 as a Core award was subject to an election by either executive director to forego vesting of 50% or 100% of that award and roll over the award in return for the entitlement to receive a Multiplier award which may increase or decrease the number of shares vesting at year five based on relative TSR performance up to the end of that period.
This election had to be made before the shares vested in July 2016.
Louise Makin elected to roll over 50% of the awards before the vesting date, therefore the remaining 50% of the awards vested in the year.
Any Multiplier award will not vest until the period of five years from grant of the original Core award.
Rolf Soderstrom did not elect to roll over any of his Core award and therefore his associated Multiplier awards lapsed on 17 July 2016.

If Core awards are deferred in June 2017, each director will have the Core awards plus the associated Multiplier awards Louise Makin 130,060 awards and Rolf Soderstrom 85,248 awards subject to a five-year TSR condition.
The number of shares that are capable of vesting under the 2014 PSP this year as a Core award are subject to an election by either executive director to forego vesting of 50% or 100% of that award and roll over the award in return for the entitlement to receive a Multiplier award which may increase or decrease the number of shares vesting at year five based on relative TSR performance up to the end of that period.
This election must be made before the shares vest in June 2017.

BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance Governance 83 Outstanding share awards audited The table below sets out details of executive directors outstanding share awards which will vest in future years subject to performance and or continued service.
In 2014, Louise elected to receive a Multiplier award as an alternative to the vesting of the 2011 PSP shares as a Core award and on 6 July 2014 a Multiplier award of 224,746 was granted.
In 2015, Louise elected to receive a Multiplier award as an alternative to the vesting of the 2012 PSP as a Core award and on 1 June 2015 a Multiplier award of 186,063 was granted.
In 2016, Louise elected to roll over 50% of her 2013 PSP Core award.
Therefore 50% of the award vested and 50% will be subject to a five-year TSR condition.
50% of the 2013 PSP Multiplier award lapsed and 50% remains and will also be subject to the five-year TSR condition.
PSP awards from 2016 onwards are granted under the 2016 PSP Plan and executive directors will be required to hold vested shares, net of tax, for an additional two-year holding period.
The award granted in 2016 will have a holding period to 15 July 2021.
In 2014, Rolf elected to receive a Multiplier award as an alternative to the vesting of the 2011 PSP shares as a Core award and on 6 July 2014 a Multiplier award of 155,869 was granted.
In 2015, Rolf elected to receive a Multiplier award as an alternative to the vesting of the 2012 PSP as a Core award and on 1 June 2015 a Multiplier award of 137,961 was granted.
In 2016, Rolf did not elect to roll over any of his 2013 PSP Core award.
Therefore all of his 2013 PSP Multiplier award lapsed and none of his 2013 PSP awards will be subject to the five-year TSR condition.
BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance Governance 85 Share options and performance shares were granted for nil consideration.
The price used for calculating the number of shares awarded under the PSP was based on the average of the closing share prices over the five days immediately prior to the award date.
Share options are awarded using the closing mid-market price on the date before grant.
Sharesave options were granted on the condition that participants agreed to enter into a monthly savings contract.
Awards are normally satisfied using new issue shares.
The Groups share plans comply with recommended guidelines on dilution limits and the Group has always operated within these limits.
Assuming none of the extant options lapse and will be exercised and, having included all exercised options, the Group has utilised 3.7% of the 10% in ten years and 3.2% of the 5% in ten years in accordance with the Association of British Insurers ABI guidance on dilution limits.

The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year-ends.
The Group has chosen the Index as a comparator as it believes that it gives shareholders a reasonable comparison with the TSR of other equity investments in companies of a broadly similar size across all sectors.
The TSR performance has been measured by NBS.
The middle market price of an ordinary share on 31 March 2017 was 615.5p.
During the year the share price ranged from a low of 534.5p to a high of 728.0p.
The total remuneration figure includes the annual bonus and LTIP awards that vested based on performance in those years.
The annual bonus and LTIP percentages show the payout for each year as a percentage of the maximum.
2017 reflects the vesting of the 2012 Core awards, the related 2015 Multiplier awards and the 2013 Core awards that were not rolled forward in 2016.

The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive.
However, the targets will be based on three financial metrics, being BTG product revenues 1 3 weighting, adjusted operating profit 1 3 weighting and free cash flow 1 3 weighting.
Full retrospective disclosure of the financial targets and performance against them will be seen in next years Annual Remuneration Report.
The individual and corporate metrics will also be disclosed to the extent possible given their ongoing commercial sensitivity.
The first 75% of salary of any bonus will be paid in cash, with any bonus paid in excess of 75% of salary compulsorily deferred into shares for three years.
Performance targets for the 2017 PSP awards The Committees policy is to grant executive directors annual PSP awards.
The Committee intends to grant awards in June 2017 at the level of 225% of salary to each executive director.
Targets for the PSP awards made during 2017 18 will be measured in the final year of the three year period the 2019 20 financial year and are as follows: TSR relative to the constituents of the Adjusted EPS in the year ending FTSE 250 over three financial years Percentage of each 31 March 2020 ending 31 March 2020 element that vests Below threshold Less than 29p Less than median 0% Threshold 29p Median 25% Between Threshold 29p to 39.5p Between median 25% to 100% and stretch and upper quartile Stretch 39.5p or higher Upper quartile or higher 100% Payouts for performance between Threshold and Stretch calculated on a straight-line basis The Committee considered these to be appropriately stretching targets having regard to the anticipated expiry of royalty licences, ongoing investment in R&D and an increase in the Groups medium-term effective tax rate.
Targets have been set assuming constant currency.
Executive Directors will be required to hold vested shares, net of tax, for a further two-year holding period.

This policy was approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM and applies from the beginning of the 2015 16 financial year until the 2019 AGM.
The Policy enables the Group to offer a package of rewards that: is sufficiently competitive to enable the Group to attract and retain the management talent it needs to ensure the Group is successful: supports the achievement of the Groups strategy by providing the potential to receive significant rewards linked to the long-term performance of the Group: aligns executives with shareholders and helps to retain them by delivering a significant element of remuneration in shares: and is flexible enough to cope with the Groups changing needs as it grows and the strategy evolves.
The Committee believes that the salary, annual bonus with deferral, long-term incentives with a five-year time horizon from grant to potential sale of vested shares, demanding share ownership guidelines, and forfeiture provisions, together provide a balanced market-competitive package for the executive team which is aligned with shareholder interests.
The Committee will, however, keep the approach under review in order to ensure it remains appropriate.

Prior to 2013, awards consisted of a mix of market value share options granted under the ESOP and performance shares granted under the 2006 PSP.
Awards granted under the 2006 PSP consist of a Core award and a Multiplier award and executive directors are able to roll over 0%, 50% or 100% of any Core award that would vest in return for a Multiplier award that could increase or decrease the value of the Core award, vesting after five years from the date of grant, subject to performance conditions.
The full structure of these awards is outlined in the policy approved at the 2013 AGM.
A description of how the Group intends to implement the policy set out in this table for 2017 can be found in the Annual Remuneration Report.
All-employee share plans do not have performance conditions.
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the UK Sharesave Plan on the same terms as other employees.
Copies of the PSP and DSBP plan rules are available on request from the Company Secretary.
