Benefits will be set at levels which are competitive, but not excessive.

Clawback may apply at any time prior to the fifth anniversary of grant in the event of: an overpayment to the participant: or if the participant leaves in circumstances which, had all the facts been known, would have resulted in the award lapsing.
Remuneration arrangements across the Group When setting Executive remuneration, consideration is given to pay policies and employment conditions of employees of the Company and elsewhere in the Group.
The remuneration of employees across the Group is based on three fundamental principles.
Firstly, that it allows the Group to retain the level of talent necessary to implement the strategy as set by the CEO and Board.
Additionally, that levels of remuneration should be sufficient to achieve this aim, but should never be higher than is necessary to do so.
Finally, with limited exceptions, the more significant the ability of an employee to influence the Companys financial results through their individual performance, the higher the proportion of their remuneration should be performance-based.
The level and design of variable pay takes into account the need to avoid incentivising the Groups employees to act in a manner that is inconsistent with the Groups risk appetite, as set by the Board.
Consistent with the policy for Executive Directors, where annual bonuses are in place across the Group, they are linked to business performance with a focus on underlying Group, divisional profit and other relevant metrics.
Whilst only Executive Directors and senior Executives participate in the PSP, other full time employees in the UK can participate in the Companys all employee SAYE scheme which is designed to incentivise participants to build a shareholding in the Company, thus aligning their interests with those of the Groups shareholders.
This plan is not subject to performance conditions, but requires the employee to remain employed at the end of the term of the scheme which they have joined.
In line with local country practices, all employees are encouraged to contribute appropriate savings towards their retirement.
In the UK, the Company operates pension arrangements within the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes Automatic Enrolment Regulations 2010.
Whilst the Company does not feel it appropriate to consult directly with employees when drawing up the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee has considered any feedback received via employee engagement surveys and from the regular meeting the CEO and Group Human Resources Director conduct with staff representative bodies in each of our major geographies.
79 Directors Remuneration Report continued Annual Remuneration report Responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee The key responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are to determine on behalf of the Board: the Companys general policy on Executive remuneration: and the specific remuneration packages of the Executive Directors, the Chairman of the Board and senior Executives of the Group including, but not limited to, base salary, pension, annual performance-related bonuses and PSP awards.
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors.
All Directors are subject to the overriding principle that no person shall be involved in the process of determining his or her own remuneration.
The full responsibilities of the Committee are contained within its terms of reference, which are available on our website investors.

This relates to the 2015 PSP awards which will be paid out in March 2018 and had a performance period of 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017.
The relevant performance criteria was partially achieved and therefore 68.01 per cent of the award vested for each of the Executive Directors.
This calculation is based upon the average value of Computacenter plc shares over the last quarter of 2017 being 10.55.
Ros Rivaz was appointed to the Board on 11 November 2016.
The value of the 2014 PSP awards have been updated to reflect the actual share price at vesting on 22 March 2017 of 7.15.
The pensions benefit for Tony Conophy includes 12,488.74 in respect of the year ended 31 December 2016 due to the timing of implementing his election of a revised pension arrangement whereby employees can, under certain conditions, receive a cash payment in lieu of membership of a collective pension scheme.
Remuneration paid in 2017: Executive Directors 2017 base salary The annual salaries of the Executive Directors were not increased during 2017.

Fifty per cent of the bonus will be deferred into Computacenter shares, with half payable after one year and half payable after two years.
Bonus payments are also subject to clawback for two years, in the event that the Group materially misstates its financial results for the reporting period or in the event of misconduct by the Executive Director.
The 2017 annual bonus opportunity was driven by the financial performance of the business and individual targets for each Director.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, 80 per cent of this award was conditional on the achievement of criteria linked to the financial performance of the Group.
These targets were set by the Committee with reference to the Groups strategic and financial plans, as approved by the Board of Directors.
The non-financial personal objectives set for the Executive Directors were based principally on delivery against the Groups strategic objectives and certain people-related objectives, including leadership development and succession planning.

O n 18 October 2017, the Company granted 3,802 options to acquire ordinary shares pursuant to the Computacenter Sharesave Plus Scheme at an Option Price of 7.89 to Tony Conophy.
Dilution limits Computacenter uses a mixture of both new issue and market purchase shares to satisfy the vesting of awards made under its Option, PSP and Sharesave plans.
In line with best practice, the use of new or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under all share schemes, is restricted to 10 per cent in any 10-year rolling period, with a further restriction for discretionary schemes of five per cent in the same period.
The Companys current position against its dilution limit is under each of these thresholds.
The Company regularly reviews its position against the dilution guidelines and, should there be insufficient headroom within which to grant new awards which could be satisfied by issuing new shares, it is the intention of the Company to continue its current practice of satisfying new awards with shares purchased on the market.
Payments to past Directors and payments for loss of office There have been no payments made to past Directors and no payments made for loss of office during the period.

87 Directors Remuneration Report continued CEO pay history The table below shows the total remuneration figure for the CEO over the previous nine financial years.
The total remuneration figure includes the annual bonus and PSP awards which vested based on performance in those years.
The annual bonus and PSP percentages show the payout for each year as a percentage of the maximum.
Salary Benefits Annual bonus CEO 0% 18.5% 89.8% Computacenter UK-based employees 1.95% -2.92% -5.75% The comparator Group of Computacenter UK-based employees was chosen as the Committee believes it provides a sufficiently large comparator Group based on a similar incentive structure to the CEO and reduces any distortion arising from currency and cost of living differences in other geographies in which the Group operates.
The year-on-year decrease in the bonus number for the UK-based employees is driven principally by UK performance as opposed to the CEO bonus, which is based on Group performance.
The year-on-year decrease in the benefits number for the UK-based employees is due principally to the fact that a number of UK staff receiving TUPE related benefits left Computacenter during the reporting period.
The increase in benefits for the CEO takes into account the increase in taxable value of his car and driver.
Relative importance of spend on pay The charts below show the relative expenditure of the Group on the pay of its employees, against certain other key financial indicators of the Group: 1 Expenditure on Group employees pay Shareholder distributions Group adjusted profit before tax 17 653.0m 17 27.1m 17 106.2m 16 560.0m 16 26.8m 16 86.4m 1 As well as information prescribed by current remuneration reporting regulations, Group adjusted profit before tax has also been included as this is deemed to be a key performance indicator of the Group which is linked to the delivery of value to our shareholders.
