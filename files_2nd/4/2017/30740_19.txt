The policy was approved by shareholders at our AGM on 28 April 2017 and is intended to remain in place for three years.
Shown below is the policy in full, as approved by shareholders, updated where appropriate to reference how the policy will be applied in 2018.
Role of the Remuneration Committee The principal role of the Remuneration Committee is to determine the framework and policy for remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman, ensuring that remuneration levels are sufficient but not excessive in order to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to successfully run the Company.
The full terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee can be found on the Companys website at www.
com en investors index committees.
Key responsibilities include: Within the approved policy, determining individual remuneration packages for the Chairman and executive directors, including the terms of any discretionary share schemes in which executive directors may be invited to participate, taking account of the level of remuneration for other Rotork management board members and being aware of remuneration conditions throughout the Group: Agreeing the terms and conditions to be included in service agreements for executive directors, including termination payments: and Selecting, appointing and setting terms of reference with any remuneration consultants who may advise the Remuneration Committee.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company The Remuneration Committee is sensitive to employee remuneration conditions in the Group and in determining remuneration takes account of Group remuneration conditions.
The Remuneration Committee invites the Group HR Director to its meetings to provide, amongst other things, details of employee remuneration conditions and metrics, such as pay rises awarded to employees to inform the Remuneration Committees decision making.
During 2017, the Chair of the Remuneration Committee met with employee representatives to discuss the approach to remuneration at Rotork.
The Remuneration Committee also monitors internal relativities and pay ratios to ensure that they remain appropriate.
Consideration of shareholder views In formulating the Policy Report, the Remuneration Committee takes into account guidance issued by shareholders, their representative bodies and proxy agencies including the Investment Association and Institutional Shareholder Services.
The Remuneration Committee also takes into consideration any views expressed by shareholders during the year including at the AGM and encourages an open dialogue with its largest shareholders.
Major shareholders are consulted in advance about changes to the Policy Report or any significant proposed changes to the way in which it is implemented.
A detailed consultation exercise was undertaken in Autumn 2016.

The fees for the non-executive directors normally comprise a basic Board fee, with additional fees paid to the Senior Independent Director and for chairing a Committee.
Any reasonable business related expenses may be reimbursed including tax thereon if determined to be a taxable benefit.
Performance measures Performance measures are used to determine the extent of any awards made under the variable elements of the executive directors remuneration mix, being the annual bonus and the LTIP.
The performance measures used are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The performance measures are selected because of their use as key performance indicators KPIs to assess Company performance and to align the interests of the directors to those of the shareholders.
Non-financial KPIs constitute part of the annual bonus award and these are selected to ensure that performance measured by financial KPIs is not delivered at the expense of important non-financial considerations.
Clawback and malus The payment of any bonus is at the ultimate discretion of the Remuneration Committee and the Remuneration Committee also retains an absolute discretion to reclaim or withhold some, or all, of any annual bonus paid in exceptional circumstances, such as misstatement of results, an error in the calculation of the performance targets and or award size and gross misconduct.
In terms of the LTIP, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to reclaim some, or all, of a vested LTIP award in exceptional circumstances the categories for clawback being the same as for the annual bonus plan.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee may lapse or reduce an award prior to vesting where the participant is found to be guilty of serious misconduct.
Differences between the Policy Report and the policy on employee remuneration The Board recognises that it is appropriate for a significant proportion of executive directors remuneration to be contingent on the performance of the Group, and that such remuneration is at risk subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions.
Consequently, executive directors and other senior managers are invited to participate in the LTIP where shares awarded will vest contingent upon performance conditions over a three year period.
Executive directors and other senior managers are also invited to participate in the annual bonus scheme which will result in a bonus payment being made if targets are achieved, part of which for executive directors may be deferred in shares.
For employee remuneration, the Board considers it more appropriate that employees share in the success of the Group through a profit based bonus plan which is based on the performance of their business unit and Group performance.
This is coupled with the opportunity, for eligible employees, to receive free shares from the Company, paid from the Companys profits.
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2017 74 overview StrateGic report Governance Financial StatementS company inFormation Approach to recruitment remuneration Base salary levels will be set in accordance with the Policy Report, taking into account the experience and calibre of the individual and their existing remuneration package.
Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, a series of increases to salary may be given over subsequent years subject to individual performance.
Benefits will generally be provided in accordance with the Policy Report, with relocation expenses an expatriate allowance paid for if necessary.
The structure of the variable pay element will be in accordance with the Policy Report.
The maximum aggregate variable pay opportunity under the policy is up to 275% of salary.
Different performance measures may be set initially for the annual bonus, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial year that the executive joined.
In the case of an external hire, it may be necessary to buy-out incentive pay or benefit arrangements which would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer.
This would be provided for taking into account the form cash or shares and timing and expected value i. e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria of the remuneration being forfeited.
Replacement share awards, if used, may be granted using Rotorks existing share plans to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms of grant.
Fees for a new Chairman or non-executive director will be set in line with the Policy Report.
Service contracts and policy on payments for loss of office Under the executive directors service contracts, up to 12 months notice of termination of employment is required by either party.
Should notice be served, the executive directors can continue to receive basic salary, benefits and pension for the duration of their notice period during which time the Company may require the individual to continue to fulfil their current duties or may assign a period of garden leave.
The Company applies a general principle of mitigation in relation to termination payments and the service contracts expressly include the use of monthly phased payments following termination in lieu of notice which can be reduced to the extent that alternative remunerated employment is found.
The service contracts also enable the Company to elect to make a payment in lieu of notice equivalent in value to 12 months base salary only.
In the event of cessation of employment, the executive directors may still be eligible for a bonus at the discretion of the Committee, on a pro-rata basis for the period of time served from the start of the financial year to the date of termination and not for any period in lieu of notice.
Different performance measures to the other executive directors may be set for the bonus for the period up until departure, as appropriate, to reflect changes in responsibility.
Any unvested shares held under the deferred annual bonus plan will ordinarily vest on the normal vesting date, save where the departure is as a result of summary dismissal, in which case the awards will lapse on cessation of employment.
The Remuneration Committee may also determine that the shares shall vest on an earlier date including the date of cessation if the Remuneration Committee, in its discretion, considers that the circumstances of the cessation merit early vesting of the awards.
The rules of the LTIP set out what happens to awards if a participant leaves employment before the end of the vesting period.
Generally, any unvested LTIP awards will lapse when an executive director leaves employment except in certain circumstances.
If the executive director ceases to be employed as a result of death, injury, retirement, transfer of employment or any other analogous reason, they may be treated as a good leaver under the plan rules.
The shares for a good leaver will vest subject to an assessment of performance, with a pro-rata reduction to reflect the proportion of the vesting period served.
Awards for a good leaver may then vest on the normal vesting date, unless the Remuneration Committee determines that they should vest early for example, following the death of the participant.
In determining whether an executive director should be treated as a good leaver and the extent to which their award may vest up to the pro-rated amount, the Remuneration Committee will take into account the circumstances of an individuals departure.
Outplacement services and reimbursement of legal costs may be provided where appropriate.
Any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination would be paid as necessary.
Any legacy benefits under the Companys defined benefit pension schemes will be allowed to be paid under the terms of those schemes and as set out in the Policy Report.
Outstanding share awards would ordinarily vest early on a change of control of the Company.
In the case of unvested awards under the LTIP, performance would be measured to the date of the date of control with a pro-rata reduction to reflect the proportion of the vesting period served.
The Executive Chairman and non-executive directors do not have service contracts, they serve under letters of appointment and are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM.
The term of appointment for non-executive directors and the Executive Chairman is three years and their appointments are subject to termination on three months notice 12 months for the Executive Chairman.
In the event of the termination of their position, they are entitled to reimbursement of any outstanding fees and expenses due.
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2017 75 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Illustration of the application of the Policy Report The charts below illustrate how the remuneration policy would function for minimum, on target and maximum performance for 2018 for each executive director.
Taxable benefits are shown as the cost to the Company of supplying those benefits for the year ending 31 December 2017 or estimated cost in the case of Kevin Hostetler.
On target performance, for illustrative purposes, assumes achievement of 60% of the maximum available bonus and threshold LTIP vesting 20% of the maximum.
Maximum performance assumes achievement of the maximum bonus and full vesting of the LTIP shares.
The LTIP grant level is 150% for Kevin Hostetler and 125% for Jonathan Davis.
No share price growth has been assumed and for simplicity, the benefit derived from participating in the Companys SIP or OPLSS have been excluded.
