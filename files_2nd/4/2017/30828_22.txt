The Committee retains the right to adjust or set different performance measures if events occur such as a change in strategy, a material acquisition and or a divestment of a Group business or a change in prevailing market conditions, which cause the Committee to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that they achieve their original purpose.
2017 PSP The Committees approach Awards under the 2017 PSP will only be granted to: 1 Executive Directors appointed after the 2017 Annual General Meeting: and 2 Executive Directors appointed before the 2017 AGM when their awards under the 2012 LTIP have vested.
Since it is not, therefore, currently proposed to grant awards to Executive Directors under the 2017 PSP, the details of any measures have not been considered.
The Committee would consult with Shareholders as appropriate in relation to the applicable performance measures in advance of any award under the 2017 PSP being granted to an Executive Director.
For initial awards to senior managers under the 2017 PSP, the intention is to align the performance targets with the Capital Return Plan.
This is aligned with our strategy and provides consistency with the participants in the current 2012 LTIP.
2017 PSP The Committees approach Differences between the Executive Directors and general employees remuneration policy Performance related pay makes up a significantly higher proportion of remuneration for the Executive Directors and senior employees than for employees generally, reflecting the role of these individuals in managing the business to achieve the Companys strategic objectives.
The Committee considers that the emphasis on performance related pay for Executive Directors and senior employees closely aligns the Directors interests with those of Shareholders and helps to deliver excellent long term Company performance.

indd 69 07 03 2018 11:43 70 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION The Remuneration Committees Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2017 is set out below.
This includes remuneration for 2017 and the proposed implementation of the remuneration policy for 2018.
The auditor is required toreport on the following information up to and including the Statement of Directors shareholding requirements and share interests.
The figures set out in the table below are the actual amounts of salary or fees and bonus earned in the year to 31 December 2017.
The value of 2012 LTIP awards is the notional value at 31 December 2017, the date the awards vested, which is the figure we are required to publish.
The participants did not acquire their shares on that date and this value cannot be deemed to be the value the participant will receive.
The actual value for income tax purposes will be determined on the date the participant exercises their award, and the exercise date is at the choice of each individual participant until 31 December 2022 at the latest.
Since 31 December 2017, and as set out in the Remuneration Committee Chairmans statement, the Executive Directors have surrendered a total of 2.8m shares under the 2012 LTIP.
The detail of this surrender is set out on pages 62 to 64 and note 32.
As a result the actual salary paid to Dave Jenkinson, a member of the defined benefit pension scheme was reduced by 9% of his pensionable salary, which would have been the member rate of contribution to the scheme.
Jonathan Davie resigned from the Board on 14 December 2017.
Marion Sears and Nigel Mills 2017 fees include additional Committee Chair fees Senior Independent fees from 14 December 2017.
2016 figures are from 4 April 2016, the date Nigel Mills was appointed to the Board.
2017 figures are from 3 April 2017, the date Simon Litherland was appointed to the Board.
During the year no Director waived their entitlement to any emoluments.
The Executive Directors decided to reduce awards under the2012 LTIP in February 2018, details are set out on pages 62 to 64.
Additional information on the amounts which make up the Single Total Figure of Remuneration is set out below.
Benefits Benefits include fully financed cars or cash car allowance, private medical scheme membership, life assurance benefits, income protection scheme membership, professional subscriptions and some telephone costs.
Annual bonus 2017 Two financial and two non-financial metrics made up the performance condition for Executive Directors 2017 annual bonus.
The financial metrics were profit and cash generation measures, which make up to 50% and 40% of maximum bonus potential, respectively.
The non-financial metrics were a customer care measure, which makes up to 10% of maximum bonus and a health andsafety measure which can act as a downward modifier of up to 10% of bonus.
The profit performance condition for 2017 annual bonuses was again linked to the Groups profit before tax before exceptionals and goodwill impairment for the year the profit measure.
The cash generation performance condition did not change from the previous year and was the Group net cash inflow before Capital Return Plan and net land payments for the year the cash generation measure.

indd 70 09 03 2018 14:11 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 71 The Committee again included a customer care metric in the performance condition for annual bonus.
Customer care remains an important focus for the Board and the Committee considered it was important that part of the Executive Directors annual bonus target continue to be based on performance linked to that.
The measure chosen for 2017 was to achieve a minimum percentage of customers who would recommend Persimmon, as measured by the results of the Home Builders Federation HBF Customer Satisfaction Survey question, Would you recommend Persimmon to a friend?.
This survey is an independent measure of customer satisfaction for houses legally completed from October 2016 to September 2017, measured from survey responses published up to 9 February 2018.
The health and safety performance condition could reduce the total annual bonus payments if any to the Executive Directors by up to 10%, if in the view of the Committee the health and safety management and or performance of the Group is below the standard expected of a reputable market-leading housebuilder.
The Committee reviewed the Groups health and safety performance and agreed that the Executive Directors annual bonuses for 2017 should not be reduced for health and safety performance.
The target figures set for each part of the performance condition, and the extent to which they were achieved are set out below.
There is straight line vesting between the relevant target figures.
The maximum bonus payable is 200% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 150% of base salary for the other Executive Directors.

indd 71 07 03 2018 11:45 72 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION continued Long Term Incentive Plan awards vesting in 2017 The Executive Directors have outstanding awards under the 2012 LTIP, which have a performance condition based upon the return of 6.20 per share to shareholders under the Groups Capital Return Plan.
By 31 December 2017 the Group had made returns to shareholders of 4.85 per share, equal to 1.5bn.
Under the rules of the 2012 LTIP, as the relevant part of the performance condition has been met, 40% of the awards vested on 31 December 2017.
As set out in the Acting Chairmans Statement, the Board has announced Capital Return Plan payments of 235p per share in 2018 and it is expected that all outstanding awards will vest in July 2018, providing shareholders approve the final dividend of 110p at the forthcoming AGM.
In February 2018, the Executive Directors informed the Remuneration Committee of a series of decisions intended to reduce the scale of payments and extend the holding period under any second tranche.
Jeff Fairburn and Mike Killoran decided to reduce their overall entitlement by a number of shares equal to 50% of the shares to which they would become entitled on the second vesting.
Additionally they also decided to extend until 2021 the holding period applying to 50% of any shares under any second vest other than shares sold to cover tax liabilities.
Dave Jenkinson decided to reduce his overall entitlement by a number of shares equal to 50% of the shares subject to awards granted to him since being promoted to the Board to which he would become entitled on the second vesting.
In addition to the existing obligation to hold 50% of the shares from any second vest for 12 months, other than shares sold to cover tax liabilities, hedecided to extend until 2020 the holding period for 25% of such shares.
All three Executives have decided to cap the value of any future exercise of the remaining second vesting entitlement to a maximum value equal to 29 per share.
The regulatory value of the awards that vested on 31 December 2017 before the reduction described above is set out below and this information is required to be included in the Single Total Figure of Remuneration table.
This is a notional value and cannot be deemed to be the value the participant will actually receive when they exercise their award and acquire the shares.
Cumulative Cash Return targets Measurement Dates Achieved 1.70 per share or more by 31 December 2015 2.80 per share or more by 31 December 2017 3.90 per share or more by 31 December 2019 5.05 per share or more by 31 December 2020 6.20 per share or more by 31 December 2021 The initial exercise price of an option is reduced by an amount equal to the value of cash returns to shareholders made by the Company during the period from date of grant to the earlier of 31 December 2021 or the date of exercise of an option.
The total number of shares held under an option that could vest will be determined by reference to the fraction x 6.20, where x is the value of the Cumulative Cash Returns paid by the relevant Measurement Date.
In considering the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied, no options shall vest and become exercisable unless, in the opinion of the Committee, acting fairly and reasonably, the cash returns paid by the Company are financed out of retained earnings and the Company has an ungeared balance sheet at the relevant Measurement Date, except to take account of events and or circumstances which the Committee fairly and reasonably determines are appropriate the Underpin.
indd 72 07 03 2018 11:45 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 73 The Remuneration Committee has confirmed that 4.85 per share has been returned by the Group within the Underpin and therefore the Performance Condition has been met to 31 December 2019.
In alignment with the capital discipline at the core of the Groups long term strategy, on 26 February 2018 the Board determined that, we will net settle the 40% of options granted under the 2012 LTIP that vested on 31 December 2017.
Participants would sacrifice their interest in an appropriate number of shares issued in exchange for an equivalently valued cash payment being sufficient to allow the participants to meet their income tax and employee national insurance liabilities in respect of the exercise of their vested options.
The value of these liabilities will be determined by the Companys share price on the date participants choose to exercise their options together with the prevailing income tax and national insurance contribution rates at that time, see note 32.
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme SAYE The SAYE Scheme is an HMRC approved all employee savings related share option scheme.
Invitations are issued annually to all employees to apply for the grant of an option under the SAYE.
There are no performance conditions attached to options granted under the SAYE.
The options granted to the Executive Directors in 2014 became exercisable on 1 December 2017.
The value of the options which matured has been calculated on the difference between the market value of a Persimmon share on 1 December 2017, being 25.52 and the option exercise price of 10.80, multiplied by the number of shares under option.

Base salary from Percentage increase 1 January 2018 from 2017 Jeff Fairburn 675,270 Nil Dave Jenkinson 515,000 Nil Mike Killoran 511,775 Nil Annual bonus Taking into consideration the early vesting of awards under the 2012 LTIP, the Remuneration Committee has determined that the Executive Directors will not receive an annual bonus for the year ending 31 December 2018.
Although there will be no annual bonus, the Remuneration Committee has set performance targets in the normal way and also introduced strategic and personal objectives.
The performance targets for 2018 will be 70% financial and 30% non-financial, and the non-financial element will be split equally between customer care and personal and strategic objectives.
The targets are based on figures which are commercially sensitive, but they will be disclosed in next years Remuneration Report.
The bonus awards will be subject to robust clawback and malus provisions.
The Committee has determined that the maximum annual bonus potential should remain at 200% of base salary for Jeff Fairburn andat 150% of base salary for the other Executive Directors.
The Executive Directors have suggested and the Remuneration Committee has agreed, that the potential bonus that could have been earned by the Directors be calculated and any amount that would have been payable be distributed to staff excluding those participants in the 2012 LTIP and 2017 Performance Share Plan.
Pension and Pension Salary Supplement There is no change to pension benefits for 2018: current arrangements are as set out on page 73.
