Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Governance DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY This part of the Directors Remuneration Report sets out Sirius Minerals Directors Remuneration Policy the Policy which, subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 Annual General Meeting, shall take binding effect from the close of that meeting.
Remuneration arrangements entered into with Directors before the move from AIM to the Main Market do not form part of the forward looking Policy, but may be satisfied in accordance with their terms as referred to on page 85.
The principal aim of the Policy, which has been determined by the Remuneration Committee, is to align the interests of Executive Directors with the Companys strategic vision and the long-term creation of shareholder value.
The Policy is intended to remunerate our Executive Directors competitively and appropriately for effective delivery of this and allows them to share in this success and the value delivered to shareholders.

Recovery provisions apply, as referred to below.

A JOE award may also include the right to acquire the trustees interest in the shares for nil cost, so that the participant is entitled to the full value of the vested shares.
78 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Recovery provisions malus and clawback Bonus and LTIP awards are subject to the following recovery provisions: Malus: The bonus opportunity may be cancelled or reduced before payment and an LTIP award may be cancelled or reduced before vesting in the event of material error or misstatement of results, material failure of risk management, material misconduct by the Executive Director, material health and safety failure.
Clawback: For up to two years following the vesting of a bonus or an LTIP award, the bonus paid may be recovered and any deferred bonus award may be cancelled or reduced and the LTIP award may be cancelled or reduced ifithas not been realised or may be recovered in the event of material error or misstatement of results, material misconduct by the Executive Director, material health and safety failure.
Explanation of performance measures chosen In order that incentive remuneration is appropriately linked to the delivery of the Companys strategy and taking into account the stage of the Companys development, LTIP awards will typically be subject to performance conditions based on the delivery of operational milestones linked to the delivery of the Companys North Yorkshire polyhalite Project.
The Remuneration Committee may vary or substitute any performance measure if an event occurs which causes it to determine that it would be appropriate to do so including to take account of acquisitions or divestments, a material change in strategy or a change in prevailing market conditions, provided that any such variation or substitution is fair and reasonable and in the option of the Remuneration Committee the change would not make the measure less demanding than the original measure would have been but for the event in question.
If the Remuneration Committee were to make such a variation, an explanation would be given in the next Directors Remuneration Report.
Shareholding guidelines To align the interests of Executive Directors with those of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has adopted formal shareholding guidelines in accordance with which each Executive Director is required to build a shareholding equal to 200% of his or her annual base salary.
In accordance with the Policy table set out above, a post-vesting holding period applies to the LTIP awards until the holding is achieved.
Shares subject to awards which have vested but have not been realised and shares subject to any deferred bonus award count towards the guidelines on a net of assumed tax basis.
Operation of share plans The Remuneration Committee may amend the terms of awards and options under its share plans in accordance with the plan rules in the event of a variation of the Companys share capital or a demerger, special dividend or other similar event or otherwise in accordance with the rules of those plans.
The Remuneration Committee may operate any such plan in accordance with its rules.
Share awards granted under any such plan may be settled in cash, although the Remuneration Committee would only do so where the particular circumstances made this the appropriate course of action for example, where a regulatory reason prevented the delivery of shares.
Total remuneration annual cap For the reasons referred to in the statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, there is an overall annual total remuneration cap of 20 million for each Executive Director.
If the remuneration otherwise disclosable in the single figure table in the Directors Remuneration Report for a year would exceed this limit, the Remuneration Committee shall reduce variable pay as it considers appropriate.

80 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Policy for the remuneration of employees more generally The Group aims to provide a competitive remuneration package which is appropriate to promote the long-term success of the Company.
The Company intends to apply this policy fairly and consistently and does not intend topay more than is necessary to attract and motivate staff.
In respect of the Executive Directors, a greater proportion of the remuneration package is at risk and determined by reference to performance conditions.
A significant number of the Companys employees participate in LTIP awards in line with the Companys ethos of ensuring that incentives for the wider employee population remain aligned to the interests of shareholders.
Illustrations of application of the remuneration policy The following charts provide an illustration, for each of the Executive Directors, of the application for the 2018 financial year of the remuneration policy.
The charts show the split of remuneration between fixed pay i. e. base salary, benefits and employer pension contributions salary supplement, annual bonus and long term incentive pay.
The regulations require us to show remuneration on the basis of minimum remuneration, remuneration receivable for performance in line with Sirius Minerals expectations and maximum remuneration.
Reflecting our approach to LTIP awards and the intention to grant awards at the level of 500% of salary in 2018 subject to the exceptional performance target for delivering the first polyhalite significantly ahead of plan, we have shown both an ordinary maximum and a super stretch maximum which assumes the vesting of a 500% LTIP award.

Recruitment remuneration policy When hiring a new Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will typically align the remuneration package with the above Policy.
When determining appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Remuneration Committee may include other elements of pay which it considers are appropriate.
However, this discretion is capped and is subject to the principles and the limits referred to below.
Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the experience of the Executive Director being appointed.
This may include agreement on future increases up to a market rate, in line with increased experience and or responsibilities, subject to good performance, where it is considered appropriate.
Retirement benefits will be provided in line with the above Policy.
The Remuneration Committee will not offer non-performance related incentive payments for example a guaranteed sign-on bonus.
Other elements may be included in the following circumstances: an interim appointment being made to fill an Executive Director role on a short-term basis: if exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a Non-Executive Director takes on an executive function on a short-term basis: if an Executive Director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or long-term incentive award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance.
Subject to the limit on variable remuneration set out below, the quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may be transferred to the subsequent year so that reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis: and if the Director will be required to relocate in order to take up the position, it is the Companys policy to allow reasonable relocation, travel and subsistence payments.
Any such payments will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee may also alter the performance measures, performance period and vesting period, deferral period and holding period of the bonus or LTIP if the Remuneration Committee determines that the circumstances of the recruitment merit such alteration.
The rationale will be clearly explained in the next Directors Remuneration Report.
The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted excluding buyout awards as referred to below is 700% of salary, reflecting an annual bonus opportunity of up to 200% of salary and an LTIP grant of up to 500% of salary.
However, awards at these levels would only be made in the event of exceptional performance targets applying.
82 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 The Remuneration Committee may make payments or awards in respect of hiring an employee to buyout remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to the forfeited arrangements and the time over which they would have vested.
The Remuneration Committee will generally seek to structure buyout awards or payments on a comparable basis to the remuneration arrangements forfeited.
Any such payments or awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above.
Buyout awards will ordinarily be granted on the basis that they are subject to forfeiture or clawback in the event of departure within 12 months of joining Sirius Minerals, although the Remuneration Committee will retain discretion not to apply forfeiture or clawback in appropriate circumstances.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under Sirius Minerals existing share plans.
If necessary and subject to the limits referred to above, recruitment awards may be granted outside of these plans as permitted under the Listing Rules which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of an Executive Director.
Where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue in accordance with their terms.
Fees payable to a newly appointed Chairman or Non-Executive Director will be in line with the policy in place at the time of appointment.
Executive Directors service agreements and Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment The Companys policy is for Executive Directors to be employed on service agreements which, ordinarily, may be terminated on not more than six months notice by the Executive Director or the Company.
However, the Company reserves the right to offer a notice period of up to 12 months for any Executive Director appointed after the date on which this Policy becomes effective.
Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but serve under letters of appointment which may be terminated on three months notice by the Non-Executive Director or the Company.
Details of the service contracts, letters of appointment and notice periods for the current Directors are set out below.

Payments in lieu of Where a payment in lieu of notice is made this will include salary, benefits and pension contributions or a notice salary supplement until the end of the notice period that would otherwise have applied.
Alternatively, the Company may continue to provide the relevant benefits.
Bonus This will be reviewed on an individual basis and the decision whether or not to award a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon a number of factors including the circumstances of the Executive Directors departure and his or her contribution to the business during the bonus period in question.
Any bonus payment would typically be pro-rated for time in service to termination and paid at the usual time although the Remuneration Committee retains discretion to pay the bonus earlier in appropriate circumstances.
If bonus deferral would otherwise apply to any bonus for the year of termination or previous year, the Remuneration Committee may pay the full bonus earned in cash.
Any outstanding deferred bonus awards would typically continue other than in the event of summary dismissal, where the entitlement would lapse and vest at the originally anticipated date, although the Remuneration Committee retains discretion to release any such award at the date of cessation or some other date.
LTIP LTIP awards will vest if the participant is a good leaver to the extent determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account their assessment of performance relative to the performance condition and such other factors as they consider relevant, which may include the length of time from grant to cessation.
The Remuneration Committee shall determine whether awards vest at cessation or continue and can vest following satisfaction of the milestone, or on some other date.
For these purposes, good leaver reasons are death, injury, redundancy, agreed retirement and any other reason at the Remuneration Committees discretion.
If an Executive Director ceases employment with the Group after an award under the LTIP has vested but during a post-vesting holding period, the realised shares will, ordinarily, remain subject to the original holding period.
Other payments The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such obligation or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Directors office or employment.
Any such payments may include, but are not limited to, paying any fees for outplacement assistance and or the Directors legal and or professional advice fees in connection with his cessation of office or employment and or in respect of accrued holiday entitlement.
Where a buyout or other award is made in connection with recruitment, the leaver provisions would be determined at the time of the award.
In accordance with his service agreement entered into in January 2011, Chris Fraser is also entitled on termination by the Company to a minimum of one months base salary for every year of employment by the Company, pro-rated for any part year of service.
Change of control LTIP awards will vest on a change of control to the extent determined by the Remuneration Committee.
In determining the extent of vesting, the Remuneration Committee would have regard to the extent to which the performance measures had been satisfied, and other factors the Remuneration Committee considers relevant.
Any deferred bonus shares will vest on a change of control or other relevant event.
As described on page 83, the notice to which Chris Fraser is entitled to increases to 12 months in certain change of control situations.
84 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Non-Executive Directors The Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to compensation on termination of their appointment in excess of their fees for the notice period.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company The Remuneration Committee does not formally consult with employees as part of its process when determining Executive Director pay.
However, as noted in the Policy table on page 76, the level of salary increases of employees within the wider Group is considered when setting base salary for Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee is also kept informed of general decisions made in relation to employee pay and related issues.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views The Remuneration Committee believes that ongoing dialogue with major shareholders is of key importance.
During the financial year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with shareholders in relation to the Policy and our proposals have been finalised having regard to feedback received.

The Company is a constituent of this Index and as such it has been selected as an appropriate comparator group.
For the purposes of the graph, TSR has been calculated as the percentage change during the period in the market price of the shares, assuming that dividends are reinvested.
The graph shows the value, by 31 December 2017, of 100 invested in the Group over the period compared with 100 invested in the FTSE 250.

2 LTIP awards of 857,143 shares which vested in three tranches in 2014 and 2015 and 2016 were granted on 21 May 2013.
These awards were subject to continued employment only.
Therefore this LTIP has been included in the single figure table at grant based on the closing middle market share price on 21 May 2013 of 25.25 pence.
There were no other awards which vested in respect of a performance period ending in the five years to 31 December 2017.
94 Value Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 CEO pay increase in relation to all employees The table below sets out the percentage change in base salary, value of taxable benefits and bonus for the Chief Executive Officer compared with the average percentage change for employees representing the wider workforce.
Chief Executive Wider 1 Percentage change Officer workforce 2 Salary 32%1 3.5% 3 Taxable benefits -1% 11% Annual bonus 139% 28% 1 In order for the comparisons to be meaningful, the group of employees selected for the wider workforce comprised: 1 in relation to salary, those employees who were with the business in both 2016 and 2017 and, accordingly, were eligible for a salary review in 2017: 2 in relation to taxable benefits, those employees who were received taxable benefits in 2016 and those employees who received taxable benefits in 2017 other than benefits related to JOE awards, as described below : and 3 in relation to bonuses, those employees who were eligible for a bonus in both 2016 and 2017.
These groups have been selected in order to provide a meaningful comparison and so that remuneration between 2016 and 2017 can be viewed on a like-for-like basis.
2 Salary increase for the CEO is a consequence of the resetting of base salaries when the Company was admitted to the Main Market as explained in the salary and fees note to the single figure table on page 89.
3 Benefits provided to the CEO and to other employees who receive JOE awards include the payment by the Company of the income tax and employee National Insurance contributions due in respect of the award of JOE awards under the LTIP.
Because these benefits relate to the value of the long-term incentive awards granted to the CEO and other employees, they are excluded for the purposes of this analysis as, in the opinion of the Committee, their inclusion would not result in meaningful disclosure of the increase in the benefits.

However, the maximum bonus earned for 2018 may be increased up to 200% of salary if a successful stage 2 financing is achieved.
This recognises the critical importance and transformational impact of a successful stage2 financing.
Details of the bonus measures and targets for 2018, to the extent that they can be shared prospectively, and the weightings which apply to each element are provided below.
The Company will disclose further detail to explain how performance is assessed against each of these strategic goals on a retrospective basis in the 2018 Annual Report.
Any bonus earned in excess of 100% of salary will be deferred into shares for a period of two years.

This reflects the significant changes brought about bycommencement of construction during 2017, our ambitious goals for the Project through the next phase of development and the prospective construction over the next several years of a complex and large scale project andfirst mining of polyhalite.
This event is expected to be a seminal and unique achievement for the Company in itslifecycle.
The 2018 LTIP share grant consists of two elements: ordinary grants of 200% of salary for Chris Fraser and 175% for Thomas Staley and an exceptional stretch award to encourage rapid and early construction which, we believe, willresult in significant additional benefits to shareholders, potentially of many hundreds of millions of pounds.
This exceptional stretch award would be up to 300% of salary.
As set out in further detail below, the vesting of the 2018 LTIPawards will be based on the critical milestone of first polyhalite being extracted from the ore body.
Ordinary award Vesting of the ordinary award is linked to the delivery of the first polyhalite up to 200% of salary for Chris Fraser by 31 March 2022 for maximum vesting of the ordinary award.
