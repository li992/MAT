In relation to the PSP awards made in 2016 we removed the requirement for EPS growth to be above RPI increases as it was felt that RPI which is specific to the UK was no longer a relevant factor given the global nature of the Companys business.
The Committee retains the ability to adjust the EPS condition if events occur e. g. material acquisition and or divestment of a Group business which cause it to determine that the condition is no longer appropriate and amendment is required so that the condition achieves its original purpose and is not materially less difficult to satisfy.
