Differences in remuneration policy for executive directors compared to other employees There are differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for the executive directors and employees, which are necessary to reflect the different levels of responsibility and market practices.
The key difference is the increased emphasis on performancerelated pay in senior roles.
Lower maximum incentive pay opportunities apply below executive level, driven by market benchmarks and the relative impact of the role.
Only the most senior executives in the Group participate in the LTIP and the BSP as these plans are targeted on those individuals who have the greatest responsibility for Group performance.
Executive directors existing service contracts, and policy on loss of office The service contracts for David Hathorn and Andrew King provide for one years notice by either party.
They include pay in lieu of notice provisions which may be invoked at the discretion of the Group.
The payment in lieu of notice would comprise base salary, benefits and pension contributions for the notice period and an amount in compensation for annual bonus only for that part of the financial year the individual has worked.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 119 Peter Oswald was recruited, and is based, in Austria.
His service contract is required under Austrian law to be for a fixed period, which renewable fixed period expires on 30 April 2022.
However, the contract has also been structured as far as possible to conform to the accepted practice for directors in the UK, and can be terminated on one years notice by either party.
Prior to 2008, he did not have a notice period, and was entitled to receive compensation on termination equivalent to remuneration for the unexpired term of the fiveyear fixed term contract.
The committee re-negotiated this contract in 2008 to substantially reduce the Groups potential liabilities, and introduced a standard 12-month notice period, together with an accompanying lump sum payment on termination, which was necessary to facilitate the transition from the previous contract.
In the event of termination by Mondi, other than for cause, the current contract provides for payment of base salary, benefits and pension contribution in respect of the 12-month notice period and eligibility for annual bonus in respect of the period he has worked.
He would also be eligible for a lump sum amount calculated as 908,800 plus interest on this amount accrued at the Euribor interest rate for the period since 1 January 2008.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive director under the Groups share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the committee taking into account the individuals performance and the reasons for their departure good Ieaver status can be applied.
For good leavers, vesting of BSP awards that are not subject to performance conditions is accelerated to as soon as practical after employment termination.
LTIP awards remain subject to performance conditions measured over the original time period and are reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.
The committee has the discretion to disapply the application of performance conditions and or time pro-rating if it considers it appropriate to do so.
However, it is envisaged that this would only be applied in exceptional circumstances.
In determining whether an executive should be treated as a good Ieaver or not, the committee will take into account the performance of the individual and the reasons for their departure.
Notice periods for the executive directors who served during the period under review are as follows: Executive director Unexpired term notice period Peter Oswald A fixed term expiring on 30 April 2022 but terminable at any time on 12 months notice David Hathorn Terminable on 12 months notice Andrew King Terminable on 12 months notice A directors service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.
Service contracts for new appointments Normally, for any new executive director appointments, the Groups policy is that the service contracts should provide for one years notice by either party.
The contract would provide that, in the event of termination by the company, other than for cause, the executive would be eligible for: e payment of the base salary, pension contribution and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the 12-month notice period: e annual bonus only in respect of the period they have served, payable following the relevant performance year end and subject to the normal performance conditions for annual bonus: and e share-based awards they hold, subject to the plan rules, which include arrangements for pro-ration of LTIP awards and continued application of performance conditions.
The Group would seek to apply the principle of mitigation to the termination payment by, for example, making payments in instalments that can be reduced or ended if the former executive wishes to commence alternative employment during the payment period.
In exceptional circumstances, such as to secure for the Group the appointment of a highly talented and experienced executive in a market such as Germany or Austria where it is common for the most senior executives to have three-year or five-year fixed term contracts, the committee may need to offer a longer initial notice period that reduces progressively to one year over a set time period.
In such exceptional circumstances, the committee would seek to ensure that any special contract provisions are not more generous than is absolutely necessary to secure the appointment of such a highly talented individual.
The committee would also take account of the remuneration and contract features that the executive may be foregoing or relinquishing in order to join Mondi, in comparison with the overall remuneration package that Mondi is able to offer.
Mondi Group 120 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Directors remuneration policy Approach to remuneration for new executive director appointments The remuneration package for a newly appointed executive director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Groups approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.
The variable remuneration for a new executive director would be determined in the same way as for existing executive directors, and would be subject to the maximum limits on variable pay referred to in the policy table on pages 116 and 117.
For an internal appointment, any legacy pay elements awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according to their terms.
For internal and external appointments, the Group may meet certain relocation expenses, as appropriate.
For external appointments, the committee may also offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of Mondi and shareholders, to replace variable remuneration awards or arrangements that an individual has foregone in order to join the Group.
This includes the use of awards made under section 9.4.
Any such payments would take account of the details of the remuneration foregone including the nature, vesting dates and any performance requirements attached to that remuneration.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 121 The Group may reimburse the reasonable expenses of board directors that relate to their duties on behalf of Mondi including tax thereon if applicable.
The Group may also provide advice and assistance with board directors tax returns where these are impacted by the duties they undertake on behalf of Mondi.
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with Mondi Limited and Mondi plc for an initial period of three years.
In accordance with best practice, non-executive directors are subject to annual re-election at the Annual General Meetings.
Appointments may be terminated by either party with six months notice.
No compensation is payable on termination, other than accrued fees and expenses.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Groups remuneration policy for the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives is set taking appropriate account of remuneration and employment conditions of other colleagues in the Group.
The committee annually receives a report from management on pay practices across the Group, including salary levels and trends, collective bargaining outcomes and bonus participation.
At the time that salary increases are considered the committee additionally receives a report on the approach management proposes to adopt for general staff increases.
Both these reports are taken into account in the committees decisions about the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives.
The Group does not engage in formal consultation with employees on directors remuneration policy.
However, employees of the Group are encouraged to provide feedback on the Groups general employment policies.
In some countries where the Group operates, more formal consultation arrangements with employee representatives are in place relating to employment terms and conditions, in accordance with local custom and practice.
The Group also conducts periodic employee engagement surveys which gauge employees satisfaction with their working conditions.
The Mondi Boards are given feedback on these survey results.
Shareholder context The committee considers the views of shareholders in its deliberations about the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives, and consults directly with major shareholders when any material changes to policy are being considered.
In the event that either the remuneration policy or implementation resolutions receive a significant proportion of votes against, the committee will seek to further engage with shareholders to understand the reasons behind these votes and any particular concerns they may have.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Group to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports.
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.
Mondi Group 122 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Annual report on remuneration 2017 remuneration of directors This table reports executive and non-executive directors remuneration in accordance with UK reporting regulations applicable to financial reporting periods ending on or after 1 October 2013.

These expenses, and the cost of the grossed-up income tax amount payable to HMRC, amounted to 1,299,029 of the benefits total for 2017.
These expenses reflect the cost of stamp duty on the purchase of a UK property, estate agents commission on disposal of the South African property, return flights for purpose of house-hunting, school search and orientation and packing and removal of household effects to the UK 5 For 2017, the three-year performance cycle of the 2015 LTIP award ended on 31 December 2017.

No retrospective payments were made to past directors in respect of the period during which they served as directors and no payments were made to past directors for loss of office Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 123 Annual bonus Approach to disclosure of bonus targets Since its 2012 report, Mondi has disclosed the performance measures used for the annual bonus as well as outcomes against these measures.
In the 2015 and 2016 reports we went substantially further in providing details of the performance against safety objectives that were set for the year under review.
In the case of executives personal objectives we described the achievements of our executives against key focus areas, together with the ratings awarded to each executive.
In the case of financial performance, we provided retrospective disclosure of the financial bonus ranges and outcomes for the year prior to the year under review.
We additionally provided outline disclosure of financial bonus outcomes for the year under review.
The retrospective approach was adopted for reasons of commercial sensitivity.
Few of Mondis competitors are subject to the same disclosure obligations as Mondi and disclosure of the detailed financial bonus ranges for the year under review would place Mondi at a competitive disadvantage.
For its 2017 report Mondi has therefore again adopted this approach to bonus disclosure.
2017 bonus outcomes For the annual bonus in respect of 2017 performance, the performance measures and achievement levels were: BSP performance measures EBITDA ROCE Safety Personal Total Weight 30 30 10 30 100 Outcomes: Peter Oswald 20.7 17.3 0 25 63 David Hathorn 20.7 17.3 0 25 63 Andrew King 20.7 17.3 0 25 63 Retrospective disclosure of 2016 financial bonus ranges Financial performance was assessed against the EBITDA and ROCE ranges that were set for 2016.
The 2016 ranges and outcomes were: EBITDA Bonus outcome ROCE Bonus outcome m points % points Entry level 1,170 7.5 17.8% 7.5 Target 1,378 18.75 20.9% 18.75 Ceiling 1,585 30.0 24.0% 30.0 Outcome 1,366 18.1 20.3% 16.6 Full disclosure of the 2017 bonus ranges and outcomes will be included in the 2018 report.
Safety element of 2017 bonus Five points of the 10-point safety element was payable on the achievement of total recordable case rate TRCR targets.
If the achieved TRCR rate was 0.67 or better, then the entire 5 points would be earned.
One point would be earned for a TRCR of 0.75, with straight-line interpolation for TRCR performance between 0.67 and 0.75.
The other 5 points were payable if there were no fatalities within the Mondi Group.
If there is one fatality then these 5 points are forfeited.
If there are two fatalities during the year then the entire 10 points attributable to safety are forfeited.
Mondi continued to achieve an industry-leading TRCR performance.
The TRCR that was achieved for 2017 was 0.60.
As a result of the tragic and unacceptable fatalities of workers engaged in Mondis operations as reported on page 45, no payment has been made under the safety element.
Mondi Group 124 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Annual report on remuneration Personal objectives of executives for 2017 bonus Key objectives and achievements The executive directors share many key objectives and also have individual objectives that are specific to their roles.

For the period from 11 May 2017 to 31 December 2017, his maximum annual bonus was 165% of base salary, which is the level the remuneration committee has already proposed to shareholders for the chief executive officer role for 2017 2 This reflects a pro-rated amount for the period on the Boards Malus and clawback Under Mondis LTIP and BSP rules malus and clawback can be applied to awards made on or after 1 January 2011 if there has been a misstatement of financial results, or performance conditions that are relevant to the Plans, that had the effect that awards were larger than they would have been had such errors not been made.
Malus and clawback may at the committees discretion take the form of a demand for the participant to repay amounts to Mondi, a reduction of future bonus payments to the participant, and a reduction in the number of conditional share awards held by a participant.
Malus and clawback apply to misstatement of results or miscalculation of relevant performance conditions.
In the case of employment termination Mondi is able to cancel subsisting but unvested share awards, withhold payments that would otherwise be due to the participant, and where appropriate initiate legal proceedings to recover funds to which the Group is legally entitled.
The committee considered whether there were any circumstances in the year that would have required clawback and agreed that such circumstances did not exist.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 125 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Vesting of the 2015 awards The LTIP awards that were made in 2015, with a three-year performance period that ended on 31 December 2017, were reviewed by the committee in February against the equally weighted relative TSR and ROCE performance conditions.
As this exceeded the 10% to 16% ROCE target range for these awards, 100% of the shares attributable to the ROCE performance condition vested in March 2018.
Mondi plc achieved a TSR of 64%, and Mondi Limited 65.8%, over the performance period and Mondis rank within the TSR peer group was 7th.
This was above the median position required for vesting of 25% of the attributable shares, but below the upper quartile required for full vesting.
Based on the performance calculation performed for the committee by New Bridge Street, 45% of the shares attributable to this element vested.
In overall terms, 72.5% of the 2015 LTIP shares under award therefore vested and the remainder lapsed.
For Peter Oswald, this means that 55,035 of the 75,910 shares under award vested.
For Andrew King, 30,222 of the 41,685 Mondi plc shares under award vested and 13,040 of the 17,985 Mondi Limited shares.
No discretion was exercised by the committee in determining the vesting outcomes.
As shares vested on 8 March 2018, after the finalisation of this report, the average share price, and average exchange rates, over the last three months of the performance cycle were used to estimate the value for the purpose of the table on page 122.
The average share price was 18.45 for the Mondi plc LTIP awards and ZAR333.46 for the Mondi Limited LTIP awards.
Awards granted in 2017 The maximum award that can be made to any LTIP participant in any year under the policy approved at the 2017 AGMs is equal to 225% of base salary.
For 2017, the award made to Peter Oswald was 210% of base salary and the award made to Andrew King was 175% of base salary.
The award made to David Hathorn was 185% of base salary in line with the previous year.
As noted in last years annual report on remuneration, this will be pro-rated down for time served in accordance with shareholder guidelines, at the date he retires, and remain subject to the normal performance conditions and vesting dates.
For the LTIP awards made in 2017, the performance conditions are based on two performance measures of equal weight relative TSR and ROCE measured over a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2019.
The committee believes that this combination of metrics provides an appropriate means of aligning the operation of the LTIP with shareholders interests and the Groups business strategy.
The TSR performance condition is based on the Groups TSR relative to a group of competitor companies.
Since the 2013 LTIP awards, the following companies were selected: 4 1 2 Amcor Domtar Huhtamaki 2017 MeadWestvaco Sappi The Navigator Company Bemis DSSmith International Paper Mets Board Smurfit Kappa UPM 4 3 BillerudKorsns Holmen Mayr-Melnhof RPC 2017 Stora Enso WestRock 1 MeadWestvaco was included in LTIP awards until its merger with Rock Tenn in 2015 when it was, in accordance with committee practice, removed from the peer group for all subsisting awards 2 Portucel Soporcel Group rebranded in February 2016 as The Navigator Company 3 WestRock, the company that was formed by the merger of MeadWestvaco and Rock Tenn, has been included in the peer group for 2016 and subsequent awards 4 As highlighted last year, Huhtamaki and RPC were added to the peer group for 2017 and subsequent awards For the 50% of awards attributable to TSR: If the Groups TSR is below the median when ranked against the comparator group, this part of the award will lapse in full.
For TSR at the median, 25% of this part of the award i. e. 12.5% of the total award will vest, with a straightline progression to the upper quartile, at which point 100% of this part of the award i. e. 50% of the total award will vest.
For the 50% of awards attributable to ROCE: This part will lapse in full if ROCE is below 10%.
25% of this part of the award i. e. 12.5% of the total award will vest for achievement of ROCE of 10%, with a straight-line progression to full vesting of this part of the award for achievement of ROCE of 18% i. e. 50% of the total award.
For the 2018 awards, the peer group remains unchanged from 2017.

The award value shown in the 2016 Remuneration report was an estimate based on the average share price over the last three months of the performance cycle which was 16.06 for Mondi plc LTIP awards and ZAR276.73 for Mondi Limited LTIP awards.
The actual share price on vesting was 18.67 for Mondi plc LTIP awards and ZAR299.38 for Mondi Limited LTIP awards.
The total remuneration for 2016 has been restated on this basis 3 David Hathorns remuneration in 2011 included 3.9 million from the proceeds of a one-off, shareholder approved, share award under a Co-Investment Plan he participated in at the time of the Groups demerger from Anglo American plc in 2007.
Under this plan, he invested 1 million from his own funds in Mondi plc shares in August 2007.
He was eligible to receive a match of up to 250% of the number of investment shares based on a relative TSR performance measure over a four-year period.

Mondi Group 128 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Annual report on remuneration Statement of directors shareholdings and share interests Until the Annual General Meetings in May 2017, the CEO was required to achieve and maintain a shareholding equivalent to 150% of base salary, and other executive directors a shareholding of at least 100% of base salary.
As at 31 December 2016, all executive directors were compliant under this policy.
From the AGMs in 2017, the requirement is for all executive directors to build a holding of 200% of base salary, normally within a period of not more than five years from joining the Boards.
Previously compliant directors whose shareholdings do not meet the minimum requirements on 1 January of any year are normally required to achieve compliance by 31 December of the same year.
Under these increased shareholding requirements, Peter Oswald was compliant at 31 December 2017.
Andrew Kings shareholding requirement doubled from 100% of salary to 200% at the AGMs in 2017 and as at 31 December 2017 he was well on his way to achieving this new, much enhanced requirement, with a holding of 191% of his salary.
Further conditional shares under Mondis share plans BSP and LTIP will vest in March 2018 and executive directors will further increase their holdings at this time.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 133 Bonus and LTIP structure for 2018 Half of any bonus earned in respect of 2017 performance will be paid out in cash and the other half will be deferred for three years in conditional Mondi shares.
The bonus structure for 2018 is being modified in response to market trends and feedback received from shareholders.
A maximum of 70 points against 60 previously will be attributable to financial performance 35 on EBITDA and 35 on ROCE.
The portion that is payable on personal objectives will reduce correspondingly from 30 points to 20.
Safety will continue to contribute 10 points to the bonus.
LTIP awards that are made in 2018 will continue to have two performance conditions of equal weight TSR and ROCE, measured over a three-year performance period commencing on 1 January 2018.
For the 50% of the awards attributable to TSR: If the Groups TSR is below the median when ranked against the comparator group on page 125, this part of the award will lapse in full.
For TSR at the median, 25% of this part of the award i. e. 12.5% of the total award will vest, with a straight-line progression to the upper quartile, at which point 100% of this part of the award i. e. 50% of the total award will vest.
For the 50% of the awards attributable to ROCE: This part will lapse in full if ROCE is below 10%.
Non-executive directors fees Current non-executive directors fees, and increases proposed for implementation with effect from the date of the Annual General Meetings of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc to be held on 16 May 2018 are shown in the table below.
Increases of 2.5% are proposed, together with structural changes that serve to rationalise the fee structure and contain costs.
It is presently anticipated that the DLC sustainable development committee and the Mondi Limited social and ethics committee will always be chaired by the same person.
