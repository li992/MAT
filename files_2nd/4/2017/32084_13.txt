While such a review will not necessarily result in any change to the rates the committee believes that it is important that these reviews happen annually.
TheCommittee when considering fees favours modest annual increases rather than larger increase awarded at longerintervals.
The Committee has considered the 2017 annual fee review and has made the following changes: Chairman The annual fee for the Chairman has been increased from 40,000 to 41,500pa with effect from 1 May 2017.
The Committee believed that the fee for the role of the Chairman should be increased more than for the other Directors to reflect the continual extra work required.
Directors The annual fee for a Director has been increased from 26,000 to 26,800pa with effect from 1 May 2017.
The Committee considered the extra fee for carrying out the duties of Chairman of the Audit Committee and Senior Independent Director was still appropriate.
It was decided that the supplements will increase to 3,500 with effect from 1 May 2017.
This is the first increase in these supplements since they were set in 2010 at 3,000pa.
Other fees and incentives As the Company is an investment trust it has no executive Directors or employees and as all the Directors are Non-executive, it is considered inappropriate to have any long-term incentive schemes and the fees are not specifically related to the Directors performance, either individually or collectively.
