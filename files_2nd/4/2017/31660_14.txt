Non-executive Directors The Companys approach to non-executive Directors remuneration is set by the Board, with account taken of the time and responsibility involved in each role, including, where applicable, the chairmanship of Board committees.
There was no increase in fees for the 2017 financial year.
Following a review of allowances versus the market, the following increases were approved by the Board for the 2018 financial year.

Annual bonus The maximum bonus potential for the year ending 30 September 2018 will remain at 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% ofbasic salary for the other executive Directors.
Awards will be determined based on a combination of Group profit before tax weighted at 50%, strategic objectives weighted at 30% and an executives personal performance achievement level weighted at 20%.
The Company believes that this combination of financial, strategic and personal performance objectives reflects the strategic focus on Group profit while maintaining a measurement of progression against strategic milestones and personal contribution across key operational goals for the business.
The Committee will continue to run a thorough annual review of strategic and personal objectives to ensure they are measurable, robust and aligned with overall Group-wide objectives.
The Committee considers certain of the performance targets for the annual bonus to be commercially sensitive and, as such, they will be disclosed either at the end of the performance period or when they are no longer commercially sensitive.
The bonus for personal and or strategic performance is payable only if, in the opinion of the Committee, underlying financial and operating performance of the business is sufficient in that year to warrant payment.
25% of all paid bonuses will be deferred into shares for a period, under normal circumstances, of three years.
Long-term incentives The extent to which LTIP awards to be granted for the 2018 financial year will vest, will be dependent on two independent performance conditions: 25% determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return TSR and 75% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS, as follows: u the TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three-year period, relative to theconstituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to25% on a pro-rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance: and u the EPS element of an award will vest in full if cumulative EPS exceeds 440p over the three-year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 20% on a pro-rata basis if cumulative EPS is 382p over the three-year period and is reduced to nil if cumulative EPS over the period fails to exceed 382p.
