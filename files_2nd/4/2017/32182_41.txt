Annual Bonus Plan awards The policy of the Company is that the bonus paid to the Executive Directors is the same as the average of the bonus awards as a % of salary paid to all the Groups stores on achieving their targets during the course of the year.
It is an important part of the Groups culture that the Executive team are rewarded with the same level of annual bonus as the average for all staff.
In respect of the year under review, the Executive Directors performance was carefully reviewed by the Committee, in consultation with the Executive Chairman in respect of the other Executive Directors, and it was determined that the performance in the year by the Executive Directors results in a bonus of 10% of salary in line with the average bonus as a percentage of salary paid across the stores.
Overview of the staff bonus scheme The staff bonus scheme is designed, on a quarterly basis, to reward each store with a bonus of up to 25% of their quarterly salary, made up of the following four key elements set out below: Occupancy performance against target Each store is set a quarterly target for occupancy growth.
The weighting of the contribution of these metrics to the bonus varies based on store occupancy, with higher occupied stores having a lower weighting towards their performance against their occupancy target.
The bonus awarded to each store increases as the store moves further ahead of target.
No bonus is awarded if the store fails to meet its target.
The individual store targets have not been disclosed as it would be impractical and commercially sensitive to disclose the targets for every one of our 73 stores in this report.
However following feedback received from our shareholders on last years report to increase the disclosure around the annual bonus, we have shown the average annual distribution of performance against target for each of the bonus measures across our stores and the corresponding average pay-out as a percentage of salary which directly corresponds to the bonus percentage pay-out for the Executive Directors.
