65 | Corporate Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 2017 ESIP Annual performance element PBT element: Successful execution of our strategy in 2017 resulted in strong PBT performance, which was significantly above internal and external expectations at the start of the year when targets were set and has resulted in a payment for this element of 100% of maximum.
To ensure no benefit is received from favourable foreign exchange movements, the actual PBT is measured at constant exchange rates.
How the PBT targets were set: Targets were set for 2017 taking account of internal goals, planned investments, and broker forecasts and the business outlook at the time targets were considered.
In the final quarter 2016 when targets were being considered, the business outlook for the recruitment sector was negatively affected by a very uncertain political and economic environment following the EU referendum result, and concerns about the potential impact of US elections in November 2016 and forthcoming elections in France and The Netherlands in spring 2017.
During the course of 2017 some of the risks and uncertainties envisaged did not materialise to the extent expected, or were mitigated.
The UK declined by only 3.8%, which was lower than our expectation at the beginning of the year.
In markets such as France, China and the US, we saw far stronger growth than anticipated as investments we made into additional capabilities delivered results ahead of plan.
There has also been a significant upwards shift in earnings consensus forecasts for 2017, not only for PageGroup, but for the majority of PageGroups competitors.
Performance expectations for the sector have significantly improved during the course of 2017.
It is important to consider PageGroups 2017 targets in the light of these changes.
Strategic element Strategic objectives for the year included growing revenue in Large, High Potential Markets, successfully executing the Shared Service Centre programme and embedding a culture of innovation across the Group.
Strong performance was delivered throughout 2017 in all these areas.
Fee earners and directors in Large, High Potential Markets increased by 22.7%, and in particular Large, High Potential Markets growth was 14.8% in constant currencies.
The SSC programme was successfully executed.
An innovation group was created to prioritise the adoption of innovations across the business and resulted in the assessment of 288 ideas of which 25 were piloted.
Personal element Personal objectives covered the development of a Senior Leadership programme to facilitate succession planning: progress on talent development: and continuing to further our diversity agenda.
During the year, a Senior Leadership programme was successfully launched to ensure development of potential successors to the Board.
In addition, a new Global Talent Review is being developed.
Commitment to gender diversity was demonstrated by the improved progress of women in director roles and the increased women in the succession planning process.
Other personal objectives covered risk management and internal controls: cost management, financial and strategic information: and tax and treasury management.
Further disclosure can be found on pages 67 to 68.
Long-term trailing performance element: In 2017, this element was based on targets for 2017 EPS and gross profit growth relative to comparators.
EPS element: Over 2017, PageGroup has delivered strong performance through the implementation of efficiency measures and driving growth in our key markets.
As a result, we have delivered 2017 EPS of 26.5p, which represents year-on-year growth of 14.7% and three-year growth of 13.3% per annum.
26.5p is above the stretch performance level set at the beginning of the year.
Although not a metric used in the ESIP, the Company also achieved total shareholder return of 26% for the year, exceeding the FTSE All-share by 13 percentage points.
How the targets were set: Targets for EPS were set at the start of the year taking account of consensus expectations at that time.
At the start of 2017, the market outlook for the year was very challenging: the Committee set a wide range for the ESIP which would take into account the high level of market uncertainty.
The stretch was set at 25p, more than 4p above consensus.
The threshold target was set at 19p.
The prevailing market consensus of approximately 20.9p, which represented a three-year growth of around 4.7% per annum, was towards the bottom of this range.
The EPS range that was set represented a target cumulative three-year growth range of 7% to 12% per annum, if measured on the same cumulative basis as for the legacy LTIP.
Corporate Governance | 66 Directors Remuneration Report Relative Gross Profit element: PageGroup delivered strong gross profit growth of 9.8% in 2017.
This was above the upper quartile of the peer group and resulted in this element being paid in full.

These awards were subject to EPS 62.5% of the award, Relative Gross Profit 12.5% of the award and Strategic targets 25% of the award, measured over a three-year period.
Cumulative EPS over the 3-year period was 70.9p compared to a threshold level of 66p and a stretch of 87p.
As a result, 42.5% of the EPS element vested.
Strong gross profit performance over the three-year performance period was above upper quartile compared to the comparator group and resulted in 100% of this element vesting, whilst progress against our long-term strategic objectives resulted in 65% of that element vesting for Steve Ingham and 67.5% of that element vesting for Kelvin Stagg.
Taking into account the weightings of each performance measure, the overall LTIP vesting outcome was 55.35% for Steve Ingham, and 55.98% for Kelvin Stagg.
This resulted in 117,017 and 47,130 shares vesting to Steve Ingham and Kelvin Stagg respectively.

The Directors Remuneration Report has been approved by the Board of Directors.
Signed on behalf of the Board of Directors Danuta Gray Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 6 March 2018 Corporate Governance | 76 Directors Remuneration Report Directors' Remuneration Policy PageGroup is a global business that operates in a cyclical industry in which the retention and ongoing motivation of Executives and management continuity is critical to the success of the Company.
As a result, the Directors Remuneration Policy set out in this report has been designed to encourage long-term decision making, to avoid undue volatility in remuneration outcomes, and to act as an effective retention tool during market downturns.
The Remuneration Policy set out below was approved by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 8 June 2017 and became effective from that date.
This new policy replaced the Annual Bonus and LTIP with a single plan, the Executive Single Incentive Plan ESIP but did not increase the maximum total quantum available to executives.
It simplified remuneration: introduced a single balanced scorecard: incorporated deferral of a significant portion of any award: introduced post-vesting holding periods on all vesting shares for executives who have not met the shareholding requirement: maintained both annual and longer-term performance measurement: and results in simpler disclosure of remuneration outcomes.
There are no other new components in the remuneration policy.
