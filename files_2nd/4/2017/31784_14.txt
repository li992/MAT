2.19 REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EMPLOYEES Our employees are a key component of the Companys performance and our overall reward strategy aims to support this.
When considering remuneration arrangements for executive directors and senior management, the Committee takes into account the pay and conditions of employees across the Group.
The Committee does not formally consult with employees on remuneration policy but the Committee receives updates on pay and conditions, including the impact of flexible working conditions family friendly policies.
Employees are invited to participate in the annual Engagement Survey where their views on all aspects of working conditions can be collected and shared with the Committee and the Board.
The Company is proud of its long history of being regarded as a responsible and respected employer and regularly reviews the overall structure of pay practices across the Group and the wider retail sector to ensure it remains competitive and is able to retain and attract employees.
All employees are entitled to base salary and benefits, including pension and staff discount.
Eligible employees are able to participate in the Companys Sharesave plan and thereby become shareholders in the Company.
Participation in a pension plan is offered to all employees on a contributory basis and following auto-enrolment, we now have over 6,300 employees in our pension plans.

THE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY: EXTRACT The Directors remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 January 2016 and applies from that date.
The Remuneration Policy table is set out below for information only.
The full Directors remuneration policy is set out on pages 37 to 44 of the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts which is available in the investor relations section of the Companys website: www.

increases awarded to employees throughout the Group.
Base salaries are benchmarked against both FTSE 250 companies and other leading retailers.
While the Committee applies judgement rather than setting salaries by reference to a fixed percentile position, its general approach is to constrain base salaries to a median or lower level.
While the Committees general approach is to keep salaries to a relatively low level, and, in the normal course, would not expect salary increases to be higher than the average for other head office staff, given the need for a formal cap, the Committee has limited the maximum salary which it may award to 110 per cent of the median of salaries of CEOs in the top half of FTSE 250 companies even though, in practice, the Committee would normally seek to keep it below the median of this benchmark.
