46 DIRECTORS REPORT 2017 18 THE YEAR AHEAD In arriving at the proposed base salaries payable for 2017 18, the Remuneration Committee has proposed a 1.5% increase in basic salaries of the Executive Directors.
This is consistent with the approach to salary increases for employees across the Group where a 1.5% increase has been applied, subject to individual objectives being met, and except in cases of exceptional performance, changes in roles or responsibilities, or promotion.
The wider employee population, excluding the Executive Directors, may also benefit from a further increase in base salary of up to 1.5% at the half subject to profit targets being met.
Independent benchmarking reports into the remuneration packages of the Non-Executive Directors, the Executive Directors and senior management population were conducted during the year.
The reports confirmed that the Groups policy of achieving total remuneration at the targeted median level was being met for Executive Directors and senior management, and that no further adjustment beyond the general increase to base salaries proposed above was required.
Remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors was found to be below median, and further increases will be made effective from 1 April 2017 to bring their salaries in line with the targeted median level that the Groups remuneration policy aims to deliver.
Further details are provided in the annual report on remuneration in part C. IN CONCLUSION The annual report on remuneration provides further details and the Directors Remuneration Policy sets out how we are continuously building for the future.
I would like to thank you for your support in approving the outgoing remuneration policy and hope that we can rely on your vote in favour of the new Directors Remuneration Report at this years Annual General Meeting.

50 DIRECTORS REPORT NOTES TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS POLICY TABLE Annual bonus Profit targets are set by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the financial year by reference to internal budgets and taking account of consensus market expectations for profit before tax and exceptional non-recurring items.
Market expectations for profit are considered a key measure of business performance for our shareholders.
The funds available for payment of the annual bonus are determined by the achievement of profit before tax, annual bonus and exceptional nonrecurring items in a financial period in excess of the target.
The maximum bonus payable to staff is capped as a percentage of base salary which varies according to individual contracts.
The maximum annual bonus payable to an Executive Director is capped at 100% of base salary.
LTIPs In arriving at the performance criteria for the 2013 LTIP, the comparator group used for benchmarking purposes consisted of listed companies in the retail sector and other companies with similar enterprise value to Ted Baker.
This scheme was introduced in July 2013 for Executive Directors and other senior executives across the Group.
The criteria used to measure performance are growth targets based on adjusted profit before tax per share over the performance period and share price growth over the award period.
The profit per share growth targets were set following consideration of consensus market analyst expectations and the share price growth target was agreed in consultation between the Remuneration Committee and shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee felt that these criteria were appropriate for the Group in view of its investment in expansion and should encourage management to focus on longer-term profitable growth.
The performance criteria were reviewed in the period and deemed to remain appropriate for the Group in the context of its current strategy.
The share price growth target has been favoured over a TSR-based measure because the unique profile of the Groups business means that a readily comparable TSR benchmark was not available.
A commitment has, however, been made to apply the existing dividend policy consistently.
