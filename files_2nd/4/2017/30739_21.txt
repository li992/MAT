The aggregate gain made by the Directors under the LTIP during the year was nil.
4 Mary Waldner left the group on 16 March 2016, and therefore was not eligible for a bonus in respect of 2016 performance.
Annual bonus for year under review Audited Annual bonuses in relation to 2017 were based upon the achievement of a sliding scale of underlying profit before tax and operating cash flow targets, as well as individual strategic objectives.
Financial targets were derived from the annual budgets approved by the Board.

Profit and cash are two of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured.
Please refer to page 20 for details.
The bonus targets set by the Committee for 2017 were: a maximum of 28.8% of salary subject to the achievement of 123.0m underlying profit before tax : and a maximum of 86.2% of salary subject to achieving an underlying operating cash flow of 120.9m and the Committee exercising its discretion on movements in working capital to ensure working capital management throughout the financial year was in the short and long-term interests of the Company.
The remaining 10% of the bonus potential reflected strategic goals.
The Committee assessed the achievement of performance against each target as follows: Actual Bonus Threshold Maximum achieved payable 000 000 000 % Underlying profit before tax 110,700 123,000 110,002 0% Operating cash flow 67,300 120,900 116,507 0% Operating cash flow is payable only if the profit element achieves threshold and therefore no bonus is payable for this element.
Director Strategic goals Amitabh Sharma Successful implementation of CSS and PCS ERP systems in accordance with S3 strategy Mark Anderson Achieve a book to bill of 850.8m excluding acquisitions and divestments In addition, the Committee assessed performance against the strategic goals which were based on the following: The Committee determined that bonuses of 10% of salary max 10% would be payable to Amitabh Sharma.
However, in assessing the strategic goals, the Committee retained discretion not to make a payment if it considered that Ultras financial performance was unsatisfactory or there was an exceptional negative event during or just after the relevant financial year.
The Committee has considered whether an annual bonus payment, in the context of the Companys challenging year is appropriate.
The Committee has determined that no bonus will be paid to the Group Finance Director or Mark Anderson who was eligible for a bonus, pro-rata for the period worked.
