Remuneration Policy The determination of the Directors' fees is a matter dealt with by the RNC and the Board.
The RNC considers the remuneration policy annually to ensure that it remains appropriately positioned and takes into account any expected changes in time commitments.
Directors will review the fees paid to the boards of directors of similar investment companies.
No Director is to be involved in decisions relating to individual aspects of his or her own remuneration, however the Board as a whole sets the level of directors fees.
No Director has a service contract with the Company and Directors appointments may be terminated at any time by one month s written notice with no compensation payable at termination.
The Company's policy is for the Directors to be remunerated in the form of fees, payable quarterly in arrears.
No Director has any entitlement to a pension, and the Company has not awarded any share options or long-term performance incentives to any of the Directors.
No element of the Directors remuneration is perfor ance related.
Directors are authorised to claim reasonable expenses from the Company in relation to the performance of their duties.
38 | NB GLOBAL FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND LIMITED GOVERNANCE | Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration Policy continued The Company s policy is that the fees payable to the Directors should reflect the time commitment required by the Board on the Companys affairs and the level of responsibility borne by the Directors and should be sufficient to enable high calibre candidates to be recruited and be comparable to those paid by similar companies.
It is not considered appropriate that directors remuneration should be performance related, and none of the directors are eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, longterm incentive schemes or other benefits in respect of their services as non-executive directors of the Company.
During the year ended 2017, the policy was for the Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the other Committees to be paid a higher fee than the other Directors in recognition of their more onerous roles and more time spent.
The Board may amend the level of remuneration paid within the limits of the Companys Articles.
The Companys Articles limit the aggregate fees payable to the Board of Directors to a total of 500,000 per annum.
The Chairman of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee may consult with principal shareholders of the Company should it be proposed to exceed the aggregate limit.
