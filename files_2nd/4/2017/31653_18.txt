Directors Remuneration Policy This Policy describes the policies, principles and structures that guide the Remuneration Committees decision making process in the area of executive remuneration.
The Policy was approved by the shareholders at the 2017 AGM and will apply for a period of three years, unless a revised policy is proposed to shareholders before the end of this period.
Remuneration principles and objectives The primary objectives of the Policy are: To attract, retain and motivate talented Directors and senior management of the calibre required to manage the business successfully, whilst seeking to avoid paying more than is necessary to meet this objective.
To motivate and reward good performance.
To meet relevant regulatory requirements, including the requirements of the FCA Remuneration Code so far as these apply to the Group.
The main principles of the Policy are: To ensure that total remuneration is set at a level that is market competitive by benchmarking against relevant external comparators, taking account of size, complexity and sector, and to ensure that the overall package takes account of market practice.
To maintain appropriate proportions of fixed and performance related pay, to help to drive performance over the short and longer term, maintain a flexible cost base, and avoid creating incentives for excessive risk taking.
To align incentive plans with the business strategy, prudent risk management and shareholder interests.
To achieve consistency with the general remuneration philosophy applied to the Groups employees as a whole.

How the views of shareholders are taken into account The Remuneration Committee regularly compares the Policy with shareholder guidelines and takes account of the results of shareholder votes on remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee Chairman will consult with major investors ahead of any material changes to the Policy and, along with the Company Secretary, is available to meet with institutional shareholders to discuss any of the policy related disclosures or outcomes contained in this Directors Remuneration Report.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years Remuneration Report and Remuneration Policy are provided on page 64.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group A consistent remuneration philosophy for employees is applied at all levels and the aggregate rate of base salary increase for all employees is one of the factors considered when determining increases in fixed pay for Directors.
All employees are eligible for discretionary performance-related annual bonus and the principle of bonus deferral applies to annual bonuses for employees whose bonuses exceed certain thresholds.
A formal employee consultation on remuneration is not operated: however, employees are able to provide direct feedback on the Groups remuneration policies to their managers or the Human Resources department and as part of an annual employee engagement survey.
The Group Human Resources Director is a standing attendee at Remuneration Committee meetings and presents regular reports on people strategy, including the effectiveness of the Groups remuneration policies and how they are viewed by employees.
co. uk Directors Remuneration Report continued Fixed ratios between the total remuneration levels of different roles in the Group are not applied, as this would prevent us from recruiting and retaining the necessary talent in a highly competitive employment market.
Benchmarking The Remuneration Committee takes account of market benchmark data when setting total remuneration packages for Executive Directors and comparisons are made with other FTSE listed companies of similar size and business profile to the Group.
Practices in the wealth management sector and other related sectors are also considered.
Benchmark data is used as a reference point, alongside other factors such as the individuals role, experience and performance, rather than as a direct determinant of pay levels.
Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees The approach to remuneration for the Executive Directors is generally consistent with that for employees across the Group as a whole.
However, there are some differences which the Remuneration Committee believes are necessary to reflect the different responsibilities of employees across the Group, and the need to recruit, retain and motivate employees in a variety of roles.
For example, below Executive Director level, the portion of annual variable pay that is deferred is structured differently and is capped at one-third rather than the two-thirds deferral that applies to Executive Directors.
Awards of market purchased shares are made to selected individuals from time to time, excluding Executive Directors, which vest subject to continued service, to recognise individuals value to the Group and to create further alignment with shareholders.
External non-executive director positions Executive Directors are permitted to serve as non-executive directors of other companies, on the grounds that this can help to broaden the skills and experience of the Director, provided there is no competition with the Groups business activities and where these duties do not interfere with the individuals ability to perform his duties for the Group.
The number of external directorships an Executive Director can hold is limited to two non-executive directorships.
Where an outside appointment is accepted in furtherance of the Groups business, any fees received are remitted to the Group.
If the appointment is not connected to the Groups business, the Executive Director is entitled to retain any fees received.
Approach to remuneration for new Executive Director appointments The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms and maximum levels of the Groups approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.
The Committee may also offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders, for the purpose of replacing awards or potential foreseeable earnings which are forgone by the individual on becoming an Executive Director.
This includes the use of awards made under 9.4.
In considering any such payments the Remuneration Committee would take account of the amount of remuneration forgone and the nature, vesting dates and any performance requirements attached to the remuneration forgone.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments and the rationale for these.
For an internal appointment, any deferred pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may be permitted to continue where this is considered to be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders.
For external and internal appointments, the Group may meet certain relocation expenses as appropriate.
Service contracts and loss of office payments Service contracts normally continue until the Executive Directors agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree.
The service contracts contain provision for early termination.
In summary, the contractual provisions are: Provision Detailed terms Notice period Six months Termination payment in the event of Total fixed pay in respect of the unexpired period of contractual notice, in addition to termination by the Company without due any amounts to which they are statutorily entitled.
In certain cases, the Committee notice may also consider a discretionary award of annual variable pay, subject to performance, in respect of the portion of any financial year that the individual has been working with the Group, although not for the period of any payment in lieu of notice or garden leave.
Change of control Same terms as above on termination.
Brewin Dolphin 68 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information The Group has power to enter into settlement agreements with executives and to pay compensation to settle potential legal claims.
Any outstanding share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Groups LTIP or other share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, disability, redundancy, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee taking into account the individuals performance and the reasons for their departure, good leaver status can be applied.
In such cases, the normal practice, unless there are exceptional circumstances, is for any LTIP awards held to be pro-rated for the period of the performance period that has expired, and the performance conditions would continue to apply.
Share awards under the DPSP will vest in full on the original vesting schedule.
An Executive Directors service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, the Directors Remuneration Policy includes authority for the Group to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous Remuneration Reports.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the implementation section of this report as they arise.
