British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2017 75 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT: ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION How we intend to apply our Remuneration Policy during the year commencing 1 April 2017 The following pages set out how the Committee intends to apply the Remuneration Policy during the coming year.
Executive Directors Remuneration Basic salaries Basic salaries have been set at the following unchanged levels for the year commencing 1 April 2017.
Basic salary Director Chris Grigg 840,000 Lucinda Bell 493,000 Charles Maudsley 446,250 Tim Roberts 446,250 Annual Incentive awards The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors remains at 150% of salary.
The performance measures for the Annual Incentive awards have been selected to reflect a range of quantitative and qualitative goals that support the Companys key strategic objectives.
The performance measures and weightings for the year commencing 1 April 2017 will be as follows: Proportion of annual incentive as a percentage Measure of maximum opportunity Quantitative measures 70% Total property return relative to IPD sector reweighted 42% Profit growth relative to budget 28% Qualitative measures 20% Right Places Progress on key projects including developments 5% Customer Orientation Company reputation with all stakeholders 5% Capital Efficiency Execution of targeted acquisitions and disposals Progress on strengthening the dividend 5% Expert People Promoting an inclusive, performance driven culture 5% Individual objectives Performance against individual success factors 10% The Committee has set targets for the quantitative measures and will disclose these in the 2018 Remuneration Report as they are felt to be commercially sensitive.
In assessing how the Executive Directors performed during the year commencing 1 April 2017, the Committee will take into account their performance against all of the measures and make an assessment in the round to ensure that performance warrants the level of award determined by the table above.
During the year, the Committee considered whether the current Investment Property Databank IPD benchmarks against which the performance of annual and long-term incentive awards is assessed were the most appropriate measures.
Following discussion with the Committees adviser, management and our own deliberations, the Committee agreed that the sector weighted IPD March Annual Universe benchmark which includes sales, acquisitions and developments and so takes into account active asset management as well as being a more representative peer group, would be most suitable.
As a result of this decision, from 1 April 2017, the disclosed performance against IPD metrics for the annual incentive plan will be based on IPD estimates.
These estimates will be adjusted once the IPD March Annual Universe data becomes available.
No annual incentive payments will be made, or LTIP awards granted, to Executive Directors until the IPD March Annual Universe data is available and the final out-turn known.
The final awards under the annual incentive plan will be detailed in the next Remuneration Report.
76 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Long-Term incentive awards The first LTIP award under the new Remuneration Policy will be made to Executive Directors during the year commencing 1 April 2017.
It is anticipated that the grant size of LTIP awards to be made in the year commencing 1 April 2017 will be 250% of salary for each Executive Director.
This is below the maximum available under the policy of 300% of salary approved by shareholders last year.
The performance measures that apply to this, and any future, LTIP award will be as follows: Measure Link to strategy Measured relative to Weighting Total Property Return TPR The TPR measure is designed to TPR performance will be assessed against the 40% The change in capital value, link reward to strong performance performance of an IPD benchmark.

Performance against the LTIP measures will be assessed over a period of three years.

If performance against a measure is equal to the median, 20% of the proportion attached to that measure will vest and if performance is below median the proportion attached to that measure will lapse.
There will be straight-line vesting between median and upper quartile performance for each measure.

Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP The awards granted to Executive Directors on 23 June 2014, and which will vest on 23 June 2017, were subject to two equally weighted performance conditions over the three year period to 31 March 2017.
The first measured British Lands TPR relative to the funds in the December IPD UK Annual Property Index the Index, while the second measured TAR relative to a comparator group of British Land and 16 other property companies.
The TPR element is expected to vest at 0% based on British Lands adjusted TPR of 10.7% compared to the funds in the Index of 11.9%.
The TAR element is expected to vest at 0%.
The actual vesting rate of the TAR element can only be calculated once results have been published by all of the companies within the comparator group.
The actual percentage vesting will be confirmed by the Committee in due course and included in the 2018 Remuneration Report.

These performance conditions are equally weighted.
The MSP Matching awards will vest on 30 June 2017.
Aon Hewitt has confirmed that the TSR element of the award will not vest as British Lands TSR performance over the period was 1.5% compared to a median of 12.7% for the comparator group.
The GIG part is expected to vest at 100% as British Lands annualised GIG over the period is expected to exceed the growth of the Universe by more than the upper hurdle of 1.5%.
As a result, 50% of the MSP Matching awards granted in June 2014 is expected to vest.
As disclosed for the 2014 LTIP above, the actual percentage vesting will be confirmed by the Committee and included in the 2018 Remuneration Report.

At grant each Director can indicate a preference as to the proportion of the award that they wish to receive as either performance shares or market value options.
The share price used to determine the face value of performance shares and the fair value of options, and thereby the number of performance shares or options awarded, is the average over the three dealing days immediately prior to the day of award.
For the award granted on 22 June 2016, this share price was 730.5 pence.

Shareholding guidelines The minimum shareholding guidelines require Executive Directors to hold ordinary shares with a value equal to a set percentage of salary.
There is no set timescale for Executive Director to reach the prescribed target but they are expected to retain net shares received on the vesting of long term incentive awards until the target is achieved.
Shares that count towards the holding guideline are unfettered and beneficially owned by the Executive Directors and their connected persons.
Deferred annual incentive shares, MSP Bonus Shares, SIP matching, dividend and free shares and all unvested awards do not count towards the requirement.
The guideline shareholdings for the year commencing 1 April 2017 are shown below: Unfettered Guideline as holding as Total holding as percentage Unfettered percentage of Total a percentage of basic Guideline holding at basic salary at shareholding at of basic salary at 1 Executive Director salary holding 31 March 2017 31 March 2017 31 March 2017 31 March 2017 Chris Grigg 225% 309,836 1,176,870 855% 1,257,368 913% Lucinda Bell 150% 121,230 186,806 231% 226,098 280% Charles Maudsley 150% 109,734 190,589 261% 230,383 315% Tim Roberts 150% 109,734 203,290 278% 244,714 335% 1 Calculated on a share price of 610 pence on 31 March 2017 2 See Directors shareholdings table above which include MSP Bonus Shares and all shares held in the SIP.
The shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors were last increased with effect from 1 April 2015 when the holding requirement for each Director was increased by 25% of basic salary.
The Committee continues to review the guidelines and the Directors shareholdings.
Although there are no shareholding guidelines for Non-Executive Directors, they are each encouraged to hold shares in British Land.
The Company facilitates this by offering Non-Executive Directors the ability to purchase shares quarterly using their post-tax fees.
During the year ended 31 March 2017, Lynn Gladden, William Jackson, Tim Score, Lord Turnbull and Laura Wade-Gery have each received shares in full or part satisfaction of their Non-Executive Directors fees.

The graph shows how the total return on a 100 investment in the Company made on 1 April 2009, would have changed over the eight year period measured, compared with the total return on a 100 300 investment in the FTSE REIT Total Return Index.
The FTSE REIT Total Return Index has been selected as a suitable comparator because it is the index in which British Lands shares are classified.
The base point, required by the regulations governing Remuneration 200 Report disclosures, was close to the bottom of the property cycle at 1 April 2009.
Since British Lands share price had not fallen as much as the average share price of the FTSE REITs Sector at that time a higher base point for subsequent growth was set.
