So, in the current stage of the property cycle where asset values are rising in our sector, 87 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 ANNUAL REMUNERATION REPORT The following section provides details of how the Companys Remuneration Policy was applied during the financial year ended 31 December 2017.
Single year variable Bonus cash including DSBP The single year variable amount includes the cash Bonus payable and monetary value of the shares awarded under the DSBP.
In accordance with the Remuneration Policy, 50 per cent of any Bonus earned in 2017 will be deferred into shares under the DSBP.
See Chart 3 for details of the 2017 Bonus payment.
As the MSCI-IPD Benchmark data was not available at the date of publication of the 2016 Annual Report, the 2016 Bonus payments disclosed last year were based on an estimate of 100 per cent of the TPR element.
The TPR element has since been confirmed at 100 per cent and accordingly no adjustment has been made to the 2016 figure.
Multiple year variable LTIP The outturn for the 2014 LTIP vesting in 2018 has been estimated at 100 per cent and the vesting share price has been estimated at 552.16 pence, based on the three-month average share price ending 31 December 2017.
For further information see page 94.
In the 2016 Annual Report the estimated share price for the 2013 LTIP, which vested in 2017, was 432.3 pence, and the figure in the above table has been updated to reflect the actual vesting share price of 540.5 pence.
Following the completion of the Rights Issue in March 2017, shares under award were adjusted by a factor of 1.046, because they were unable to participate in the Rights Issue.
The figure in the table has been further updated to reflect the additional shares acquired by the Directors following the adjustment and consequently the sum disclosed above is different to the sum disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report.
The monetary value of the LTIP includes a cash value of 61.6 pence per share, equivalent to the dividends that participants would have received on these shares had they held them from the date that the shares were awarded.
The Committee has the right to decide that this payment may be paid in cash or in shares.
Pension benefit In 2017, each of the Executive Directors received cash in lieu of pension.
As Andy Gulliford and Phil Redding were members of the defined benefit pension scheme until 31 March 2016, the 2016 pension benefit comprises the pension input value increase in accrued pension plus cash in lieu of pension from that date.
Further information can be found on page 97.
For David Sleath, the sum comprises solely cash paid in lieu of pension.
Other This includes SIP, based on the number of shares awarded during the year and the share price at the date of grant, and Sharesave, based on the discount represented by the option price, multiplied by the annual savings.
For Soumen Das, this figure includes the value of replacement awards made in 2017 under the rules of the DSBP.
For further information, see Chart 14 on page 96.

89 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Bonus payment 2017 audited CHART 3: BONUS PAYMENT 2017 For the Executive Directors, the 2017 Bonus comprised three equally weighted components: Adjusted Profit Before Tax PBT : rent roll growth RRG : and relative TPR.
Profit Adjusted PBT against target 100% For this element, a Bonus is earned for Adjusted PBT performance against target.
50 per cent is earned on achieving the threshold target 172.0million for 2017, rising to 100 per cent for achieving the maximum target 184.9 million for 2017.
100 per cent of this element was achieved in 2017, with Adjusted PBT performance for PBT TPR bonus purposes of 185.2 million achieved.
Rent roll growth RRG against target RRG For this element, a Bonus is earned if the rent roll growth from the existing standing stock 100% is positive the threshold.
Once the threshold 100% is achieved, the Bonus is determined based on total RRG existing standing stock plus the impact of development RRG, with a sliding pay-out scale rising from 0 per cent for flat total RRG through to 100 per cent for achieving the maximum increase 27.9 million in 2017.
In 2017, RRG from standing stock was positive, thus ensuring the threshold was achieved.

LTIP awards made before the 2017 AGM were subject to a four-year performance period.
All LTIP awards are subject to TSR and TPR performance conditions, which are equally weighted and measured over the performance period: TSR this benchmark is based on the weighted mean TSR of other FTSE 350 REITs.
25 per cent of this element vests if the Companys TSR over the performance period is in line with benchmark TSR, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting if the benchmark is exceeded by 5 per cent per year.
TPR this benchmark is based on the MSCI-IPD All Industrial Country benchmarks weighted to reflect the approximate geographical mix of the Groups portfolio.
25 per cent of this element vests if the Companys TPR over the performance period is in line with the MSCI-IPD Benchmark, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent if the MSCI-IPD Benchmark is exceeded by 1.5 per cent per year.
On vesting, calculations are approved by the Committee who retain the discretion to withhold vesting of awards should such payments be deemed inappropriate.
The 2013 LTIP Award vested on 7 August 2017, subject to the TSR and TPR performance conditions over the four-year performance period to 31 December 2016.
The Companys TSR over the performance period was 117.7 per cent and the benchmark was 40.3 per cent.
The Companys TSR outperformance of 11.6 per cent per annum compared with the benchmark led to 100 per cent of the TSR element vesting and, as estimated in the 2016 Remuneration Report, 100 per cent of the TPR element vested.
Overall, this resulted in a total payout of 100 per cent.
The 2014 LTIP Award will vest on 9 April 2018, subject to relative TSR and TPR over the four-year performance period to 31 December 2017.
The Companys TSR over the performance period was 105.6 per cent and the benchmark TSR was 24.4 per cent.
The Companys TSR outperformance of 13.4 per cent per annum compared with the benchmark will lead to 100 per cent of the TSR element vesting.
As with the Bonus, the complete TPR data will not be available until after the date of this Report.
For the purposes of the Directors single figure calculations Chart 1, the performance for the TPR element has been estimated.
The estimated calculation is based on the Companys actual annualised TPR between 2014 and 2017 of 17.1 per cent and an estimated MSCI-IPD Benchmark over the same period of 15.1 per cent.
On this basis, the Companys four year TPR to 31 December 2017 has exceeded the estimated MSCI-IPD Benchmark by more than 1.5 per cent which would lead to 100 per cent of the TPR element vesting.
Vesting of the TPR element of the LTIP will be deferred until Summer 2018, when the European MSCI-IPD Benchmarks become available.
Accordingly, the actual number of shares which will vest under the 2014 LTIP Award, may differ from the amount disclosed in this Report.
Details of the LTIP awards granted to the Executive Directors are set out in Chart 13.
Any awards made under the LTIP in 2018 will be made in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
