Directors Remuneration Report This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Section 420-422 of the Companies Act 2006.
Following amendments to the Companies Act 2006, effective from 30 September 2013, the Remuneration Report comprises a Directors Remuneration Policy and a Directors Remuneration Report.
The Directors Remuneration Policy is subject to a triennial binding shareholder vote and the Directors Remuneration Report will be subject to an annual shareholder vote, as ordinary resolutions.
The law requires your Companys auditor to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated as such.
The auditors opinion is included in their report on pages 59 to 63.
All Directors are Non-Executive, appointed under the terms of Letters of Appointment, and none has a service contract.
These letters are available for inspection by shareholders at the Companys registered address.
The Directors Report includes, on page 37, details of the Directors terms of appointments.
The Company has no employees.
Details on the Nomination Committee can be found on page 37 within the Directors Report.
Directors Remuneration Policy This Policy provides details of the remuneration policy for the Directors of the Company.
It was approved at the 2014 AGM and will be subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM.
The Boards policy is that the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors should reflect the responsibilities of the Board, Directors time commitments, the experience of the Board as a whole, and be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts similar in size, capital structure and investment objective.
To this end, the Nomination Committee may engage independent external advisors to provide a formal review of Directors remuneration.
Any changes to fee levels as a result of this review will be subject to an annual review.
The review process involves an analysis of fees paid to Directors of other companies having similar profiles to that of the Company.
This review would be submitted to the Nomination Committee and the Directors fees would be agreed for the next year subject to approval by the shareholders at the relevant AGM.
A review was carried out this year which recommended an increase of 1,000 for all independent non-executive Directors with the additional fee for the Chairman of 2,000.
The last increase in Directors remuneration was on 1 April 2011.
Directors and Officers liability insurance cover is maintained by the Company, at its expense.
Directors remuneration is not linked to the performance of the Company and Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, long-term incentive schemes or other benefits in accordance with other investment trusts.
The Directors are entitled to reclaim reasonable expenses incurred in order to perform their duties as Non-Executive Directors for the Company.
Directors are not entitled to payment for loss of office.
