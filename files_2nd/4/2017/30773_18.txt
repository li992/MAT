CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Remuneration Committee Report continued Annual Remuneration Report This report covers the reporting period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 and explains how the Remuneration Policy has been implemented.
Comparative figures for the 2016 financial year have also been provided.
b All Dir ectors received salary supplement allowance in lieu of contributions into the Groups pension scheme throughout the year.
No Director had any entitlement under the defined benefit section of the pension scheme and no additional benefit was received as a result of early retirement.
c T he annual bonus column shows 50 per cent of the total bonus contribution earned under the MIP Element A in respect of 2017 performance, and 50 per cent of the total value of Element B shares awarded which are deferred but are not subject to further performance conditions other than continued employment.
The remaining 50 per cent in respect of 2017 Element A is deferred into shares in the MIP account which are subject to performance and employment-based forfeiture for a further holding period.
The remaining 50 per cent of 2017 Element B shares is subject to performance and employmentbased forfeiture for a 3-year deferred period.
These deferred elements will be disclosed in the long-term incentive column when the conditions are satisfied.
The deferred shares in relation to both Element A and Element B may change in value during the holding period depending on the Marshalls share price.
d The long-term incentive column shows the aggregate value of sums released from MIP or LTIP account balances from earlier years that are no longer subject to deferral and forfeiture risk.
e F or 2017, the LTIP column comprises the aggregate value of sums released from the MIP, at the end of the first cycle, in relation to Element A and Element B.
Of these amounts, the Remuneration Committee have determined that MIP Element A will be settled in cash and MIP Element B will be settled in shares.
For 2016, the LTIP comprises the 2014 Performance Share Award under the 2005 LTIP that vested and was settled during 2017.
Setting pay in context The following graphs illustrate the relationship between total expenditure on remuneration and other disbursements from profit over the past 3 years.
The 4 elements represent the most significant outgoings for the Company during the financial year.
In addition to staff pay and shareholder distributions, capital investment and taxation are shown for the following reasons: investment the Companys strategy is to increase capital investment to take advantage of market demand and in order to ensure that the business grows in a sustainable manner with a corresponding long-term benefit for all stakeholders: and tax the Company is a UK taxpayer and feels that it is beneficial to demonstrate to all its stakeholders its total UK tax contribution.
The most significant elements of the Companys UK tax contribution are VAT, employers NI, corporation tax, fuel duty and aggregates levy.
As profitability increases, corporation tax will also increase.
In 2017 the Group was re-accredited with the Fair Tax Mark.

MIP The MIP incorporates: Element A, an annual bonus award carrying a maximum of 150 per cent of salary, of which 50 per cent must be deferred into shares or sharelinked units: and Element B, an award normally in the form of a nil-cost option to acquire shares, carrying a maximum of 100 per cent of salary, conditional on continued employment for 3 years from grant and 50 per cent of which is also subject to a financial condition over the 3-year period.
Element B shares must be held for a further 2 years after vesting.
Both awards depend on achievement of the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the date of award.
The table below shows the 2017 performance conditions and the extent to which they have been satisfied.

During the year, cash flow from sales improved significantly and pre-tax profit grew by 13 per cent.
This performance meant that the stretching EPS and OCF targets were both met in full, resulting in a combined 100 per cent achievement against target.
The share price rose by 56 per cent during the year 31 December 2016: 292.5 pence: 31 December 2017: 454.9 pence, which means the underlying value of share and share-linked awards from previous years also increased.
EPS EPS relates to our strategic objective to grow profits.
The Groups profit before tax increased by 13 per cent from 46.0 million to 52.1 million.
Reported EPS improved by 14 per cent from 18.95 pence in 2016 to 21.52 pence in 2017.
"EPS and operating cash flow are both measured using International Financial Reporting Standards ""IFRSs"" based on the audited results of the Group and subject to the discretion of the Committee withregard to one-off items."
For the 2017 remuneration outcomes the Committee applied adjustments for one-off items relating to the acquisition of CPM Group Limited and certain operational restructuring items.
These adjustments gave rise to an EPS figure of 22.41 pence for the purpose ofremuneration outcomes.
Operating cash flow Operating cash flow is relevant for measurement of cash flow and overall sustainability.
The Groups operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio for the year ended 31 December 2017 was at the top of the target range set by the Committee at the beginning of the year.
Additional performance conditions Our customers are at the heart of our business model, and our measurement of customer service uses factors such as product availability, on-time delivery performance and administrative and delivery accuracy to assess performance.
The Groups average customer service performance, assessed monthly, exceeded its minimum target of 95 per cent throughout 2017.
The Group also continued its excellent performance against its stated objective of keeping days lost to accidents to a minimum, by reference to the 2015 rate.
Days lost to accidents year on year actually reduced by afurther 35 per cent.
Had either of these targets not been met, the overall level of MIP award would have reduced by 10 per cent: the achievement of these measures means that no reduction factor will apply.
