Weare mindful of the need to ensure that Our current Remuneration Policy What is our current Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors?
Our current Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at our AGM on 21July 2016.
The improvements we made are intended to reward delivery at pace of the objectives required to achieve sustainable success, while maintaining appropriate flexibility in target setting from year to year.
In summary, the objectives for our new policy are to: be more aligned with our fast-changing market place and with what our executives need to focus on year on year incentivise sustained year on year improvements with the aim of delivering long-term value for shareholders increase the proportion of remuneration which is delivered in the form of deferred equity, from around 25per cent to 40per cent of the total, and encourage long term shareholding supported by an increase in the shareholding requirement for our Executive Directors.
Under our new policy, a larger proportion of the overall package is linked to performance, more is delivered in shares and the potential payout is over a longer timeline.
Remuneration Principles Remuneration Principles Overall package The overall remuneration package should take account of the dynamics of the market in which we operate.
Ourincentive targets need to be flexible enough to ensure that we can reward performance appropriately.
Incentive levels and structure Incentive payouts should be based primarily on the achievement of relevant operational, financial and strategic goals, as well as the creation of long-term shareholder value.
Alignment with shareholders Management interests should be aligned to the interests of shareholders, including through building a significant Royal Mail shareholding.

Annual bonus 80per cent of the performance in the Annual Bonus is measured through the Corporate Balanced Scorecard.
This Scorecard tracks a range of short-term measures that are critical to the creation of long-term, sustainable shareholder value and the delivery of our strategy.
There are no changes to the metrics for 2017-18, which continue to focus on our people, customer, efficiency and financial performance.
The scorecard is shown below: Employee customer focus First Class quality of service Employee engagement Composite parcels quality Sick absence rate 3% 3% Employee 1st Class 3% Mean business customer 3% Engagement Retail Quality 3% satisfaction Accident rate 6% of Service Total customer 6% complaints People Customer UKPIL non- 3% Total Road Trafc people costs 15% 15% Customer Collisions 3% Complaints 000 av.

The following objectives have been agreed between the Chairman and the CEO.
They will be used in conjunction with the Corporate Scorecard to measure the performance of the Executive Directors at the end of the financial year: 1.
Apply sufficient resource focused on global parcels to enable acceleration of our rate of expansion primarily via acquisition.
Continue to drive profitable growth in GLS, our parcels business in Europe.
Deliver the next stage of the parcels strategy in the UK, including enhancement of the customer proposition at acceptable cost through technology deployment.
Implement the steps necessary to defend the sustainability of the core UK business in the face of continuing and substantial declines in letter volumes and revenues.
LTIP Our LTIP has a single metric directly reflecting shareholder value achieved, including dividends, relative to other large quoted companies.
TheCommittee believes relative TSR is an appropriate measure of strategy implementation over a three year period.
It rewards the creation of value for shareholders through the successful execution of our strategy.
TSR also reflects the importance of dividend yield to the Groups shareholders and the Companys commitment to a progressive dividend policy.
In the event that the underlying financial performance of the Group is not reflected in the TSR performance, the Committee would retain discretion to adjust the award.

We have included the single figure so that you can see where against our policy scenarios the actual remuneration for the year sits.

Maximum: Bonus: For the cash bonus, this is 100per cent of salary and the same value is used for the deferred share award.
LTIP: For the LTIP this is 100per cent of salary.
No assumptions have been made in relation to future share price movements or dividend reinvestments.
72 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information How will the Policy be implemented in 2017-18?
The following table sets out how the Committee proposes to operate the Policy next year.
Element Implementation of policy in 2017-18 Base salary We annually review the salary of the CEO and CFO and will do the same in 2017-18.
Any increases in salary will be no greater than the general increase provided to employees.
Benefits No change to benefit provision for 2017-18 Pension Allowance No change to pension allowance provision for 2017-18 Annual Bonus The maximum total annual incentive opportunity for the Executive Directors will remain at 200per cent of salary, as per agreed policy, half delivered in cash and half in deferred shares.
For the 2017-18 annual bonus, 80per cent of the award will be based on achievement against the scorecard, in which at least 50per cent of the measures will be financial, with the remainder focused on operational, customer and people-related targets.
20per cent of the award will be based on achievement against strategic objectives.
The Committee is of the opinion that given the commercial sensitivity arising in relation to the detailed financial targets used for the Annual Bonus, the disclosure of precise targets for the Annual Bonus in advance would not be in shareholders interests.
Actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the performance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts under the Plan.
LTIP The Executive Directors will be eligible for an award equivalent to 100per cent of salary.
100per cent of the award will be based on the Groups relative TSR performance against the FTSE 100 excluding mining and financial companies.
The vesting schedule will measure the Groups performance over three years as follows: 50per cent of salary will vest if TSR performance is equal to the median TSR of the companies in the comparator group Maximum vesting will occur if TSR is equal to, or greater than, the upper quartile TSR of the comparator group The award is subject to straight line vesting between these two points.
Shareholding guidelines 200per cent of salary for Executive Directors.
What would the remuneration arrangements be for a new Executive Director?
Salaries for new Executive Directors appointed to the Board will be set in accordance with the terms of the approved Remuneration Policy in force at the time of appointment.
In particular, they will take account of the appointees skills and experience as well as the scope and market rate for the role.
Benefits consistent with those offered to other Executive Directors under the approved Remuneration Policy in force at the time of appointment will be offered, including the discretion to offer additional benefits such as relocation allowance on recruitment.
Following the shareholder consultation we undertook last year, the pension allowance paid to any newly appointed Executive Director will be 17.5per cent of salary.
Allexisting arrangements will remain the same.
Incentive arrangements for new Executive Directors will be in accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy in force at the time of appointment.
This means the maximum total annual incentive opportunity award in any year would be 200per cent of salary, split equally between cash and deferred shares, and the maximum LTIP award would be 100per cent of salary, with the ability to offer up to 200per cent of salary for the year of recruitment.
For an externally appointed Executive Director, the Company may offer additional cash or share-based payments that it considers necessary to buy out current entitlements from the former employer that will be forfeited on recruitment.
Any such arrangements would reflect the type of award for example, cash or shares : time horizons: and levels of conditionality of the remuneration foregone.
In order to facilitate buy-out arrangements, existing incentive schemes will be used to the extent possible, and the Committee will retain discretion on the application of holding periods, performance conditions and performance periods.
For an internally appointed Executive Director, any outstanding variable pay element, such as a long-term incentive plan awarded in respect of the prior role will continue on its original terms.
The fees for Non-Executive Directors appointed will be set in accordance with the terms of the approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.
The Committee always seeks to ensure that any remuneration package is set such that the Company is able to attract the right calibre of individual required, whilst taking account of affordability, and therefore the Committee must be allowed to exercise its judgement.

The assessment of the annual bonus award would be made in line with normal practice for determining bonuses.
The bonus provision is not replicated in any other contracts and would not be part of the terms of appointment of a new Executive Director.
Under Matthew Lesters service contract and the policy for future hires, the Company may terminate the contract by making a payment in lieu of any unexpired notice period.
The payment in lieu of notice is limited to a maximum of 12 months base salary.

How do the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors compare with arrangements for employees across the Company?
When making decisions on the levels of remuneration for Executive Directors, the Committee takes account of pay increases and incentive awards for all employees.
The Company does not use remuneration comparison measurements nor have employees been consulted directly on the Policy.
A range of different incentive and commission schemes operate across the Company, designed to support the delivery of the Company-wide annual bonus scorecard, through which the Executive Directors are incentivised.
How does the change in the Chief Executive's pay compare to that for Royal Mail employees?
The table below shows the percentage change in the Chief Executive's salary, benefits and annual bonus between 2016-17 and 2015-16, compared with the average for all employees across the Group.
There has been no change to the contractual benefit entitlement for the CEO but she has made use of her financial advice during 2016-17, and the Company has paid benefit in kind tax on her flights.
3 The small reduction in the averages shown for All Employees is not due to a reduction in the terms and conditions we offer our employees overall.
However, the data is impacted by employee turnover and a change in the mix of employees across our grades.

Strategic objectives: Achievement against the Strategic Objectives was assessed by the Chairman and ratified by the Remuneration Committee.
Performance was determined to be strong due to the finalisation of a very clear strategy being implemented successfully, as follows: 1.
Articulate the ambition for the Company for the next five years and define the route to achieving that vision A five year strategic plan was agreed with the Board and communicated effectively to key stakeholders including investors, employees, unions and the regulator.
Following this agreement, the strategy has been progressed by reshaping the UKPIL business to create more focused business units, progress has been made on a more efficient labour model and we have established a programme of work to acquire and build a global network parcels business: this has included the completion of two successful acquisitions in the USA.
In addition we have continued to build our know how in Consumer and Data Services while evaluating the potential for Royal Mail to operate as an E-commerce Enabler.
Defend the Letters business by managing the cost base of the core network effectively, continuing to transform the business to become more efficient, and stemming letters decline through initiatives A strategic cost programme was successfully implemented across the Group, as shown by the third consecutive year of achieving our cost saving targets.
Actions included a 1.9per cent reduction in core hours, 225 million of cost avoided and significantly improved revenue recovery totalling 218 million.
This allowed us to keep prices low without impacting our excellent quality of service.
A series of collaborative projects with the advertising industry helped to slow letter decline.
Continuing to evolve the Parcels business both in the UK and internationally to win more profitable business in a dynamic and highly competitive market place In the UK the sales mix improved with full-year UKPIL parcels revenue growth of three per cent compared to one per cent for last year.
GLSrevenue grew by nine per cent in an increasingly competitive market.
Cost containment translated this into an increase in profitability of17percent.
Further deployment of medium parcels processing has progressed with the first Parcels Sortation Automation machine now live and a further two are undergoing installation.
Parcels technology has improved on multiple fronts to support customer convenience.
Growing in new areas through acquisitions as well as leveraging our existing assets The diversification strategy is proving effective with the three substantial acquisitions completed of ASM, GSO and Postal Express the latter completed just after the year-end.
ASM is expected to be economic profit accretive in 2018-19, while GSO should be economic profit accretive in 2019-20.
We continue to build out the pipeline of potential acquisition candidates for 2017-18 and onwards.
Amongst other initiatives, weestablished a Fleet business unit, offering vehicle maintenance services to third parties, and a new consumer ID service that will be ready tolaunch in 2017-18.
Continue to refresh our approach to technology, defining a digital strategy which identifies and embraces technology relevant for our business future The Boards approval of the digital strategy allowed the development of products for customers: market trials for Tamoco for doorstep delivery instructions and Glympse for predicted time of delivery have been implemented.
Operational performance was enhanced through the deployment of PDAs.
The PDA platform can now manage 4.5 million scans an hour, up from 730,000, which supports an increasing proportion of parcels 68per cent now carrying a barcode.
78 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information When added to the outcome of the Corporate Balanced Scorecard, the total bonus value, and the percentage of salary, were as follows:- Moya Greene: 439,883, 80per cent of salary.

Additionally, in line with the Remuneration Policy and subject to Committee approval, this performance outturn determines the value of the deferred share award to be granted to the CEO, equal to the value of her bonus.
This award will vest in three years.
What was the outturn of the 2014 LTIP?
The 2014 award was based on achievement against two performance conditions to be achieved by 26March 2017 and a third condition, TSR, to be achieved by July 2017.
The tables below show the performance conditions and the vesting of this plan.
However, overall performance of the plan will be finalised ahead of the vesting in July 2017.
Performance targets for the 2014 LTIP were not previously published due to commercial sensitivity.

3 Shares include those which are subsequently due to vest following the end of performance period in July 2017.
Data is reported prior to the sale of shares required to cover tax obligations.
The impact of pre-IPO LTIP awards vesting in cash rather than shares means that it will take some time for the Executive Directors to achieve the minimum required level of shareholding guideline.
Were any payments made for loss of office?
As mentioned elsewhere, our CFO, Matthew Lester has decided to leave the business this July, after nearly seven years of service with the Company.
Other than for the award vesting this year, his outstanding LTIP awards will lapse in accordance with the plan rules, and he will not be eligible for the award of deferred shares that forms part of the 2016-17 bonus.
He will also not receive any payment for loss of office.
The Committee determined that he would be eligible for the cash element of the 2016-17 Annual Bonus given that he was employed for the full financial year: and the Committee also agreed that his 2014 LTIP award, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, would be capable of vesting given that he was employed by the Company for the whole of the performance period.
The Committee took the view that this was justifiable on account of his dedicated service to the Company throughout his notice period.
It has been to the Companys advantage that he gave us more than his contractual notice in order for us to plan succession.
Were any payments made to past Directors during the year?
No payments were made to past Directors during the year.

The reasons for the votes against the Policy in 2016 primarily related to a minority of shareholders who did not support the increase in potential compensation related to short term performance or the sole use of TSR as a performance conditionfor the LTIP.
