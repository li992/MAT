Dear Shareholder, On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our report on Directors remuneration at the end of yet another successful year.
As set out elsewhere in this Annual Report, the disappointing Justin Dowley downgrade of Brush and the restructure of its turbogenerator Remuneration Committee Chairman business, albeit a small part of the Group, is offset by the scale and pace of the transformation achieved with Nortek.
Nortek recorded a 52% improvement in its underlying profit through the 5.5 The Board has delegated to the Remuneration percentage point improvement in its underlying profit margins to Committee the Committee responsibility for over 15%.
This margin improvement had been the original three to five-year aim when the business was acquired, but this has been overseeing the remuneration of the Companys achieved in under 18 months.

Performance in 2017 2017 was another very strong year for Melrose and marked another milestone in our buy, improve, sell strategy.
It is with this performance in mind, and in line with Melroses remuneration philosophy of paying only for performance, that the Committee has taken its decisions in respect of executive Directors remuneration arrangements for 2017 and 2018.
Our remuneration structure for executive Directors Melroses philosophy is that executive remuneration should be simple and transparent, support the delivery of the value creation strategy and pay only for performance.
This philosophy is reflected in our remuneration structure.

Non-executive Directors basic fees for 2018 have also been increased by 3%, with effect from 1 January 2018.
However, the additional fees payable to the committee chairmen and the Senior Independent Director are viewed as appropriate and have been left unchanged.

Each executive Director received an increase in base salary of approximately 3% effective from 1 January 2017.
Benefits The range of benefits provided to Directors has not changed since the inception of Melrose and there is no intention to widen the range of benefits Directors may receive.

Geoffrey Martin also received paid train travel to and from London.
Melrose Industries PLC Annual Report 2017 Governance 85 Bonus The maximum bonus opportunity is set below the maximum median annual bonus opportunity for FTSE 250 companies to reflect the participation of the executive Directors in the Companys long-term incentive arrangements.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the maximum bonus opportunity was equal to 100% of base salary.
Following the application of the formulaic basis used in previous years and as explained below, it was determined by the Committee that Simon Peckham and Geoffrey Martin being the only executive Directors participating in the annual bonus plan should be awarded a bonus of 90% of base salary.

Total 100% 90% The Committee is satisfied that given their significant shareholdings the interests of executive Directors are aligned with those of shareholders, and therefore considers bonus deferral provisions would be unnecessary and inappropriate.
Long-term incentives The long-term incentives values in the 2017 single total figure of remuneration table reflect the value of the Incentive Plan 2012 which vested in May 2017.
The performance period of that plan ran from May 2012 to May 2017 and delivered to participants including the executive Directors 7.5% of the index adjusted growth in shareholder value of the Company over that period, calculated in accordance with the Incentive Plan 2012 rules.
It should be noted that these values were earned over that five-year period and that no other longterm incentive vested to the executive Directors over that period.
As noted in the statement from the Chairman of the Committee, the creation of shareholder value over the same period was 3.6 billion.
As described in the circular relating to the General Meeting on 11 May 2017, the crystallisation of the Incentive Plan 2012 resulted in an income tax liability for the participants.
The tax liability could have been satisfied by the sale of shares acquired on the crystallisation of the Incentive Plan 2012.
However, as described in that circular, the Committee recognised that this would increase the dilutive effect of the Incentive Plan 2012 on existing shareholders, and instead determined that a proportion of the Incentive Plan 2012 options would be cancelled in return for a cash payment equal to the value of the shares that would otherwise have been issued for those options, so as to enable participants to meet their tax and National Insurance contributions liability, with the cash payment withheld to satisfy those liabilities.
In the 2017 single total figure of remuneration table, the long-term incentives value for each executive Director is calculated as follows: Number of ordinary Value of ordinary shares acquired shares acquired Amount of pursuant to the pursuant to the cash cancellation crystallisation of the crystallisation of the payment to meet tax 1 2 Executive Director Incentive Plan 2012 Incentive Plan 2012 and NIC liabilities Option exercise price Aggregate value Christopher Miller 9,604,317 22,978,328 18,796,627 4,675 41,770,280 David Roper 9,604,317 22,978,328 18,796,627 4,675 41,770,280 Simon Peckham 9,255,069 22,142,753 19,632,032 4,505 41,770,280 Geoffrey Martin 9,255,069 22,142,753 19,632,032 4,505 41,770,280 1 Based on a share price of 2.3925, being the closing value of those shares on 31 May 2017.

Melrose Industries PLC Annual Report 2017 86 Directors remuneration report Continued Scheme interests awarded during the year Awards were granted to the executive Directors and other participants under the Incentive Plan 2017, on establishment on 31 May 2017.
On 29 June 2017, each of the executive Directors exercised all options they held at that time and, on payment of the exercise price to the Company, the executive Directors were issued with Incentive Shares 2017.
Details of the award, exercise and issue to the executive Directors are as follows: Christopher Miller 2,583 Incentive Shares 2017, David Roper 2,583 Incentive Shares 2017, Simon Peckham 2,833 Incentive Shares 2017 and Geoffrey Martin 2,833 Incentive Shares 2017.
The Incentive Shares 2017 entitle the holders to 7.5% of the increase in the index-adjusted value from and including 31 May 2017 to but excluding 31 May 2020, subject to earlier crystallisation in accordance with the Incentive Plan 2017.
For accounting purposes, the IFRS 2 charge has been calculated as if all three tranches have been granted on establishment because of a common expectation, established at that date but subject to changes to take account of exceptional circumstances, between employees and the Company that the remaining options will be allocated annually in two more equal tranches over the three-year performance period.
The regulations require that the Directors Remuneration Report sets out the face value of the awards at the date of grant.
However, this is not practical in the case of the Incentive Plan 2017, where the value of any award is based on the growth in value of the Company over the applicable measurement period.
Payments to past Directors No payments were made in the year to any former Director of the Company.
Payments for loss of office No payments for loss of office were made in the year to any Director.
Statement of Directors shareholding and share interests As disclosed at the time of the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Plan, the executive Directors considered it appropriate that they, together with their immediate families, would hold at least half of the shares acquired pursuant to that crystallisation after satisfying tax obligations following the crystallisation of that plan and subject to capital adjustments for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has adopted the minimum share retention guidelines outlined below in relation to the holding of ordinary shares by executive Directors who participated in the 2009 Incentive Plan and the Incentive Plan 2012 and who participate in the Incentive Plan 2017, reinforcing the executive Directors long-term stewardship of the Company and long-term investment in the Companys shares.
No executive Director may dispose of any ordinary shares without the consent of the Remuneration Committee, which will not normally be withheld provided the executive Director will continue to hold at least the minimum number of ordinary shares referred to in the table below following any such disposal.
These guidelines were updated at the time of the renewal of the Incentive Plan 2017 for the ordinary shares issued to executive Directors on crystallisation of the Incentive Plan 2012 as set out in the table on page 85.

2 As at 31 December 2017, the interest of Christopher Miller included 8,750,000 ordinary shares held by Harris & Sheldon Investments Limited, a company which is connected with Christopher Miller within the meaning of section 252 of the Act.
3 For these purposes, the value of a share is 212.20 pence, being the closing mid-market price on 29 December 2017, the last business day prior to 31 December 2017.
As at 31 December 2017, each executive Director held much more than the minimum number of ordinary shares and so satisfied the guidelines.
Internal Company rules on shareholdings are extended to senior management in addition to the executive Directors, in order that appropriate remuneration principles are applied to senior management on a similar basis to executive Directors.

2 Each executive Director was granted options over Incentive Shares 2017 on 31 May 2017: Christopher Miller was granted 2,583 options, David Roper was granted 2,583 options, Simon Peckham was granted 2,833 options and Geoffrey Martin was granted 2,833 options.
Each executive Director exercised his option on 29 June 2017 and 2,583 Incentive Shares 2017 each were issued to Christopher Miller and David Roper and 2,833 Incentive Shares 2017 each were issued to Simon Peckham and Geoffrey Martin.
The value which may be derived from the Incentive Shares 2017 acquired on exercise will be determined following 31 May 2020, or any other earlier crystallisation date in accordance with the Incentive Plan 2017.
For accounting purposes, the IFRS 2 charge has been calculated as if all three tranches have been granted on day one because of a common expectation, established at that date but subject to changes to take account of exceptional circumstances, between employees and the Company that the remaining options will be allocated annually in two more equal tranches over the three-year performance period.
3 John Grant retired as a non-executive Director of the Company with effect from 11 May 2017.
4 During 2017, each executive Director exercised his option under the Incentive Plan 2012.
Each executive Director held an option over 8,500 Incentive Shares 2012.
Those options were cancelled in respect of 3,825 Incentive Shares 2012 in the case of Christopher Miller, 3,825 Incentive Shares 2012 in the case of David Roper, 3,995 Incentive Shares 2012 in the case of Simon Peckham and 3,995 Incentive Shares 2012 in the case of Geoffrey Martin, as referred to on page 64.
The Incentive Shares 2012 acquired on exercise of the Incentive Plan 2012 options were converted into 9,604,317 ordinary shares in the case of Christopher Miller, 9,604,317 ordinary shares in the case of David Roper, 9,255,069 ordinary shares in the case of Simon Peckham and 9,255,069 ordinary shares in the case of Geoffrey Martin, as referred to on page 64.
There have been no changes in the holdings of the Directors between 31 December 2017 and 20 February 2018.
Performance graph The information provided in this part of the Annual Report on Remuneration is not subject to audit.
The total shareholder return graph below shows the value as at 31 December 2017 of 100 invested in the Company on 31 December 2009, compared with 100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index, the FTSE 250 Index or the FTSE All-Share Index.
The Committee considers the FTSE 100 Index, the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE All-Share Index to be appropriate indices for the year ended 31 December 2017 for the purposes of this comparison because of the comparable size of the companies which comprise the FTSE 100 Index and the FTSE 250 Index and the broad nature of companies which comprise the FTSE All-Share Index.

Therefore, in the view of the Committee, inclusion of these values in respect of the years ended 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2017 does not give a fair representation of the Chief Executives yearly remuneration over each of the previous five years.
Therefore, an additional column has been added to the table below to show total remuneration excluding the value received on the maturity of those plans.
No other long-term incentive plan vested in favour of any executive Director in any of the other years.
The amount of that value shown in respect of David Roper and Simon Peckham for the year ended 31 December 2012 reflects the proportion of that year for which each was the Chief Executive.

In the table above: i the Total remuneration figure shows, in respect of David Roper, his total remuneration in respect of his service in the period 1 January 2012 to 9 May 2012 and in respect of Simon Peckham his total remuneration in respect of his service in the period from 9 May 2012 to 31 December 2012.
Included in this figure for each of David Roper and Simon Peckham is the value of the long-term incentives vesting in the year pro-rated to reflect the portion of the year for which he was Chief Executive: and ii the Total remuneration excluding the long-term incentive value shows in respect of each of David Roper and Simon Peckham total remuneration in respect of the period for which he was Chief Executive excluding any value received on the maturity in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Plan.
2 The value derived in 2017 from the Incentive Shares 2012 represents the Chief Executives share, determined in accordance with the terms of those shares, of the shareholder value created over a period of approximately five years.
3 On the crystallisation in May 2017 of the Incentive Plan 2012, participants as a whole were entitled to 7.5% of the increase in shareholder value from 22 March 2012 to 31 May 2017.
Because the value derived on the crystallisation of the Incentive Shares 2012 depended upon the shareholder value created over the relevant period, it is not possible to express the value derived as a percentage of the maximum opportunity.
4 The value derived in 2012 from the 2009 incentive shares represents the Chief Executives share, determined in accordance with the terms of those shares, of the shareholder value created over a period of approximately five years.
5 On the crystallisation in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Plan awarded in 2009, participants as a whole were entitled to 10% of the increase in shareholder value from 18 July 2007 to 23 March 2012.
Because the value derived on the crystallisation of the 2009 incentive shares depended upon the shareholder value created over the relevant period, it is not possible to express the value derived as a percentage of the maximum opportunity.
The crystallisation of the 2009 incentive shares was satisfied by the conversion of those shares into ordinary shares.

The percentages shown opposite relate to the financial year ended 2017 as a percentage comparison to the financial year ended 2016.
This group of senior management was considered an appropriate comparator group because of their level of seniority and the structure of their remuneration package.
The spread of the Companys operations across various countries and industries means that remuneration policies vary to take account of geography and industry such that the Committee considers that selecting a wider group of employees would not provide a meaningful comparison.
