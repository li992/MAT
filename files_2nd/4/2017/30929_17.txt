Such appointments are seen as a way in which Executive Directors can gain a broader business experience and, in turn, benefit the Company.
Currently, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director do not hold any external Non-executive Directorships.
Service contracts and loss of office payments The Companys policy in relation to contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, is that they should be fair to the individual, the Company and shareholders.
In the case of termination by the Company the Director will be given twelve months notice, including where there is a change of control.
The Director will give not less than six months notice, except where there is a change of control when it will be ninety days.
Where a Director receives a payment in lieu of notice this will include base salary and benefits, to which the Executive Director is entitled including any bonus accrued up until the date of termination notwithstanding that the date of termination may be prior to the date the bonus is actually paid.
The Remuneration Committee also has discretion to incorporate payments under the performance-linked elements of the package under good leaver scenarios.
More details can be found in the Companys Remuneration Policy on the Companys website.
How the Remuneration Policy will be implemented for 2018 Executive Directors Salary Base salaries were reviewed in December 2017 and as from 1 January 2018 are: Chief Executive 507,800 Finance Director 355,500 This represents an increase of 3% which is in line with the increase to other employees within the Group.
Salaries will next be reviewed in December 2018 for the financial year 2019.
Annual bonus Following approval of the Companys Remuneration Policy the annual bonus opportunity for 2018 is amended to 125% of salary, with up to 20% of the bonus earned being delivered in the form of shares that are deferred for two years.
The increase in annual bonus opportunity reflects the significant increase in scale and complexity of the Company, both in the UK and internationally, over the last few years and the Companys move into the FTSE 250 in June 2016. www.

The Remuneration Committee will determine an appropriate performance range for each measure used.
The Committee considers that the performance targets are commercially sensitive and so will not be disclosed prospectively.
However the Committee will disclose performance against these measures and their targets retrospectively in future reports on a similar basis to the disclosures on page 65.
Share plans The Remuneration Policy approved by members at the Companys AGM in May 2017, permits the Committee to grant awards under the LTIP up to a maximum of 150% of base salary.
However the Committee intends to make an award in 2018 in respect of the performance period 1 January 2018 31 December 2020, of 125% of base salary, subject to the following performance conditions: Vesting amount Absolute UEPS growth over three years 50% of the award TSR 50% of the award 0% Vesting Less than 15% Below median 25% Vesting 15% Median Maximum vesting 30% Upper quartile Straight line vesting will apply between these two points.

Benefits The Company will continue to provide benefits of membership of the Companys healthcare scheme, income protection scheme, personal accident insurance, car or cash allowance, ill health and life assurance.
Pensions The Company will continue to make a cash payment to D W Muir and M Pegler in lieu of pension contributions, equal to 25% of their base salary.
How the Remuneration Policy will be implemented for 2018 Non-executive Directors Fees The fees of Non-executive Directors are reviewed regularly to ensure they are in line with the market and so the Company can attract and retain individuals of the highest calibre.
Any change to these fees will be approved by the Board as a whole, following a recommendation from the Chief Executive.
In December 2017, the Board approved a 3% increase in the base fees as from 1 January 2018 for all Non-executive Director fees and following a review which indicated that the Chairmans fees was positioned below the market competitive range, given the Companys position in the FTSE 250, the Board approved an increase in the Chairmans fees to 165,000 in line with the lower end of the market range.

Recovery provisions Annual bonus and LTIP awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions as set out below.
For up to two years following the determination of an annual bonus, the Remuneration Committee may require a participant to repay any cash bonus paid and or may reduce or cancel any deferred bonus award granted in the event of: i a material misstatement in the Groups financial results: or ii the Remuneration Committee reasonably determining that the participant has been guilty of gross misconduct.
Before the vesting of an LTIP award, the Remuneration Committee may decide to reduce or cancel the award in the event of: i a material error in or misstatement of the Groups results: ii information coming to light which, had it been known, would have affected the award or vesting decision: or iii reputational damage to the Group.
For up to two years following the vesting of an LTIP award the Remuneration Committee may reduce or cancel the award for example if it remains unexercised and subject to a holding period or require a repayment in respect of shares acquired in the event of: i a material misstatement in the Groups financial results for any year in the performance period for the relevant award: or ii the Remuneration Committee reasonably determining that the participant has been guilty of gross misconduct.
Explanation of chosen performance measures and how targets are set Performance measures have been selected that reflect the Groups strategy.
Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual bonus and LTIP awards.
In setting these stretching performance targets the Remuneration Committee will take into account a number of different reference points such as the Groups business plans and strategy.
The Remuneration Committee considers that underlying EPS and profit before tax are closely aligned to the Groups key performance metrics and, in conjunction with the other annual bonus performance metrics, provide a balanced measurement of performance that encourages sustainable growth.
The UEPS and TSR performance conditions attaching to the LTIP align managements objectives to those of shareholders and reward the delivery of year on year growth and delivery of value to shareholders.
For the relative TSR performance condition there will be no vesting for performance below median compared to the comparator group.
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust the performance targets and measures where it considers it appropriate to do so.
For example, to reflect changes in the strategy or structure of the business or in prevailing market conditions and to assess performance on a fair and consistent basis from year to year.
Operation of share plans The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to operate the Companys share plans in accordance with their rules, including the ability to adjust awards in the event of a variation of capital or other relevant corporate event, and settle awards in cash.
