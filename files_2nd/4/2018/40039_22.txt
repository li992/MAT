Introduction Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Directors Remuneration Policy This section describes the Groups remuneration policy for Directors which applies for up to three years from approval at the Annual General Meeting on 14 September 2016.
The only amendments to this Policy Report from the version approved by shareholders in 2016 are to update: i the data used in the pay-for-performance scenarios: ii references to financial years: iii page references: and iv the details of the Non-Executive Directors appointment letters.
The overarching principles of the remuneration policy are to provide a competitive package of fixed and variable pay that will enable the Group to ensure it has executives with the right skills and experience to drive the success of the Company, and that their remuneration is linked to shareholder interests and the Companys long-term success.
The remuneration philosophy is: to promote the long-term success of the Company, with stretching performance targets which are rigorously applied: to provide appropriate alignment between the Companys strategic goals, shareholder returns and executive reward: and, to have a competitive mix of base salary and short and long-term incentives, with an appropriate proportion of the package determined by stretching targets linked to the Companys performance.
Executive Directors fixed and variable remuneration arrangements have been determined taking into account: the role, experience in the role, and performance of the Executive Director: the location in which the Executive Director is working: remuneration arrangements at UK listed companies of a similar size and complexity: remuneration arrangements at US high-technology companies of a similar size and complexity, including companies with which the Company competes for talent: and, best practice guidelines for UK listed companies set by institutional investor bodies.

Other than in exceptional cases such as to replace existing arrangements for new recruits the Committee does not anticipate pension benefits as being at a cost to the Company that would exceed 20 per cent of base salary.

Notes to the Policy Table This policy is unchanged in substance since approval at the AGM on 14 September 2016.
Other than minor text changes to ensure this policy remains clear for the reader, a few other minor changes have been made to provide additional clarity, including updated scenario charts shown below.
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting Billings and EBITDA are considered to be the best measures of the Groups annual performance given the current size and stage of growth, and will continue to determine annual bonus vesting.
The Committee will keep this under review, and may select alternative measures as the Group evolves and strategic priorities change.
Annual bonus targets will be set prior to, or shortly after, the start of the financial period.
Financial targets will be calibrated with reference to the Groups budget for the upcoming financial period and the Groups performance over the prior financial period.
Threshold and stretch performance levels for performance-based awards under the LTIP will be set at the start of the three-year performance period.
The Committee aims to set stretching but achievable targets, taking account of a range of reference points, including market consensus and the Groups strategic plan.
Differences in remuneration policy operated for other employees Other employee remuneration has the same components as set out in the policy, being base salary, annual bonus, long-term incentive participation, pension, life assurance and benefit provision.
Annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements share a similar structure and pay-out arrangement, although the mix between performance-based and time-based awards, and the maximum award, varies by seniority and role.
Other In addition to the above elements of remuneration, any commitment made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, the approval and implementation of the policy detailed in this report will be honoured, this includes awards made to Directors both Executive and Non-Executive prior to IPO.
Performance scenarios The graphs below provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunities for Executive Directors, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Minimum, Mid and Maximum.
Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer $000 000 Maximum Maximum 11% 22% 67% 6,455 15% 22% 63% 2,149 Mid Mid 24% 24% 52% 3,030 31% 22% 47% 1,058 Fixed Minimum Minimum Annual incentive 45% 55% 1,633 53% 47% 609 LTI 68 Cybersecurity made simple Introduction Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The potential reward opportunities illustrated are based on the policy approved at the AGM on 14 September 2016, applied to the base salaries in force at 1 April 2018.
The projected value of LTIP amounts excludes the impact of share price movement or dividend accrual.
The assumptions made in illustrating potential reward opportunities are shown in the table below: LTIP LTIP performance-based time-based Performance scenario Fixed pay Annual bonus awards awards No annual bonus Minimum Threshold not achieved Salary as at most recent payable review date On target annual Performance warrants threshold Mid Full vesting Benefits and pension value bonus payable vesting as for the most recent Maximum annual Maximum financial period Performance warrants full vesting bonus payable Approach to Remuneration for New Executive Director Appointments In the cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee may make use of all the existing components of remuneration, as follows: Maximum Component Approach opportunity Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined based on the experience n a and skills of the individual, relevant market data and their current basic salary.

Other than in exceptional cases such Policy Table as to replace existing arrangements for new recruits the Committee does not anticipate pension benefits as being at a cost to the Company that would exceed 20 per cent of base salary.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with the policy which n a may include but are not limited to car allowance, medical insurance and life insurance.
Annual bonus The structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with the 200 per cent of relevant maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over base salary the year.
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on similar terms as other Up to 750 per cent executives, as described in the Policy Table.

Policy Table In determining appropriate remuneration for a new Executive Director, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of the Group and its shareholders.
In addition to the remuneration arrangements set out above, the Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, using Listing Rule 9.4.
In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
The fair value of any buy out will not exceed that of the award being foregone.
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the approach will be consistent with the policy for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to Board level, the Group will continue to honour these arrangements.
Incentive opportunities for below Board employees are no higher than for Executive Directors, but measures may vary.
In recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on page 68.
69 Directors Remuneration Policy continued Service Contracts and Exit Payment Policy Non-Executive Directors The appointments of each of the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are for a fixed term of three years and subject to annual re-election by the Company at the AGM.

The Payment in Lieu will be paid in monthly instalments over the notice period.
In specified circumstances not involving a change of control, in which case the severance payment applicable is as described below, each Executive Director is entitled to terminate his employment without notice and receive a severance payment.
The severance payment will be equal to the Payment in Lieu and paid in a single lump sum.
The specified circumstances are where either: a the employer terminates or gives notice to terminate the Executive Directors employment without cause: or b the Executive Director terminates his employment in response to: a material diminution of his authority, duties, responsibilities or status in a manner inconsistent with his service agreement: a breach of a fundamental term of his service agreement: a material reduction in his annual basic salary or target bonus opportunity: or being required to relocate his place of work beyond a specified distance each a Good Leaver Reason.

70 Cybersecurity made simple Introduction Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The Groups change of control provisions are standard practice in the US where many of the SMT, including the CEO, are located and to renegotiate contracts would likely represent an increased cost for the Company where this provision may never be triggered.
For future hires, the Committee will consider the appropriateness of the contractual provisions at that time, taking into account prevailing market practice in the geography that the executive is located.
The Companys policy on termination payments is to consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the executives contractual terms, the circumstances of termination and any duty to mitigate.
The table below summarises how incentives are typically treated in different circumstances: Reason for leaving Treatment Bonus Summary dismissal, resignation Awards lapse.
Good leaver Eligible for an award to the extent that performance conditions have been satisfied, pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year served, with Committee discretion to treat otherwise.
Change of control Eligible for an award to the extent that performance conditions have been satisfied up to the change of control, pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year served, with Committee discretion to treat otherwise.
Executives may be eligible for an enhanced bonus payment in the case of termination of employment within 18 months of a change of control, as described above.
Long-term incentives Summary dismissal, resignation Awards lapse.
Good leaver Outstanding awards will normally be pro-rated to the date of leaving, with Committee discretion to treat otherwise and with discretion to either test at the end of relevant performance periods, or immediately assess, whether or not relevant performance criteria have been met.
Change of control Outstanding awards will normally vest and be tested for performance over the period to change of control, and be pro-rated for time based on the proportion of the period served, with Committee discretion to treat otherwise.
Executives may be eligible for additional vesting in the case of termination of employment within 18 months of a change of control.
All-employee schemes Treated in line with applicable scheme rules External appointments of Executive Directors Executive Directors may accept external appointments with the prior approval of the Chairman, provided that such appointments do not prejudice the executives ability to fulfil their duties for the Group.
Any fees for outside appointments would normally be retained by the Director.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in Group The Committee takes into account the general basic salary increase being offered to employees elsewhere in the Group when annually reviewing the salary increases and remuneration for the Executive Directors.
Employees have not been consulted in respect of the design of the Groups senior executive remuneration policy.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee takes shareholder feedback into careful consideration when reviewing remuneration and regularly reviews the Remuneration policy in the context of key institutional shareholder guidelines and best practice.
It is the Committees policy to consult with major shareholders prior to making any major changes to its executive remuneration structure.

Base Salary During FY18, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the salaries of Kris Hagerman and Nick Bray, who were each awarded an increase of 2.6 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively, effective 1 July 2018, as follows: Executive Director 1 July 2018 1 July 2017 Increase % Kris Hagerman $740,000 $721,000 2.6 Nick Bray 300,000 293,000 2.4 Pension and Benefits Kris Hagerman receives medical and dental insurance, travel insurance, life and disability insurance, a reimbursement of up to $10,000 per annum for the preparation of his tax returns and, under his employers standard US 401 k savings plan for all US employees, is entitled to receive a matching contribution of up to three per cent of his salary, subject to any annual maximum contribution applicable to US 401 k savings plans from time to time.
For 2018, this annual maximum is $24,500.
Nick Bray is entitled to receive up to five per cent of his base salary as a contribution to a group personal pension scheme.
In FY18 he also received an annual car allowance of 14,000 paid monthly, life insurance, private medical and critical illness insurance, travel insurance, personal accident insurance and employee assistance programme arrangements.
Incentive Outcomes for FY18 Annual bonus The Group operates an annual performance-related bonus scheme for a number of senior executives including Executive Directors.
Bonus opportunities for FY18 were 200 per cent of salary for Kris Hagerman and 160 per cent of salary for Nick Bray.
Target bonus was 50 per cent of the maximum opportunity.
The level of annual bonus earned in any one year is based on Group performance against predetermined financial targets for the year and personal performance.
In FY18, the bonus was based 80 per cent on billings and EBITDA, as defined by the scheme rules, with 12.5 per cent of maximum vesting for threshold performance and 50 per cent for target performance.
The remaining 20 per cent of the bonus opportunity is based on personal performance.
No bonus is awarded for performance below the threshold.
The financial element payout is based on the lower of the implied payouts for billings and EBITDA, so to achieve any vesting of this element, executives were required to perform on both billings and EBITDA.
73 Annual Report on Remuneration continued Financial performance The financial targets for the FY18 annual bonus are no longer considered commercially sensitive, and are disclosed in full, alongside performance against these targets, below: Threshold Target Stretch Implied vesting Performance measure 12.5% payout 50% payout 100% payout Achievement % of element Billings $686M $750M $899M $738M 43% EBITDA $172M $188M $226M $185M 43% Performance was measured using constant currency exchange rates.
For levels of performance between the points set out in the table above, bonus payout was determined on a straight-line, pro-rata basis.
The overall bonus payout was based on the lower of the implied payouts for billings and EBITDA, and was therefore 43 per cent of maximum for the financial element.
Personal performance Following the end of FY18, the Committee assessed each Executive Directors performance against personal objectives set at the start of the year.
Performance of the Executive Directors in respect of FY18 was assessed to warrant a payout of 48 per cent for the personal element.

75 Annual Report on Remuneration continued The RSU awards are not subject to future performance conditions, and will vest over four years, subject to continued employment, with 25 per cent of the awards vesting on 1 June 2018 and the remainder vesting on a quarterly basis thereafter until 1 June 2021.
The PSU awards vest subject to the vesting outcome implied by performance against annual targets over the three years to the financial year ending 31 March 2020, with the award vesting to the extent that targets are met on the third anniversary of grant.
Targets for the three years are set at the start of the performance period.
Vesting is based on the lower of the implied payouts for billings and cash EBITDA, with 25 per cent vesting for threshold performance, 100 per cent for stretch performance, and 125 per cent vesting for maximum performance.
The table on page 75 sets out the face value of awards granted in FY18 which can vest, subject to performance set out above, and in the table below.
No awards will vest for performance below the threshold.
Performance Targets for Outstanding PSU Awards The Committee believes that disclosing the individual annual financial performance targets for FY19 and FY20 in this report would put the Company at a competitive disadvantage to its international and privately held competitors, that are not subject to similar disclosure requirements.
However, the Committee remains committed to disclosing on a retrospective basis the annual financial targets attaching to outstanding PSU awards, and performance against these.

The gap between the previous Stretch and Super Stretch targets has been removed for all PSU awards made from FY18 onwards.
Actual vesting is dependent on the performance against targets for each of the financial years FY18 to FY20 and is based on the lower of the implied payouts for billings and cash EBITDA i. e. the measures are equally weighted.
Vesting on a sliding scale between 25 and 100 per cent applies between threshold and stretch, and a 1.25 multiplier applies up to the maximum 125 per cent vesting for performance above stretch.
76 Cybersecurity made simple Introduction Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Dilution Limits Sophos will continue to manage dilution within the context of maintaining award levels within a 10 per cent limit over fiveyears, the limit that has applied since the equity incentive plans were approved at IPO.
The Committee is aware that this is higher than the limit adopted by many UK companies and preferred by many institutional investors of 5 per cent over 10 years in respect of discretionary awards and 10 per cent over 10 years in respect of all schemes.
The Committee believes the higher limit we operate is necessary in part because of the broad based nature of our equity incentive plans, under which shares are provided to a large proportion of our employees including SAYE and ESPP schemes open to most employees.
The equity incentive plans are a key part of the Groups employee compensation package, and reflects the need to be able to compete with other US and international companies for the high-calibre employees and executives required to secure Sophos future success.
At 31 March 2018, dilution under all our incentive schemes was c. 6.7 per cent, and continues to reflects the front-loaded approach to equity incentive grants following the IPO.

77 Annual Report on Remuneration continued Annual bonus For the year ending 31 March 2019, the Committee will operate the annual bonus using the same framework and measures as used in FY18.
Billings and EBITDA targets have been set by the Committee and will require Executive Directors to deliver significant stretch performance to achieve full payout.

All of bonus will be paid in cash.
Bonus payments are subject to malus and clawback provisions.
Long-Term Incentive Plan In FY19, the Committee intends to grant long-term incentive awards to Executive Directors in line with the stated remuneration policy and using the same measures as were used in FY18.
Awards will be made over performance share units at least 75 per cent of the total award and restricted shares, within the normal policy limits.

During FY18 the Company published an interim statement in response to notification of its inclusion in the Investment Associations Public Register of listed companies who received opposition of more than 20 per cent on any resolution in a General Meeting the 2017 Interim Statement.
It is the Committees belief that the Groups remuneration policy the Policy measures and rewards the performance of the Groups executives against the best measures of the Groups performance given its current size and stage of growth, and further that these metrics are appropriate now for focusing the Groups executives on growing the business and establishing a strong customer base from which to build on.
However, as already noted, the Committee is committed to keeping this under review and recognises that as Sophos matures as a business, it may become appropriate to look at a different, possibly broader, selection of metrics with which to focus the Groups executives on delivering in additional areas.
The Policy is next due for shareholder approval in 2019 and the Committee will continue to review developments in market practice in advance of its renewal.
