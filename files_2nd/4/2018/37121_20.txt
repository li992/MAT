Directors shareholdings audited The following table sets out a summary of the Directors interests in shares including any interests held by connected persons.
Interests in shares are shown as at 10 May 2018.
Between 31 December 2018 and the date of this report there have been no changes in the Directors shareholdings.
The guideline shareholding for Executive Directors for 2018 was 100% of salary.
At 31 December 2018, Olivier Brousse and Patrick OD Bourke held shares worth 167% and 289% of salary respectively.
Under the new Policy, the guideline shareholding for Executive Directors has been increased to 200% of salary.
Shares counting towards achievement of this guideline include beneficially owned shares and unvested shares net of tax held under the DSBP.
Of the total interests in shares held at 31 December 2018, the following shares are subject to a post-cessation holding requirement: 1 2 Vested LTIP awards Outstanding LTIP awards Olivier Brousse 163,628 935,043 Patrick O'D Bourke 108,615 614,042 1.
Shares vesting from the 2015 LTIP award which are subject to a two year post-vesting holding requirement.
These shares are included in the number of shares owned on 31 December 2018 in the table above.
Unvested LTIP awards will ordinarily lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain circumstances see page 86, participants are allowed to retain a right to the shares.
In such circumstances, the shares will ordinarily vest on the normal vesting date and a two year post-vesting holding period still applies irrespective of employment status.
Payments to past Directors audited There were no payments to past Directors during the year.
Payments for loss of office audited No payments have been made for loss of office in the year.
Relative importance of the expenditure on pay The table below shows the Groups expenditure on pay compared with distributions to shareholders.

This comparator group was used because the Committee believes it gives the best understanding of underlying increases, while avoiding distortions from currency fluctuation and different economic conditions in other countries.
Salary Benefits Bonus 1 2 CEO 7.1% 15.0% 10.9% Average for other UK employees 2.6% 3.5% 5.3% 1 The CEOs salary increase for 2018 is explained on page 59 of the 2017 Annual Report.
2 This is due to an increase of c. 200 in the medical insurance premium which was consistent with the increase for all UK employees.
The Committee considers internal and external relativities when making pay decisions.
With less than 250 UK employees, we are not required to disclose Chief Executive Officer to employee pay ratios.
However, in order to increase the transparency of our reporting in this area, we are including the tables below ahead of the new reporting requirements.
The ratios compare the total remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer, as set out in this report, against the total remuneration of the median UK and Group employees as well as UK and Group employees in the lower and upper quartiles.
This disclosure will build up over time to cover a rolling 10-year period.
A significant proportion of the Chief Executive Officers pay is delivered in LTIP awards which are in part linked to the Companys share price movements over the longer term.
Therefore, the ratios will depend significantly on the outcomes of the LTIP and may fluctuate from one year to the next.
The tables also include ratios covering salary to enable a further comparison.
The process to ensure that employees are paid fairly is set out on pages 47 to 50 of this report.

The employees at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles lower, median and upper quartile were determined as at 31 December 2018 based on full-time equivalent remuneration for all Group UK employees other than for variable pay where the actual amount to be paid has been used.
Option A methodology, as set out in the Companies Miscellaneous Reporting Regulations 2018, was selected as this is considered the most statistically accurate under the reporting regulations.
Employees on reduced pay are excluded from the calculation.
Joiners have been excluded as their annualised package may not be comparable to the Chief Executive Officer due to limited participation in the variable pay schemes.
The data for the three individuals identified has been considered and fairly reflects pay at the relevant quartiles amongst the Group and UK employee population respectively.
Each of the employees was a full-time employee during the year and none received an exceptional award which would otherwise inflate their pay figures.

Link to performance Base salary levels are set at a level to reflect the experience, skills and responsibilities of the individual as well as the scope and scale of their role.
Increases to base salary will reflect individual performance and contribution as well as the pay and conditions for other employees of the Group.
Maximum opportunity While there is no maximum salary, increases will normally be in line with the typical level of increase awarded to other employees of the Group.
However, increases above this level may be offered in certain circumstances such as where an Executive Director has been promoted, has had a change in responsibilities, to reflect increased experience in the role, or where there has been a significant change in the size and or scope of the business.
For details of salary levels from 1 January 2019 see the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 79.

81 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED Annual Bonus Purpose and To recognise and reward the delivery of short-term strategic and financial objectives which contribute towards long-term link to strategy sustainable growth.
Operation The Executive Directors participate in the same overall bonus structure as other Group employees except for those employees within JLCM.
To the extent any bonus exceeds 60% of salary or where higher 60% of maximum bonus potential, the full amount of any excess will be deferred in shares under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
Awards under the DSBP vest in equal tranches on the first, second and third anniversary of grant, normally subject to continued employment.
Dividend equivalents that accrue on the DSBP shares during the vesting period may be paid in cash and or shares at the time of vesting.
Clawback and, in the case of deferred share awards, malus provisions apply.
Link to performance The size of the bonus is assessed by the Committee taking into account performance against a scorecard of corporate metrics.
The choice of metrics is reviewed by the Committee each financial year, with threshold, target and stretch levels of performance set for each measure.
There is no fixed weighting between metrics.
Details of the metrics used to determine the 2018 bonus are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 74 and the metrics to be used for the 2019 bonus are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 80.
The Committee uses the scorecard as a guide to help it consider the overall performance of the business and the appropriate size of the bonus.
The Committee will, in its absolute discretion, take into account all relevant circumstances when determining the size of the bonus, recognising that, given the long-term nature of the business, metrics relating to projects invested in may move from one year to another outside managements control.
The Committee also has the discretion to reduce the size of the bonus if it feels that the level of bonus is not supported by the underlying financial and operational performance of the business.
Once performance against the corporate metrics has been determined, the calculation of an individuals allocation will be subject to an assessment by the Committee of both Group performance and individual performance.
The amount allocated based on individual performance cannot exceed 20% of the maximum.
The Committee may reduce a participants bonus including to zero to reflect adverse events, e. g. health and safety breaches or poor individual performance.
Maximum opportunity Up to 150% of salary 60% of maximum for target performance.
For 2019, the maximum bonus will be limited to 100% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
No more than 25% of maximum will be payable for threshold performance.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Purpose and To incentivise and reward the creation of long-term shareholder value.
link to strategy Operation At the discretion of the Committee, Executive Directors will normally receive annual awards of shares in the form of nil or nominal cost options or conditional awards which will usually vest on the third anniversary of grant or, if later, when the Committee determines that the performance conditions have been satisfied.
The awards are subject to the achievement of performance and service conditions.
Executive Directors are required to retain any shares vesting under an LTIP award net of tax for a further two years post-vesting.
Dividend equivalents that accrue on award shares during the vesting period may be paid at the time of vesting.
Clawback and malus provisions apply.
Link to performance Awards are subject to the achievement of performance targets linked to the long-term success of the Company.
These targets are currently based 50% on growth in NAV per share and 50% on total shareholder return TSR.
However, different performance metrics weightings may be set for future awards to ensure that the LTIP remains aligned to the Companys strategy.
A sliding scale of targets is applied for each performance metric, with no more than 25% of that part of the award vesting for achievement of the threshold target.
Maximum opportunity Up to 200% of salary.
It is intended that awards for 2019 will be limited to 175% and 150% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer respectively.
82 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED Shareholding guidelines The Executive Directors are required to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200% of salary and are expected to retain all shares vesting under the DSBP and LTIP net of tax until such time as the guideline shareholding has been achieved.
The Committee notes the advice set out in the 2018 Code for executives to be required to retain a shareholding in the Company for a period post cessation of employment.
The Committee has reviewed its policy in this regard and the revised policy is set out below: Continued interest in shares post cessation Share type Retention requirement of employment 1 Unvested shares under the DSBP and LTIP Unvested share awards will ordinarily lapse Up to three years in respect of DSBP.
However, in Up to five years in respect of LTIP shares certain prescribed circumstances see page 86, remainder of performance period plus a participants will be allowed to retain a right to two year post-vesting holding requirement.
In such circumstances, the shares will ordinarily continue to vest on the normal 1 vesting date and for the LTIP awards, an additional holding period will apply.
Vested LTIP shares subject to a holding period The holding period continues to apply Up to two years irrespective of employment status.
Other beneficially owned shares None 1.
See page 86, a different policy applies in respect of DSBP awards granted prior to 9 May 2019.
Having reviewed the Executive Directors existing shareholdings, the Committee is satisfied that the above policy provides sufficient exposure for the executives to the long-term share price movement of the Company.
Detail on the Executive Directors current interests in shares and the proportion to which a post-employment retention requirement applies are set out on page 77.
Annual bonus performance metrics The size of the overall bonus is assessed by the Committee taking into account performance against a scorecard of corporate metrics which reflect the growth of the business.
The choice of metrics may change for future award cycles, but was the following for 2018: Metric Link to strategy 1 NAV This measures growth in the value of the Group's net asset value.
Distributions This reflects the Group's ability to realise cash distributions from its investments.
Disposals Disposals of existing investments provide additional funding for new investments.
Special dividends payable to shareholders are based on disposal proceeds.
New investments New investments are designed to contribute to future NAV growth.
Value enhancements Value enhancements increase the investment portfolio valuation and therefore contribute to future NAV growth.
Profit before tax This is linked to growth in NAV in any given year and in addition provides an appropriate focus on cost control.
In 2018 the metrics were adjusted, as appropriate, to take into account the Rights Issue.
The majority of the bonus currently 80% at an Executive Director level is based on the above assessment of corporate performance.
The remainder of the bonus currently 20% at an Executive Director level is assessed on individual performance.
LTIP metrics Awards under the LTIP vest subject to delivering against metrics which are aligned to long-term shareholder value creation.
The choice of metric may change for future award cycles, but is currently the following: Metric Link to strategy TSR This measures the total return to shareholders provided through share price appreciation and dividends.
TSR is measured relative to performance against a comparator group consisting of the members of the FTSE 250 index.
TSR provides a clear alignment between the value created for shareholders and the reward earned by executives.
NAV per share This measures the overall value of the Group's net assets adjusted for dividends paid or approved divided by the number of shares in issue and provides an assessment of the growth of the business over time.
83 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED Incentive plan operation The Committee operates the Companys incentive plans according to their respective rules and consistent with normal market practice, the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant, including flexibility in a number of regards.
This includes dealing with leavers and making adjustments to awards following acquisitions, disposals, changes in share capital and other merger and acquisition activity.
For awards granted in respect of performance periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, the Committee retains the ability to scale-back the extent to which any LTIP award vests, or to impose any additional conditions on vesting, where it considers it is appropriate to do so for example, where the vesting outcome does not reflect wider Company or individual performance.
The Committee also retains the ability to adjust the metrics, weighting and targets for the annual bonus plan and outstanding LTIP awards if events occur which cause it to determine that the conditions are no longer appropriate and the amendment is required so that the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Companys major shareholders.
Clawback and malus The Company has the right to reduce the number of shares over which an award was granted under the DSBP or LTIP where it is discovered that the award was granted over too many shares as a result of a material misstatement in the Companys accounts, where there has been an error or reliance on misleading information when assessing the size of the award that was granted, and or it is discovered that the participant could reasonably have been dismissed as a result of his her misconduct.
In addition, for awards granted in respect of performance periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, the Company may also apply malus or clawback to an award where the Company suffers a material downturn in its operational or financial performance which is at least partly attributable to management failure and to which the relevant participant has made a material contribution: where the Company has suffered an instance of corporate failure resulting in the appointment of a liquidator or administrator: and or where there is a failure of risk management and or regulatory non-compliance resulting in material damage to the Companys business or reputation.
The Company may also clawback cash bonus awards or previously vested DSBP and LTIP awards in the circumstances set out above to ensure that the full value of any overpayment is recouped.
In these circumstances the Committee may apply clawback within three years of the payment of the cash bonus, date of grant of a DSBP award or the vesting of an LTIP award.
Shareholder views The Remuneration Committee values the views of the Companys shareholders and guidance from shareholder representative bodies.
Shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM, as well as any additional feedback received during the year, is considered as part of the Companys annual remuneration review.
The Committee consults with major shareholders in advance of making any significant changes to remuneration arrangements.
Link to the remuneration policy for all employees A consistent approach to remuneration is applied across the Group with the same overarching principle that reward should be sufficient to attract and retain high calibre talent and that reward should support the delivery of the business strategy.
The same approach to salary reviews is applied to all employees and the Executive Directors participate in the same overall bonus structure as other Group employees except those employees within JLCM.
However only the most senior employees are subject to deferral arrangements and some other employees may have a higher weighting on individual performance.
Other senior employees also participate in the same LTIP as the Executive Directors.
There are some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors compared to other employees, which the Committee believes are necessary to reflect the different levels of responsibility.
The two main differences are the increased emphasis on performance-related pay for Executive Directors through a higher variable pay opportunity and a greater focus on long-term alignment through bonus deferral, additional holding periods for LTIP awards and minimum shareholding guidelines.
The Committee did not formally consult with employees in respect of the design of the Directors remuneration policy.
However, a review of the workforce engagement programme is underway, including how the Company will engage with employees in respect of executive pay.
84 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED Remuneration reward scenarios The total remuneration for the Executive Directors that could result from the remuneration policy in 2019 is shown below: 100% 548 Minimum Target 39% 31% 30% 1,406 Maximum 26% 34% 40% 2,120 Maximum 50% 2,543 21% 29% 50% share price growth Minimum 366 100% Target 805 46% 24% 30% Maximum 31% 28% 41% 1,179 Maximum 50% 1,422 26% 23% 51% share price growth 0 250 500 750 1,000 1,250 1,500 1,750 2,000 2,250 2,500 2,750 000 Fixed Pay Annual Bonus Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP Notes: 1.
Fixed pay consists of salary, benefits and pension.
Salary is the amount to be paid in 2019 and benefits are based on the estimated value for 2019.
Pension is shown as 12.9% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 12% for the Chief Financial Officer.
For the Chief Financial Officer, full year equivalent values have been shown.
The maximum bonus opportunity for 2019 is 150% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 100% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer, with 60% of the maximum earned at target performance.
The amount of any bonus in excess of 60% of salary is deferred in shares, which vest subject to continued employment over one, two and three years.
The maximum LTIP award for 2019 is 175% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 150% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
An award of 50% of the maximum is assumed for target performance.
LTIP awards are subject to a three year performance period and the number of shares that vest net of tax must be held for a further two years post vesting.
The minimum, target and maximum scenarios exclude the impact of possible share price appreciation.
A further scenario has been included to illustrate the impact of a 50% increase in the share price on the value of LTIP awards in the maximum scenario.
The basis of the calculation of the share price appreciation is that the share price used in the calculation for the further scenario is assumed to increase by 50% across the performance period.
No assumptions have been made as to the value of dividend equivalents on share awards in any scenario.
Executive Director Recruitment and Promotions Remuneration arrangements for a new appointment will be set in accordance with the policy for the existing Executive Directors, except as noted below: If it is considered appropriate to set the salary for a new Executive Director at a level which is below market, his or her salary may be increased in future periods to achieve the desired market positioning by way of an above inflation increase or increases, subject to his or her continued development in the role.
Pension arrangements for new appointments to the Board will be aligned with the rate applying to the majority of the employees in the country in which the Executive Director is to be based.
Any bonus payment for the year of joining will normally be pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the period worked and the Committee may set different performance measures and targets, depending on the timing and nature of the appointment.
In the case of an Executive Director being recruited overseas, being recruited by the Company to relocate overseas or an existing Executive Director being asked to relocate overseas, expatriate benefits may be provided for a specified period.
The Committee may also approve the payment of one-off relocation-related expenses and legal fees.
Maximum variable pay is limited under the policy to 350% of salary.
However, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements to compensate an individual for remuneration forfeited on leaving a former employer, if it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and therefore its shareholders.
Such payments would take account of remuneration relinquished and would mirror as far as possible the delivery mechanism, time horizons and performance requirement attached to that remuneration.
Where possible any such payments would be facilitated through the Companys existing share plans, but, if not, the awards may be granted outside these plans as permitted under the Listing Rules which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate the recruitment of an Executive Director.
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed to pay out according to its original terms or adjusted as considered appropriate to reflect the new role.
Executive Directors service agreements Olivier Brousse entered into a service agreement with the Company on 16 January 2015.
Luciana Germinario entered into a service agreement with the Company on 22 January 2019.
There is no fixed term and the contracts continue until terminated by either party giving 12 months notice.
85 Luciana Germinario Olivier Brousse Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED Policy on payment for departure from office The Company is entitled to terminate the Executive Directors employment by payment of a cash sum in lieu of notice equal to salary and the cost to the Company of providing contractual benefits including pension but excluding bonus during what would otherwise have been the notice period.
A payment in lieu of notice can, at the Companys discretion, be paid as a lump sum or in equal monthly instalments over the notice period.
There is a mechanism in the service agreement to reduce the instalments where the Executive Director commences alternative employment during the notice period.
The Company may also terminate the Executive Directors employment with immediate effect and with no liability to make any further payments in certain prescribed circumstances e. g. in the case of a serious or repeated breach of the Executive Directors obligations.
Outplacement services and reimbursement of legal costs may also be provided.
Where appropriate, medical coverage may continue for a period post cessation.
The Committee may pay any statutory entitlements or settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination of employment, where considered in the best interest of the Company.
The table below sets out the general position in respect of incentive arrangements for departing Executive Directors.
In accordance with the terms of the relevant incentive plan rules, and based on the circumstances of any departure, the Committee has discretion to determine how an Executive Director should be categorised for each element and determine the relevant vesting levels: Voluntary resignation or termination for cause Annual Bonus No entitlement.
DSBP Unvested awards will lapse LTIP Unvested awards will lapse Death, ill health, disability, redundancy or retirement agreed with the Board or for any other reason determined by the Committee Annual Bonus Bonus may be payable subject to performance.
Awards normally pro-rated based on the period worked during the financial year.
If the executive has left employment by the payment date, the bonus will be paid wholly in cash.
DSBP Unvested awards granted prior to 9 May 2019 will vest on the date of cessation with no pro-rata reduction.
Awards granted after 9 May 2019 will continue to vest on the normal vesting date, unless the Committee determines that early vesting should apply.
LTIP Awards will vest on the normal vesting date, subject to performance and a time pro-rata reduction.
The Committee may, in its absolute discretion, determine that awards can vest, subject to performance, earlier than the normal vesting date and, if a participant dies, the award will ordinarily vest, subject to performance, on the date of death unless the Committee decides it should vest on the normal vesting date.
In any of the circumstances described above, the Committee may determine that the pro-rata reduction should not apply at all or should apply to a lesser extent if it considers that exceptional circumstances justify such treatment.
The post-vesting holding requirement and post-employment shareholding policy continue to apply.
Departure on agreed terms Treatment will normally fall between the two treatments described above, subject to the discretion of the Committee and the terms of any termination agreement.
Any outstanding awards under an all employee share plan or separate buy-out arrangements entered into on the recruitment of an Executive Director will be treated in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan award.
In the event of a change of control or voluntary winding-up, unvested LTIP awards will vest at the time of the relevant event subject to performance and a time-based pro-rata reduction although the Committee may determine that the pro-rata reduction should not apply at all or should apply to a lesser extent if it considers that exceptional circumstances justify such a treatment.
Unvested DSBP awards will vest early and in full.
The Committee may require LTIP and DSBP awards to be exchanged for equivalent awards over shares in a new holding company if the change of control is part of an internal reorganisation.
In the event that a demerger, special dividend or other similar event is proposed which, in the opinion of the Committee, would affect the price of a share to a material extent, the Committee may decide that unvested LTIP and DSBP awards will vest on the same basis as described above or that such awards should be adjusted in such manner as the Committee may determine.
86 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED External Board appointments The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive directors in other companies and that these appointments can enhance their knowledge and experience to the benefit of the Company.
It is the Companys policy that Board approval is required before any external appointment may be accepted by an Executive Director.

The maximum aggregate fee is set at 750,000 in the Companys Articles of Association.
Current fee levels are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 80.
Fee levels are reviewed on a periodic basis, and may be increased taking into account factors such as the scope and time commitment of the role and market levels in companies of comparable size and complexity and other broadly comparable companies.
Additional fees may be paid as appropriate.
Expenses The Chairman and the Non-executive Directors are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable expenses and any tax payable thereon.
Letters of The letter of appointment for the Chairman states that his appointment is expected to last for at least three years but will be appointment subject to annual re-election at the AGM.
