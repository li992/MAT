Discretion to override formulaic outcomes The Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM contains these provisions.
Post-termination holding requirement It has been the practice to apply post-vesting holding requirements in respect of Directors incentive scheme shares, notwithstanding an earlier termination date: however, the 2017 Policy does not specify a minimum post-termination holding requirement encompassing all shares.
The Committee will continue to monitor evolving market practice.
Pension alignment It is the Committees current intention to bring new Executive Directors in at a pension contribution aligned with the average employee contribution.
The Committee does not intend to change the contractual provision for existing Executive Directors.
Extended malus and clawback The current malus and clawback provisions of the MIP already exceed the best practice guidance associated with the new Code.

Definitions: EPS and OCF are measured using International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs based on the audited results of the Group and subject to the discretion of the Committee with regard to one-off items.
EPS EPS relates to our strategic objective to grow profits.
EPS grew by 22 per cent to 26.29 pence in 2018.
OCF OCF targets are set by reference to EBITDA and relate to our strategic objective to convert projects into cash flow.
The OCF to EBITDA ratio was 92 per cent in 2018.
Non-financial targets Our customers are at the heart of our business model, and our measurement of customer service uses factors such as product availability, on-time delivery performance and administrative and delivery accuracy to assess performance.
The Groups average customer service performance, assessed monthly, exceeded its minimum target of 95 per cent throughout 2018.
The Group also continued its excellent performance against its stated objective of keeping days lost to accidents to a minimum, by reference to the 2015 rate.
Days lost to accidents year on year actually reduced by a further 26 per cent.
Had either of these targets not been met, the overall level of MIP award would have reduced by 10 per cent: the achievement of these measures means that no reduction factor will apply.
See page 70 for details of the awards made.

The OCF to EBITDA ratio ensures that this growth in profit is not at the expense of its sustainability.
The customer metric and health and safety performance conditions reflect our commitment to service and employee wellbeing and the need to ensure that growth and profitability are not achieved in a way that is detrimental to the Companys customers and employees.

For those elements of remuneration provided in shares in 2017 and 2018, we have separated out their original value on grant and the additional value generated due to share price growth over the vesting period.
It is the Committees view that one of the key objectives of equity-based remuneration is to align Executives interests and those of shareholders.
With such a high proportion of MIP awards expressed in or linked to shares, the impact of share price movement on overall Executive reward can be significant.
The increase in the value of awards due to share price growth over the vesting periods is another demonstration of how our Policy aligns with strategy and the interests of shareholders.
Explanatory notes on the single figure can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration page 69.

In the Committees opinion, the impact on the total reward of the Director is more important than the single figure in any one year.
This approach encourages Directors to take a long-term view of the sustainable performance of the Company, which is critical in a cyclical business.
The ability for the Directors to gain and lose, dependent on the share price performance of the Company, at a level which is material to their total remuneration is a key facet of the Companys Remuneration Policy.
The following table sets out the single figure for 2018, the number of shares held by the Executive Directors at the beginning and end of the financial year and the impact on the value of these shares taking the opening price and closing price for the year.

In setting all elements of remuneration the Company seeks to benchmark itself against comparable companies.
The aim of the Companys policy is to attract, retain and continue to motivate talented employees while aligning remuneration with the achievement of the Companys strategic objectives.
When determining remuneration policy specifically for the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee also addressed the following: Factor How addressed under the Remuneration Policy Clarity The Companys performance-based remuneration framework is linked to the implementation of the Companys strategy.
Overall strategic performance is measured through KPIs which are the same measures as used for the incentive plan.
This provides clarity to all stakeholders on the relationship between the successful implementation of the Companys strategy and the remuneration paid.
Simplicity The Company operates a single incentive plan for Executive Directors and senior management that incorporates both an annual bonus and a long-term share incentive plan, using common performance measures that are clearly explained in reports to shareholders and stakeholders.
Risk The Remuneration Policy: sets defined limits on the maximum award which can be earned: requires deferral of a substantial proportion of the incentives in shares for a material period of time: aligns performance conditions with the strategy of the Company: incorporates an underpin on part of the incentive: and ensures there is sufficient flexibility to adjust payments through malus and clawback and that the Committee has overriding discretion to depart from formulaic outcomes.
These elements mitigate against the risk of target-based incentives by: limiting the maximum value that can be earned: deferring the value in shares for the long term which helps ensure that the performance earning the award is sustainable and thereby discouraging short-term behaviours: aligning any reward to the achievement of Company strategy: using an underpin to focus on the sustainability of performance over the longer term: reducing the award or cancelling it if the behaviours giving rise to the award are inappropriate: and reducing the award or cancelling it if it appears that the criteria on which the award was based do not reflect the underlying performance of the Company.
Predictability The Committee provided illustrations of potential outcomes when the MIP was submitted for shareholder approval in 2014.
The measurement of performance over a single year provides a more predictable outcome and aligns with the performance actually delivered during the year.
This helps avoid the situation where rewards are tested against historical performance measures, but performance in the year of vesting may not appear to warrant the outcome.
Proportionality The Companys incentive plan clearly rewards the successful implementation of its strategy and, through deferral into shares or share equivalents, ensures that the Executive Directors have a strong drive to ensure that the performance is sustainable over the long term.
Alignment to culture The focus on long-term sustainable performance and share participation is a key part of the Companys culture.
This is supported by the Remuneration Policy.
It should be noted that the Remuneration Policy operated over the 2018 financial year as intended by the Committee.

Process In order for the Committee to fulfil its responsibility for the oversight and review of wider workforce pay and policies and incentives and ensure they are designed to support the desired culture and values of the Group, a formal process has been introduced, under which the Committee receives a report twice a year from the Company setting out key details of remuneration throughout the Company.
The information received by the Committee in this report is then reviewed at the end of the financial year.
The reports will incorporate, for each area of the business, data on: salary and salary increases: general positioning of remuneration packages: bonus total eligible population, target and maximum range, performance conditions, payment method, scope for discretion recovery under malus and clawback provisions : sales and commission plans: long-term incentive plans total eligible population, target and maximum range, performance conditions, payment method, scope for discretion recovery under malus and clawback provisions, vesting and holding periods : and pension schemes defined contribution plan, total eligible population, Company contribution and employee contribution.
As Senior Independent Director and designated Director for employee engagement, Janet Ashdown will avail herself of opportunities to attend employee forums within a planned engagement framework developed following the work done with consultants Corporate Culture in 2017 and 2018.
The Committee also expects to receive feedback from employee surveys and the Company town hall meeting programme of site visits by the Executive Directors and senior management.
Marshalls plc 62 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Corporate governance The Committee has the authority to ask for additional information from the Company in order to carry out its responsibilities.
Clearly the levels of remuneration and the packages offered will vary across the Company depending on the employees level of seniority and role.
The Committee is not looking for a homogeneous approach: however, when conducting its review it is paying particular attention to: whether the element of remuneration is consistent with the Company remuneration principles see page 59 : whether the incentive structure is designed in a way that promotes the Companys strategy, values and culture: if there are differences, they are objectively justifiable: and whether the approach seems fair and equitable in the context of other employee packages.
Once the Committee has conducted its review of the wider workforce remuneration and incentives it considers the approach applied to the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior management.
In particular, the Committee is focused on whether within the framework set out above, the approach to the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior management is consistent with that applied to the wider workforce.
Overview of findings The key findings of the Committees review for 2018 are as follows: Average salary increases for employees across the Company are being applied on an equitable and objective basis.
The average rise of 3.3 per cent is the same as that applied to the salaries of the Executive Directors, consistent with our policy to provide generally the same percentage increase for employees whose roles have not changed during the year.
The majority of our employees are able to share in the success of the Company through incentive compensation.
In line with market practice the level of incentive compensation and whether it is paid solely in cash or in a mixture of cash and deferred shares depends on the level of seniority of the employee.
The incentive approach applied to the Executive Directors aligns with the wider Company policy on incentives, which is to associate a higher percentage of at-risk performance pay with the seniority of the role, and to increase the amount of incentive deferred, provided in equity and or measured over the longer term for roles with greater seniority.
The following table shows the cascade of incentives throughout the Company: Participation Participation Participation in in Element A in Element B Participation in all-employee of the MIP of the MIP other bonus or equity plans Level number percentage range percentage range commission plans Sharesave SPP Executive Directors 2 150% of salary 100% of salary X Executive Committee 6 85% to 120% of salary 55% to 70% of salary X Senior management 12 45% to 55% of salary 30% to 35% of salary X Employees in BSP 49 15% to 45% 5% bonus shares Employees in other job related bonus or Sales bonuses commission schemes 460 Equity participation is offered to all employees of the Company through the Share Purchase Plan and SAYE schemes and to managers and the Executive through the MIP or the BSP, each of which involves the award of shares.
It is the Companys wider pay policy to allow employees to share in Company success by means of equity participation.
In line with the Companys wider policy on pay, all employees are eligible for enrolment in a Company defined contribution pension arrangement.
The current basic contribution 4 per cent employer, 4 per cent employee for the Marshalls Group is likely to increase by agreement with the workforce in 2020.
The Committee would expect the pension contribution for new Executive Directors and senior management who may be recruited in future to be aligned more closely with the pension contribution applicable to the wider workforce.
In line with the wider Company policy on pay, the Company offers life assurance cover for death in service to all its employees.
The minimum lump sum benefit for all employees has increased to 50,000 with effect from 1 January 2019.
Other benefits such as private medical cover and health screening are offered according to the level of seniority of the role in line with market practice.
In summary the Committee is satisfied that the approach to remuneration across the Company is consistent with the Companys principles of remuneration.
Further, in the Committees opinion the approach to Executive remuneration aligns with wider Company pay policy and there are no anomalies specific to the Executive Directors.
Marshalls plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 63 Corporate governance Remuneration Committee Report continued Fairness, diversity and wider workforce considerations continued Living Wage employer Marshalls is proud to be a Living Wage employer, underscoring its commitment to its employees.
Marshalls benchmarked its average salaries against other similar companies as part of the review of job evaluations carried out by external consultants in connection with the HR system implementation and this showed that its average pay rates for equivalent jobs were generally competitive or at the higher end of the comparable range.
Bonus Share Plan The Bonus Share Plan approved in 2015 provides the opportunity for those in the BSP to earn free bonus shares of up to 5 per cent of salary, which vest after 3 years subject to continued employment.
Sharesave Scheme Share Purchase Plan The Marshalls 2015 Sharesave Scheme was introduced to encourage wider ownership of Marshalls plc shares across the entire workforce, so that the employees are able to participate in the Groups success in a way that aligns their interests with those of shareholders.
The 2015 SAYE matured in December 2018 and employees may, until June 2019, exercise their option to acquire shares from their savings fund at a discounted share price of 2.91.
Participating employees in the Share Purchase Plan may purchase shares in the market on a monthly basis out of gross salary, another way of incentivising investment by employees in the Companys shares.
Fairness throughout our supply chain From living wages in the UK to the elimination of child labour in India, we are committed to ensuring that what is good for business is good for society.
Our approach to labour rights is driven by the ETI Base Code, which we adopted in 2005.
To ensure that the Base Code principles are embedded within operations and supply chains, we employ social auditors in India, China and Vietnam, which regularly carry out checks and audits to ensure that the Base Code is being upheld and to report any concerns or violations so that we can take swift action should we need to.
Marshalls has also worked closely with external organisations to evaluate our business and supply chain against the principles now embodied in the Modern Slavery Act 2015 to eliminate slavery in all its forms.
Our Modern Slavery Statement can be found on the Companys website www.
Marshalls was the first company in its sector to belong to the ETI and is committed to the ETI Base Code.
Pay comparisons CEO ratio Our CEO to employee pay ratios for 2018 are as follows: lower quartile 58:1 median 44:1 upper quartile 37:1 The calculation has been performed in line with the new Regulations Option A in line with best practice and is based on the total single figure of remuneration methodology.
To give context to this ratio, we have included a chart tracking CEO pay and average employee pay since Martyn Coffeys appointment alongside Marshalls TSR performance over the same period.
The Remuneration Committee has always been committed to ensuring that CEO reward is commensurate with performance.
The chart shows a clear alignment between shareholder returns and CEO single figure pay.
The CEO single figure for 2013 was affected by the retiring CEOs 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards vesting early on a pro-rata basis owing to his good leaver status.
The factors leading to the increase in the ratio over the previous 3 years is the strong performance of the Company reflected in the total shareholder return which has resulted in high levels of vesting of share-based incentives granted to the CEO.
Shareholders expect the CEO to have a significant proportion of pay based on performance and paid in shares.
It is this element of the package which provides the volatility in CEO remuneration and the variations in the ratio.
The Committee is satisfied that the underlying picture does not show a divergence trend between the CEO remuneration and employees generally, i. e. excluding share price volatility, the relationship with employee pay is consistent.
2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Ratio of single figure total remuneration to average employee 23.6x 30.6x 98.1x 32.0x 60.0x 51.4x 64.1x 44.6x Marshalls plc 64 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Corporate governance There is significant volatility in this ratio, and we believe that this is caused by the following: Our CEO pay is made up of a higher proportion of performance related incentives than that of our employees, in line with the expectations of our shareholders.
This introduces a higher degree of variability in CEO pay each year which affects the ratio.
The value of long-term incentives which measure performance over 3 years is disclosed in pay in the year it vests: this affects historical years up to 2017.
This increases the CEO pay in that year, again impacting the ratio for that year.
Long-term incentives are provided in shares, and therefore an increase in share price during any deferral or vesting period magnifies the impact of a long-term incentive award in the year in which it vests.
The high ratio in 2013 reflects the early vesting of long-term incentive awards held by the previous CEO, Graham Holden, on his retirement.
We recognise that the ratio is driven by the different structure of the pay of our CEO versus that of our employees, as well as the make-up of our workforce.
This ratio varies between businesses even in the same sector.
What is important from our perspective is that this ratio is influenced only by the differences in structure, and not by divergence in fixed pay between the CEO and wider workforce.
Where the base structure of remuneration is similar, for example between the Executive Committee and the CEO, the ratio is much more stable over time.
b The 2013 single figure is made up of the previous CEOs base salary and benefits up to 10 October 2013 and Martyn Coffeys proportionate entitlement to salary, benefits and annual bonus for his period of service in 2013.
It also includes the various incentive payments that crystallised as a result of Graham Holden being a good leaver by reason of retirement in 2013 see 2013 Remuneration Report for full details.

TSR is defined as share price growth plus reinvested dividends.
Marshalls plc was a constituent of the FTSE Small Cap Index for the period from January 2009 to August 2015 and became a constituent of the FTSE 250 in August 2015.
This chart shows the value at 31 December 2018 of 100 invested in Marshalls plc on 1 January 2009 compared with the value of 100 invested in i the FTSE Small Cap Index and ii the FTSE 250.
The other plotted points are the intervening financial year ends.
Marshalls TSR performance improved by 5.8 per cent in 2018, compared with a fall of 9.5 per cent in the FTSE Small Cap Index and a fall of 13.3 per cent in the FTSE 250 in 2018.
Percentage change in CEOs remuneration The table below shows how the percentage change in the CEOs salary, benefits and bonus between 2017 and 2018 compares with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for the UK-based employees of the Group as a whole.
b The bonus is the non-deferred amount earned for the relevant year taken from the single figure remuneration table on page 69. c A 3.3 per cent increase was awarded to the workforce on 1 January 2018.
The table above shows, however, that the average salary increase per employee for 2018 was slightly lower.
This was due to variations in overtime in the current year and specific variations relating to the impact and timing of leavers and new starters.
d The table above shows that the average bonus per employee increased by 17.3 per cent in 2018 compared with the prior year.
Marshalls plc 66 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Corporate governance Gender balance and pay At the end of 2018 our total workforce excluding CPM and Edenhall, comprised 2,207 employees with the following gender balance: Male Female Total workforce 1,845 362 Senior managers 6 2 Directors 4 2 1 Senior managers are defined according to the 2018 Code and comprise the Executive Committee and the Company Secretary.
Our gender pay gap disclosure is based on amounts paid in the April 2018 payroll.
The bonus gap is based on incentives paid in the year to 31 March 2018.
Our disclosures are made pursuant to UK Government Equalities legislation.
Marshalls Group has 2 employing companies: Marshalls plc which has fewer than 250 employees, mostly at Director senior manager level and Marshalls Group Limited, which employs all remaining employees.
The charts show the consolidated results for Marshalls plc and Marshalls Group Limited, which provides a more accurate overview of pay balance: however, the separate information that is required by the legislation in relation to Marshalls Group Limited is also included below.
This information will also be posted on Marshalls website.
CPM Group Limited was acquired in October 2017, and remained a separate employer until June 2018, at which time its employees transferred to Marshalls Group Limited.
A separate report for CPM Group Limited as at April 2018, calculated consistently with the methodology used for Marshalls Group and Marshalls plc, is therefore available on the Company website.
Edenhall Holdings, acquired in December 2018, employed fewer than 250 employees so is not required to report in 2018.
Marshalls is committed to equal pay and opportunities for men and women throughout the Group.
The gender pay gap analysis is based on a calculation of the average hourly pay and bonus of all our employees, irrespective of what job they do.
This shows that as at April 2018 there is a median gender pay gap of 21.2 per cent consolidated 22 per cent: Marshalls Group Limited, and a mean gender pay gap of 15.2 per cent consolidated 16.6 per cent: Marshalls Group Limited.
These ratios have not changed significantly since 2017.
Our recruitment policies, salary and bonus structures are designed to be gender neutral.
However, as the gender split analysis shows, more than 80 per cent of our workforce are male, and there are more males than females in every pay band across the organisation.
This is representative of the construction sector generally.
During 2018 we have carried out an in-depth review of pay and benefits across the Group and worked on harmonising hours, rates and pay grading structures.
This has enabled us to develop our understanding of the detailed contributory factors and identify areas for action.
In broad terms, because the construction sector has traditionally attracted more men than women, a majority of our longer-serving employees for example in middle management or shift leader positions are male, and most of the senior roles, attracting the highest pay and bonus, are also currently held by men.
In addition, there is a very high proportion of male workers within our production workforce, where packages are generally in the upper quartile of the comparator group.
These appear to be the main reasons for the current difference.
We have an action plan designed to identify and address any anomalies in the pay and grading structure between different gender groups, and over the longer term to balance the ratios through better recruitment and retention policies that encourage applications from female candidates and provide a flexible and family-friendly working environment.

Across our consolidated workforce more women than men participate in a bonus scheme: however, the predominance of men in senior roles carrying higher base pay means that we are also reporting a gender pay gap in mean and median bonus.

The Groups Code of Conduct, M-Way, launched in 2017, clearly states its commitment to these principles and requires a similar commitment from its business partners.
Marshalls is supportive of the initiatives reflected in the Hampton-Alexander, Parker and McGregor-Smith reviews to improve ratios in gender and ethnic diversity at Board and senior management level as well as in the wider workforce.
Aligning pay and recruitment policies with these principles has formed a key element of our planning for 2018 and beyond.
The Remuneration Committee Chairs engagement programme will support the initiatives in our action plan to eliminate unconscious bias, if it is found, and to ensure our pay and performance policies are fair and transparent with measures to encourage applications from talented and motivated individuals regardless of gender, ethnicity, degree of physical ability or background.
Retention of such people by giving fair consideration to flexible working policies where appropriate, and ensuring incentive schemes are fairly distributed will also be key elements of our diversity strategies.
We have made some progress on our gender diversity objectives: during 2018 the appointment of Vanda Murray to succeed Andrew Allner meant that we achieved our 2020 target of at least 33 per cent of our Board being female, and the number of females among senior management doubled.
We welcome and give full and fair consideration to applications from individuals with recognised disabilities to ensure they have equal opportunity for employment and development in our business.
Wherever practicable we offer training and make adjustments to ensure disabled employees are not disadvantaged in the workplace.
More information on our employment policies can be found in our Strategic Report on page 37, and in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 48 and 49.
