Personal contribution may be considered where it diverges from scorecard outcomes.
Awards will not be made if the Group doesnot meet threshold financial performance or if an individual is rated Developing or below.

The total number of shares vesting were 3,445,449 and 509,271 shares delivered in respect of dividend equivalents for Antnio Horta-Osrio, 1,901,209 shares vesting and 281,017 shares delivered in respect of dividend equivalents for George Culmer and 1,874,804 shares vesting and 277,114 shares delivered in respect of dividend equivalents for Juan Colombs.
The average share price between 1 October 2018 and 31 December 2018 56.04 pence has been used to indicate the value.
The shares were awarded in 2016 based on a share price of 72.978 pence and as such no part of the reported value is attributable to share price appreciation.
LTIP and dividend equivalent figures for 2017 have been adjusted to reflect the share price on the date of vesting 67.1043 pence instead of the average price 66.75 pence reported in the 2017 report.

This was a partial buy-out of a pension forfeited on joining from Santander Group.
It is an Employer-Financed Retirement Benefits Scheme EFRBS.
The EFRBS provides benefits on a defined benefit basis at a normal retirement age of 65.
The benefit in the EFRBS accrued during the six years following commencement of employment, therefore ceasing to accrue as of 31 December 2016.
The EFRBS was subject to performance conditions.
It provides a percentage of the GCEs base salary or reference salary in the 12 months before retirement or leaving.
No additional benefit is due in the event of early retirement.
The rate of pension accrued in each year depended on share price conditions being met and the total pension due is 6 per cent of his base salary of 1,244,400 or 74,664.
There are no other Executive Directors with defined benefit pension entitlements.
Under terms agreed when joining the Group, Juan Colombs is entitled to a conditional lump sum benefit of 718,996 either i on reaching normal retirement age of 65 unless he voluntarily resigns or is dismissed for cause, or ii on leaving due to long-term sickness or death.
2016 LTIP vesting audited Awards in the form of conditional rights to free shares in 2016 were made over shares with a value of 300 per cent of reference salary for the GCE and 275per cent of salary for the CFO and COO.
These LTIP awards are vesting at 68.7 per cent, as detailed in the table below.
This reflects the Groups strong financial and strategic performance over the three financial years ended 31 December 2018, balanced against significant uncertainty in the economic and political environment impacting negatively on share price performance, resulting in no vesting for the Total Shareholder Return component.
The Committee has an overarching discretion to reduce the level of award that will vest, regardless of whether the performance condition for partial or full vesting has been met.
This qualitative judgement ensures that vesting is not simply driven by a formula that may give an unexpected or unintended remuneration outcome compared to Group performance.
The Committee considers this discretion carefully, taking into account circumstances that are relevant to the performance measures and the period under consideration.
No discretion has been applied in respect of the vesting outcome for the 2016 LTIP.

Shareholding requirement audited Executives are expected to build and maintain a company shareholding in direct proportion to their remuneration in order to align their interests to those of shareholders.
The minimum shareholding requirements Executive Directors are expected to meet are as follow: 350 per cent of base salary for the GCE and 250 per cent of base salary for other Executive Directors.
Newly appointed individuals will have three years from appointment to achieve the shareholding requirement.
There is no appetite for non-compliance with the Shareholding Policy.
In the event that exceptional individual circumstances exist resulting in an Executive not being able to comply with the Policy, the Remuneration Committee will consider whether an exception should apply.
In addition to the Groups shareholding requirements, shares vesting are subject to holding periods in line with regulatory requirements.

Shares held by Connected Persons, as defined by the Companies Act, but broadly meaning spouse or partner and children, may also be included.
The current Shareholding Policy does not take into account post-employment requirements.
Consideration of how post-employment shareholding will be incorporated into the Policy will be undertaken in 2019, ahead of a revised policy being implemented in 2020.
As per the diagram on page 84 illustrating how share based remuneration is delivered to our Executive Directors, shares are deferred for up to seven years and clawback provisions can be implemented for up to ten years.
Deferred bonus awards and long term incentive awards that are yet to vest are not currently included within the total shareholding for Executive Directors.
Based on the number of outstanding bonus deferrals and number of in-flight long term incentive awards granted to each Executive Director, a post-employment shareholding requirement could be achieved until a formal policy is implemented.
None of those who were Directors at the end of the year had any other interest in the capital of Lloyds Banking Group plc or its subsidiaries.
The closing market price of the Groups ordinary shares on that date was 67.50 pence.
Shares vested are subject to a further two-year holding period.

The share price used to calculate face value is the average price over the five days prior to grant 27 February to 5 March 2018, which was 68.027 pence.
As regulations prohibit the payment of dividend equivalents on awards in 2018 and subsequenet years, the number of shares awarded has been determined by applying a discount factor to the share price on award.
An adjustment of 25 per cent was applied.
Performance conditions for this award are set out in the table below.

Additional disclosures CEO pay ratio The Group is committed to ensuring remuneration is competitive, performance-driven and fair.
The Group has decided to publish the CEO pay ratio in advance of the formal disclosure requirement using the prescribed Methodology A, as shown in the table below together with an alternative view based on fixed pay.
In assessing the pay ratio for 2018, the Committee has considered likely ratios at industry and sector peers, and companies with a similar employee profile.
The Remuneration Committee views pay ratios as a useful reference point to inform policy-setting, but also takes into consideration a number of other factors when considering remuneration levels, including direct engagement on pay with the Groups recognised unions and shareholders.
The Committee is confident that the Groups policy on pay is fair and that improvements to pay progression will continue to ensure that lower paid colleagues receive a greater share of pay awards.
Total remuneration Methodology A Fixed pay P25 P50 P75 P25 P50 P75 Year Lower Quartile Median Upper Quartile Lower Quartile Median Upper Quartile 2018 237:1 169:1 93:1 113:1 81:1 48:1 2017 245:1 177:1 97:1 113:1 82:1 48:1 Y-o-Y 4% 1% The median ratio has decreased 4 per cent year-on-year.
The median ratio provides a fair reflection of the Groups approach to pay as colleagues at this level make up approximately 70 per cent of the Groups employee base, however, these colleagues do not receive long-term incentive plan awards which are more volatile.
For the majority of colleagues, year-on-year changes in remuneration are principally driven by pay awards, which the Group directs to the lowest grades.
For example, the P25 colleague in 2017 received a 5 per cent pay increase in 2018, meaning this colleague moved up in the percentile ranking to P25.5.
The colleague who is now at P25 for 2018 received a 3 per cent pay increase which brought them up from P24.5 to that level.
For 2019, the pay budget has been set at 2.6 per cent, but only 2 per cent for senior colleagues, including the Group Chief Executive.
To support the Groups policy of real wage growth and commitment to pay progression, there is a focus on ensuring higher pay awards for colleagues who are lower paid, or paid lower within their pay range.
From April 2019, all full-time colleagues will be paid a minimum salary of 17,510.
For some colleagues, this will result in an increase of up to 9.9 per cent.
This salary level is 7 per cent above the National Living Wage.
Notes to the calculation: The P25, P50 and P75 colleagues were determined based on calculating total remuneration for all UK employees as at 31 December 2018.
This methodology was selected on the basis that it provided the most accurate means of identifying the median, lower and upper quartile colleagues.
The 2018 total remuneration for the colleagues identified at P25, P50 and P75 are as follows: 26,490, 37,058, 67,225.
The 2018 base salary for the colleagues identified at P25, P50 and P75 are as follows: 21,560, 30,364, 45,230.
The colleague identified at P50 is not eligible to receive a car benefit unless required for role and does not participate in the long term incentive plan, therefore the ratio does not provide a like-for-like comparison to the total remuneration of the Group Chief Executive.
Each of the three individuals identified was a full-time employee during the year.
The single total figure of remuneration calculated for each of the 65,537 UK colleagues includes full time equivalent base pay, Group Performance Share awards for the 2018 performance year, long term incentive plan payments for eligible colleagues, core benefits, pension, overtime and shift payments, travel relocation payments and private medical benefit.
Due to operational constraints, the calculation of the colleague Pension Input Figure excludes the adjustment to uprate the opening value for defined benefit plans specified in section 229 of the Finance Act 2004.
