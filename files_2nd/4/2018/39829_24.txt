Type of LTIP The Committee proposed RoRE as the sole performance condition for the During the consultation Given the strong level of performance LTIP as is the case for the current policy.
The Committees rationale was a number of different shareholder support the condition as follows: performance measures Committee determined to were discussed with proceed with its proposal RoRE is a holistic measurement of performance requiring management shareholders.
However, to retain RoRE as the to focus on performance across a range of areas such as Totex, customer on engagement with the performance condition ODIs and financing which help measure long-term success within the Committee the general forthe LTIP.
Therefore, whilst it is a single measure, delivering the RoRE view of shareholders was performance requires the Executive Directors to deliver on a number that RoRE was the key ofCompany KPIs: and long term metric for the RoRE is the primary measure used by Ofwat to measure the performance Company and appropriate of the Company and other WaSCs.
In addition, Ofwat calculates and ranks as the sole performance RoRE for the WaSCs giving an independently verified and comparable condition for the LTIP.

Current maximum vesting 2016 and 2017 awards occurs for 1.39x FD 7.78% return.
The Committee wants to ensure that any additional incentive opportunity can only be earned through even more stretching performance.
The rationale for the use of the UQ comparison against other WaSCs is that: It ensures full vesting is only achieved for UQ comparative performance.
At the point of AMP change over it is difficult to set an absolute target for UQ performance: and It aligns with the Companys aspirations to remain an UQ performer.

Diversity and inclusion Our employees tell us we are doing well on diversity and inclusion, through great scores in our employee engagement survey, but we know there are opportunities to reflect better the demographics of our region.
We are recognised for leading performance in the FTSE 100 for womens representation at Board and Executive Committee level and our mean gender pay gap for the year was just 2.4%.
This year we have also launched our menopause awareness programme, supported by our Trades Unions.
Our apprenticeship scheme has a Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic BAME representation of 9.6% and this is 15.3% forour graduate scheme.
Investing in the community Our education and work experience programmes now actively focus on the areas of lowest social mobility in our region.
We already have a strong track record of creating jobs in these areas, with over half of our employees from areas outlined by the Social Mobility Commission, but we want to do more.
Our employee volunteering programme gives all employees two paid days per year to participate in voluntary work inourcommunity.
This year saw participation numbers increase to 40%.
Diversity and inclusion policies We continue to focus on long term improvement through our diversity and inclusion policies: Developing role models We believe that strong role models inspire more junior employees and demonstrate an inclusive culture to potential candidates.
We are leading the way on senior leader gender diversity, placing us ahead of many of ourindustry peers.
Reflecting the communities we serve We have increased our programme of school career events over the last two years, helping to broaden the rangeof students who are aware of Severn Trent and the career opportunities we offer.
Changing the way we recruit During 2016, we moved to a strengths-based interview process for our graduate and apprentice positions.
Thisishelping us to understand the potential of each candidate and remove bias throughout the process.
Wewantto attract candidates who share the same passion about the water industry and understand the needsofthe communities we serve.
Breaking down stereotypes We are making progress in attracting more diverse candidates into roles that require science, technology, engineering and mathematics STEM backgrounds.
By taking part in engineering initiatives aimed at women, including National Women in Engineering Day, we are raising our profile among prospective applicants.
Thechallenge to increase diversity in these areas is longer term and we will continue to face a challenge torecruitfemale employees if we do not receive a sufficient level of applications to these roles.
108 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Gender Pay Gap Reporting We reported our Gender Pay Gap in November 2017 in line with statutory requirements.
The data was based on 5 April 2017 and showed a mean gap of 2.4% and a median gap of 14.6%.
The relatively low mean gap is predominately due to our senior gender diversity.
The higher median gap is representative of occupational segregation.
We have a large number of operational roles which attract shift, on-call and stand-by allowances, and these roles are principally held by men.
By way of comparison, the average mean and median gaps for those WoCs and WaSCs that have reported data is 11.9% and15.3%respectively.

Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 111 Governance Directors remuneration report continued Remuneration Despite a period with some significant operational challenges and a difficult year on bad debt, we have continued to make good progress in managing our underlying cost base to absorb these and other cost pressures to end the year delivering PBIT of 527.6 million in STW before property profits.
Our customer ODI rewards of 80.2 million were underpinned by significant improvements in internal and external sewer flooding, and sustained performance on Category 3 pollutions with a gross performance on waste of 109 million.
However, this was offset by the impact of operational incidents on water measures such as supply interruptions, which resulted in a net penalty of 29 million.
This year the Committee agreed to include an additional measure todriveimprovement in customer experience, targeting a 20% reduction in written complaints.
In the last few months we have seen a significant improvement in performance driven by a significant improvement in billings related complaints, with these learnings being rolled out across our other teams.
The result of these improvements is represented by a 17.2% reduction for the year.
We set ourselves bold targets to improve the safety of our employees this year and, although we still incurred 18LTIs, this represents a 23% year on year improvement, resulting in our best ever year and the lowest LTI rate in the sector in England.
Business Services has had a particularly strong year, benefiting from a new contract with plumbing and drainage insurers that contributed significantly to both revenue and PBIT.
Personal objectives for the Executive Directors are linked to our strategic framework which will move us towards our ambition to be the most trusted water company.
Objectives were shared across the team with each Executive Director leading on the areas which best align with their accountabilities and expertise.
As noted on page 111, the achievement of the personal objectives for each of the Executive Directors was as follows: 6%, 6% and 3% for the CEO, CFO and Managing Director, Wholesale Operations, respectively.

Directors shareholdings and summary of outstanding share interests audited The Company operates shareholding requirements under which Executive Directors are expected to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company of 200% of salary for the CEO and 150% of salary for the CFO.
Details of the current shareholdings of the Directors and whether Executive Directors have met the shareholding requirements are set out below.
The Committee believes that it is an essential part of the Companys Remuneration Policy that Executive Directors become material shareholders.
The retention and build-up of equity is important in a long term business such as Severn Trent as it encourages decisions to be made on a long term sustainable basis for the benefit of customers and shareholders.
The CEO has exceeded the shareholding requirement applicable in 2017 18 of 200% of salary and the CFO is close to exceeding the shareholding requirement applicable in 2017 18 of 150% of salary.

116 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Payments for loss of office and to past Directors audited Emma FitzGerald Background In advance of PR19 the Company has reshaped the wholesale business to create three teams: Customer Delivery, Capital Delivery andCommercial, and Production.
The reorganisation has resulted in changes to the role of the Managing Director, Wholesale Operations, held by Emma FitzGerald.
As a consequence, following the transition of her responsibilities, Emma stepped down from the Board on 31 December 2017 and will leave the Company on 31 July 2018.
During the period between her stepping down as Managing Director, Wholesale Operations and leaving the Company, she is focusing on developing the Companys management and integration of disruptive innovation.
Emma was appointed to the Board on 1 April 2016.
During this time, she led the wholesale business and played a key role in helping the Company achieve its success during the first half of the AMP.
On the basis that Emmas role as Managing Director, Wholesale Operations will no longer exist in its current form, the Committee has determined under the loss of office policy under the approved Remuneration Policy to treat her as a good leaver.
Remuneration As Emma remains an employee of the Company, she will be paid her salary, benefits and pension for the period to 31 July 2018, onamonthly basis.
For clarity, no pay in lieu of notice will be paid after she ceases employment with the Company.
Emma was employed for the full financial year and, therefore, will receive an annual bonus of 68.94% of salary in relation to 2017 18, based on performance against the relevant targets set out on page 113.
The Committee has determined to pay the bonus in cash because under the Remuneration Policy and the rules of the deferred annual bonus plan deferred share awards would vest on cessation of employment and, given the short period between the determination of the bonus for the year and her departure, itisadministratively simpler.
No bonus will be paid to Emma for 2018 19 and Emma will not receive an LTIP award for 2018 19.
All unvested and unexercised awards will be treated in accordance with the applicable plan rules and our loss of office policy.
Unvested shares held under the deferred annual bonus plan will be released on cessation of employment, and remain subject tomalus and clawback provisions.

These charts are illustrative as the actual value will depend on business performance in the year 2018 19 for the annual bonus and in the three year period to 2020 2021 for the LTIP, as well as share price performance to the date of the vesting ofthe share element of the Annual Bonus Plan and LTIP awards in 2021.
The on-target and maximum scenarios include an additional bar which shows the impact of share price growth over the relevant performance period to show how the package value is aligned to shareholders.
