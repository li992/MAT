Recruitment remuneration The Companys policy on the recruitment of Executive Directors is to pay a fair remuneration package for the role being undertaken and the experience of the Executive Director.
The Remuneration Committee will determine base salary in line with the current Remuneration Policy and having regard to the parameters and limits set out in the future implementation table.
Incoming Executive Directors will be entitled to pension, benefit and incentive arrangements, which are the same as provided to existing Executive Directors although the Committee may exercise its discretion to vary those elements of remuneration within the maximum levels set.
On that basis, incentive awards would not exceed the maximum levels of 350% of base salary in the case of a newly appointed Chief Executive and 325% of base salary in the case of a Group Finance Director.
Where an existing employee is appointed as an Executive Director, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment.
The Committee may also agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses as it considers appropriate.
In recognition of the fact that a new Executive Director may have to forfeit sizeable cash bonuses and share awards if they choose to leave their former employer to join Spectris, the Committee has the ability to compensate incoming Executive Directors for incentive awards they give up on joining Spectris.
The Remuneration Committee will use its judgement in determining any such compensation, will only provide compensation which is no more beneficial than that given up and will seek to replicate forfeited share awards using Spectris incentive plans or through reliance on Rule 9.4.
Termination arrangements The Companys policy regarding termination payments to departing Executive Directors is to limit severance payments to pre-established contractual arrangements.
The contracts permit the Committee to make payment in respect of base salary, pensions and benefits on a monthly basis with payments reducing or ceasing if the departing individual finds another position during the notice period.
However, the Committee reserves the power to negotiate a single lump-sum on termination if it considers that to be in the interests of the Company and will have full regard to the duty to mitigate if it does so.
In some circumstances, additional benefits may become payable to cover outplacement fees and legal fees.

Ordinarily, no bonus payments would be made and all share awards would lapse following termination.
However, under certain circumstances, such as good leaver provisions covering retirement and ill health, bonus entitlement may be payable, calculated to the date of termination.
Additionally, awards made under the PSP will remain exercisable subject to time pro-rating and the application of the performance conditions at the measurement date.
The Committee retains discretion to vary or disapply time pro-rating for PSP awards for good leavers where it considers it fair and reasonable to do so or to allow good leavers PSP awards to vest at the date of termination subject to time pro-rating and the application of the performance measures in exceptional cases.
Likewise, on a change of control, PSP awards may vest in accordance with the rules of the plan and subject to time-pro-rating and performance conditions.
Vested PSP awards which are subject to a holding period will not normally be forfeited on termination except in the case of gross misconduct and the holding period will continue to apply.
The Committee has the discretion to release awards early from the holding period in appropriate cases such as death or ill health.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to alter these provisions on a case-by-case basis following a review of circumstances and to ensure fairness for both shareholders and Executive Directors.
Details of an out-going Executive Directors remuneration arrangements will be published on the Companys website around the time of leaving.
Consideration of remuneration conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee considers the remuneration and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group together with current market practice when determining remuneration for the Executive Directors.
In addition to the UK comparator group set out on page 70, the levels of remuneration, annual bonus and PSP awarded to the Presidents of each of the Groups operating companies are taken into consideration, notwithstanding that these reflect such businesses particular trading positions and the geographical and technical employment markets in which they operate.
However, the Committee does not consult specifically with employees on the Remuneration Policy.
Consideration of shareholders views The Committee takes into account the views of the Companys shareholders and best practice guidelines set by shareholder representative bodies when determining remuneration for Executive Directors.
The proposals for the 2020 Remuneration Policy will be the subject of consultation with the Companys significant institutional shareholders and their representative bodies and their feedback will be incorporated into the final policy submitted for shareholder approval at the 2020 AGM.

68 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Governance PSP awards vesting in February 2019 audited PSP awards granted in 2016 and maturing in February 2019 are subject to EPS, TSR and EP performance conditions.
The EPS and EP threshold targets in respect of the three financial years to 31 December 2018 were exceeded and, as a result, part of the award up to a maximum of two-thirds will vest.
Based on the interim TSR performance results provided by Aon as at 31 December 2018, the remaining one-third of the award which is subject to the performance of TSR for the three-year performance period ending on 22 February 2019 may vest subject to the final assessment of TSR on 25 February 2019 see tables below.

The face value is based on the average closing share price over the five days immediately prior to the date of grant of 1,713.6 pence.
Details of the performance conditions are set out on page 75.
Vested awards are satisfied in shares normally treasury shares with sufficient shares being sold to meet income tax and national insurance contributions due on exercise, at the Directors discretion, and the net balance of shares transferred to the individual.
Awards lapse if they do not vest on the third anniversary of their award.
E. Retirement benefits audited Executive Directors are entitled to a defined contribution pension contribution.
John OHiggins and Clive Watson receive 25% of base salary and Andrew Heath receives 20% of base salary.
In light of the pension lifetime allowance of 1.03 million and the maximum annual pension contribution allowance of 40,000, the Executive Directors are entitled, at their option, to a taxable salary supplement in lieu of some or all of such pension contributions.
All Executive Directors have chosen this option and each receives a cash payment in lieu of participation in a Spectris pension scheme.
No Executive Director participated in a defined benefit pension plan during the year, nor currently participates in a defined benefit plan.
F. All-employee share plans audited Options granted to Clive Watson on 22 September 2015 under the Spectris Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE Scheme vested on 1 December 2018 and were exercised on 3 December 2018 to acquire 1,036 ordinary shares at an option price of 1,737 pence per share giving a total exercise value of 17,995.
The option price was set at the time of grant based on the closing mid-market price of the Companys shares on 24 August 2015, being the last business day prior to the grant date.
Although the SAYE Scheme rules permit the option price to be discounted up to a maximum of 20% of the market price at the time of grant, no discount was applied to the option price.
The exercise price therefore reflects fair value as at the date of grant.
The closing market price on 3 December 2018, was 2,495 pence per share producing a total gain on exercise of 7,852.88.

Percentage change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive The table below shows the percentage change in the salary and benefits of the Chief Executive compared with the change in the Executive team excluding the Chief Executive and in the Groups UK-based employees between the year ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018.
The Group-wide 2018 annual bonus outcomes and payments will be confirmed in March 2019 and therefore estimated figures for UK-based employees have been used in the comparison.
The Committee has selected this comparator group on the basis that the Chief Executive is UK-based and this provides a local market reference and a sufficiently large comparator group based on a similar incentive structure to the Chief Executive, and reduces any distortion arising from currency and cost of living differences in other geographies in which Spectris operates.
For comparison purposes, the annualised figures for John OHiggins have been used.
% change 2017-2018 Base salary Benefits Annual bonus Chief Executive 2.0% 0.9% 31.6 % Executive team 1.7% 19.4% 21.5 % Spectris UK-based employees 4.6% 3.0% 1.0 % Relative importance of spend on pay The table below shows the relative expenditure of the Group on the pay of its employees in comparison to adjusted profit before tax and distributions to shareholders by way of dividend payments and share buyback between the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018.
Total employee pay is the total pay costs for all Group employees.
Adjusted profit before tax has been used as a comparison as this is a key financial metric which the Board considers when assessing the Groups financial performance.
Adjusted profit before tax is calculated as being the statutory profit before tax as adjusted to exclude certain items defined in Note 2 to the Financial Statements on page 108.

Directors shareholdings and share interests audited Directors shareholding requirements Each Executive Director is, subject to personal circumstances, required to build a retained shareholding in Spectris plc of at least three times base salary in value within five years of appointment and is required to apply the post-tax benefit of any vested PSP awards or any bonus payments exceeding 60% of base salary to the acquisition of shares until this required level of shareholding is achieved.
Andrew Heath was appointed on 3 September 2018 and is in the process of building his shareholding.
Both John OHiggins and Clive Watson each have a holding in excess of this requirement.
For comparison purposes, annualised 2018 base salaries in respect of Andrew Heath and John OHiggins have been used to calculate their respective required level of retained shareholding.
There is no such requirement in respect of the Chairman or Non-executive Directors, who have discretion as to whether to hold the Companys shares or not.
Executive Directors interests in shares The beneficial interest of each Executive Director including their closely associated persons in the shares of the Company, as at 31 December 2018, is as follows: Shares held as at Interests in share plans 31 December 2018 No.

Spectris plc 73 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued Executive Directors interests in share plans PSP and SAYE No.
Shareholders approved the rules of the Spectris Performance Share Plan 2017 at the AGM held on 24 May 2017.
The PSP awards are conditional rights to acquire shares and are nominal cost options.
The exercise price is the nominal value of a Spectris ordinary share, which is 5 pence.
PSP awards to the Executive Directors are currently structured so that one-third of the award is subject to an EPS target, one-third is subject to a TSR target and one-third is subject to an Economic Profit EP target.
PSP awards granted in 2017 and 2018 are subject to an additional two-year holding period following the initial three-year performance period.
These PSP awards will become available to exercise at the end of the holding period which will be the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
Under the terms of the PSP, additional dividend equivalent shares are awarded on the date the PSP award becomes exercisable thereby increasing the number of award shares granted.
The value of these shares is equivalent to the Companys dividends that would have been paid between the date of grant and the date the PSP award becomes exercisable on the vested shares under the PSP award.
These additional award shares are structured as nil cost options so the exercise price is nil.
The PSP awards granted to the Executive Directors in 2015 and 2018 are linked to a grant of market value share options Linked PSP awards.
Such Linked PSP awards are granted up to the HMRCs limit of an aggregate value of 30,000, and have the same performance and vesting conditions as the PSP awards to which they are linked.
No additional gross value was can be delivered from the exercise of the Linked PSP awards.

No performance conditions are attached to SAYE options other than continuous service.
No grants have been made under the SAYE Scheme since 2016.
