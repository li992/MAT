The target for 2018 was increased by 215 million to reduce the level of over performance attributable to the original timing assumption for the loss of Advair exclusivity.
2 The Adjusted Group PBIT target and outcome for the purposes of the Annual bonus calculation differ from Adjusted Group PBIT disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report, primarily because both the target and outcome numbers are calculated applying GSK budget exchange rates and not actual exchange rates.

Adjusted operating profit was 8,745 million, 2% higher on an AER basis and 6% higher CER.
The Adjusted operating margin of 28.4% was flat on an AER basis compared with 2017 and 0.5 % higher CER.
This reflected the benefit from sales growth across all three businesses on a CER basis and a more favourable mix, primarily in Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare.
The margin also benefited from the prioritisation of R&D expenditure and the comparison with the impact of the Priority Review Voucher utilised and expensed in 2017, as well as continued tight control of ongoing costs across all three business.
This was partly offset by continued pricing pressure, particularly in respiratory, increased input costs, the comparison with the benefit in 2017 of a settlement for lost third party supply volume in Vaccines, investments in promotional product support, particularly for new product launches, and a reduction in royalty income.

There are no changes to the targets set for the R&D New Product performance measure or the Relative TSR performance measure for the 2016 PSP awards and DABP matching awards.

The following charts provide an estimate of the vesting levels taking into account performance to 31 December 2018.
Actual vesting levels will only be determined based on performance over the full three-year performance periods.
The indications below should therefore not be regarded as predictions of the final vesting levels.
In addition to the adjustments made to the target and associated vesting scale for the 2016 PSP awards and the DABP matching awards, adjustments have been made to the AFCF targets and associated vesting scales for the 2017 and 2018 awards, as follows: The target for the 2017 PSP awards and the DABP matching awards have been decreased in aggregate by 557m to 11.26bn.
This is to reflect: i a r eduction to the target due to the forecast impact of the Tesaro acquisition and the major restructuring programme announced with the Q2 2018 results: and ii an increase to the target to reduce the level of Advair outperformance attributable to the delayed loss of exclusivity.
The overall net impact is a reduction to the target.
The target for the 2018 PSP award has been similarly adjusted for the same factors applicable to the 2017 PSP.
The net overall impact is a decrease to the target of 1.29bn to 10.79bn.
The reduction is primarily driven by the impact of the restructuring programme and the Tesaro acquisition.
The adjustment for the delayed loss of exclusivity results in an increase to target.
