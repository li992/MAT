Committees decisions and remuneration outcomes for the year.
Performance Share Plan PSP The outcome for the Performance Share Plan PSP awards granted in 2016 were subject to performance for the three years ended 31 December 2018.
Strong earnings per share 19.2% and dividend 7% growth over the three year period would have resulted in maximum vesting for the EPS and DPS component.
However, the Lesley Knox exclusion of the impact of the mortality assumption changes reduces Chairman of the Remuneration Committee the EPS growth over the period to 11.5%, which, in turn, reduced the overall vesting to 97.3% of the maximum 50% for this portion of the award.
TSR performance over the period of 11.2% per annum was insufficient to trigger any vesting for this portion of the award.
For PSP awards granted from 2019, the performance measures remain those of EPS and relative TSR, subject to an assessment of performance against Solvency II objectives.
There are no anticipated changes to the TSR bespoke comparator group, but the EPS growth vesting range has been adjusted from 5%-14% per annum to 5%-12% per annum, to reflect a movement in these comparators.
Base salary increases in 2019 As highlighted in our 2016 report on remuneration, when Jeff Davies and Kerrigan Procter were first appointed to the Group Board in 2017, their base salaries were set to reflect that these were their first appointments as executive directors.
It was also stated that the Committee may reposition their base salaries as they progressed in their roles over time.
Now, two years into their roles, the Committee has reviewed their base salaries, and, with effect from 1 March 2019, have their increased their base salaries to 555,000 8.8% and to 525,000 8.4% for Jeff and Kerrigan respectively.
The Committee will continue to review base salary levels to ensure they reflect skills and experience in role.
In determining base salary increases, the Committee considered appropriate comparator data and the increases applied to the wider workforce.
The average base salary increase for all UK employees from 1 March 2019 is 3.2%, although again this year the spend is focused onmore junior employees receiving around 3.5%, with salary increases for senior managers already paid at the appropriate benchmark generally limited to 2%.
The base salary increase for Nigel Wilson has been set at 2%.
Mark Zinkula will not receive any base salary increase for 2019.

Remuneration element Policy Base Salary Purpose and link To help recruit and retain executive directors of the calibre required to develop, lead and deliver the business strategy.
to strategy Operation The Committee sets base salary taking into consideration: the individuals skills, experience and performance: the scope of the role: pay and conditions elsewhere in the group: overall business performance: and external market benchmark data in other FTSE 100 companies and other relevant bespoke groupings of financial and non-financial institutions.
Base salaries are normally reviewed annually, with increases effective 1 March.
Opportunity Whilst there is no maximum base salary, any increases for executive directors will normally be in line with the range of increases for other UK employees in the wider group.
In specific circumstances, the Committee may award increases above this level, for example: where the Committee has set the base salary for a newly appointed executive director with a view to allow the individual to progress into the role over time: or where, in the Committees opinion, there has been a significant increase in the size or scope of an executive directors role or responsibilities: or where there is a significant change in the regulatory environment.
Performance Personal performance will be taken into consideration in determining any salary increase.
Proposed changes for 2019: Base salary No change in approach.
78 Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Governance Directors report on remuneration Remuneration element Policy Benefits Purpose and link Benefits are provided to executive directors to attract and retain the best talent for the business and to ensure that the total package is competitive in the market.
to strategy Operation The Committees policy is to provide executive directors with a market competitive level of benefits, taking into consideration benefits offered to other senior employees in the UK, the individuals circumstances and market practice at similar companies.
Benefits provided to executive directors are normally in line with benefits provided to other senior employees in the UK.
Benefits currently provided to executive directors include: car allowance, private medical insurance, life assurance, group income protection, and insured death in service arrangements.
These are all in line with our general policy for other UK employees.
In line with other Legal & General employees, executive directors can choose to acquire Legal & General products, and are eligible to participate in the companys voluntary benefits which they fund themselves, sometimes through salary sacrifice.
They are eligible to participate in the UK all-employee share plans on the same terms as other employees.
The two current all-employee share plans are: the savings-related share option scheme SAYE the all-employee share incentive plan Where an executive new or current is required to relocate, or perform duties outside their home country in order to fulfil their duties, in line with our mobility policy and practice, additional benefits may be provided, for example: home country benefits such as healthcare and additional support in relocating such as assistance for housing, school fees, travel home, relocation costs and taxadvice.
Opportunity In line with other UK employees, there is no maximum level for the benefits as this is dependent on the individuals circumstances and the cost to the company.
The maximum opportunity for participation in the current all-employee share plans is in line with other employees and takes into account the prevailing HMRC rules.
Relocation international assignment benefits the level of such benefits would be set taking into account the circumstances of the individual and typical market practice.
Performance There are no performance conditions.
Proposed changes for 2019: Benefits Benefits No change in approach.
The approach to benefit provision for executive directors is the same as that operated for senior managers in the rest of the UK organisation.
Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 79 Governance Remuneration element Policy Pension Purpose and link The policy aims to provide competitive post-retirement benefits and therefore recognise sustained contribution.
to strategy Operation Pension contributions are set at an appropriate level to attract and retain high performing people.
In line with other employees in the UK, executive directors currently participate in either a defined contribution pension plan, adefined benefit pension plan or receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension, or have some combination thereof.
The defined benefit pension plan was closed to new joiners in 2000.
From 2009, increases in pensionable salary for the defined benefit pension plan for remaining active members have been limited to a maximum of 2.5% each year and in 2015 the scheme wasclosed to future accruals.
For executive directors who took enhanced protection in 2006, a cash allowance was provided in lieuwhich may be reviewed or amended by the employer.
Non-UK national executives may be permitted to participate in home-country pension plans where relevant.
Base salary is the only element of pensionable remuneration.
At the discretion of the Committee, executive directors may elect tosacrifice all or part of their cash AVP into pension.
Opportunity New executive directors receive 15% of base salary into the defined contribution pension plan they contribute 5%.
This contribution level for executive directors is the same as that operated for senior managers in the rest of the UK organisation inthedefined contribution pension plan.
As for other employees, there is a cash alternative.
Mark Zinkula may also contribute part of any cash allowance into a US 401k pension plan.
Mark is also a member of a cash balanceplan in the US.
Proposed changes for 2019: Pensions Pensions Change for new executive directors The contribution level for executive directors is no more generous than that operated for senior managers in the rest of the UK organisation.
For new executive directors, the pension provision will be aligned to that available for the majority of the workforce 10% of salary.

to strategy The deferred proportion of AVP into shares reinforces retention and enhances alignment with shareholders by encouraging a longer-term focus and risk alignment.
Operation Performance targets and weightings are set annually by the Committee to ensure they are appropriately stretching.
Performance is normally assessed over a one-year period.
AVP outturns are determined by the Committee after the year end, taking into consideration performance against targets, the underlying performance of the business and individual performance.
The Committee may exceptionally adjust the outcome of the AVP calculation if it believes there are underlying circumstances that justify such a change.
Normally, 50% of any AVP awarded is deferred.
Deferred awards are normally awarded in the form of restricted shares or nil-cost options or phantom equivalent if appropriate.
However, awards may be deferred in other forms dependent upon business or regulatory requirements.
Deferred awards will vest after a period set by the Committee.
This period will normally be three years.
Dividends on deferred awards made in the form of shares accrue during the deferral period and normally are paid in the form of shares to the executive directors upon vesting.
Dividend equivalents may accrue on awards made in other forms.
Deferred awards are subject to malus.
Clawback provisions also apply to both deferred awards and cash awards paid.
The Committee may adjust and amend the awards in accordance with the rules.
Opportunity The maximum award opportunity in respect of any financial year is based on role as follows: For the Group Chief Executive and CFO, the maximum potential is 150% of base salary.
For the CEO LGIM and the CEO LGC the maximum potential is 175% of base salary.
The award opportunity at threshold performance is 0% of minimum, with up to 50% of maximum bonus payable for target performance for the Group Chief Executive, CFO and CEO LGC.
Up to 60% of maximum bonus is payable for target performance forthe CEO LGIM.
Performance Performance measures are selected by the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis to ensure that they are aligned with the groups strategic priorities and the delivery of sustainable shareholder value.
Performance is measured based on an appropriate mix of group and or divisional financial performance targets as well as strategic including customer and employee measures and personal measures.
Performance measures are weighted with normally up to 70% based on financial targets.
The split between financial, strategic andpersonal performance measures and the relative weighting of group and divisional performance targets will be kept under review by the Committee on an annual basis.
Proposed changes for 2019: AVP No change in approach.
Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 81 Governance Remuneration element Policy Performance Share Plan PSP Purpose and link Awards under the PSP are reflective of the Committees desire that the remuneration of executives should be weighted towards the delivery of sustainable returns to shareholders over the longer term.
to strategy In addition to deferred awards under the AVP, awards under the PSP enhance alignment with shareholders by focusing executives on the longer-term performance of the business.
Operation Award of shares or options which are subject to a performance period of normally no less than three years.
Performance is normally measured after the end of the three-year performance period.
Subject to performance, awards for executive directors are released on the fifth anniversaries of the grant date.
The Committee retains discretion to lengthen the performance period and holding period for future awards.
The Remuneration Committee may also amend the final level of vesting dependent on the underlying performance of the group.
The Committee may only exercise such discretion downwards and may not increase the level of vesting.
The parameters which the Committee uses in making this assessment will include, but are not limited to, market share, partnerships entered into and maintained, cost constraint, shareholder perception, capital management and a range of risk measures to ensure that the company has operated within appropriate risk thresholds.
Financial performance targets are set annually by the Committee to ensure they are relevant and sufficiently stretching.
PSP awards are normally awarded in the form of nil cost options or conditional shares or phantom equivalent where appropriate.
However, they may be awarded in other forms if the Committee considers it appropriate.
Dividends or dividend equivalents accrue in the period following the end of the performance period until vesting and release.
These will normally be paid in shares on a reinvested basis.
PSP awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions.
The Committee may adjust and amend the awards in accordance with the PSP rules.
Opportunity The maximum award opportunity under the PSP is 300% of salary in respect of any financial year.
The Remuneration Committees current intention is that the normal award opportunity in respect of any financial year will be 250% of base salary for all executive directors.
15% of the award normally vests for threshold performance increasing to 100% of the award for maximum performance.
Performance Performance measures for the PSP are selected by the Remuneration Committee to be aligned with the groups long-term strategic priority of delivering sustainable returns to shareholders.
The Committee therefore intends to grant awards based on an appropriate mix of earnings, capital efficiency and shareholder return measures.
The split between these measures, for each grant, is set annually by the Committee and will normally be 50% based on total shareholder return and 50% on financial measures.
Proposed changes for 2019: PSP No change in approach.
82 Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Governance Directors report on remuneration Recruitment remuneration General approach The Committee aims to attract, motivate and retain executive directors with the required expertise to develop and deliver the business strategy, while at the same time ensuring that the remuneration arrangements offered are in the best interests of both the company and its shareholders and paying no more than considered necessary to attract the right calibre of candidate to the role.

The maximum level of annual variable pay and long-term incentives which may be awarded to a new executive director will be in Maximum variable line with the policy table, that is 475% of base salary.
This limit excludes buyout awards.

Accordingly, to aid the recruitment of a new executive director, the Committee may make awards to buyout remuneration remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, taking into consideration relevant factors including, components but not limited to: or other arrangements form of the award any performance conditions attached to those awards the vesting profile of the awards and likelihood of vesting relevant regulatory requirements and guidance in place in relation to buyout awards Buyout awards will typically reflect the terms and the value of the arrangements forgone.

Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 83 Governance Service contracts and termination and payments for loss of office When determining leaving arrangements for an executive director, the Committee takes into account any pre-established agreements, including theprovisions of any incentive plans, typical market practice, statutory and contractual obligations, the performance and conduct of the individual and the commercial justification for any payments.
The following summarises our policy in relation to executive directors service contracts and payments in the event of loss of office: Notice period Standard notice policy is: and Termination 12 months notice from the company Payments 12 months notice from the executive director the current CFOs service contract may be terminated on 6-months notice by the company or the executive director Executive directors may be required to work during the notice period, take a period of garden leave or may be provided with pay in lieu of notice if not required to work the full notice period.
Payments in lieu of notice: Our policy for new appointments is that termination payments in lieu of notice would consist solely of base salary and the cost ofproviding benefits for the outstanding notice period.
Any statutory requirements will be observed.
Our standard practice is to include within executive directors contractual terms mitigation provisions as regards payments in lieu of notice.
The CEO LGIM may be paid his contracted benefits for three months following his effective date of termination of employment provided he is not dismissed for cause.
Expiry date All executive directors are subject to annual re-election.
The contracts for our executive directors are rolling service contracts.
Treatment of Rights to annual variable pay, deferred annual variable pay awards and performance share awards are governed by their respective plan rules.

Deferred annual variable pay awards In the event that a participant is a good leaver any outstanding unvested deferred annual variable pay award will normally be released at the normal time.
Where it considers it appropriate, for example in the circumstances of terminal illness, the Committee reserves the right to accelerate any payment due.
Good leaver circumstances are leaving due to circumstances such as death, disability, ill health or injury, redundancy, retirement with company agreement, the individuals employing company business ceasing to be part of the group, or other circumstances at the Committees discretion.

The value includes both thecash element and the portion deferred into shares 50% of the award.
The executive directors AVP awards in relation to performance during 2018 were measured against a basket of metrics and objectives.
ForNigel Wilson and Jeff Davies, they were weighted between group financial objectives 70% and other strategic personal objectives including effective risk management 30%.
ForMark Zinkula and Kerrigan Procter they were weighted between group financial objectives 35%, divisional objectives 35% and other strategic personal objectives including effective risk management 30%.
As with 2017, the AVP awards were subject to potential adjustment based on an assessment of overall financial performance, risk and any other circumstances considered relevant by the remuneration committee as well as a Solvency II performance measure.
For 2018, the Solvency II performance measure was assessed by the Committee on a qualitative assessment of performance informed by input from the Chief Risk Officer and the Risk Committee.
Based on this assessment and consideration of all the circumstances, itwas determined that no adjustment was necessary to the formulaic outcome.
For 2018, AVP payouts as a percentage of the maximum were: Nigel Wilson 80%, Jeff Davies 83%, Mark Zinkula 62% and Kerrigan Procter 73%.
Thetables below illustrate performance against each of the measures.

The vesting schedule of the TSR performance conditions is as follows: Proportion of shares vesting Below median 0% Median threshold vesting 15% 80th percentile and above 100% Between median and the 80th percentile Straight line basis between 15% and 100% At the end of the three-year performance period, the Committee will critically assess whether the formulaic vesting outcome is justified.
To do this, the Committee will look at a number of factors including: whether the result is reflective of underlying performanceand has been achieved within the companys agreed risk appetite: the Solvency II coverage ratio, the quality of earnings and the nature of any changes in leverage or key assumptions.
If such considerations mean that the formulaic outcome of the vesting schedule is not felt tobe justified, then the Committee can exercise downwards discretion.

Having considered the business plan over the coming three years and market expectations of performance and given the level of stretch within the TSR performance conditions, the Committee considered it appropriate to continue to set threshold vesting 15% of the award at median TSR performance and maximum vesting at the upper quintile TSR performance.

96 Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Governance Directors report on remuneration Remuneration for employees below Board General remuneration policy The groups remuneration policy is designed to reward, motivate and retain high performers in line with the risk appetite of the group.
Remunerationis considered within the overall context of the groups sector and the markets in which the divisions operate.
The policy for the majority of employees continues to be to pay around the relevant mid-market range with a competitive package designed to align the interests ofemployees with those of shareholders, and with an appropriate proportion of total remuneration dependent upon performance.
We define core remuneration as base salary, annual bonus and other benefits such as pension.
Key employees are also eligible to participate in theperformance share plan PSP.
Summary of the remuneration structure for employees below Board Element Policy Base salary We aim to attract and retain key employees by paying salaries which deliver competitive total remuneration.
Factors taken into account when determining salaries include: the nature, size and scope of the role the knowledge, skills and experience of the individual individual and overall business performance pay and conditions elsewhere in the group appropriate external market data As a member of the Living Wage Foundation salaries are also set with reference to the Foundations UK and London living wagelevels.
For 2018, the average base salary increase was 3.2%: however, it was agreed that this spend would be focused on more junior employees within the group with base salary increases for senior managers generally limited to around 2%.
Annual bonus The majority of employees participate in a discretionary bonus plan, unless an alternative plan applies based on role.
An employee will be considered for a discretionary bonus award based on achievement against objectives, conduct and behaviours, the role performed during that year and internal relativities.
The group operates bespoke bonus plans where business appropriate.
However, the Remuneration Committee has ultimate discretion over all bonus plans.
Bonuses above a certain threshold are subject to deferral with the deferral amount increasing with the size of the bonus.
Deferred awards are normally held in shares for three years.
The company reserves the right to adjust deferral levels for code staff as deemed appropriate.
Performance Participation in the PSP is offered to a small number of senior executives each year in recognition of the strategic and influential role that they hold in terms of driving company performance, as well as their individual contribution.
This includes employees in LGIM share plan PSP whose roles span different business divisions and whose participation encourages synergy and teamwork across the group.
Participation in the plan for one year does not guarantee participation in future years.
PSP awards will be made to around 80 employees during 2019.
Where appropriate, grants under the PSP may also be made for new employees who join the company during the year in key roles.
Other share plans The company operates a Share Bonus Plan SBP which provides the vehicle for deferral of annual bonuses in the majority of cases and also allows for a limited number of awards of shares to high potential individuals and those with critical skills.
and long-term incentives In addition, the company operates a cash based long-term incentive plan for LGIM LGIM LTIP based on the financial performance of the division.
Participation in the LGIM LTIP is limited to senior managers within the division.
Pension All employees are given the opportunity to participate in a Group Pension Scheme.
The pension opportunity offered to the majority of the workforce is 10% of salary.
Employee All employees are given the opportunity to participate in a Save As You Earn SAYE plan and an Employee Share Purchase plan.
These are both HMRC approved plans which offer all employees the opportunity to share in the success of the business.
share plans Annual equal pay audit The group seeks to ensure that our pay policies and practices are free from unfair bias.
Part of the pay review process is an annual equal pay audit that reviews pay and bonus decisions by gender, ethnicity, age and full-time versus part-time working.
In addition, it considers the application of the pay policy more widely, in particular looking at decisions made in the annual pay review across grades, functions and divisions.
Gender pay reporting The group has published its gender pay report for 2018.
Further details can be found on page 36 of the report.
Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 97 Governance Pay ratio in relation to the Group CEO As in 2016 and 2017 we are voluntarily disclosing details of the pay ratio in relation to the Group CEO and the wider UK employee population.
For2018 we have made some amendments to how we report the information in order to align with the reporting requirements set out by BEIS which will come into effect for financial years starting 1 January 2019.
The tables below provide the ratio between the CEO single figure total remuneration and total remuneration for all UK employees and the details ofthe salary and total remuneration for UK employees in 2018.
Total Remuneration All employee Pay ratio Year Method 75th percentile Median 25th percentile 75th percentile Median 25th percentile 2018 B 38 77 130 86,082 42,906 25,381 2017 B 51 90 133 67,475 38,055 25,891 Salary Pay ratio All employee Year Method 75th percentile Median 25th percentile 75th percentile Median 25th percentile 2018 B 13 26 41 71,583 35,493 22,570 2017 B 18 27 42 51,550 33,706 21,765 Pay ratio commentary From 2017 to 2018 the ratio between the total remuneration of the Group CEO and the total remuneration of the employees and the median, upper and lower quartiles has reduced.
This reduction is due to a combination of a fall in the level of short and long term variable remuneration for the Group CEO from 2017 to 2018 and a significant increase in the total remuneration paid to employees, particularly at the median and upper quartile.
Methodology We have chosen option B as our method for calculating the pay ratio for this report, consistent with the methodology for reporting of the gender pay gap.
Bonus amounts for 2018 are not determined for some eligible employees until after publication of this report, and therefore it is not possible to determine the exact 2018 total remuneration for all UK employees within this timescale.
It is unlikely that the pay ratios will change significantly once these bonus amounts are determined, but for completeness and transparency, the ratio using the full actual 2018 total remuneration for all employees option A will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2019 report.
Percentage change in remuneration of director undertaking the role of Group Chief Executive 2018 over 2017 Change to base salary % Change to benefits % Change in AVP % Group Chief Executive 2.08% -41.52% -3.91% Comparator group 0.88% 0.88% 17.72% As with last year we have chosen the whole UK employee population as the comparator group.
This group has been chosen because it includes a wider cross section of the groups employees.
The increase in benefits for the employee comparator group relates to the impact of salary increases.

Terms of reference The Committees terms of reference are available on our website.
The remit of the Committee includes the remuneration strategy and policy framework for the whole company as well as the executive directors.
The Committee particularly focuses on: determining the individual remuneration for executive directors and for other designated individuals or for those who are discharging a head ofcontrol function role undertaking direct oversight on the remuneration of other high earners in the group oversight of the remuneration of Code staff and employees in the control and oversight functions oversight of remuneration policies and structures for all employees Considering risk The Reward Steering Committee RSC and the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function make a key contribution to the process of designing reward structures and evaluating whether achievement of objectives and any payment from plans have taken into account the overall risk profile of the company.
Reward Steering Committee RSC Reporting to the Remuneration Committee, the RSC helps set the framework within which our incentive arrangements are normally reviewed and implemented, with a view to supporting business strategy, whilst acting within the groups risk appetite.
The members of the RSC include the Group HR Director, Group Chief Risk Officer, Group Conduct Risk Director, Regulatory Risk Director, LGIM Chief Compliance Officer and the Director of Group Finance.
Where a business unit tables a proposal for consideration, the relevant business manager is required to attend the RSC meeting to explain the background and to answer all questions and challenges from the RSC.
Group regulatory risk and compliance function The Remuneration Committee also works closely with the group regulatory risk and compliance function with respect to remuneration proposals.
In particular, the function reports to the Committee on an annual basis on whether any risks have been taken outside of pre-agreed parameters, there have been regulatory breaches, or they are aware of any other considerations that may lead the Committee to consider whether it should impact the payment of bonuses to staff including in particular the executive directors and code staff.
The CRO also specifically looks at the overall risk profile of the company and whether executive directors have achieved objectives within the companys accepted risk appetite.
The CRO also reviews the executive directors objectives for the forthcoming year to ensure they are in line withthe risk parameters.
Since the implementation of a new Solvency II remuneration policy in 2016, the scope of the CRO report has been extended to consider whetherthere are any risk considerations which may warrant adjustments to the overall level of corporate annual variable pay awards.
100 Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Governance Directors report on remuneration Engagement with shareholders The Committee seeks to maintain an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance and any changes to the companys executive pay arrangements.
During the course of 2017 the Committee undertook a detailed review of the policyto ensure it remains appropriate to the company.
The result of the review was that the policy was considered appropriate to drive group performance: however, some changes were considered appropriate: firstly to extend the time horizons of long-term incentive awards and secondly to replace the previous EPS DPS matrix which determined 50% of PSP awards with a sole measure of EPS.
In late 2017 and early 2018, the Committee consulted with the groups largest shareholders on these changes.
During the course of 2019, the Committee intends to undertake a detailed review of the remuneration policy, and will consult with the groups largest shareholders on any changes, prior to presenting a new policy for shareholder approval at the 2020 AGM.

Young people often see money and finance as deadly dull and confusing, so we pulled out all the stops to make the workshops enjoyable and fun.
Financial literacy is now part of the national curriculum for state schools for 11-16 year-olds and is included in the maths syllabus for 5-14 year-olds.
Our aim is to help teachers and children alike to understand the basics of finance: how to earn, spend and save money.
This is closely linked to our aim to help make society more resilient financially as we know that millions of people are excluded from the benefits of personal financial services.
