BAE Systems 98 Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Appropriateness of remuneration and link to strategy The Committee has established the following six core principles which underpin our approach to executive remuneration aligned toBAE Systems strategic objectives, taking account of shareholder expectations and the new remuneration factors in the 2018  Code, as well as reflecting a stronger performance accountability across the enterprise: Simplicity Clarity and simplicity of design: ease of understanding by executives and external stakeholders.
Motivational Plans are relevant and meaningful with clear line of sight between actions and reward outcomes: metrics and targets whichdrive superior performance and value for shareholders.

philosophy and approach to executive remuneration to ensure alignment to BAE Systems strategic objectives.
BAE Systems Annual Report 2018 99 Annual remuneration report continued Wider employee remuneration The Committee has responsibility for reviewing remuneration and related policies applicable to the wider workforce, ensuring that this is taken into account when setting the policy for executive remuneration.
As part of our commitment to openness and transparency we have introduced this section which sets out more information in relation to our wider workforce and recognises the requirements of the revised UK Corporate Governance Code in this area.
Further detail regarding our employees is provided in the Our People section on page 24 including our approach, diversity and inclusion, reward and employee engagement.
For our wider employee population, reward is managed by reference to external competitor benchmarks, differentiated by competitive practice in each home market.
Share plans All-employee share plans are a long-established and highly valued part of our total reward package, providing opportunity for eligible employees in a number of our markets to acquire shares in the Company and share in its success.
The Company rewards eligible employees under these plans with an annual award of free shares, or cash equivalent, based on and subject to our Group financial performance.
We also invite eligible employees to participate in and receive free matching shares in our Company Share Incentive Plan SIP or international equivalent.
Retirement benefit provision Our reward framework includes the provision of competitive and affordable retirement benefits which reward long-term contribution and loyalty.
This is achieved through providing access to competitive retirement plans aligned to local market practice in our various locations across the globe.
In the UK, all defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants, with benefits for all new employees being provided through a defined contribution scheme.
Informing the Committee on wider workforce To build the Remuneration Committees understanding of reward arrangements applicable to the wider workforce, the Committee undertook a deep dive session in 2018 covering the broader executive reward framework as well as a range of other topics including reward principles, job sizing, pay philosophy and pay ranges, annual and long-term incentive design, employee share plans and other employee benefits including pension and retirement schemes.
It is intended that a similar deep dive session will be undertaken on an annual basis in order to provide the Committee with visibility of remuneration practices in the different sectors markets in which we operate and for the different populations within the wider workforce across the Company globally.
During meetings, the Remuneration Committee is periodically updated on wider employee matters such as the outcome of our UK gender pay analysis.
Whilst the Company does not currently directly consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay and formulating the Remuneration Policy, the Company does receive insights from the broader employee population on an annual basis using an engagement survey.
Communication with employees BAE Systems employees are kept informed of its activities and performance through a series of employee briefings at regularpoints during the year.
These briefings also serve as an informal forum for employees to ask questions about the Company.
Corporate announcements and other relevant information are circulated to employees and supplemented withupdates on the Companys intranet.
The Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and other sector and business managing directors post blogs tokeep employees informed of relevant Company or sector and business matters.
Monthly radio podcasts called Our Conversation are delivered for BAE Systems employees around the world.
The topics vary and typically include discussions on recent programme or contract activity, company performance updates, and specific deep dive features into a programme, business or market opportunity.
As shareholders through our all-employee share schemes, eligible employees are encouraged to vote and attend ourAnnual General Meeting AGM.
In addition to providing an update on our business performance, it also provides theopportunity for them in their capacity as shareholders to ask questions to our Chairman and other members of theBoard.
Communication with shareholders In line with our commitment to full transparency and engagement with our shareholders on the topic of executive remuneration, the Remuneration Committee chairman annually writes to our major shareholders to set out the changes planned for the following year.
In a year of significant change, such as during our Remuneration Policy renewal, the Remuneration Committee chairman will additionally engage directly with our major shareholders to discuss and seek views on potential changes.
The Remuneration Committee chairman values direct engagement with our shareholders and makes herself available for such meetings throughout the year to hear their perspective on remuneration matters.
In early 2018, BAE Systems conducted a Governance Investor event, aimed at encouraging greater transparency andawareness of our governance programmes, with an opportunity to provide closer contact with non-executives, particularly the committee chairs.
As part of this, the Remuneration Committee chairman shared an overview of theRemuneration Committee including the key themes and areas for focus for the Committee looking forward.
BAE Systems 100 Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Pay comparisons Pay ratio of Chief Executive to global average employee The Committee is mindful of the relationship between Chief Executive remuneration and remuneration of the wider BAE Systems employee population.
Therefore, in line with our commitment to transparency, the table below provides theratio of remuneration of the Chief Executive to the average employee of the Group for the past five years.
As can be seen, the ratio has typically been around 50:1, with the ratio being higher in 2014 as a result of the partial vesting of Long-Term Incentive awards in that year.
The ratio could range from around 20:1 to 100:1 depending on thelevel of performance against the measures which drive the Annual and Long-Term Incentive Plans.
The ratio of remuneration of the Chief Executive to the average employee of the entire Group over the last five years wasas follows: 1 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2 Chief Executives remuneration 000 3,519 2,929 3,463 3,365 2,416 3 Average employee remuneration 000 58 62 67 72 72 Ratio 60:1 47:1 52:1 47:1 33:1 1.
Chief Executives remuneration in 2017 includes a combination of the remuneration of Ian King and Charles Woodburn.
As Charles Woodburns overallremuneration is lower than Ian Kings, the calculation for 2017 results in a downward movement in the pay ratio.
The Chief Executives remuneration is calculated on the same basis as the single total figure of remuneration table.
Average employee remuneration is based on staff costs calculated on the same basis as note 3 to the Group accounts, excluding social security costsand US healthcare costs.
The 2018 figure excludes the Guaranteed Minimum Pension equalisation charge see note 22 to the Group accounts.
Recognising the global nature of our workforce, we believe the above pay ratio measured against the average employeeofthe entire Group is the most appropriate for BAE Systems.
We will therefore continue to provide thepayratio on this basis.
Pay ratio of Chief Executive to UK average employee The UK government has now introduced legislation requiring companies to publish the ratio of their Chief Executive to that of the median, 25th and 75th percentile total remuneration of full-time equivalent employees.
We are voluntarily disclosing the payratio on the required basis in this years report as shown in the table below: 25th 75th percentile Median percentile Year Method pay ratio pay ratio pay ratio 2018 Option B 61:1 48:1 38:1 The reporting regulations offer three calculation approaches for determining the pay ratio Options A, B and C. Thetable above has been calculated using the approach determined by Option B which is deemed the most appropriate methodology for BAE Systems.
Recognising that BAE Systems has more than 30,000 UK employees, operating on different human resources and payroll systems, it is not feasible to adopt Option A.
The calculations for the relevant representative employees were performed as at 31 December 2018.
To ensure Option B provides a sufficiently accurate representation of the UK workforce, we have performed sensitivity analysis around the three quartiles.
Our approach has been to consider the total pay and benefits for a number of employees centred around each quartile.
This allows any anomalies that may arise when calculating the total pay andbenefits for the full financial year such as if an employee left part way through the year to be adjusted or excluded.
By taking an average of the remaining figures, this provides a robust representation of each quartile.
The total full-time equivalent pay and benefits for the relevant employees has been calculated based on the amount paid or receivable in respect of the financial year.
The calculations are on the same basis as required for the Chief Executives remuneration for single total figure purposes.
For pension-related benefits, employer pension costs have been estimated using the employer contribution rates applicable to the members pension scheme.
No other estimates or adjustments have been used in the calculation and no remuneration items have been omitted.
A minority of employees in this calculation are employed on a part-time basis and therefore their remuneration has been annualised to reflect the full-time equivalent.
Our reward framework across the Group is based on a consistent set of principles, including managing reward by reference to external competitor benchmarks see page 98.
In the case of our Chief Executive, his total remuneration comprises a significant proportion in variable pay and therefore the single figure will vary considerably depending on thelevel of performance against the measures which drive the Annual and Long-Term Incentive Plans.
In 2018, there wasno vesting of long-term incentives for the Chief Executive in respect of performance ending in 2018 which has resulted in a decrease to the pay ratio.
The employees in the calculation would not typically participate in any long-term incentive plans and receive a significantly higher proportion of their remuneration in the form of fixed pay.
The difference in ratio at the three quartiles is consistent with our market-based approach to reward, with the ratio increasing as the Chief Executives remuneration is compared with that of more junior employees.
25th 50th 75th percentile percentile percentile Total pay and benefits 41,918 53,248 63,135 Salary component 29,498 39,286 47,404 BAE Systems Annual Report 2018 101 Annual remuneration report continued Total Shareholder Return TSR performance and Chief Executive pay The graph below shows the value by 31 December 2018, on a TSR basis, of 100 invested in BAE Systems on 31 December 2008 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE 100 index, including the effect of dividends.
The graph includes the ratio of remuneration of the Chief Executive to the average employee of the Group for the past five years.
The FTSE 100 isconsidered to be an appropriate comparator for this purpose as it is a broad equity index of which BAE Systems is a constituent member and reflects the investment interests of our UK shareholder base.
In addition, itforms 50% of the TSR performance measure for awards made from 2016 onwards.
The equivalent data is shown forthe sectoral comparator group which is of relevance to our international shareholder base.
Ian King retired and stepped down as Chief Executive on 30 June 2017 and Charles Woodburn took over the position on 1 July 2017.
Ian Kings remuneration is shown from the start of the financial year until 30 June 2017.
Charles Woodburns remuneration is shown from 1 July 2017 to the endof thatfinancial year.
Total remuneration includes the value of share plans vesting that were granted prior to appointment as Chief Executive.
BAE Systems 102 Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Percentage change in Chief Executives remuneration The percentage change from 2017 to 2018 in remuneration of the Chief Executive and average UK employee is shown inthe table below.
As required by statute, the table shows the details for the Chief Executive role and, therefore, includes a combination of the remuneration of Ian King and Charles Woodburn for the 2017 financial year.
As Charles Woodburns overall remuneration is lower than Ian Kings, the calculation for 2018 results in a downward movement in the year-on-year percentage change.
If the table below reflected Charles Woodburns remuneration for the full financial year, the percentage movement on a like-for-like basis would be a 2.5% increase in salary, a 0.1% decrease in taxable benefits anda decrease of 11.3% in bonus.
Change in Change in 1 Chief Executives average UK employee remuneration remuneration % % Base salary 3.4 2.5 Taxable benefits 49 0 Bonus 16.4 17.8 1.
The BAE Systems UK employee population has been chosen as this employee comparator group reflects the local employment conditions of the ChiefExecutive for the purpose of this comparison.
Gender pay BAE Systems has published its second annual gender pay gap report in line with the UK regulations.
For 2018, the average mean gender pay gap for our UK workforce was 9.0% 2017 11.2%, which is lower than the current UK national average of 17.9%.
We have a gender pay gap because we employ around four times more men than women and a greater proportion of our senior leadership population is male.
We rely on employing large numbers of employees with STEM qualifications and we, like other companies, face challenges recruiting females with these qualifications because there are significantly fewer women who study and work in these fields.

Adjusted to be on a like-for-like basis with the targets.
The Committee exercised its discretion in respect of the Group order intake measure and assessed the actual outcome of 28.3bn as on-target achievement, even though the on-target level had been set at 29.2bn.
In doing so, the Committee recognised the order intake for 2018 was a record achievement, and that the prevailing geopolitical climate has created an unavoidable delay in translating the March 2018 Memorandum of Intent between the UK government and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for a further 48 Typhoon aircraft, support and transfer of technology and capability into a confirmed order.
Performance against the safety element of the bonus was determined by the Corporate Responsibility Committee whose composition is stated on page 87.
The objective requires a reduction in the level of significant risk and improvement in safety culture, as well as targeted improvements against key safety indicators including a reduction in recordable injuries.
Although the Company met its stretch target for reduction in recordable injuries, the amount awarded was reduced by the Committee to reflect the incident at Radford, Virginia, which resulted in an employee fatality and two other employees being seriously injured.

The Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance and that it is appropriate for vesting of 18.8% of the TSR portion.
With respect to the EPS 2016 LTIP PS award, for which the performance period also ended on 31 December 2018, the related performance condition was not met and thus this portion of the award will lapse.

A ccrued benefit for Charles Woodburn is the total value ofhisdefined contribution account, including employee contributions and investment returns.
Accrued benefit for Jerry DeMuro is the total value of his Section 401 k account, including both employee and company contributions as well as investment returns.
The figure includes both funded and unfunded defined benefit arrangements for Peter Lynas.
Accrued benefit for PeterLynas is annual pension payable on retirement prior to any reduction for early payment or exchanging pension for cash.
In addition, a longevity adjustment factor is applied to pension accrued after 5 April 2006 to mitigate against life expectancy changes.
The figures allow for the current factors in force, whereas in practice the factors are updated annually and those in force at retirement will be applied.
Charles Woodburn participates in the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme Defined Contribution Retirement Plan EPSDCRP, which is a defined contribution arrangement for senior executives.
Charles Woodburn contributes the maximum 10,000 per annum into the EPS DCRP arrangement as permitted by the Annual Allowance and a 19%salarysupplement is paid in lieu of the Company contributions.
Jerry DeMuro participates in a Section 401 k defined contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which theCompany will match his contributions up to a maximum contribution of 6% of salary, up to US regulatory limits 2019 $19,000: 2018 $18,500.
In 2018, the company paid contributions of $16,500 into this arrangement.
Peter Lynas is a member of the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme ExPS and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 2000 Plan which together provide a pension for executive directors payable at 62 of 1 30th of three-year average final salary for each year of service subject to the payment of members contributions currently 8%.
Benefits paid prior to age 62 for ExPS and age 65 for 2000 Plan will be subject to actuarial reduction.
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target benefit for executive directors payable from normal retirement age of 1 30th of Final Pensionable Pay FPP for each year of ExPS pensionable service subject to a maximum of two-thirds of FPP.
FPP is defined as annual base salary averaged over the last 12 months prior to leaving service in respect of service accrued to 5 April 2006 and 36 months prior to leaving in respect of service from 6 April 2006.
The ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-service benefit equal to four times base salary at date of death, and a spouses death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of the prospective pension at normal retirement age.
Spouses pensions arealso payable upon death in retirement and death after leaving the Companys employment with a deferred pension.
Once in payment, pensions are increased annually by the rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum increase of 5% per year in respect of pre-6 April 2006 service and 2.5% per year in respect of service from 6 April 2006.
Peter Lynas joined the ExPS in 1999.
The 2000 Plan provides a pension of 1 50th of Final Pensionable Earnings FPE for each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement age of 65 and members pay contributions of 8% of Pensionable Earnings.
FPE under the 2000 Plan is the best consecutive three-year average of base salary and bonus in the ten Plan Years prior to leaving, less an offset for State pensions.
The Company decided in 2006 to limit pensionable bonuses in the 2000 Plan in the 2006 07 Plan Year to 20% of base salary and to 10% of base salary for the 2007 08 Plan Year and thereafter.
However, there is a guarantee that the FPE figure for benefits in respect of service prior to 6 April 2007 will not be less than the FPEfigure at 5 April 2007 to ensure that employees do not lose the benefit of contributions paid on past bonuses.
PeterLynas has 33 years and two months service in the 2000 Plan.
The review of pension policies carried out in 2010 by the Committee concluded that the pension benefits should continue to be based on the Companys registered pension schemes and that, in appropriate circumstances, the Company will continue to have the option to offer an unfunded pension promise so as to mitigate the impact of further reductions to the Lifetime Allowance and the impact of the reduced Annual Allowance.
Peter Lynas was given the choice to remain in the current arrangement and pay the increased tax or to take an unfunded promise: he elected for the latter.
The Committee has decided that in cases where the Company is to pay an unfunded promise, executives will be given the choice to commute some or all of the benefit for a taxable lump sum, or take it as pension.
Where an unfunded pension is taken, ten years after retirement, the executive will be given a further opportunity to commute the residual value of the unfunded pension for a lump sum.
Therefore, Peter Lynas total pension is the sum of his 2000 Plan benefits plus the top-up from the ExPS, most of which isprovided through the unfunded promise referred to above.

BAE Systems 112 Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Statement of directors shareholdings and share interests Minimum Shareholding Requirement MSR Executive directors are compulsorily required to establish and maintain a minimum personal shareholding equal to a setpercentage of base salary.
An Initial Value must be achieved as quickly as possible using shares vesting or options exercised through the executive share option schemes and Long-Term Incentive schemes by retaining 50% of the net value i. e. the value after deduction of exercise costs and tax of shares acquired under these schemes.
Once the Initial Value is achieved, a Subsequent Value must be achieved in the same way, except that a minimum of 25% of the net value must be retained on each exercise or acquisition.
Shares owned beneficially by the director including the portion of net annual bonus deferred compulsorily into BAE Systems shares and his her spouse count towards the MSR.
Any case of non-compliance would be dealt with by the Committee.
The MSR does not currently apply after the individual has ceased to be a director.
The Committee intends to make necessary changes to the existing policy to ensure an appropriate post-cessation holding policy is in place, as part of thebroader executive remuneration policy proposals to be submitted for approval at the Companys Annual General Meeting AGM in May 2020.
The following table sets out MSR Initial Value and Subsequent Value and actuals as at 31 December 2018: Initial Value Subsequent Value Actual Charles Woodburn 150% 300% 71% Peter Lynas 100% 200% 188% Jerry DeMuro 212.5% 425% 186% The actual MSR figures in the table are provided as at 31 December 2018, based on the year-end share price of 4.59.
The share price fluctuated throughout the year such that for the majority of the year, the actual MSR figures held by the executive directors were accordingly higher.
Charles Woodburn and Jerry DeMuro joined the Board in 2016 and 2014 respectively, and have been gradually building up their shareholdings.
The higher MSR values applicable to Jerry DeMuro which were increased at the beginning of 2018 recognise the higher LTI opportunity and broader US market practice.
There are MSR requirements in place for all of the employee population who receive LTIPs.
There are no shareholding requirements for the Chairman or the non-executive directors.
