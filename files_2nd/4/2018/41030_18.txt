No further performance conditions apply to these awards.
Malus provisions apply to the deferred share awards in the event, for example, of a material misstatement of results with clawback provisions applying to the cash awards.
The share price used to calculate the awards was the average closing price of a Whitbread share for the five business days preceding 1 March 2018 i. e. 3,911.4 pence.
The number of deferred shares awarded to each director will be as follows: Number of deferred Number of deferred shares awarded shares awarded Director 2018 2017 Alison Brittain 11,102 9,104 Nicholas Cadbury 7,383 6,128 Louise Smalley 4,799 4,051 Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 81 Governance Governance Annual report on remuneration continued Long Term Incentive Plan The amounts shown in the table on page 79 refer to the value of the LTIP awards made in 2015 and vesting in 2018.
The value given for the LTIP awards is based on the average market value over the last quarter of the financial year 3,886.6 pence, as the awards will not vest until after the date of this report.
During the 2015 and 2016 LTIP performance periods, a strategic decision was taken by the Board to undertake certain sale and leaseback transactions in order to manage the balance sheet effectively to generate the best returns for shareholders.
On-going rental expense from all sale and leaseback transactions is reflected in reported EPS numbers.
For consistency the decision was taken to include profit from these transactions alongside the rental expense when determining underlying earnings for the EPS and ROCE performance conditions.
The Committee felt it was appropriate for these amounts to be treated in a consistent way in determining the incentive outcome.
This approach will be taken in respect of these material sale and leaseback transactions for both the 2015 and 2016 LTIPs.
As a result of performance, 38.3% of the shares awarded under the 2015 LTIP will vest.
The awards vesting to the executive directors each of which are subject to a two-year holding period are as follows: Number of Number of Director sharesvested 2018 sharesvested 2017 Alison Brittain 11,182 22,334 Nicholas Cadbury 4,334 10,255 Louise Smalley 3,041 6,688 Pension The percentage of salary or pension allowance received by the executive directors in pension contributions is shown in the table below.
Director % of salary Alison Brittain 25.0 Nicholas Cadbury 27.5 Louise Smalley 27.5 Executives receive either a pension contribution or a monthly amount in cash in lieu of the pension contribution.
Alison Brittain received a cash payment, while Nicholas Cadbury andLouise Smalley each elected to receive a cash payment less an amount equal to the employers national insurance contribution.
The percentage of salary received by Nicholas Cadbury and Louise Smalley rose from 25.0% to 27.5% on 1 December 2017 and 1 November 2017 respectively.
Thiswas as a result of grandfathered terms.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 82 EPS growth above RPI per annum Governance Statement of directors shareholding and share interests audited information The Committee believes that the shareholding requirements for executives play an important role in the alignment of the interests of executives and shareholders and help to incentivise executives to deliver sustainable long-term performance.
The Chief Executive is required to build and hold a shareholding at least equal to 200% of salary, whilst the other executive directors are expected to reach a holding to the value of 125% of salary and other senior executives 75% of salary.
Until they reach this level, executives are expected to retain 100% of vested awards after the deduction of income tax, national insurance contributions and dealing fees.
In addition, a newly appointed executive director is expected to build a shareholding in the Company in advance of any share awards vesting.
The failure to adhere to these requirements may lead to the executive being excluded from participation in future share scheme awards.
It should be noted that any vested LTIP awards subject to a holding period will not be counted for the purpose of calculating whether an executive has met his or her requirement.
When determining whether a director has met the requirement, both the current market price and the price at the point the shares were acquired will be taken into consideration.
All of the executive directors are in compliance with the requirement.
Alison Brittain, who was appointed in September 2015, and is currently required to build towards a 200% holding, invested in excess of 1 million in the Companys shares from her own resources.
Alisons first share scheme award partially vested in April 2017, but is subject to a two-year holding period.
During 2014 15, shareholding requirements were introduced for the Chairman and the non-executive directors.
They are each required to build a holding to the value of 100% of their annual fee over a three-year period.
The table below shows the holdings of directors as at 1 March 2018: Counting towards requirement Performance versus requirement Additional awards % of salary Awards not Number of Value based on Value based on Shareholding based on % of salary Awards subject subject to ordinary purchase price market price requirement purchase based on to performance performance 1 2 shares 000 000 % of salary price market price conditions conditions Chairman 3 Adam Crozier 1,000 41 39 100 10 10 Richard Baker 16,188 N A N A N A N A N A Executive directors Alison Brittain 20,900 1,029 812 200 127 100 111,353 35,067 Nicholas Cadbury 29,100 1,182 1,131 125 215 205 45,129 29,183 Louise Smalley 41,236 1,531 1,603 125 420 440 30,948 19,707 Non-executive directors David Atkins 1,425 56 55 100 94 92 Sir Ian Cheshire 2,282 N A N A N A N A N A Chris Kennedy 1,500 61 58 100 102 97 4 Deanna Oppenheimer 1,600 66 62 100 110 104 Susan Taylor Martin 1,490 50 58 100 83 97 Stephen Williams 11,340 N A N A N A N A N A As at date of leaving 1 Includes outstanding LTIP awards for which performance has not yet been tested.

The Committee consulted with employees in relevant roles when developing the directors remuneration policy.
Base salary All employees, including the executive directors, receive an annual review of base salary.
Under normal circumstances the annual increase in salary for an executive director will be in the same range as the increase for employees across the Group.
Benefits Approximately 1,100 employees across the Group are entitled to a company car or cash in lieu of a company car.
The executive directors are no longer entitled to a company car under this scheme, but are entitled to receive cash in lieu of a car.
Approximately 2,700 employees are entitled to participate in the Groups private healthcare scheme, with 1,150 of these, including the executive directors, entitled to family cover.
All employees receive discounts on Company products, but the directors have waived their right to this benefit.
Whitbreads Sharesave scheme is a standard HMRC approved SAYE scheme.
It is offered to all UK employees, including the executive directors, on equal terms.
Annual Incentive Scheme Approximately 6,400 employees are eligible to receive an annual incentive payment linked to the achievement of profit and WINcard targets.
The maximum opportunity is dependent on the role.
Approximately 90 executives, including the executive directors, are entitled to participate in the Annual Incentive Scheme, with maximum payouts split between cash and deferred shares, ranging from 60% to 167%.
Approximately 200 senior leaders, including the executive directors, are given individual strategic objectives in addition to the profit and WINcard targets mentioned above.
Long Term Incentive Plan Approximately 50 executives, including the executive directors, participate in the LTIP.
This scheme is not available to the wider employee population, although the Sharesave scheme provides employees with a form of long-term incentive.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 84 Governance Pension Like all employees, the executive directors are entitled to participate in the Companys pension scheme.
The scheme is a defined contribution scheme.
Employees below the executive level are able to choose a contribution rate of between 5% and 10% and have this matched by the Company.
Approximately 45 executives receive between 15% and 20% of basic salary from the Company, which can be allocated to pension or taken as cash.
Employees who do not choose to participate may be automatically enrolled with contributions in line with the automatic enrolment regulations.
The policy on pension contributions for executive directors is that there is an upper limit for Company contributions of 27.5% of salary.
In 2013, the upper limit for new joiners was reduced to 25%.
This contribution can be allocated to pension, or taken as cash.
Fees from external directorships The executive directors are entitled to retain fees from external directorships.
Louise Smalley is a non-executive director of DS Smith Plc and retained a fee of 56,735.
Alison Brittain is a non-executive director of Marks and Spencer Plc and retained a fee of 70,000.
Nicholas Cadbury is a non-executive director of Land Securities Group PLC and retained a fee of 78,333.

The base salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 May 2018 will be as follows: Base salary at Base salary at 1 May 2018 1 May 2017 Director 000 000 Alison Brittain 843 811 Nicholas Cadbury 573 551 Louise Smalley 379 362 Benefits The benefits received by each executive director will continue to include family private healthcare and a cash allowance in lieu of a company car.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 85 Governance Governance Annual report on remuneration continued Annual incentive scheme To be eligible to receive incentive payments there are gateway requirements relating to both performance and leadership behaviour.
Any incentive payments will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee in the event that either profit performance is below 90% of target or the health and safety score is red on the WINcard.
The expectation is that our leaders actions reflect Whitbreads values and code of conduct, including our approach to health and safety.
Keeping our team and customers safe is not an incentive lever but a core responsibility that earns the right to achieve incentivised rewards.
Profit and WINcard performance % of salary In 2018 19, half of the total incentive available will be based on performance against a Group underlying profit before tax target.
This profit target is considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive and, for that reason, is not disclosed in advance.
The Committee intends to disclose the target retrospectively in the 2018 19 report.
Each executive will be able to earn an additional 25% of the maximum based on WINcard measures.
One measure will be operational team retention and the others will be Customer Heartbeat measures, made up of Premier Inn brand health, Costa net recommend and Restaurants net recommend.
Only half of the maximum available in respect of these measures will be available for a green WINcard score, with 75% of maximum payout available for achieving a stretch target beyond green and maximum payout requiring an excel level, to be achieved.
Profit and WINcard performance % of salary % of salary linked to Threshold Total profit performance % of salary linked to WINcard measures On-target Total Maximum Total Individual strategic objectives Each executive director also has three individual strategic objectives.
They will be eligible to receive up to 25% of the maximum incentive opportunity based on the delivery of these objectives.
Achievement of the approved objective outcomes has been aligned to a payment level that would be recognised as stretch performance.
The objectives are quantifiable and linked to the business plan and future financial performance.
The table below shows a summary of the individual strategic objectives for each of the executive directors, together with details on which of the three strategic priorities see pages 10 to 11 each objective is linked to: Strategic Priority Alison Brittain Growth in UK estate and Premier Inn occupancy and delivery of key UK innovations.
1 Increase German hotel pipeline, updated growth plan for Costa China and international progress for Costa Express.
2 Develop detailed road map to deliver cost savings plan and deliver in-year cost savings.
3 Nicholas Cadbury Develop a new financial operating model and improved reporting for property.
1 3 Achievement of in-year international growth targets.
2 Deliver in-year cost savings and support transformation plan.
3 Louise Smalley Deploy the new HR System to plan, budget and key governance parameters in the UK and Germany.
1 2 Establish a representative and sustainable employee forum structure across the Group, initially in the UK.
1 Increased succession cover for priority roles pools critical to long-term growth and brand proposition development.
2 3 Cash awards will be made in May 2019, with deferred equity issued in April 2019 and due to vest on 1 March 2022, with no further performance conditions applying.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 86 Governance Long Term Incentive Plan The awards to be made in 2018 will be based on 200% of base salary for Alison Brittain and 125% of base salary for the other executive directors, calculated by reference to the average of the closing price of a Whitbread share for the five business days preceding 1 March 2018 i. e. 3,911.4 pence.
They will vest in April 2021, subject to the directors continued employment within the Group and satisfaction of the performance conditions.
The awards will be subject to a two-year holding period post vesting.
The 2018 awards to the executive directors will be made in April 2018 and, in line with the 2017 grant, will be subject to two independently operating performance conditions: 50% will be dependent on the Group ROCE in 2020 21, with the threshold being 13% and maximum payout at 18%, with a sliding scale operating in between.
A further 50% will be dependent on an EPS growth target operating on a sliding scale between 4% per annum at threshold and 10% per annum at maximum.
The Committee is mindful that it is crucial that the executive team is awarded fairly for its significant contribution to the ongoing success of the Company and that this key talent is retained within the business.
During the year the Committee considered the LTIP grant levels for the Group Finance Director and Group HR Director, which have remained unchanged at 125% of salary for a number of years.
The maximum LTIP grant under our policy, approved by shareholders in 2017, is 200% of salary.
The current LTIP grant level is significantly behind market levels, which therefore reduces the competitiveness of the package for these two roles.
It is the Committees intention to review future LTIP award levels for these two roles.
As set out in the Remuneration Committee Chairs letter, further to the recent announcement, the Committee will be consulting with major shareholders on proposals for a new long term incentive plan and revised Policy which will support the future strategy of the business and successful execution of the demerger.
To this end, in the event that the revised Policy is approved by shareholders, the Committee will substitute awards under the new arrangements for the 2018 LTIP awards.
The number of shares awarded under the LTIP to each director will be as follows: Value of Number of award Director sharesawarded 000 Alison Brittain 41,463 1,622 Nicholas Cadbury 17,602 689 Louise Smalley 11,637 455 LTIP performance conditions past awards Performance metrics 2014 award Based on underlying basic EPS growth above RPI per annum of 4% to 10% on a sliding scale with a onethird multiplier based on ROCE in 2016 17 of 13% to 18%.
ROCE also acts as a hurdle and is calculated using an average of the previous 13 months net assets.
2015 award Based on underlying basic EPS growth above RPI per annum of 4% to 10% on a sliding scale with a onethird multiplier based on ROCE in 2017 18 of 13% to 18%.
2016 award Based on underlying basic EPS growth above RPI per annum of 4% to 10% on a sliding scale with a onethird multiplier based on ROCE in 2018 19 of 13% to 18%.
2017 award Subject to two independently operating performance conditions.
50% of each award is dependent on Group ROCE in 2019 20, with the threshold being 13% and the maximum payout at 18%, with a sliding scale operating in between.
The other 50% of each award will be linked to an EPS growth target on a sliding scale between 4% per annum at threshold and 10% per annum at maximum.
Chairmans fee Adam Crozier was appointed Chairman on 1 March 2018 and his fee with effect from that date is 400,000.
The Chairmans fee will be reviewed annually.
Non-executive directors fees The base annual fee for non-executive directors is 60,000, which was increased from 57,000 on 1 March 2018, having previously been reviewed in March 2016.
The fees for the chairmanship of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee are unchanged at 20,000.
The fee for the Senior Independent Director remains at 15,000 and the fees for membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees are unchanged at 5,000.
Non-executive director fees will be reviewed annually in the future.
