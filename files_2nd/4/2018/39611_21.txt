4 The 2018 value relates to an LTI award granted in 2016.
Performance has been assessed over the three year period to 31 December 2018 as set out below resulting in 487,285 shares due to vest in two equal tranches in March 2020 and March 2021.
No discretion was exercised by the Committee as a result of share price appreciation or depreciation over the performance period.
The estimated value above is 11,013 higher than the value of 487,285 shares at the time of grant, as a result of the share price rising from 2.2574 to 2.28 over the period.

Economic Profit was defined as profit after tax and preference share charges less tangible net asset value multiplied by the cost of equity.
The companies in the relative TSR group for this award were: Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC, Standard Chartered, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Crdit Agricole, Santander, Socit Gnrale, Unicredit, ING, Intesa San Paolo and Nordea Bank.
Final outcome and discretionary underpin If the Committee considers that the vesting outcome calibrated in line with the performance conditions above does not reflect underlying financial results, or if the Committee is not satisfied that conduct and risk management during the performance period has been effective, then the terms of the award allow for an underpin to be used to reduce the vesting.
In making its final judgement, the Committee considered the overall context of performance, noting significant improvements in capital strength and employee engagement over the period and the Trust score for NatWest also meeting the target.
Relative TSR, the cost:income ratio and customer performance were not at the required level.
The Committee also considered the potential impact of the US Department of Justice charge on the Economic Profit outcome.
Input was also received from the Board Risk Committee on risk performance.
Taking all circumstances into account, the Committee determined that no further adjustment was necessary under the discretionary underpin.

Note: 1 Awards were granted as conditional share awards.
The number of shares was calculated in line with the approved policy with the maximum potential award being 175% of salary for the Chief Executive and 200% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
The award price of 2.659 was based on the average share price over five business days prior to grant.
The award levels reflected a reduction of 10% to the maximum award following the pre-grant assessment of performance over 2017.
Ewen Stevensons award was forfeited on 30 November 2018, his final date of employment.
For Ross McEwan, subject to the pre-vest assessment, the award will be eligible to vest in equal amounts between years 2021 and 2025.
Malus provisions will apply up until vest and clawback provisions will also apply for a period of at least seven years from the date of grant.
Further details on malus and clawback can be found on page 80.
70 Annual Report on Remuneration Performance assessment framework for LTI awards granted from 2018 onwards For each of the core performance areas, the Committee will consider whether the executive director has achieved what would reasonably have been expected over the relevant period.
The Committee will follow a robust process to review performance against pre-set objectives relevant to RBSs strategic aims, but will apply its judgement without reference to formulaic targets and weightings.
Performance will be assessed taking into account circumstances applying over the period.
Risk & Control and Stakeholder Perception underpins will also apply under which the Committee, with input from the Board Risk Committee and Sustainable Banking Committee, can consider if there are any other factors that would lead to a downwards adjustment.
The majority of the performance variation will normally take place under the pre-grant assessment, with a further assessment prior to any vesting taking place.
Overall, the achievement of reasonable or target performance expectations will deliver full or nearly full payout of the LTI awards, as long as executives deliver good, sustainable performance.
This approach reflects the significantly reduced level of awards compared to the previous policy, creating more predictable outcomes and encouraging safe and secure growth within risk appetite.
Each year, the performance factors will be determined in light of RBSs priorities for that year.

Outcome of the pre-grant assessment The Committee also received advice from the Board Risk Committee and the Sustainable Banking Committee in making its final assessment.
After considering all the factors above, the Committee determined that good progress had been made with strong performance particularly in relation to capital and people scores.
2018 was seen as a milestone year with a number of important legacy issues resolved, the resumption of dividends and arrangements in place for ring-fencing.
Overall, the Committee considered that a 6% reduction was appropriate as customer and risk performance was not fully at the desired level.

74 Annual Report on Remuneration Directors interests in RBS shares and shareholding requirements audited The shareholding requirement is to hold shares to the value of 400% of salary for the Chief Executive and 250% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
Unvested shares from LTI awards count on a net of tax basis towards meeting the shareholding requirement once the pre-vest performance assessment has taken place, at the end of the three year period.
Once the respective retention periods have passed, directors can only sell up to 25% of the shares received until the requirement is met.
There are no shareholding requirements for non-executive directors.
Shareholding requirements audited Ross McEwan Ewen Stevenson as at 30 September 2018 Shareholding Shareholding requirement requirement Notes: 1 Ross McEwan holds 142,925 shares from his 2015 and 2016 fixed share allowances that are included in the shares held below but these have been excluded from the shareholding requirements calculation as he will transfer these shares to charity at the end of the retention period.

2018 2017 m m Change Remuneration paid to all employees 1 3,628 3,945 8.0% Distributions to holders of ordinary shares 2 241 Distributions to holders of preference shares and paid-in equity 470 628 25.2% Taxation and other charges recognised in the income statement: - Social security, Bank levy and Corporation tax 1,062 1,100 3.5% - Irrecoverable VAT and other indirect taxes incurred by RBS 3 616 533 15.6% Notes: 1 Remuneration paid to all employees represents total staff expenses per Note 3 to the Financial Statements, exclusive of social security and other staff costs.
As the contents of other staff costs per Note 3 is different to prior years, the 2017 balance has been re-presented for consistency.
2 In 2018 RBS paid an interim dividend of 2.0p per ordinary share.
In addition, the company announced that the directors have recommended a final dividend of 3.5p per ordinary share, and a further special dividend of 7.5p per ordinary share, which are both subject to shareholders approval at the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2019.
3 Input VAT and other indirect taxes not recoverable by RBS due to it being partially exempt.
76 TSR Annual Report on Remuneration Change in Chief Executive pay compared with employees The table below shows the percentage change in remuneration for the Chief Executive between 2017 and 2018 compared with the percentage change in the average remuneration of RBS employees based in the UK.
In each case, remuneration is based on salary, benefits and annual bonus.
The Chief Executive also receives a fixed share allowance as part of his fixed pay and this remained unchanged over the period.
Salary Benefits Annual Bonus 2017 to 2018 change 2017 to 2018 change 2017 to 2018 change Chief Executive 1 0% 0% n a UK employees 2 17% -51% 8% Notes: 1 Executive directors are not eligible for an annual bonus but receive variable pay in LTI awards.
Standard benefit funding for executive directors remained unchanged between 2017 and 2018.
The benefits for the Chief Executive excludes other benefits such as travel assistance in connection with company business and relocation benefits, the value of which is disclosed each year in the total remuneration table.
2 The data represents full year average salary costs of the UK based employee population.
This is considered to be the most representative comparator group as it covers the majority of employees and the Chief Executive is based in the UK.
The changes in salary and benefits for employees have largely been driven by a simplification and rebalancing of fixed pay arrangements.
There was no material change to total remuneration as a result of these changes.
The percentage reduction in benefits is not equal to the percentage uplift in salary because the underlying values are different and salary makes up a larger proportion of total remuneration.
CEO to employee pay ratios We are including the table below ahead of new reporting requirements formally applying next year.
The ratios compare the total remuneration of the Chief Executive, as set out in this report, against the remuneration of the median UK employee as well as employees at the lower and upper quartiles.
The disclosure will build up over time to cover a rolling 10-year period.
A significant proportion of the Chief Executives pay is delivered in LTI awards, where awards are linked to the companys performance and share price movements over the longer-term.
Therefore, the ratios will depend significantly on LTI outcomes and may fluctuate from one year to th th th the next.
None of the three employees identified at the 25, 50 and 75 percentiles this year received LTI awards.
The table also includes ratios covering salary only so that a further comparison is possible as well as the remuneration values for the identified employees.
The steps that RBS takes to ensure employees are paid fairly are set out earlier in this report.

2 Option A methodology was selected as this is considered the most statistically accurate method under the reporting regulations.
UK employees receive a pension funding allowance set as a percentage of salary.
Some employees, but not the Chief Executive, continue to participate in the defined benefit pension scheme, under which it would be possible to recognise a higher value.
For simplicity and consistency with our regulatory disclosures, the pension funding allowance value has been included in the calculation for all employees.
3 The data for the three individuals identified has been considered and fairly reflects pay at the relevant quartiles amongst the UK employee population.
Each of the three individuals was a full-time employee during the year and none received an exceptional award which would otherwise inflate their pay figures.

2 The value of the LTI awards reflects awards that were granted in 2016 and performance-assessed at the end of 2018.
An estimated value is shown above based on the average share price between October and December 2018, consistent with the method used for executive directors in this report.
3 The buyout includes awards granted in replacement of awards forfeited on leaving a previous employer and also an award in respect of lost variable pay opportunity for 2018.
