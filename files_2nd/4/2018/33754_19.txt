How was the annual bonus payment determined?
Audited The bonus elements with targets for the year, performance against these targets, and the resulting payouts are set out below.

The Committee therefore determined that in respect of the year to 31 December 2018, the resulting annual bonus awards were as follows: Maximum opportunity Actual % Total Paid in Deferred % of salary of salary awarded cash in shares Duncan Painter 125% 25% 133,688 66,844 66,844 Mandy Gradden 125% 25% 90,159 45,080 45,080 The Committee confirmed the level of bonus payouts were appropriate with respect to the 2018 performance.
At the time of setting the targets, the Committee considered the target ranges to provide an appropriate balance between being achievable at the bottom end of the performance ranges and providing a stretch target at the top end of the ranges.
The targets above are the adjusted targets that allow for acquisitions and divestments during the year.
The adjustments to the original targets ensured that the restated numbers were no more or less challenging but for the material transactions that took place during the year.
This process included, for example, increasing the targets for expected performance for acquired businesses.
These adjustments ensured that the targets were able to fulfil their original intent.
In addition, the original targets were considered similarly demanding to those set for 2018 allowing for changes to the Group and, for any bonuses to become payable, a threshold EBITA was set at 107.6m, which was ahead of the threshold target set in 2018 of 98.1m.
The annual bonus is subject to deferral and 50% of the above awards will be paid as conditional share awards with a three-year vesting period.
What equity awards are eligible to vest based on performance to 31 December 2018?

Base salary The base salaries of the Executive Directors will be increased by 2.5% with effect from 1 April 2019, in line with the wider employee group, taking Duncan Painters salary to 551,450 and Mandy Graddens salary to 371,950.
Annual bonus plan The annual bonus plan will continue to be subject to a maximum of 125% of base salary and measured against stretching financial targets.
50% of the bonus will be based on Adjusted EBITA and 50% will be based on revenue.
Half of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares which vest after a three-year period.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive.
An explanation of bonus payouts and performance achieved, along with the targets set, will be provided in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
The range of targets set for 2019 is considered to be similarly challenging to a range of targets set for 2018 allowing for current commercial circumstances.
Performance Share Plan The Committee intends to grant PSP awards to the Executive Directors in 2019 at 200% of salary for Duncan Painter and 175% of salary for Mandy Gradden.
75% of the award will be measured against growth in Adjusted EPS and 25% against relative TSR versus the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts.
Each element will be assessed independently of each other.
The Adjusted EPS targets that are intended to apply to the 2019 PSP awards were set following the Committees review of internal financial planning, external market expectations, current macro-economic conditions and range of targets to apply will require annual growth of between 6% and 15% per annum increased from 6% to 12% from the 2018 Adjusted EPS result.
These targets are considered to be no less challenging than the range of targets set for the 2018 awards, providing a realistic incentive at the lower end of the performance range, but with full vesting requiring exceptional outperformance in the current commercial context.
A summary of the 2019 performance targets is set out below: Threshold Stretch Performance criteria Weighting 25% vesting 100% vesting Measurement period Adjusted EPS Compound Annual 75% 6% 15% CAGR measured over the three financial years to 2021, using 2018 Growth Rate CAGR as the base year Relative Total Shareholder Return 25% Median Upper Average Return Index of Company and each member of the quartile constituent group Average Return during the three-month period ending on 31 December 2018 to the Average Return during the three-month period to 31 December 2021 Vesting between threshold and maximum will be measured on a straight line basis.
