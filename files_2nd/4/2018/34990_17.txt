Remuneration arrangements across the Group When setting Executive remuneration, consideration is given to pay policies and employment conditions of employees of the Company and elsewhere in the Group.
The remuneration of employees across the Group is based on three fundamental principles.
Firstly, that it allows the Group to retain the level of talent necessary to implement the strategy as set by the Board.
Additionally, that levels of remuneration should be sufficient to achieve this aim, but should never be higher than is necessary to do so.
Finally, with limited exceptions, the more significant the ability of an employee to influence the Companys financial results through their individual performance, the higher the proportion of their remuneration should be performance-based.
The level and design of variable pay takes into account the need to avoid incentivising the Groups employees to act in a manner that is inconsistent with the Groups risk appetite, as set by the Board.
Consistent with the policy for Executive Directors, where annual bonuses are in place across the Group, they are linked to business performance with a focus on underlying Group, divisional profit and other relevant metrics.
Whilst only Executive Directors and senior Executives participate in the PSP, other full time employees in the UK and Germany can participate in the Companys all-employee SAYE scheme which is designed to incentivise participants to build a shareholding in the Company, thus aligning their interests with those of the Groups shareholders.
This plan is not subject to performance conditions, but requires the employee to remain employed at the end of the term of the scheme which they have joined.
In line with local country practices, all employees are encouraged to contribute appropriate savings towards their retirement.
In the UK, the Company operates pension arrangements within the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes Automatic Enrolment Regulations 2010.
Whilst the Company does not feel it appropriate to consult directly with employees when drawing up the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee has considered any feedback received via employee engagement surveys and from the regular meeting the CEO and Group Human Resources Director conduct with staff representative bodies in each of our major geographies.
89 Directors Remuneration Report continued Annual Remuneration Report Responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee The key responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are to determine on behalf of the Board: the Companys general policy on Executive remuneration: and the specific remuneration packages of the Executive Directors, the Chairman of the Board and senior Executives of the Group including, but not limited to, base salary, pension, annual performance-related bonuses and PSP awards.

Bonus payments are also subject to clawback for two years, in the event that the Group materially misstates its financial results for the reporting period or in the event of misconduct by the Executive Director.
The 2018 annual bonus opportunity was driven by the financial performance of the business and individual targets for each Director.
For the year ended 31 December 2018, 80 per cent of this award was conditional on the achievement of criteria linked to the financial performance of the Group.
These targets were set by the Committee with reference to the Groups strategic and financial plans, as approved by the Board of Directors.

95 Directors Remuneration Report continued Minimum shareholding requirements In accordance with the Groups minimum shareholding guidelines, the CEO is required to build up a shareholding that is equal to 200 per cent of his her gross salary.
In respect of the FD, the threshold that is expected to be achieved is 200 per cent of his her gross salary.
It is additionally expected that the Executive Director will achieve these levels within five years of appointment.
For the purposes of these requirements, options which have vested unconditionally, but are as yet unexercised, will be included on a net basis, for the purposes of calculating shareholdings, as will shares held by an Executives spouse or dependants.
There is no requirement for the Non-Executive Directors of the Company to hold shares.
The Committee notes the new provision in the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to post-employment shareholdings.
There is currently a policy in place whereby any share-based awards normally continue on their original time horizons if good leaver status has been awarded including the application of a holding period for PSP awards, therefore requiring Executives to retain an interest in shares post-employment.
However, the Committee will continue to keep this under review.
Both the CEO and the FD have met and substantially exceed their shareholding requirement.

Based on the Companys closing share price as at 31 December 2018, being 10.06.
4 On 24 October 2018, the Company granted 2,846 options to acquire ordinary shares pursuant to the Computacenter Sharesave Plus Scheme at an Option Price of 10.54 to Tony Conophy.

Dilution limits Computacenter uses a mixture of both new issue and market purchase shares to satisfy the vesting of awards made under its PSP, DBP and Sharesave schemes.
In line with best practice, the use of new or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under all share schemes, is restricted to 10 per cent in any 10-year rolling period, with a further restriction for discretionary schemes of five per cent in the same period.
The Companys current position against its dilution limit is under each of these thresholds.
The Company regularly reviews its position against the dilution guidelines and, should there be insufficient headroom within which to grant new awards which could be satisfied by issuing new shares, it is the intention of the Company to continue its current practice of satisfying new awards with shares purchased on the market.
Payments to past Directors and payments for loss of office There have been no payments made to past Directors and no payments made for loss of office during the period.
