b All Directors received salary supplement allowance in lieu of contributions into the Groups pension scheme throughout the year.
No Director had any entitlement under the defined benefit section of the pension scheme and no additional benefit was received as a result of early retirement.
c The annual bonus column shows 50 per cent of the total bonus contribution earned under the MIP Element A in respect of 2018 performance, and 50 per cent of the total value of Element B shares awarded which are deferred but are not subject to further performance conditions other than continued employment.
The remaining 50 per cent in respect of 2018 Element A is deferred into shares in the MIP account which are subject to performance and employment-based forfeiture for a further holding period.
The remaining 50 per cent of 2018 Element B shares is subject to performance and employment-based forfeiture for a 3-year deferred period.
These deferred elements will be disclosed in the LTIP column when the conditions are satisfied.
The deferred shares in relation to both Element A and Element B may change in value during the holding period depending on Marshalls' share price.
d The LTIP column shows the aggregate value of sums released from MIP or LTIP account balances from earlier years that are no longer subject to deferral and forfeiture risk.
The LTIP figure for 2017 includes the 2014 Performance Share Awards under the 2005 LTIP that vested in 2017.
There were no further outstanding LTIP awards, so the 2018 column relates solely to MIP awards.
Setting pay in context The following graphs illustrate the relationship between total expenditure on remuneration and other disbursements from profit over the past 3 years.
The 4 elements represent the most significant outgoings for the Company during the financial year.
In addition to staff pay and shareholder distributions, capital investment and taxation are shown for the following reasons: investment the Companys strategy is to increase capital investment to take advantage of market demand and in order to ensure that the business grows in a sustainable manner with a corresponding long-term benefit for all stakeholders: and tax the Company is a UK taxpayer and feels that it is beneficial to demonstrate to all its stakeholders its total UK tax contribution.
The most significant elements of the Companys UK tax contribution are VAT, employers NI, corporation tax, fuel duty and aggregates levy.
As profitability increases, corporation tax will also increase.
In 2018 the Group was re-accredited with the Fair Tax Mark.

The previously deferred proportion of the 2017 Element A award was converted into shares by reference to the mid-market average value for the 30-day period ending on 31 December 2017.
Dividends paid during the year are also added to the carried-forward plan account.
The chart above shows the resulting opening balance value calculated by reference to the mid-market average value for the 30-day period ended 31 December 2018 and adding the value of dividends of 14.8 pence per share paid during 2018. b The earned Element A award for 2018 is added to the individuals plan account, and 50 per cent of the resulting balance is released to the participant as an annual bonus: the remaining 50 per cent is deferred into the participants MIP account and converted into shares.
The deferral is repeated in each subsequent year up to the final year.
In the final year, subject to any forfeiture provisions, 100 per cent of any balance in the MIP account is released.
c The carried-forward balance is converted back into shares by reference to the mid-market average value for the 30-day period ended 31 December 2018 446.94 pence.
d If the actual EPS falls below the forfeiture threshold over the 3 years before vesting, 50 per cent of the balance of the award is forfeited.
Once Element B shares have vested, they must normally be held for a further 2 years.
Element B shares lapse on cessation of employment except in good leaver circumstances, in which case they vest on leaving and must be held for 2 years from the date of leaving.

Marshalls plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 71 Corporate governance Remuneration Committee Report continued Annual Remuneration Report continued Service contracts and policy on termination payments Each Executive Director has a service contract with the Company which is terminable by the Company on not more than 12 months notice and by the Director on 6 months notice.
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, are appointed under letters of appointment, usually for a term of 3 years.
Either the Company or the Non-Executive Director may terminate the appointment before the end of the current term on 6 months notice.
If the unexpired term is less than 6 months, notice does not need to be served.
No compensation is payable if a Non-Executive Director is required to stand down.
There are no provisions for compensation for loss of office on a takeover.
In the event of early termination of an Executive Directors service contract, our policy is to ensure that termination is effected in accordance with Company obligations while fully reflecting the individuals obligation to mitigate loss.
