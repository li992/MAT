89 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018 ANNUAL REMUNERATION REPORT The following section provides details of how the Companys Remuneration Policy was applied during the financial year ended 31 December 2018.
In addition, Executive Directors are entitled to life assurance which is not taxable.
Single year variable Bonus including DSBP The single year variable amount includes the cash Bonus payable and monetary value of the shares awarded under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
In accordance with the Policy, 50 per cent of any Bonus earned in 2018 will be deferred into shares under the DSBP.
Vesting of shares is dependent on continued employment or good leaver status.
See Chart 3 for details of the 2018 Bonus payment.
As the MSCI Benchmark data was not available at the date of publication of the 2017 Annual Report, the 2017 Bonus payments disclosed last year were based on an estimate of 100 per cent of the TPR element being achieved.
The TPR element has since been confirmed at 100 per cent and accordingly no adjustment has been made to the 2017 figure.
Multiple year variable LTIP 2018 The outturn for the 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP which vests in 2019 has been estimated at 100 per cent and the vesting share price has been estimated at 612.96 pence, based on the three-month average share price ending 31 December 2018.
For further information see page 96.
It is estimated that 534,240 of the above figure for David Sleath and 349,685 of the above figures for Andy Gulliford and Phil Redding may be attributed to a share price appreciation of 190.46 pence per share, based on an actual award price of 422.50 pence and an estimated vesting share price of 612.96 pence, and 156,586 of the above figure for Soumen Das may be attributed to share price appreciation of 178.96 pence per share, based on an actual award price of 434.00 pence and an estimated vesting price of 612.96 pence.
The monetary value of the 2015 LTIP includes a cash value of 66 pence per share for David Sleath, Andy Gulliford and Phil Redding and 35pence per share for Soumen Das, equivalent to the dividends that they would have received had they held the shares from the award date.
The Committee has the right to decide that this payment may be made in cash or shares.
The Committee has not exercised discretion in respect of the vesting of the 2015 LTIP.
2017 In the 2017 Annual Report the estimated vesting share price for the 2014 LTIP, which vested in 2018, was 552.16 pence, and the figure in the above table has been re-presented to reflect the actual vesting share price of 638.53 pence.
Pension benefit In 2018, each of the Executive Directors received cash in lieu of pension.
Other This includes SIP, based on the number of shares awarded during the year and the share price at the date of grant, and Sharesave, based on the discount represented by the option price, multiplied by the annual savings.
For Soumen Das, the 2017 figure includes the value of replacement awards made in 2017 under the rules of the DSBP.
For further information, see Chart 14 on page 96 of the 2017 Annual Report.

91 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BONUS PAYMENT 2018 AUDITED CHART 3: BONUS PAYMENT 2018 For the Executive Directors, the 2018 Bonus comprised three equally weighted components: Adjusted Profit Before Tax PBT : rent roll growth RRG : and relative TPR.
Profit Adjusted PBT against target 65% For this element, a Bonus is earned for Adjusted PBT performance against target.
50 per cent is earned on achieving the threshold target 222.1 million for 2018, rising to 100 per cent for achieving the maximum target 238.8 million for 2018.
100 per cent of this element was achieved in 2018, with Adjusted PBT performance for PBT TPR bonus purposes of 246.1 million.
Rent roll growth RRG against target For this element, a Bonus is earned if the RRG 100% rent roll growth from the existing standing stock is positive the threshold.
Once the 100% threshold is achieved, the Bonus is determined based on total RRG existing standing stock plus the impact of development RRG, with a sliding pay-out scale rising from 0 per cent for flat total RRG through to 100 per cent for achieving the maximum increase 40.3 million in 2018.
In 2018, RRG from standing stock was positive, thus ensuring the threshold was achieved.
Total RRG including the contribution from developments The actual TPR performance for the The Adjusted PBT and RRG element of was 52.6 million for Bonus purposes and, Companys assets for bonus purposes in the 2018 Bonus will be paid in April 2019, accordingly, 100 per cent of this element 2018 was 16.8 per cent, being 17.6 per cent less a 50 per cent deduction for the DSBP.

96 SEGRO PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION CONTINUED LTIP LTIP awards made after the 2017 AGM are subject to a three-year performance period and a two-year holding period.
LTIP awards made before the 2017 AGM were subject to a four-year performance period.
All LTIP awards are subject to TSR and TPR performance conditions, which are equally weighted and measured over the performance period: TSR this benchmark is based on the weighted mean TSR of other FTSE 350 REITs.
25 per cent of this element vests if the Companys TSR over the performance period is in line with benchmark TSR, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting if the benchmark is exceeded by 5 per cent per year.
TPR this benchmark is based on the MSCI All Industrial Country benchmarks weighted to reflect the approximate geographical mix of the Groups portfolio.
25 per cent of this element vests if the Companys TPR over the performance period is in line with the MSCI Benchmark, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent if the MSCI Benchmark is exceeded by 1.5 per cent per year.
The 2014 LTIP Award vested on 2 May 2018, subject to the TSR and TPR performance conditions over the four-year performance period to 31 December 2017.
As previously reported, 100 per cent of the TSR element vested.
The 2017 Remuneration Report estimated that the TPR element would vest at 100 per cent.
The Companys actual TPR over the performance period was 17.1 per cent and the benchmark was 14.7 per cent.
The Companys TPR outperformance of 2.1 per cent compared with the benchmark led to 100 per cent of the TPR element vesting.
Overall, this resulted in a total payout of 100 per cent for the 2014 LTIP Award.
The 2015 LTIP Award will vest on 22 May 2019, subject to relative TSR and TPR over the four-year performance period to 31 December 2018.
The Companys TSR over the performance period was 96.6 per cent and the benchmark TSR was -3.1 per cent.
The Companys TSR outperformance of 19.3 per cent per annum compared with the benchmark will lead to 100 per cent of the TSR element vesting.
As with the Bonus, the complete TPR data will not be available until after the date of this Report.
For the purposes of the Directors single figure calculations Chart 1, the performance for the TPR element has been estimated.
The estimated calculation is based on the Companys actual annualised TPR between 2015 and 2018 of 16.3 per cent and an estimated MSCI Benchmark over the same period of 13.8 per cent.
On this basis, the Companys four year TPR to 31 December 2018 has exceeded the estimated MSCI Benchmark by more than 1.5 per cent which would lead to 100 per cent of the TPR element vesting.
Vesting of the TPR element of the LTIP will be deferred until Summer 2019, when the European MSCI Benchmarks become available.
Accordingly, the actual number of shares which will vest under the 2015 LTIP Award, may differ from the amount disclosed in this Report.
Details of the LTIP awards granted to the Executive Directors are set out in Chart 15.
Any awards made under the LTIP in 2019 will be made in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
The Committee has the discretion to adjust awards downwards at vesting if it is not satisfied that the outcome is a fair reflection of underlying performance, or in the event of excessive risk-taking or misstatement.
No such discretion was exercised in respect of the vesting of the 2014 Award.
Dividends will accrue on LTIP shares which are released on vesting and may be paid in cash or shares.

3 I n order to recruit Soumen Das it was necessary to buy out the share awards he forfeited upon leaving his previous employer.
These awards are subject to the same performance conditions as the other LTIP Awards.
4 As part of his recruitment package, Soumen Das was awarded 300 per cent of salary in respect of the 2017 LTIP.
