SELECTION OF PERFORMANCE METRICS The annual incentive plan is based on performance against a mix of financial measures.
The mix of financial measures is aligned to the Groups Key Performance Indicators 'KPIs' and is reviewed each year by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they remain appropriate to reflect the priorities for the business in the year ahead.
The targets are set for each KPI to encourage continuous improvement and challenge the delivery of stretch performance.
The LTIP is based on EPS growth and TSR performance.
EPS is a measure of the Groups overall financial success and TSR provides an external assessment of the Companys performance against the market.
It also aligns the rewards received by executives with the returns received by shareholders.
A sliding scale of challenging performance targets is set for each measure.
The Committee reviews the choice of performance measures and the appropriateness of the performance targets prior to each LTIP grant.
The Committee reserves the discretion to set different targets for future awards, without consulting with shareholders.
Overall, the Committee consider that the complementary nature of the performance measures used for the annual incentive plan and the LTIP provide executives with the right balance between revenue growth, margin progress, cash generation, disciplined capital allocation and return on investment to deliver sustainable returns for our shareholders.
When setting the targets for the annual incentive and the LTIP, the Committee takes into account a range of factors, including the business plan, prior-year performance, market conditions and consensus forecasts.

Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 103 Directors' Report | Corporate Governance REMUNERATION REPORT continued PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION LEVELS The table below shows the average movement in salary and annual incentive for UK employees between the 2017 and 2018 financialyear ends.
Salary Incentive Benefits 1 CEO A Lacroix 2.0% 45.2% 25.3% Average pay based on Interteks UK employees2 5.5% 50.9% 7.0% 1.
The percentage change for incentive and benefits for Andr Lacroix are based on actual amounts earned in 2017 and 2018.
The Intertek UK employee group has been selected as the most appropriate comparator group, due to the diverse nature of the Groups global employee population.
CEO PAY RATIO For accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2019, UK companies have to report on pay ratio information in relation to the total remuneration of the Director undertaking the role of Chief Executive Officer.
To meet the spirit of the legislation, Intertek has decided to voluntarily report one year early the required data, comparing the CEOs total remuneration against that of all of its UK employees.
The table below shows the required information.
25th 75th percentile Median percentile Year Method pay ratio pay ratio pay ratio 2018 Option B 262:1 189:1 123:1 In terms of reporting options, the Company chose option B, using the most recent gender pay gap information to determine the relevant employees at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile to compare to CEO pay, as that data was already available and is used for other reporting purposes.
It refers to gender pay data as of 1 April 2018.
With regards to representativeness of the ratios, Intertek is a very diverse employer and has employees in many UK locations.
Our employees have many different qualifications and are working in and serving almost all major industries.
As a consequence, it is unlikely that there is any one single individual whose pay and benefits is representative of Intertek UK as a whole.
Intertek have therefore also looked at the total pay of the individuals immediately above and below the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile.
Looking at the spread of resulting ratios, it was decided that the best equivalent would be the arithmetic mean of the total pay of three individuals around each reporting point: For the three employees around the 25th percentile: Ratios ranged from 239:1 to 280:1, with an arithmetic mean of 262:1.
For the three employees around the 50th percentile: Ratios ranged from 165:1 to 210:1, with an arithmetic mean of 189:1.
For the three employees around the 75th percentile: Ratios ranged from 110:1 to 143:1, with an arithmetic mean of 123:1.
When calculating total pay and rewards, no pay components were omitted.
The Company used the calculation methodology as set out in the relevant regulations The Companies Miscellaneous Reporting Regulations 2018.
For part-time employees their relevant pay and benefit components have been adjusted to the equivalent full-time figure for the relevant business.
Full-time equivalent hours can vary across locations and legal entities.
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPEND ON PAY The table below shows the movement in spend on staff costs between the 2017 and 2018 financial years, compared to dividends.
Staff costs are shown at actual rates.
At constant currency, staff costs increased by 4.9%, reflecting a 3.4% foreign exchange impact.
104 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Directors' Report PERFORMANCE GRAPH Consistent with prior years, the graph below shows the TSR in respect of the Company over the last 10 financial years, compared with the TSR for the full FTSE 100 Index.
The FTSE 100 is selected as the comparator group as it is a good representation of peer group companies and Intertek is a constituent of the FTSE 100.
TSR, reflecting the change in the value of a share and dividends paid, can be represented by the value of a notional 100 invested at the beginning of a period and its change over that period.

Consistent withthe calculation methodology for the single figure for total remuneration, the total remuneration figure includes the total annual incentive and Deferred Share Award based on that years performance and LTIP Share Awards based on the three-year performance period ending in the relevant year.
The annual incentive payout and LTIP award vesting level as a percentage of the maximum opportunity are also shown for each of these years.

Annual incentive and LTIP awards to be granted in 2019 For 2019, the annual incentive opportunity expressed as a percentage of base salary will be 200% for the CEO and CFO.
The Committee has determined that for 2019 the basis for calculating the annual incentive will be unchanged from the previous year 80% will be based on a matrix based on revenue and adjusted operating profit growth, and 20% will be based on ROIC.
Annual incentive will continue to be subject to a quality of earnings review at the end of the year to ensure that payouts are appropriate based on the underlying performance of the Group and to ensure that any awards are commensurate with the Groups culture and values.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include items whichthe Committee considers commercially sensitive.
In accordance with good governance, the Committee is however committed to providing insightful and transparent disclosure to our shareholders.
In this regard, the Committee will disclose the performance targets for the annual incentive in the following year.
