SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The Committee believes that to further align their interests with those of shareholders, Executive Directors should have a significant shareholding in the Company.
Under the 2016 Remuneration Policy, the Committee required Executive Directors to hold shares with a value equivalent to at least 100 per cent of their base salary in the form of shares and unfettered share incentive awards which may be built up over time following appointment as an Executive Director.
Under the revised Remuneration Policy, for which approval will be sought from shareholders at the 2019 AGM, this requirement will increase to a holding of shares equivalent in value to 200 per cent of base salary.

Key to share plan and type of award: EIP PS 2005 Employee Incentive Plan Performance Shares awarded as conditional share awards.
LTIP PS 2016 Long-term Incentive Plan Performance Shares awarded as conditional share awards.
The market price on date of grant is the price of an Ordinary Share at the close of business on the day before the date of grant.
There is no exercise price payable for a Performance Share upon vesting.
Awards which have passed the date first exercisable have vested and are unfettered, having passed the relevant performance conditions.
The performance conditions for this award were based on i an EPS growth target based on performance reported for 31 December 2017 and ii a TSR growth target based on the Company share price averaged over a 90-day period immediately prior to the announcement of the 2017 Full Year results.
Full Year results for 2017 and EPS performance to 31 December 2017 were reported on 8 March 2018, not 5 March 2018 as previously anticipated and therefore the performance condition testing date for this award was updated accordingly.
SHARE INCENTIVE INTERESTS AWARDED DURING THE YEAR In 2018, the Committee approved an award of Performance Shares to Mr Hutchinson and Ms Bell equivalent to 150 per cent and 100 per cent of base salary respectively.
50 per cent of award: The EPS performance period for this award started at the beginning of the financial year in which the award is made, in this case on 1 January 2018, and ends after three years, in this case on 31 December 2020.

In determining TSR growth for the Company, share prices will be averaged over 90-day periods immediately prior to the announcement of the 2017 Full Year results on 8 March 2018 and the 2020 Full Year results, which will be announced in March 2021.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2018 83 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION CONTINUED SHARE INCENTIVE INTERESTS VESTING DURING 2019 Both Mr Hutchinsons award which is due to vest on 16 June 2019 and Ms Bells award which is due to vest on 30 September 2019 are subject to the same performance conditions: an EPS performance condition and a TSR performance condition.
The EPS condition has passed the growth threshold required for partial vesting but has not achieved the growth required for full vesting.
The TSR condition will be tested after the conclusion of the performance period.
Current estimates, based on the growth in market price of a Spirent Ordinary Share between the beginning of the performance period and the date of this Report, suggest it is likely that this will achieve a significant level of vesting.
No new shares were issued during the year, with all exercises of share incentives being satisfied by the transfer of shares held by the Companys Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT.
At the date of this Report, the ESOT holds 0.5 million Ordinary Shares for the purpose of satisfying the exercises of current and future awards by employees and former employees of the Group.
DILUTION Overall shareholder dilution resulting from the Companys share incentive plans on a rolling ten-year basis has fallen by 1.1 per cent when comparing the positions at 31 December 2018 4.0 per cent and 31 December 2017 5.1 per cent.
The overall number of share incentives outstanding has decreased by 0.9 million during the year to 9.1 million at 31 December 2018 2017 10.0 million.

DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY UNAUDITED The Committees policy is to set remuneration levels which ensure that the Executive Directors are fairly and responsibly rewarded in return for high levels of performance.
The remuneration policy aims to promote value creation through transparent alignment with the agreed corporate strategy, supporting performance and encouraging the underlying sustainable financial health of the business while promoting sound risk management for the benefit of all stakeholders.
The Committee believes that the aims of the policy are achieved by ensuring that a significant proportion of executive remuneration is tied to the achievement of the agreed corporate strategy and longterm value creation.
The Companys previous remuneration policy was subject to a binding vote at the 2016 AGM on 4 May 2016 and received 96.7 per cent of all votes cast in favour.
A revised remuneration policy will be put to shareholders for approval at the AGM on 1 May 2019 and, if approved, is intended to apply for the next three years.
The revised policy is broadly consistent with the previously approved policy.
However, certain changes have been made to ensure that the new policy remains fit for purpose for the next three years for the Company and its shareholders.
The principal changes from the previously approved policy are: introduction of a cap on the maximum pension contribution or cash allowance in lieu that may be offered to a newly-appointed Executive Director: introduction of mandatory deferral into shares for one-third of the Annual Incentive for Executive Directors for bonuses paid with respect to 2019 and beyond: addition of a two year post-vesting holding requirement for the long-term incentive plan awards: clarification of the malus and clawback provisions operable in each of the Companys incentive plans: and an increase to the share ownership guideline for Executive Directors to 200 per cent of salary whilst in employment and the introduction of a formal policy on post-cessation holdings.

88 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION POLICY TABLE This section of the Report describes the key components of each element of the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2018 89 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION CONTINUED NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE Performance conditions applicable to the Annual Incentive The Annual Incentive is designed to drive and reward excellent short-term financial and operational performance.
The Committee reviews the Annual Incentive plan measures each year in order to ensure that they are aligned with the Groups strategy.
The Committee may alter the choice and weighting of the metrics for future Annual Incentive cycles to reflect the changing needs of the business.
The Committee also retains the discretion to retrospectively amend the measures, weightings, targets and or method of assessment for the in-year Annual Incentive to take into account changes in the business strategy, significant acquisitions or disposals, changes in accounting treatment or other exceptional events to ensure that the scheme is able to fulfil its original purpose.
The payment of any Annual Incentive is at the sole discretion of the Committee.
Annual Incentives are currently based on: adjusted operating profit a key driver of shareholder return and a key measure of business success: revenue reflecting Spirents strategic priority of delivering top-line growth: other strategic and operational priorities these account for a minority of the Annual Incentive and ensure a rounded assessment of performance.
Performance conditions applicable to awards under the Spirent Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Long-term incentive awards will be granted in accordance with the rules of the LTIP and the discretions contained therein.
The Committee reviews the appropriateness of performance parameters for each award under the LTIP and sets stretching performance conditions in light of the Companys current and expected performance over the performance cycle.
The performance conditions for awards to Executive Directors are ordinarily measured over a period of three years and are set using a sliding scale of targets and no more than 25 per cent of the award under each measure will vest for achieving the threshold performance hurdle.
The choice of measures may change for future award cycles, but is currently based on: Absolute Total Shareholder Return generates a strong alignment of interest between executives and shareholders: and Adjusted Earnings per Share this provides an assessment of the profitability of the revenues delivered and aligns with the interests of shareholders.
Challenging targets for earnings per share are set based on internal and external forecasts.
The Committee would consult with shareholders in advance of a significant change in the choice or weighting of the performance measures to be applied to future award cycles.
Under the rules of the LTIP, the Committee has the discretion to amend or substitute the performance conditions for inflight awards in exceptional circumstances, providing the new targets are no less challenging than originally envisaged.
Malus and clawback The rules of the LTIP and the Companys Annual Incentive including any element deferred into shares include provisions for malus and clawback to apply if the Committee concludes that: the relevant individual has committed misconduct: there has been a restatement of any member of the Groups financial results, due to inaccurate or misleading data: the extent to which an award was granted or has vested was based on inaccuracy or error: the Group or a business unit within the Group suffered a material financial loss as a result of circumstances that could reasonably have been risk managed: where the Company has suffered an instance of corporate failure resulting in the appointment of a liquidator or administrator: a material failure of risk management and or regulatory non-compliance resulting in damage to the Companys business or reputation: or any other circumstances that the Board considers to have a similar nature or effect.
Clawback may be applied for up to two years following cash payment of an Annual Incentive and vesting under the LTIP, and up to three years following the granting of awards under the Companys deferred bonus arrangements.
Shareholding guideline The Executive Directors are required to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200 per cent of salary and are expected to retain shares vesting under the deferred annual bonus and LTIP net of tax until such time as the guideline shareholding has been achieved.
The Companys policy in respect of vested and unvested share awards post-cessation of employment is set out below in the section on Exit Payment Policy.
90 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Discretions retained by the Committee in operating the LTIP and other variable pay schemes The Committee operates the Groups various incentive plans according to their respective rules and where applicable in accordance with relevant legislation and HMRC guidance.
In order to ensure efficient administration of these plans, certain operational discretions are reserved to the Committee.
These include: determining who may participate in the plans: determining the timing of grants of awards and or payments under the plans: determining the quantum of any awards and or payments within the limits set out in the policy table above : in exceptional circumstances, determining that a share-based award or any dividend equivalent shall be settled in full or in part in cash: determining the performance measures and targets applicable to an award in accordance with the statements made in the policy table above : where a participant ceases to be employed by the Company, determining whether good leaver status shall apply: determining the extent of vesting of an award based on assessment of the performance conditions, including discretion as to the basis on which performance is to be measured if an award vests in advance of normal timetable on cessation of employment as a good leaver or on the occurrence of corporate events : whether, and to what extent, pro ration shall apply in the event of cessation of employment as a good leaver or on the occurrence of corporate events: whether malus and or clawback shall be applied to any award and, if so, the extent to which they shall apply: and making appropriate adjustments to awards on account of certain events, such as major changes in the Companys capital structure.
Approach to recruitment remuneration In the event that the Company recruits a new Executive Director either from within the organisation or externally, when determining the appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors, including but not limited to quantum, the type of remuneration being offered and the jurisdiction which the candidate was recruited from to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both shareholders and the Company without paying more than is necessary to recruit an executive of the required calibre.
Element Recruitment policy Base salary The Committee will take into consideration a number of factors, including internal relativities, external market forces, skills and current level of pay.
Salary may but need not necessarily be set below the normal market rate, with a series of planned increases implemented over the following few years to bring it to the desired positioning, subject to individual performance.
Benefits Benefits provision would be in line with normal policy The Committee may agree that the Company will meet appropriate relocation costs.
Retirement benefits In line with normal policy.
Annual Incentive Eligible to take part in the Annual Incentive, with a maximum bonus of up to 150 per cent of salary in line with policy.
Depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee may deem it appropriate to set Annual Incentive performance metrics that are different from those that apply to the current Executive Directors for the first performance year in which the appointment falls.
Long-term Incentive A normal award of up to 200 per cent of salary, in line with policy.
Buy-out awards In exceptional circumstances, the Committee may offer additional cash or share incentive awards using Listing Rule 9.4.
2, if necessary to compensate an individual for remuneration forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
The awards would not exceed what is felt to be a fair estimate of the remuneration forfeited and would reflect as far as possible the nature and time horizons attached to that remuneration and the impact of any performance conditions.
The Company would aim to replace any forfeited cash awards with shares wherever possible.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
For an internal appointment, any remuneration terms awarded in respect of the previous role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment.
When recruiting Non-executive Directors, the remuneration arrangements offered would normally be in line with those paid to existing Non-executive Directors, details of which are set out in the Annual Remuneration Report.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2018 91 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION CONTINUED Service contracts Executive directors In normal circumstances, it is the Companys policy that service contracts for Executive Directors have no fixed term and are capable of termination on no more than 12 months notice from either the Company or the Executive Director.
It is intended that this policy would also apply to new appointments of Executive Directors.
Both Eric Hutchinson and Paula Bell currently have a service agreement with Spirent Communications plc, and, being UK residents, both their contracts are in line with UK employment practice and are governed by the laws of England and Wales.
Eric Hutchinsons service agreement dated 8 December 2014 may be terminated on 12 months notice from the Company and six months notice from Mr Hutchinson.
Paula Bells service agreement, dated 12 April 2016, may be terminated on 12 months notice from the Company and six months notice from Ms Bell.
The Company recognises that its Executive Directors may, from time to time, be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the Company.
Details of any such appointments are set out in the Annual Remuneration Report.
The service agreements of Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Companys registered office on request and will be available for inspection at the 2019 AGM.
Exit payment policy The Committee is committed to ensuring that it does not pay more than is necessary when Executive Directors leave Spirent and its policy on exit payments is and will continue to be in line with market practice in the country in which the Executive Director resides.
The current exit payment policy is: service contracts contain provisions for the removal of the Executive Director without compensation for not performing their duties to the standard required by the Board or material misconduct: payment in lieu of notice may be paid under service contracts if the relevant notice period is not given to the Executive Director or if, having received notice from the Executive Director, the employer does not wish him her to serve it.
Any payment in lieu of notice shall ordinarily be paid in monthly instalments, in respect of annual base salary and pension contributions only: unless provided for in the service contract, the Company would seek to apply practical mitigation measures to any payment of compensation on termination, for example by reducing payments to reflect payments received in respect of alternative employment, taking into account all relevant circumstances: service contracts do not contain provision for additional compensation on termination following a change of control as detailed in the Change of Control provisions set out in the Report of the directors : service contracts do not contain provision for liquidated damages of any kind: and service contracts contain appropriate provisions to protect the legitimate interests of the Company with respect to preventing any terminated Executive Director from working in a business which competes against the Company.
92 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION The table below sets out key provisions for Executive Directors under their service contracts and the Incentive Plan rules: Element Termination policy Salary, benefits Payment will be made up to the termination date in line with relevant contractual notice periods and will not and pension exceed contractual entitlements.
Annual Incentive Unless otherwise provided in the service contract to be consistent with market practice in the country in which the Executive Director resides, Executive Directors are not entitled to accrued cash incentives payable following termination unless the individual is determined by the Committee to be a good leaver defined as an individual leaving employment due to redundancy, ill-health, injury or disability, retirement, death, the individuals employing company ceasing to be under the control of the Group, or a transfer of the undertaking in which the individual works Good Leaver.
Deferred Share Awards will ordinarily continue to vest on the normal vesting date, unless the Committee determines that early Bonus Plan vesting should apply.
The Committee reserves the discretion to scale the awards down including to nil in the event of misconduct by the individual or to reflect individual performance.
Spirent Long-term Unvested awards will generally lapse at the time of exit.
Incentive Plan 2016 For individuals determined by the Committee to be a Good Leaver see below, the Committee will ordinarily assess the performance conditions at the end of the applicable vesting period and unvested awards will ordinarily vest on the normal timetable.
Exceptionally, and always in the case of death, the Committee may assess performance conditions at the point of cessation by testing the performance conditions up to or as close as reasonably practicable to the date of cessation.
Awards will then vest following such early assessment of performance.
Except in the case of death, any shares which vest following the assessment of the performance conditions would normally be pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the vesting period actually served by the individual.
For the purposes of the LTIP, a Good Leaver is any individual who leaves due to death, ill-health, injury, disability, agreed retirement, redundancy, a transfer of the business for which the individual works out of the Group or for any other reason at the Committees discretion except where the individual is summarily dismissed.
Any post-vesting holding period would normally continue to apply to a leavers vested and unvested awards.
Legacy arrangements: Unvested awards generally lapse at the time of exit.
For individuals determined by the Committee to be a Good Leaver, performance conditions are assessed by the Committee at the point of exit by testing the performance Employee Incentive conditions up to the date of exit for TSR performance and to the end of the most recent financial period for EPS Plan EIP performance.
Vesting is then pro-rated for the proportion of the performance period actually served and the individual has 12 months following the date of termination of employment in which to exercise them.
For all leavers, the Committee may also determine to make a payment in reimbursement of a reasonable level of outplacement and legal fees in connection with a settlement agreement.
The Company may pay any statutory entitlements, to which an Executive Director is entitled, or settle or compromise any claims made in connection with the termination of employment or appointment of an Executive Director where the Committee considers such claims to have a reasonable prospect of success and that it is in the best interests of the Company to do so.
Where appropriate, private health cover may continue for a suitable period post-cessation of employment.
The Committee has now introduced a formal policy in respect of post-cessation shareholdings.
On approval of this policy and in respect of the incentive awards to be granted thereafter, the following will ordinarily apply: unvested shares under the deferred share bonus plan will continue to vest on the normal vesting date ie up to four years postcessation : unvested shares under the LTIP will, subject to the participant being a Good Leaver, continue to vest on the normal vesting date and be subject to a post-vesting holding period: vested shares under the LTIP the holding period will continue to apply: other beneficially owned shares no sale restriction applies.
The above will ensure that the Executive Directors continue to have an interest in the Company after having left employment, promoting a culture of sustainable long-term performance.
Furthermore, additional safeguards are in place through the malus and clawback provisions which can continue to be invoked irrespective of employment status.
In the event of change in control of the Company, in accordance with rules of the respective plans, any outstanding share awards will ordinarily vest on the date of such an event.
For awards under the LTIP, vesting will be subject to an assessment of achievement against the applicable performance conditions and, unless the Board determines otherwise, a reduction to reflect the curtailed vesting period.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2018 93 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION CONTINUED Non-executive Directors All Non-executive Directors have a letter of appointment with the Company for a period of not more than three years, subject to the Companys Articles of Association.
However, since 2011 and in accordance with the 2016 Code, all directors who are not stepping down from the Board will stand for re-election at each AGM.
The letters of appointment of Non-executive Directors are available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection at the 2019 AGM.
An example of a letter of appointment for a non-executive director is available on the Companys website at https: corporate.
com Consideration of employee remuneration arrangements elsewhere in the Group When setting the policy for directors remuneration, the Committee has regard to the pay and employment conditions elsewhere within the Group, particularly in the jurisdictions in which the Executive Directors are based.
The Committee is kept informed on a regular basis of salary increases for the general employee population and takes these into account when determining salary increases for Executive Directors and the Executive Management Team.
Where relevant, the Committee seeks to align the remuneration policy for Executive Directors with that for other senior managers.
Selected employees are able to share in the success of the Group through participation in the Management Incentive Plan.
Executive Directors, other members of the Executive Management Team and key employees are also eligible for participation in the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The Committee is aware of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and its requirements for increasing engagement with stakeholders including employees and will be introducing an enhanced workforce engagement programme in 2019 to facilitate this.
Consideration of the views of shareholders in setting Remuneration Policy The Committee is mindful of the views of shareholders in determining appropriate levels of remuneration and in ensuring that shareholder and director interests are aligned.
The Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with shareholders and seeks shareholder views when any significant changes are proposed to remuneration arrangements.
Over the past few years, the Committee consulted with major shareholders and shareholder representatives as follows: January 2016: consultation related to the introduction of the new LTIP: December 2017: consultation related to the Committees approach to base salary, cash incentives and LTIP awards in 2018: and December 2018: consultation regarding the revised remuneration policy for which the Committee is proposing to seek shareholder approval at the 2019 Annual General Meeting.
Legacy matters For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company to make payments and honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors such as the payment of pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes where the terms were agreed either prior to 24 April 2014 the effective date of the first Directors remuneration policy or at a time when a previous remuneration policy was in force.
Details of any payments will be set out in the Annual Remuneration Report as they arise.
