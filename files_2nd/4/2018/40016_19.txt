After a period of consultation with shareholders, Graham Bakers salary was increased by 5% to 546,210 to take effect from 1 July 2018, when he assumed additional responsibilities for the IT and Global Business Services functions.
In February 2019, we reviewed the base salaries of the Executive Directors, having considered general economic conditions and average salary increases across the rest of the Group, which have averaged at 2.9% in the UK and 3% in the US.
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that Namal Nawanas salary will increase by 2.5% and Graham Bakers salary will increase by 2% to $1,578,500 and 557,134 respectively with effect from 1 April 2019.

Business Objectives When setting business objectives for the upcoming year, the Board looks not only at the expected financial performance for the year, but also at the actions it expects the Executive Director to carry out in the year to build a solid foundation for financial performance over the longer term.
In reviewing performance against these objectives at the end of the year, the Board is mindful that there is not always a necessary correlation between financial performance and the achievement of business objectives.

In 2018, these objectives were all aligned to ensuring an orderly transition to the new Chief Executive Officer.
The Committee considered his performance as Chief Executive Officer against these business objectives for the period up to 7 May 2018 and concluded that he had broadly met these objectives and that therefore the payout in respect of his Business Objectives should be in line with the payout in respect of the overall financial objectives at 94% as follows: Award % Amount of target Financial Objectives 75% of award 289,463 94 Business Objectives 25% of award 96,488 94 Total Cash Incentive Payment 385,951 1 These non-IFRS financial measures are explained and reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with IFRS on pages 194198.

The first looks at what has been achieved, namely the extent to which the employee has performed against the financial and business objectives set at the beginning of the year.
The second looks at how this performance has been achieved, reflecting the right culture and values in accordance with our critical enablers.
Against each, the employee is rated as having performed below, in-line or above expectations.

In assessing their performance against the same financial and business objectives used to determine the level of their cash award, the Remuneration Committee has determined that on the first criterion assessing what they have achieved Namal Nawana and Graham Baker have both performed in line with expectations throughout the year.
On the second criterion assessing how they have achieved, the Remuneration Committee has determined that Namal Nawana has exceeded expectations and Graham Baker has performed in line with expectations.
These ratings result in an Equity Incentive Award of 55% of salary prorated to 35.9% to reflect his appointment on 7 May 2018 for Namal Nawana and 50% of salary for Graham Baker.
In summary, as a result of the financial performance described on page 91 and the individual performance described in the table on page 92, the Remuneration Committee determined that the following awards be made under the Annual Incentive Plan in respect of performance in 2018: Cash Component Equity Component Executive Director % of salary Amount % of salary Amount Namal Nawana 67.7% $1,042,655 35.9% $552,290 Graham Baker 95.5% 506,951 50.0% 265,328 These figures are converted into dollars and included under Annual Incentive Plan cash and equity in the single figure table on page 89.
The precise awards granted in 2019 to Namal Nawana and Graham Baker in respect of service in 2018 will be announced when the awards are made and will be disclosed in the 2019 Annual Report.
The Committee also determined that no Equity Incentive Award would be made to Olivier Bohuon who had retired as Chief Executive Officer during the year.
As a result of the 2018 performance assessment for Graham Baker, the first tranche of the Equity Incentive Award made in 2018 will vest.
Both the grant and vesting of these awards are subject to Grahams performance discussed on page 92.
Namal Nawana was not employed during 2017 and therefore received no Equity Incentive award in 2018.

The four equally weighted performance measures are relative TSR, return on invested capital, sales growth and cumulative free cash flow.
These measures are aligned with our financial priorities and strategies.
Performance will be measured over the three financial years from 1 January 2018 and awards will vest subject to performance and continued employment in 2021.
Sufficient shares will be sold to cover taxation obligations and the Executive Directors will be required to hold the net shares for a further period oftwo years.
The two equally weighted peer groups against which the Companys TSR performance will be measured are defined at the start of each performance period based on constituents of the following: A sector-based peer group based on those companies classified as the S&P 1200 Global Healthcare subset comprising Medical Devices, equipment and supplies companies official industry classifications of Health Care Equipment and Supplies, Life Sciences Tools & Services and Health Care Technology.
This is a broader sector-based peer group than in previous years, so that we maintain a focus on outperforming our broad sector without being impacted by the volatility of a smaller group.
FTSE 100 constituents excluding financial services and commodities companies.
This is in response to shareholders who assess our performance not based on sector, but instead based on the index we operate in.
The Groups TSR performance and its performance relative to the comparator groups is independently monitored and reported to the Remuneration Committee by Deloitte LLP.
Total Shareholder Return TSR performance is relative to two separate indices as follows: Award vesting as % of salary at date of grant Relative TSR ranking Sector Based Peer Group FTSE 100 Peer Group Below median Nil Nil Median 5.9375% 5.9375% Upper quartile or above 23.75% 23.75% Awards will vest on a straight-line basis between these points.

This target however will be disclosed in the 2020 Annual Report, when the Committee will discuss performance against the target.
Cumulative free cash flow is defined as net cash inflow from operating activities, less capital expenditure, less the cash flow input of certain adjusted items.
Free cash flow is the most appropriate measure of cash flow performance because it relates to cash generated to finance additional investments in business opportunities, debt repayments and distribution to shareholders.
This measure includes significant elements of operational financial performance and helps to align Executive Director awards with shareholder value creation.
It is important as it is derived from increased revenues and healthy trading profits.
Having a healthy cash flow will enable us to continue to grow and invest.

Vesting of the conditional awards made in 2016 was subject to performance conditions based on TSR, revenue inEmerging Markets and cumulative free cash flow measured over a three-year period commencing 1 January 2016.
25% of the award was based on the Companys TSR relative to a bespoke group of 15 Medical Devices companies.
This group comprised the following companies: Baxter, Becton Dickinson, Boston Scientific, Coloplast, Conmed, Edwards Life Sciences, Essilor Luxottica, Getinge B, GN Store Nord, Medtronic, Shire, Sonova N, Stryker, William Demant Holding, and Zimmer.
The following companies delisted during the period and were therefore removed: C R Bard and St Jude Medical.
Against this peer group, the Companys TSR performance ranked below median meaning that this part of the award therefore vested at 0%.
25% of the award was based on revenues in Emerging Markets.
The threshold set in 2016 was $2,316 million with a target of $2,725 million.
Over the three-year period, the adjusted revenues in Emerging Markets were $2,560 million.
These adjustments include translational foreign exchange.
This part of the award therefore vested at 20% out of the 25% target.
50% of the award was based on cumulative free cash flow performance.
Over the three-year period, the adjusted cumulative free cash flow was $1,929 million which is between target and maximum.
These adjustments include items such as Board-approved M&A, including the acquisition of Rotation Medical and the disposal of the Gynaecological business and Board-approved Business Plans such as the APEX programme, the commercial restructuring programme and exceptional expenditure to comply with the EU Medical Devices Regulations.
This part of the award therefore vested at 73%.

Neither Namal Nawana nor Graham Baker were employed by the Company in 2016 and therefore have no Performance Share Awards to vest on 7 March 2019.

Chief Executive Officer remuneration compared to employees generally The percentage change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer between 2017 and 2018 compared to that of employees generally was as follows: Base salary Benefits Annual cash bonus % change 2018 % change 2018 % change 2018 1 Chief Executive Officer 12.6% -41.3% 23.9% Average for all employees 2.6% N A N A 1 Amounts paid to Olivier Bohuon up to his retirement on 7 May 2018 and to Namal Nawana after his appointment on the same date.
The average cost of wages and salaries for employees generally increased by 6% in 2018 see Note 3.1 to the Group accounts.
Figures for annual cash bonuses are included in the numbers.
When considering remuneration arrangements for our Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into account pay across the Group inthe following ways: Salary levels and increases for all employees including Executive Directors take account of the scope and responsibility of position, the skills, experience and performance of the individual and general economic conditions within the relevant geographical market.
When considering increases to Executive Director base salaries, the Committee considers the average pay increases in the market where the Executive Director is based.
All employees including the Executive Directors have performance objectives determined at the beginning of the year which cascade down from the StrategicImperatives for the Group.
The level of variable pay determined for all employees, whether in the form of shares or cash is dependent on performanceagainst these imperatives, both financially and personally.
Executive Directors participate in benefits plans and arrangements comparable to benefits paid to other senior executives in the relevant geography.
The Remuneration Committee is keeping under review the level of pension benefits and cash payments in lieu of pensions paid to our Executive Directors, which for historical reasons are currently higher than paid to most employees.
Executive Directors participate in the same senior executive incentive plans currently the Annual Incentive Programme and the Performance Share Programme as other Executive Officers and senior executives.
The level of award reflect the differing seniority of participants but the same performance conditions apply for all.

Our calculations are based on actual pay data for 2018, in accordance with Option A as set out in the Companies Miscellaneous Reporting Regulations 2018 using a combined figure for CEO pay comprising: pay for Olivier Bohuon Chief Executive Officer until 7 May 2018 : and pay for Namal Nawana Chief Executive Officer from 7 May 2018.
Comparisons have been made with employees at median P50, lower P25 and upper P75 quartiles.
The Committee is satisfied that the individuals identified in the employee comparison group appropriately reflect the employee pay profile at those quartiles, and that the overall picture presented by the ratios is consistent with our pay, reward and progression policies for UK employees.
The table below sets out the ratio at the median, lower and upper quartiles: Year P25 lower quartile P50 median P75 upper quartile 2018 142:1 95:1 59:1 The table below provides the total pay figure used for each quartile employee, and the salary component within this.

Next year we expect the figures to relate solely to remuneration for Namal Nawana.
Relative importance of spend on pay When considering remuneration arrangements for our Executive Directors and employees as a whole, the Remuneration Committee also takes into account the overall profitability of the Company and the amounts spent elsewhere, particularly in returning profits to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buy backs.
The following table sets out the total amounts spent in 2018 and 2017 on remuneration, the attributable profit for each year and the dividends declared and paid in each year.

Gender Pay Ratio In 2018, the Remuneration Committee reviewed our UK Gender Pay ratio.
It was noted that the average pay gap had increased from 29% in 2017 to 31% in 2018 and the median pay gap from 15% to 21% for the same period.
We recognised that the reasons for this increase were a higher level of female attrition with more males being promoted or recruited during the year into senior positions, as well as the move of one senior female executive from UK to US.
We shall continue to review these figures and the actions being taken by management to address these gaps across our global business.
A number of initiatives were established in 2018 including: Developing our female leaders though a programme we call Elevate 280 female professionals participated in the programme : Training our managers and Human Resource professionals in areas such as increasing awareness of unconscious biases: Conducting a masterclass for the Talent Acquisition Team to further drive diversity and inclusion in our approach to recruitment: and Procuring Talent widening recruitment channels to improve diversity and inclusion in our candidate pipeline.
From 2019 a programme of activity is planned, under the sponsorship of the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Committee and in line with our new purpose and culture pillars.
It includes plans to: leverage a new spirit of inclusion at the Executive level to drive change at a global level: sponsor female talent and leveraging role models to increase diversity in senior roles: pro-actively map the market for female talent, launch a female acceleration programme to drive development of talented women: and train our leaders and managers on how to lead inclusively beyond recruitment.
Shareholding Requirements The Chief Executive Officer is required to hold three times his salary in the form of shares and the Chief Financial Officer is required to hold two times his salary.
Our current remuneration arrangements also require Executive Directors to retain any shares received in respect of Performance Share Awards made in or after 2017 for a period of two years after vesting.
The Remuneration Committee will be considering these requirements further as part of our review of Remuneration Policy in 2019 and in particular, we will be looking to introduce some form of post-cessation shareholding requirement for our Executive Directors.

Our strategy to generate cash from Established Markets in order to invest for growth in higher growth geographies and franchises means that we are competing for international talent and our base salaries therefore need to reflect what our Executive Directors would receive if they were to work in another international company of a similar size, complexity and geographical scope.

Payment in lieu of pension In order to attract and retain Executive Directors with the capability of driving our corporate strategy, we need to provide market-competitive retirement benefits similar to the benefits they would receive if they were to work for one of our competitors.
At the same time, we seek to avoid exposing the Company to defined benefit pension risks, and where possible will make payments in lieu ofproviding a pension.
