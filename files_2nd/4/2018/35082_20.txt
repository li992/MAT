FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Interest rate risk Fair value hierarchy The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no material impact on the Groups equity.
Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Currency derivatives have not been included in the sensitivity analysis below as they are not considered to be exposed to interest rate risk.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Effect on Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Increase profit before Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting period.
decrease in basis tax points m The Groups forward currency contracts are measured using Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The valuations are provided by the Groups bankers 2018 from the proprietary valuation models and are based on mid-market levels as at close of business on the Groups year end reporting date.
