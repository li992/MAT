61 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REMIT During the year, the Remuneration Committee, under the chairmanship of Vindi Banga, agreed that the publication of the proposed revisions to the UK Corporate Governance Code by the Financial Reporting Council, along with the appointment of Archie Norman to Chairman of the Board and member of the Remuneration Committee, provided an excellent opportunity to review the Committees Terms of Reference.
Following a thorough review of the existing remit, new broader Terms of Reference were agreed.
The role of the Committee continues to be ensuring that the Senior Executive Group are appropriately rewarded, through making recommendations regarding senior remuneration strategy and framework to the Board.
Reflecting market direction and anticipating incoming regulation, the revised Terms of Reference further extend the Committees remit to include greater responsibility for demonstrating how pay and incentives align across the Company, along with defined mechanisms for workforce engagement.
Further demonstrating the Committees commitment to meaningful and transparent engagement on pay practices in the wider workforce, the chair of M&Ss employee representative body will be invited to attend and contribute to a Committee meeting each year.
The broadened remit also includes oversight of key people policy areas such as performance management, diversity and inclusion, and gender pay.
