Implementation of Policy in 2018 19 Salaries and fees Executive Directors In accordance with recruitment policy the Committee purposefully appointed Jakob Sigurdsson on a base salary that reflected his experience with the intention of making phased increases over the first few years as he develops in the role of CEO.
Accordingly the Committee approved an increase of 9% effective 1 October 2018 which results in a base salary that remains below that of both his predecessor and the normal market rate.
The Committee will continue to monitor the CEOs performance and competitiveness of his total compensation arrangements as he continues to develop in role.
The other executive Directors received a base salary increase of 3% which was in line with those of the wider workforce with the exception of the new Group Finance Director, Richard Armitage, who received nil, recognising that he was appointed during the year.
He retired as an employee on 31 March 2018 andreceived a commensurate reduction in base salary to reflect the reduced responsibilities during the period.

No changes to non-executive Director fees are proposed for the 2019 financial year.
Following a review of the market in conjunction with the Committee advisors Willis Towers Watson, the Remuneration Committee approved an increase in the Chairmans fee as outlined below.
Should the resolution regarding the proposed increase to non-executive fee limits not be approved, the Chairman will not receive any increase for 2019.

Awards will be determined based on a combination of Group profit before tax weighted at 50%, strategic objectives weighted at 30% and an executives personal performance achievement level weighted at 20%.
The Company believes that this combination of financial, strategic and personal performance objectives reflects the strategic focus on Group profit while maintaining a measurement of progression against strategic milestones and personal contribution across key operational goals for the business.
The Committee will continue to run a thorough annual review of strategic and personal objectives to ensure they are measurable, robust and aligned with overall Group-wide objectives.
The Committee considers certain of the performance targets for the annual bonus to be commercially sensitive and, as such, they will be disclosed either at the end of the performance period or when they are no longer commercially sensitive.
The bonus for personal and or strategic performance is payable only if, in the opinion of the Committee, underlying financial and operating performance of the business is sufficient in that year to warrant payment.
25% of all paid bonuses will be deferred into shares for a period, under normal circumstances, of three years.
Long-term incentives The extent to which LTIP awards to be granted for the 2019 financial year will vest will be dependent on two independent performance conditions: 25% determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return TSR and 75% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS, as follows: u the TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three-year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 25% on a pro-rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance: and u the EPS element of an award will vest in full if cumulative EPS exceeds 467p over the three-year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 20% on a pro-rata basis if cumulative EPS is 424p over the three-year period and is reduced to nil if cumulative EPS over the period fails to exceed 424p.
As set out in the Directors Remuneration Policy, awards granted are subject to malus and clawback provisions.
