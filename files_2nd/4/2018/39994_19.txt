Bundesliga, and Formula 1 Having listened to the feedback from shareholders over the past 12 months, Agreed new partnerships including Netflix, BT Sport, Mediaset Premium, the Committee intends to make a number of changes which will simplify and Spotify the policy and further strengthen alignment with shareholder interests.
The following changes will apply for the 2018 19 performance year: Mandatory deferral of 50% of the earned annual bonus for 2018 19 into shares for two years Disclosure of performance targets immediately following the end of 1 This is an adjusted measure, performance is measured on an adjusted basis using the performance period, commencing with the 2018 19 annual bonus methodology agreed by the Remuneration Committee, which may differ from the adjusted measures presented elsewhere in this report.
Revenue growth is presented on a constant currency basis only.
46 Sky plc Governance We intend to present key structural changes for approval at the 2019 AGM for approval should the Offers from 21st Century Fox or Comcast fail to complete or otherwise fall away in sufficient time, to be implemented for the 2019 20 performance period onwards: Removal of the Co-Investment Plan, incorporating its value into a single Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Committee therefore intends that LTIP and CIP awards normally due to be granted in July 2019 would be deferred until after the 2019 AGM, at which point awards under the new combined Plan would be granted Move from bi-annual vesting to annual vesting for the LTIP A holding period of two years following the end of the performance period for the LTIP Until then the existing policy will apply, providing continuity and stability for the Executive Directors and the senior management team.
Share awards vesting There is no LTIP vesting due this year: the 2016 and 2017 LTIP awards are due to vest in 2019.
Should the ongoing Offer process complete prior to normal vesting dates for outstanding CIP and LTIP awards, the Committee will determine the vesting conditions on the completion date taking into account the circumstances at that time including discussions with the offerors and the interests of the business, employees and shareholders.
Future share awards Awards will be granted as normal in July and August 2018 under the current LTIP and Co-Investment plans, subject to the timing of the Offer process.
The performance conditions for the LTIP award are unchanged with the exception of relative TSR performance which the Committee concluded in the light of the ongoing Offer process is no longer a fair measure of the Companys performance due to the effective distorting impact of the share price.
The LTIP award will therefore vest based solely on the operational metrics of revenue growth, operating cash flow and EPS growth, which the Committee believes are no more difficult nor easier to achieve than the TSR conditions were intended to be in the absence of the Offer process.
These awards will vest either at the end of their normal performance period, or, as above, the Committee will determine the vesting conditions on the completion date taking into account the circumstances at that time.
Execution of the existing remuneration policy The Committee has implemented the existing remuneration policy throughout the year without change.
Activity in the coming year The Committee will continue to monitor developments on corporate governance including proposed changes to the Corporate Governance Code and implementation of the CEO Pay Ratio.
Activity for the coming year will be shaped by the outcome of the Offer process for 21st Century Fox and Comcast.
Should the Offers not complete the Committee is committed to implementing the changes to policy set out above in time for the 2019 performance year and the 2019 AGM.

52 Sky plc Governance Executive Long Term Incentive Plan 20162019 There was no LTIP vesting in 2018.
Subject to the outcome of the ongoing 21st Century Fox Offer and Comcast Offer, the next vesting of awards made under the terms of the LTIP will occur on 29 July 2019 for the three-year performance period 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2019, for awards made in 2016 and 2017.
Should the ongoing 21st Century Fox Offer and Comcast Offer process complete prior to normal vesting dates for outstanding CIP and LTIP awards, the Committee will determine the vesting conditions on the completion date taking into account the circumstances at that time including discussions with the offerors and the interests of the business, employees and shareholders.
What share-based incentive awards did we make in the year?
2 Market price at date of CIP matching award was 9.56 on 1 September 2017.
Performance conditions for the Long Term Incentive Plan Awards made in July 2017 were Year 2 nil-cost awards.
That is, they relate to the three-year performance period beginning on 1 July 2016 and ending on 30 June 2019.
Vesting is subject to the following performance conditions: 1.
Operational targets 70% of the award There are three equally weighted operational performance measures, each of which is a key indicator of Skys continued success: EPS growth Operating cash flow Revenue growth Performance is measured on an adjusted basis, as reported externally, in order to capture underlying performance.
The Committee will make retrospective disclosure of the targets for operating cash flow and revenue growth when they are deemed to be no longer commercially sensitive.
This has typically been two years after the end of the performance period though the Committee has decided that subject to outcome of the ongoing Offer process, performance targets will be disclosed immediately following the end of the relevant performance period, commencing with the 2019 performance year.
For EPS, two points are awarded for growth of RPI 3% per year, with the maximum ten points awarded for RPI 5% per year or more.
For operating cash flow and revenue growth, one point is awarded for 75% achievement of target on a sliding scale up to ten points for 105% or more.
One point equates to 10% of the award vesting, with maximum vesting for 21 points or more, vesting on a straight-line basis between these points.
There is no additional award for achievement above 21 points.
If the minimum range is met each year for all measures, 26% of the shares vest.
The Committee sets a high threshold vesting level in line with our policy of rewarding success not failure.
Maximum vesting is not achievable if performance is below threshold for any one measure.
To earn the minimum of one point on any one of these measures requires the achievement of 75% of target.
Missing two targets would represent a significant and disproportionate reduction in total compensation.
Annual Report 2018 53 Directors remuneration report Annual remuneration implementation report continued Annual performance measures are shown in further detail in the table below: Average EPS growth Operating cash flow Revenue growth Performance achieved Performance achieved Performance achieved Points awarded % of target Points awarded % of target Points awarded RPI 5% p. a.

This is equivalent to absolute growth in earnings of 26% over three years if RPI is 3% a year.
This level of growth in earnings was set at a level which exceeded consensus research analysts estimates.
Relative TSR performance 30% of the award The Companys TSR performance is measured relative to the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE 100.
If the Companys TSR performance is below median, the TSR element of the award lapses in full.
For median performance, one-third of the shares subject to the TSR condition may vest, with all of the shares vesting for upper quartile performance.
Vesting is on a straight line basis between these points as shown below.

The table below sets out total remuneration received by the Executive Directors for the financial year ended 30 June 2018 and the prior year ended 30 June 2017.
The vesting pattern of awards under the LTIP is biennial: shares vest every other year over a three-year performance period.
This means that every other year no payment is due as there is no vesting of awards.
The following year, assuming performance conditions are met, there will be a payment which covers the equivalent of two years vesting.
There was no LTIP vesting in 2018, so the single figure for 2018 is significantly lower than for 2017, which was a vesting year.
The all-employee pay budget was 2.5%, with increases of 5% for outstanding performance and 10% for promotions.
Employees earning less than 31,000 received an uplift on the standard increase of a further 0.5% to 1.5% based on performance.
2 Taxable benefits include company car or car allowance, healthcare, provision of tax advice and other expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business which are deemed to be taxable benefits on the individual.
3 Pension comprises a cash allowance in lieu of company contributions.
4 Bonus shows the full amount earned shortly after the year end in which the performance measures applied, including amounts deferred through the CIP.
The payout for the 2017 bonus was 186% of base salary for the Group CEO and 140% for the Group COO & CFO.
The figures for 2018 are 180% for the Group CEO and 135% for the Group COO & CFO, which is 90% of maximum.

TSR performance The graph below shows the Companys TSR for the nine years to 30 June 2018, measured as the value of a 100 holding in ordinary shares at the start of the period.
The performance is shown relative to the FTSE 100, which represents the broad market index against which the Companys shares are traded.
TSR is a measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders, reflecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends.
Data is averaged over three months at the end of each financial year.

The table highlights the unique structure of our remuneration policy, in which vesting of LTIP shares occurs every two years rather than the customary 12-month cycle.
As our LTIP awards are made as a fixed number, the realised value is purely reflective of delivery against performance measures and any share price growth over this period, keeping it aligned to shareholders interests.
It should be noted that total remuneration for 2013 includes vesting of the one-off additional LTIP award of 300,000 shares made in 2011 at the time of the then possible News Corporation bid.
The average annual total remuneration paid to the Group CEO over this nine-year period, excluding this one-off award, is 9,036,154.
2 Includes vesting of the one-off additional LTIP award of 300,000 shares made in 2011 at the time of the then possible News Corporation bid.

56 Sky plc Value of a hypothetical 100 investment Governance Disclosure of performance targets for 2016 The Committee discussed at length its approach to disclosure of performance targets.
Its position that early disclosure of targets would be commercially detrimental because of the highly competitive nature of the market in which it operates still holds but it considers that performance targets for the 2016 annual bonus are no longer commercially sensitive.
There was no LTIP vesting in 2016 and the 2013 CIP award that vested in 2016 did so based on EPS performance disclosed on page 55 of the 2016 Annual Report.
Annual bonus In setting the bonus targets the Committee gave careful consideration to the business plan and to the research analyst consensus forecasts at the time.
The targets and performance measured on an adjusted basis for the 2016 annual bonus are shown in the table below.
2015 16 Performance vs Performance metric Target Performance Target Group paid-for products growth 3.0m 3.27m 109% Group operating profit 1,525m 1,558m 102% Group operating cash flow 1,160m 1,291m 111% On the basis of average performance versus target of 107%, the Committee determined that the bonus was paid at 100% of maximum for the Group CEO and for the Group COO & CFO.
How do we intend to implement the remuneration policy next year?
Shareholders approved the renewal of the existing remuneration policy at the 2017 AGM.
Following further consultation with shareholders this year the Committee determined that changes to the policy would be put to shareholders for approval at the 2019 AGM should the 21st Century Fox Offer and Comcast Offer fall away.
Until then the Committee intends to implement the current policy as summarised on pages 49 to 51 for the year ending 30 June 2019 or until such time as a 21st Century Fox Offer or Comcast Offer completes during this period.
Base salary Increases for our employees effective 1 July 2018 ranged from 2.5% to 3.5% based on performance, with additional adjustments of 10% for promotions and market adjustments.
After careful consideration, the Committee decided to make base salary adjustments of 3.0% each for the Group CEO and Group COO & CFO, effective 1 July 2018, which is in line with the performance matrix parameters for our employees.
Employees were not consulted over the Committees decision but the Committee was briefed on the employee pay budget and policy for pay awards.
Taxable benefits and pension Effective from 1 July 2018 the Dependents Death in Service Benefit which provided a surviving spouse or dependent with a pension of 1 3rd of the employees base salary for life has been replaced with additional life cover of 4x base salary life cover.
This change applies to all employees, including the Executive Directors, as part of a strategic review of our benefits package for UK employees.
Annual bonus and Co-Investment Plan The performance measures for the annual bonus remain unchanged for the coming year, namely revenue growth, operating profit and operating cash flow.
The Committee believes that these measures provide clear line of sight to the key imperatives for the business.
We expect that both of the Executive Directors will participate in the CIP for this year, based on their earned 2017 18 annual bonus.
The performance conditions for the vesting of shares are as per the details set out on page 54.
The Committee has decided that with effect from the 2018 19 performance year the earned annual bonus will be subject to a mandatory deferral of 50% into Sky shares.
Long Term Incentive Plan award The Committee agreed that Jeremy Darroch would be granted an award of 600,000 shares and Andrew Griffith would be granted an award of 350,000 shares on 27 July 2018.
This is the Year 1 award of the 20182021 Plan.
These awards will normally vest on 27 July 2021 subject to the performance measures being achieved.
The performance conditions for this award are the same as for the 2017 award, as set out on pages 53 and 54, with the exception of relative TSR performance which the Committee concluded in the light of the ongoing Offer process is no longer a fair measure of the Companys performance due to the effective distorting impact of the share price.
Awards will therefore vest based solely on operational metrics, which the Committee believes are no more difficult nor easier to achieve than the TSR conditions were intended to be in the absence of the Offer process.
Annual Report 2018 57 Directors remuneration report Annual remuneration implementation report continued Directors share interests As at the end of the financial year, the Group CEO had beneficial ownership of 743,101 shares equivalent to 10.1x base salary and the Group COO & CFO had beneficial ownership of 197,580 shares, equivalent to 4.3x base salary, using the year end closing share price of 14.61.

58 Sky plc Governance What did we pay our Chairman and Non-Executive Directors during the year?
audited The following table sets out the single figure for total remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors for the financial year ended 30 June 2018 and the prior year ended 30 June 2017.
Changes to responsibilities and associated fees are set out in full in the 2016 17 Remuneration Report.
2 Katrin Wehr-Seiter had taxable travel expenses of 9,881 during the year, which have been grossed up for tax and included in the total fees.
Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are detailed in the table below: From 1 July From 1 July 2018 2017 1 Chairman all inclusive fee 422,300 410,000 Deputy Chairman 30,000 30,000 1 Board member 68,200 66,215 Additional responsibilities: Senior Independent Director 40,000 40,000 Chairman of Committee 25,000 25,000 Member of Committee 10,000 10,000 1 Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors were increased by 3.0% effective 1 July 2018.
Payments to past Directors and loss of office There were no payments made to past Directors and no payments made for loss of office during the financial year.
Shareholder voting outcomes The Company engages with major shareholders and institutional investor groups every year to seek their views on remuneration, and the Remuneration Committee ensures that their views are considered carefully prior to making its decisions.
At the AGM held on 12 October 2017, 70.99% of shareholders voted in favour of the Directors Report on Remuneration and 93.76% voted in favour of the remuneration policy.
The Company had engaged with its major shareholders prior to the 2017 AGM on a new policy and explained that given the ongoing 21st Century Fox Offer the prudent approach at the time was to propose a substantially unchanged policy which would enable senior management to continue to focus on the business priorities.
This rationale was accepted at the time, as evidenced by the voting outcome.
Since the last AGM the Company has continued to engage with our major shareholders on a new policy should the 21st Century Fox Offer and Comcast Offer process fall away.
The proposals have been positively received.
The Committee considered feedback on the 2017 Remuneration Report and the views of shareholders on the early vesting conditions for LTIP and CIP in the event of a successful 21st Century Fox Offer as set out in the Co-operation Agreement of 15 December 2016.
The Committees view was that the conditions proposed were proportionate and measured given the particular circumstances at the time.
Since then the process has continued and the Committee will consider the most appropriate approach at the time should the 21st Century Fox Offer or Comcast Offer complete, having regard to the interests of the Company, its employees and shareholders.
