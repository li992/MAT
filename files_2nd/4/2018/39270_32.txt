The Remuneration Committee has approved the following takes into account a number of internal and external factors, including proposed structure of bonuses for 2019 for the Executive Directors: Company performance during the year, external market data and the 95% of the profit target and a Free Cash Flow gateway of 170m have to salary review principles applied to the rest of the organisation to ensure be reached at Group level before a bonus can be paid to the Executive a consistent approach.

Shares under the awards will be released no earlier than five years after grant i. e. following a three-year vesting period and a two-year holding period.
Vesting of this award will be determined by the Companys performance as follows: Performance measures 2019-2021 Weighting Threshold: 25% vesting Target: 50% vesting Maximum: 100% vesting 1 Relative TSR 50% TSR performance is median Straight-line vesting between Upper quartile TSR against comparator group threshold and maximum performance against comparator group 2 EPS 25% 6% per annum 7.9% per annum 11% per annum Organic Revenue growth 5% 3% per annum 3.5% per annum 4% per annum Free Cash Flow conversion 5% 80% 85% 90% 3 Strategic measures Sales and service colleague 5% Targets for these measures have not been disclosed as the Board believes that these measures are retention commercially sensitive.
They will be based on straight-line vesting between threshold and target and Customer satisfaction 5% target and maximum performance which will be reported at vesting.
T he TSR index of comparators for this cycle will be the constituents of the FTSE 350 Index, excluding financial services, property and primary resources sectors.
The FTSE 350 is recognised as a broad index and is considered to be an appropriate benchmark for measuring performance given the Companys membership of that index, the scope and scale of the Companys international operations, and the diverse nature of companies in the business services sector.
This relative TSR measure is used to ensure participants are incentivised to outperform key peers and to ensure that the interests of management are aligned with shareholders.
T he EPS measure is used to link reward more directly to long-term profit performance.
It is measured on a point-to-point basis over the three-year period of the award.
In order to measure underlying earnings improvement, EPS is measured after adjusting for impairments, amortisation, pension interest and material one-off items, as the Remuneration Committee considers that these items do not reflect the underlying performance of the business.
Given the Companys continued focus on improving efficiency and reducing costs around restructuring, restructuring costs are included in the EPS calculation in order to incentivise management to maintain focus in this area.
Given the international nature of our business, EPS is measured on an exchange neutral basis to reflect management performance by removing the impact of windfalls and losses as a result of exchange rate movements.
Vesting shall be calculated on a straight-line basis between threshold and target, and target and maximum.
The EPS targets for 2019 maintain the same approach and linkage to performance scales by comparing the EPS to internal plans and external consensus in deriving the new target range, as for previous years.
Absolute ranges will vary year to year depending on the business plans and environment.
T he Strategic measures will be measured over the three-year performance period.
Colleague retention will be measured on average overall sales and service colleague retention: customer satisfaction will be measured in average Customer Voice Counts scores: and energy efficiency will be measured on our average reduction in the index of energy and fuel derived CO emissions at CER see our 2 Corporate Responsibility section on page 51.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that these targets represent a stretching range in light of all relevant factors including the current business plan and analysts forecasts.
When determining the level of vesting, the Remuneration Committee will also consider the underlying financial performance of the business, as well as the value added to shareholders during the performance periods, and may adjust the vesting outcome if it considers this to be appropriate.
