Our Governance 80 Audit Committee Report The Board discussed and reviewed the Groups risk appetite when reviewing the principal risks and the strategy for the Group.
Regular review of the risk appetite ensures that the Companys risk exposure remains appropriate and acceptable in enabling the Group to achieve its strategic objectives.
The Audit Committee also reviews risk appetite and principal risks when considering the effectiveness of the risk management system.
Every year the Audit Committee focuses on particular risk areas identified in the Group risk register.
During the period, management reported on the Groups information security controls and assurance plans for the existing systems, the programme for complying with the new General Data Protection Regulation and the programme for the new Ocado Solutions platform security and privacy internal control systems.
The Audit Committee will continue to receive reports on these areas in future years.
Further details of the risk review and the Groups risk management and internal control systems, including financial controls, are set out in the How We Manage Our Risks section on pages 44 to 49.
Internal Audit: Part of the assurance provided to the Audit Committee when reviewing the effectiveness of the Groups systems of internal control comes from Internal Audit.
The Audit Committee reviewed the Internal Audit plan in January 2018 and considered it appropriate to the Group having regard to the principal risks of the business.
The Internal Audit plan, which is risk-based, sets out a number of activities for the period and the 2019 Financial Year, including key assurance programmes, most notably the work on the Ocado Solutions platform security and privacy internal control system.
The programme also included operational audits for key operational risk areas such as physical site security, supplier payments and the Groups business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
The Audit Committee reviews the planned Internal Audit activities, and its resourcing and prioritisation.
Internal Audit reports to each Audit Committee meeting.
Management actions are tracked and the status of these actions is reported alongside progress against the Internal Audit plan.
These reports enable the Audit Committee to monitor progress, and to discuss key findings and the plans to address them.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the Internal Audit plan provides appropriate assurance on the controls in place to manage the principal risks facing the Group.
Internal Audit Effectiveness Review: A review of the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function was carried out during the period by way of a questionnaire completed by members of management and business operations, the Audit Committee members and the external auditor, as well as a self-assessment by the Head of Internal Audit.
The assessment questionnaire asked questions to assess performance in a range of areas including planning and work programme, communication, reporting and performance.
Having considered the results of this review and informal feedback from management and the external auditor provided during the period, the Audit Committee concluded that the Internal Audit function was effective.
During the period, the Audit Committee met with the Head of Internal Audit, without management present.
Annual Review: In addition to its annual performance evaluation, discussed in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 67, the Audit Committee carried out a review of its terms of reference.
The review resulted in changes to the terms of reference to reflect the new 2018 Code.
The Audit Committees terms of reference can be found on www.
Assessing the Effectiveness of the External Audit Process and the External Auditor The Audit Committee places great importance on ensuring that there are high standards of quality and effectiveness in the external audit.
Given Deloitte transitioned into the external auditor role during the prior period, the Audit Committee assessment covers the first full period of Deloitte as the Companys external auditor.
The Audit Committee reviewed and approved the annual audit plan to ensure that it is consistent with the scope of the audit engagement.
In reviewing the audit plan, the Audit Committee discussed the significant and elevated risk areas identified by Deloitte most likely to give rise to a material financial reporting error or those that are perceived to be of higher risk and requiring additional audit emphasis including those set out in the Independent Auditors Report on pages 142 to 148.
The Audit Committee also considered the audit scope and materiality threshold.
The Audit Committee met with Deloitte at various stages during the period, including without management present, to discuss their remit and any issues arising from the work of the auditor.
At the end of the period, the Audit Committee reviewed the performance of Deloitte based on a questionnaire that contained various criteria for judging their effectiveness and on feedback from management.
The criteria for assessing the effectiveness of the audit included the robustness of the audit, the quality of the audit delivery and the quality of the people and service.
The questionnaire was completed by members of the Audit Committee, members of the finance department and senior members of management.
The results of the questionnaire were reviewed by the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee also met with management, including without Deloitte present, to hear their views on the effectiveness of the external auditor.
The Audit Committee concluded that Deloitte had remained effective in their role.
Independence and Objectivity: The Audit Committee considered the safeguards in place to protect the external auditors independence.
Deloitte reported to the Audit Committee that it had considered its independence in relation to the audit and confirmed to the Audit Committee that it complies with UK regulatory and professional requirements and that its objectivity is not compromised.
The Audit Committee took this into account when considering the external auditors independence and concluded that Deloitte remained independent and objective in relation to the audit.

Approval Thresholds for Non-Audit Work Approver Over 10,000 and up to 30,000 per engagement Chief Financial Officer Over 30,000 and up to 100,000 per engagement Chief Financial Officer and Audit Committee Chairman Greater than 100,000 per engagement, or if the value of non-audit fees to audit fees Audit Committee reaches a ratio of 1:2 as a result of a new engagement, regardless of value An additional protection is provided by way of a non-audit services fee cap.
The Audit Committee or the Company may not approve an engagement of the external auditor if annual non-audit services fees would exceed 70% of the average audit fees not including fees for auditrelated services charged in the previous three years.
Certain types of non-audit service are of sufficiently low risk so as not to require the prior approval of the Audit Committee, such as audit-related services including the review of interim financial information.
Prohibited services are those that have the potential to conflict directly with the auditors role, such as the preparation of the Companys financial statements.
Non-Audit Work Undertaken During the Period: The total of non-audit fees, audit fees and audit-related services fees paid to the external auditor during the period is set out in Note 2.6 to the consolidated financial statements on page 168.
The non-audit service fees of 39,000 2017: 311,000 paid to Deloitte during the period related to audit-related assurance services for an interim review.
All non-audit work engagements were approved by the Chief Financial Officer and Audit Committee Chairman as the fees concerned were within the approval thresholds set under the policy.
The Audit Committee received a regular report from management regarding the extent of non-audit services performed by the external auditor.
Deloitte provided a report to the Audit Committee on the specific safeguards put in place for each piece of non-audit work confirming that it was satisfied that neither the extent of the non-audit services provided nor the size of the fees being 13% of the audit fees charged had any impact on its independence as statutory auditor.
It was concluded that appropriate safeguards were in place to prevent a compromise of auditor independence.
The Audit Committee was satisfied this was the case and so concluded that the auditors independence from the Group was not compromised.
Audit Fees: The Audit Committee was satisfied that the level of audit fees payable in respect of the audit services provided excluding auditrelated services being 456,000 2017: 345,000 was appropriate and that an effective audit could be conducted for such a fee.
The existing authority for the Audit Committee to determine the current remuneration of the external auditor is derived from the shareholder approval granted at the Companys annual general meeting in 2018.
At the annual general meeting in 2018, 99.92% of votes cast by shareholders were in favour of granting the Directors this authority.
Statement of Compliance with the Competition and Markets Authority CMA Order The Company confirms that it has complied with The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation Mandatory Use of Competitive Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities Order 2014 Article 7.1, including with respect to the Audit Committees responsibilities for agreeing the audit scope and fees and authorising non-audit services.

The performance of the Group saw continued growth in the retail business, steady improvement in the efficiency of the platform and a very rapid A A expansion of the Solutions business.
The Group achieved strong gross sales and customer growth and increased EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended 2 December 2018.
The shareholders recognise the strong growth of the Group, with the share price having increased 129% from December 2017 to December 2018.
The Remuneration Committee is committed to ensuring the Companys leadership is motivated to deliver long-term sustainable growth through successful implementation of the strategy.
This year we are putting forward a revised 2019 Directors Remuneration Policy the 2019 Policy for shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 1 May 2019.
In addition, we have taken on board feedback received from shareholders both through consultation for the 2019 Policy and in previous years on matters related to remuneration and governance structures, as well as carefully considering the changing legislative and regulatory environment in both Ocados remuneration and disclosures.
Relationship Between Pay and Performance We have approved a bonus payment to the Executive Directors based on 69% to 72% achievement against objectives under the Annual Incentive Plan AIP for the period.
More detail about the bonus plan can be found on pages 93 to 94.
During the period, we reviewed the performance against the 2016 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP award targets, which had a performance period ending on 2 December 2018.
The 2016 LTIP awards were subject to the achievement of targets relating to the retail business and the platform business, including the operational efficiency and the capital costs for the Ocado Smart Platform.
Based on the results to the end of the performance period, the Directors achieved 50% against the performance targets as a result of progress made in improving the Andover CFC.
The 2016 LTIP awards are expected to vest in March 2019.
More detail about the LTIP vesting can be found on page 95.
In 2014, the Remuneration Committee implemented a one-off five-year Growth Incentive Plan GIP to incentivise a focus on the key strategic drivers and delivery of exceptional growth and return to shareholders over the long-term.
The GIP is due to vest in May 2019 dependent on Ocados share price growth relative to the FTSE 100 over the five-year performance period exceeding the threshold.
While the GIP has been successful in incentivising management to deliver the growth experienced in the last year, it was not without its structural flaws, in particular its point-to-point measurement leading to a very binary outcome: it was effectively underwater for four of the five performance years and therefore potentially ineffective as an incentive and retention arrangement for this period.
Base salaries, which underpin retention of the Executive Directors, were reviewed during the period.
An increase of 3% was approved, which is broadly in line with the Groups employee salary percentage increase and business plans and will be reviewed in the coming period.
When reviewing base salaries, the Committee is mindful of Group performance and the increasing complexity of the business.
The Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 88 to 103 contains details of the remuneration paid to Executive Directors during the period.
The 2019 Directors Remuneration Policy and Key Changes to Executive Director Remuneration The Remuneration Committee works to ensure that the remuneration framework helps support and drive the Companys strategy.
Under the current schemes, the commercial sensitivity of much of Ocados long-term strategic plans meant that the Committee has in the past faced some criticism from shareholders and advisory bodies where targets were not disclosed in sufficient detail.
It is the view of the Board that the key measure of the success of the implementation of the Companys strategy over the next period remains the generation of substantial and sustained total shareholder return.
The Committee has worked hard to formulate the 2019 Policy and incentive plans that drive exceptional, sustainable growth, also rewarding short-term operational and strategic decisions while addressing the flaws that underlie the long-term plans used historically.

Banked value is subject to phased vesting in years three, four and five, and achievement of a compound TSR underpin of 10% CAGR at each vesting date: Additional holding periods such that vested shares become unrestricted no earlier than five years from start of the VCP and the amount that can vest in any given year is capped, with any excess eligible to vest in future years: Increase to the minimum shareholding requirement and introduction of a post-cessation employment shareholding requirement: and Reduction in the maximum Director pension contribution.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the proposed changes to the 2019 Policy address the challenges set out above and will achieve the goal of motivating and retaining the Executive Directors.
The 2019 Policy on pages 107 to 129 will be put to shareholders to vote on at the 2019 AGM.
The AIP and VCP are also subject to shareholder approval at the 2019 AGM.
Changes To Non-Executive Director Remuneration The Non-Executive Directors annual fees were subject to annual review and, as a result of this review, the basic fees for Non-Executive Directors were increased to 52,000 2017: 50,000.
Fee levels have only increased once since April 2014.
The Committee reviewed the Chairmans remuneration arrangements and have proposed some changes.
Upon appointment as Chairman, Lord Rose received a one-off award of 452,284 shares the Matching Shares, which was approved by shareholders at the 2013 annual general meeting.
Prior to joining the Board, the Chairman had purchased 750,000 shares on his own account the Acquired Shares.
The proposal is to seek shareholder approval to amend the terms of this arrangement to remove a restriction in the terms that prevents the Chairman from selling the Acquired Shares while he remains a Director of the Company.
The Committee believes that since the Matching Shares, which vested in May 2016 and belong to the Chairman, would remain subject to an ongoing restriction that prevents sale of these shares, these arrangements alone provide sufficient alignment of interests between the Company and its shareholders and the Chairman.
Shareholder Consultation and Remuneration Disclosure In preparing the 2019 Policy, an extensive shareholder consultation exercise was carried out with the Companys largest shareholders and representative bodies.
In formulating the proposals, the Remuneration Committee carefully considered the shareholder feedback that had been received.
We contacted the 20 largest shareholders, as well as Glass Lewis, The Investment Association and ISS, to consult on proposed changes to the policy, and I would like to take the opportunity to thank them again for their input.
Further details on the consultation can be found on page 110.
While the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 the 2018 Code does not apply to the Company yet, the Company is able to evidence that it is compliant with a number of the provisions of the 2018 Code from a remuneration perspective, including with regards to the proposed 2019 Policy and the disclosures throughout this report.
Executive Remuneration and the Broader Context Ocado is committed to ensuring its workforce has the diversity of talent and expertise that it needs for the business to continue to grow and innovate.
Our people are critical to us achieving the strategy and we are committed to hiring and developing the highest quality talent throughout Ocado, ensuring our people are rewarded fairly and competitively for their contribution to the Companys success.
When making decisions on executive remuneration, the Committee references a number of factors related to the wider workforce, including the all-employee remuneration report.
Further details on workforce remuneration can be found on page 111.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions about the work of the Remuneration Committee.

 LLP Re-appointment and Review The Remuneration Committee considered the re-appointment of  LLP PwC.
This review took into account PwCs effectiveness, independence, period of appointment and fees.
PwC were appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 2017 following a tender process led by the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance of PwC based on feedback from members of the Remuneration Committee and management.
The criteria for assessing their effectiveness included their understanding of business issues and risks, their knowledge and expertise and their ability to manage expectations.
The Remuneration Committee concluded that the performance of PwC remained effective.
The Remuneration Committee considered the independence and objectivity of PwC.
PwC have provided assurances to the Remuneration Committee that they have effective internal processes in place to ensure that they are able to provide remuneration consultancy services independently and objectively.
PwC confirmed to the Company that they are a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such operate under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
The Remuneration Committee is, following its annual review, satisfied that PwC have maintained independence and objectivity.
For the period, 161,833 in advisory fees were paid or payable to PwC for services provided to the Remuneration Committee.
The basis for this is a fixed retainer fee and a time-based fee for additional work including the 2019 Directors Remuneration Policy.
Following the review by the Remuneration Committee, it was agreed that PwC should be re-appointed.

The Remuneration Committee is mindful of the need to recognise and manage conflicts of interest when receiving views and reports from, or consulting with, the Executive Directors or members of senior management.
How the Committee Spent its Time in 2018 The Remuneration Committee has, under its terms of reference, been delegated responsibility for setting remuneration for all of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and the Company Secretary.
In line with its terms of reference, the Remuneration Committees work during the period included the following: approving the Directors Remuneration Report: approving the Directors Remuneration Policy: consulting with shareholders on the proposed 2019 Directors Remuneration Policy: reviewing performance under the 2017 AIP and consideration of any bonuses payable: approving the 2018 AIP performance targets: approving the 2018 LTIP awards and performance targets: reviewing performance against LTIP awards: receiving executive remuneration advice from advisers in respect of a range of matters considered by the Remuneration Committee during the year: receiving a report from the Company Secretary on the implications of the 2018 Code: receiving a report on Group-wide and management remuneration for 2018: consulting the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman on performance and remuneration of the Executive Directors: receiving reports from advisers on senior executive pay, market themes and trends: receiving a report on the Groups share schemes and plans for 2019: receiving a report on shareholder feedback on the 2017 annual report and 2018 annual general meeting: and reviewing the performance of advisers.
The Remuneration Committees work also included monitoring and considering the level and structure of remuneration for the Management Committee.
Ultimate decision-making responsibility for the remuneration of the Management Committee lies with the Chief Executive Officer.
This approach still gives the Remuneration Committee necessary visibility of senior management remuneration to enable it to formulate appropriate policy and make decisions regarding Executive Director remuneration, but allows the Chief Executive Officer, who is best placed to make remuneration decisions about the management team, the flexibility to do so.
In line with the 2018 Code, the Remuneration Committee will set remuneration for the Management Committee in future years.
The Remuneration Committee carried out a review of its terms of reference during the period, which did not result in any changes.
In addition to the activities of the Remuneration Committee, the Executive Directors and the Chairman reviewed the remuneration arrangements of the Non-Executive Directors.

Wider Workforce Considerations and Our Approach to Fairness Ocado is committed to ensuring our workforce has the diversity of talent and expertise that it needs for the business to continue to grow and innovate.
Our people are critical to us achieving our strategy and the Remuneration Committee is aware that ensuring our people are rewarded fairly and competitively for their contribution to our success is important for hiring, developing and retaining the highest quality of talent throughout Ocado.
The 2019 Policy is designed in line with the remuneration principles outlined on page 107, which reflect the remuneration principles for the Group.
A key remuneration principle for the Group is that share awards be used to recognise and reward good performance and attract and retain employees.
The Remuneration Committee receives an annual report from management on Group-wide remuneration.
This review covers changes to pay, benefits, pensions and share schemes for all employees in the Group, including the percentage increases in base pay for monthly and hourly paid employees.
The Remuneration Committees work includes monitoring and commenting on the level and structure of remuneration for the Management Committee in relation to various changes to base pay and incentive plans.
The Remuneration Committee carefully considers the relevant parts of this report when making decisions on executive remuneration.
To help support alignment across the Group and with the interests of shareholders and reward for company performance, all UK employees are eligible to participate in the Group Share Incentive Plan and Sharesave plan.
The Management Committee participate in an annual bonus plan and the LTIP, with no share deferral or holding periods operating on these plans.
For some small groups of senior employees, the Group operates some tailored bonus and long-term incentive arrangements such as the cash-based long-term incentive scheme and management incentive plans.
Employment at Ocado Our business is built on innovation, on finding solutions, and on delivering world-class service.
Our people are critical to us achieving our strategy.
We are committed to hiring and developing the highest quality talent throughout Ocado.
We operate in sectors and locations where there is strong competition for workers.
We keep our recruitment processes under constant review and evolve them to make it easy to apply to work for Ocado while maintaining our high standards.
This has allowed us to remain flexible and agile and respond to the changing labour market by using new attraction methods.
Total Shareholder Return The following graph shows the Total Shareholder Return TSR performance of an investment of 100 in Ocado shares from its Admission to the end of the period compared with an equivalent investment in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 Indices over the past nine years.
These indices were chosen as Ocado has historically been a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index, and has entered the FTSE 100 this year.
Both represent a broad equity market index against which the Company can be compared historically.
The Company has not paid a dividend since its Admission so the Companys TSR does not factor in dividends reinvested in shares.
As shown in the chart opposite, Ocados TSR outperformed the FTSE 250 and FTSE 100 indices over the period.

Details of the number of conditional shares awarded to each Director for the 2016 LTIP awards are shown in the table on page 99.
Luke Jensen was not an employee at the time of the 2016 LTIP awards and therefore does not have a vesting award.

A Neither retail business target met the threshold.
The revenue used as a performance condition for the LTIP includes Retail revenue generated by Ocado.
com and the other Retail sites Fetch, Sizzle and Fabled but excludes revenue from Morrisons and the Solutions business.
The adjusted retail EBT measure is not consistent with the segmental reporting changes made in 2017.
The performance target for adjusted retail EBT is based on Group EBT less an apportionment of certain costs in a number of areas relating to the Solutions business and is based on 52 weeks.
This measure is used by the Remuneration Committee to assess management performance for the 2016 LTIP only.
It is not considered an Alternative Performance Measure.
Specific details of the achievement of Platform Operational Efficiency and Platform Capital Efficiency solution for the Financial Year are not disclosed.
Although the Remuneration Committee is conscious of the regulations and the Code requirement that performance targets should be transparent, it considers that disclosure of the achievement against these specific targets remains commercially sensitive to the Company and if disclosed could damage the Companys commercial interests.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the targets were stretching and have been applied vigorously.

The Cash LTIP is an amount of money that is based on the value of 143,632 of the Companys shares.
The final cash amount that Luke Jensen is eligible to receive depends on the extent to which the Company achieves a performance target linked to the number of Ocado Solutions deals signed by the Group during the performance period.
The Cash LTIP has a three-year performance period.
The performance conditions for the 2017 Cash LTIP allow for the early payment of the award in the event that the maximum performance conditions are satisfied prior to the end of the 2017 18 Financial Year.
The performance conditions were satisfied in full during the period and therefore the award will vest in March 2019.
Payout of the full value of the award will be based on the average share price of the Companys shares in the twenty business days prior to the payout date.

This means that if an Executive Director ceases to be employed by the Group during the three-year period, the Free Shares and Matching Shares will be forfeited.

The number of shares subject to an LTIP award was determined based on a price of 540.93 pence per share, being the volume weighted average price of the Companys ordinary shares on the three trading days prior to 1 March 2018 being the LTIP grant date.
The 2018 LTIP awards are subject to four performance metrics.

The SIP scheme is made available to all employees.
The SIP allows for the grant of a number of different forms of awards.
An award of Free Shares was made to the Executive Directors in September 2018 under the terms of the SIP and the Directors Remuneration Policy.
Free shares of up to 3,600 of ordinary shares may be allocated to any employee in any year.
Free Shares are allocated to employees equally on the basis of salary, as permitted by the relevant legislation.
An award of Matching Shares was made to those Executive Directors who purchased Partnership Shares using deductions taken from their gross basic pay under the terms of the SIP and in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Policy.
For more details about the SIP, please see page 118.
The Executive Directors continued their membership in the SIP after the end of the period and were therefore awarded further Matching Shares pursuant to the SIP rules.
Between the end of the period and 21 January 2019, being the last practicable date prior to the publication of this Annual Report, the Executive Directors acquired or were awarded further shares under the SIP as set out in the table below: Total Face Value Total SIP Partnership Matching of Free Shares and Shares Shares Shares Free Shares Matching Shares Held at Director Acquired Awarded Award 21 01 19 Tim Steiner 35 5 43 7,768 Duncan Tatton-Brown 35 5 43 7,710 Mark Richardson 35 5 42 7,761 Neill Abrams 35 5 42 6,980 Luke Jensen 36 5 43 2,222 1.

Awards granted under the GIP may be met by the issue of new shares, the transfer of shares from treasury, or the purchase or transfer of existing shares by the EBT where available.
Awards vesting under the LTIP are typically satisfied by the issue of new shares and transfer of existing shares by the EBT.
There are limits on the number of shares that may be allocated under the Companys share plans.
These dilution limits were recommended by the Remuneration Committee and incorporated into the rules of the various share schemes, which have been approved by the Companys shareholders.
The dilution limits restrict the commitment to issue new ordinary shares or reissue treasury shares under all share schemes of the Group to 10% of the nominal amount of the Companys issued share capital and under the LTIP and the GIP and any other selective share scheme to 5% of the nominal amount of the issued share capital of the Company in any rolling ten-year period.
These limits are consistent with the guidelines of institutional shareholders.
Impact on Dilution The Company monitors the number of shares issued under these schemes and their impact on dilution.
The charts below show the Companys commitment, as at the last practicable date prior to the publication date of this Annual Report being 21 January 2019, to issue new shares in respect of its share schemes assuming all performance conditions are met, all award holders remain in employment to the vesting date and all awards are settled in newly issued shares.
For these purposes, no account is taken of ordinary shares allocated prior to the Companys Admission.

created for shareholders above a Threshold TSR.
Base Salary and Benefits The Remuneration Committee expects to finalise its annual review of the Executive Directors base salaries later in 2019, in line with the timing of pay reviews for all of the Groups employees.
The benefits in kind offered to the Executive Directors are expected to remain unchanged.
Pensions Pension contributions for Executive Directors will continue to be 8% of salary in 2019.
2019 AIP The 2019 AIP will operate in line with the 2019 Policy, subject to shareholder approval.
The AIP potential is 275% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 215% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Executive Officer of Solutions, and 190% of salary for the General Counsel and Company Secretary.
Any payout is subject to mandatory deferral of at least half of any AIP award into shares.
The maximum amount of AIP award that can be paid in cash is 100% of salary.
Shares vest after three years but are subject to a further two-year holding period, during which they cannot be sold.
There will be four measures in the 2019 AIP, with the weighting for each element as detailed below: A Retail revenue 20% : a measure concerning the reported revenue for the Retail segment of the Group.
A Retail profitability 20% : a measure concerning the reported EBITDA for the Retail segment of the Group.
Solutions commitments 40% : a measure concerning the number of new commitments from Solutions partners for the Solutions offer, weighted according to a pre-determined scale linked to the size of the commitment.
Operational and strategic objectives 20% : as agreed between the Executive Director and the CEO or the Chairman and reviewed by the Remuneration Committee, which will be in relation to, for example, growth in client bases, platform costs, capacity and productivity targets, and technology developments.
A bonus is not payable unless a threshold level of the performance condition has been achieved.
At threshold performance for a financial performance measure, 5% of total bonus is payable and at maximum performance, 20% of total bonus is payable except for the Solutions commitments target, which is 10% and 40%, respectively.
A straight-line sliding scale will apply in relation to the intermediate points between the threshold and maximum.
Each target is discrete and can be earned separately.
The actual performance targets are not disclosed due to their commercial sensitivity on the basis that if disclosed it would likely damage the Companys commercial interests.
The Company expects to disclose achievement against the targets after the end of the performance period.

The award has no value on grant but gives the Executive Directors the opportunity to share in a proportion of the total value created for shareholders above a hurdle Threshold Total Shareholder Return at the end of each year Measurement Date over a five-year VCP period.
At each Measurement Date, 2.75% of the value created above the hurdle will be banked in the form of share awards which will be released in line with the vesting schedule.
The 2.75% will be allocated as follows: Chief Executive Officer: 1% of share capital, Other Executive Directors: 0.25% each of share capital: and 0.75% of share capital in total unallocated for potential future participants.
The initial price for the VCP will be the average share price over the 30-day period prior to the Annual General Meeting the Initial Price.
The Executive Directors will receive the right at the end of each year of the performance period to the share awards with a value representing the level of the Companys total shareholder return Measurement Total Shareholder Return above the Threshold Total Shareholder Return at the relevant Measurement Date.
The share price used at the Measurement Date will be the 30-day average following the announcement of the Companys results for the relevant financial year plus the value of any dividends in respect of that year.
The Threshold Total Shareholder Return or hurdle which has to be exceeded before share awards can be earned by the Executive Directors is the higher of: The highest previous Measurement Total Shareholder Return: and The Initial Price compounded by 10% p. a.
If the value created at the end of a given year does not exceed the Threshold Total Shareholder Return, nothing will accrue in that year under the VCP.
The vesting schedule provides that 50% of the cumulative number of share awards will vest following the third Measurement Date, 50% of the cumulative balance following the fourth Measurement Date, with 100% of the cumulative number of share awards vesting following the fifth Measurement Date.
At each vesting date, vesting of awards is subject to: i.
A minimum Total Shareholder Return underpin of 10% Compound Annual Growth Rate being maintained: Where the Total Shareholder Return underpin has been achieved at the third Measurement Date, 50% of the cumulative balance will vest.
If the underpin has not been achieved no share awards will vest at this point but they will not lapse: Where the Total Shareholder Return underpin has been achieved at the fourth Measurement Date, 50% of the cumulative balance will vest.
If the underpin has not been achieved no share awards will vest at this point but they will not lapse: and Where the Total Shareholder Return underpin has been achieved at the fifth Measurement Date, 100% of the cumulative balance will vest.
If the underpin has not been achieved no share awards will vest at this point and the remaining cumulative balance will lapse: ii.
Any shares vesting cannot be sold prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of the implementation of the VCP: and iii.
An annual cap on vesting of 20 million for the Chief Executive Officer and a proportionate limit for other Executive Directors.
In the event that in any year vesting as described above would exceed the annual cap, any share awards above the cap will be rolled forward and allowed to vest in subsequent years provided the cap is not exceeded in those years, until the VCP is fully paid out or after five years after the fifth Measurement Date when any unvested share awards will automatically vest.
Rolled forward share awards will not be subject to further underpins, performance conditions or service conditions.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee will adjust VCP vesting levels if it believes they are not reflective of underlying business or personal performance or any other factors it considers appropriate.
As part of this, the Remuneration Committee will consider the operational and strategic performance under the AIP as part of its consideration each year when calculating the VCP banked share awards and on vesting.
The table below shows indicative figures of the value delivered to shareholders and the Executive Directors under the VCP, for three different Total Shareholder Return performance scenarios.
15% p. a. growth growth growth End share price after five years 13.69 14.98 17.00 Additional value created for shareholders over the five years 3,624m 4,525m 5,935m Chief Executive Officer payout Nil 26m 55m Other Executive Director payouts each Nil 6m 14m 1.
These figures are based on an Inital Price of 8.50 and linear growth.

If share price growth is not linear the actual level of benefits to the Executive Directors are likely to be less.
The Executive Directors in the VCP may choose to purchase linked jointly owned equity JOE awards.
Under a JOE award the Executive Directors acquire shares jointly with the Employee Benefit Trust the EBT trustee where the Executive Directors have an interest in the growth in value of the jointly-owned shares above a hurdle price.
The Executive Directors may only realise value from the JOE award at the same time and to the same extent as from a linked nil-cost option, and any value the Executive Directors receive from the JOE award will be offset against the value that the Executive Directors may receive under the linked nil-cost option.
Therefore acquisition of a JOE award does not increase the gross value that the Executive Directors may obtain under the VCP, nor does it allow the Executive Directors to obtain this any earlier.
JOE awards are forfeitable in certain circumstances, in particular, where no value will be delivered to the Executive Directors under the VCP.
SIP The Executive Directors are expected to continue their participation in the SIP scheme in 2019.
Sharesave The Executive Directors will be invited to participate in the next offer of Sharesave, expected to be made in 2019.
Changes for Non-Executive Directors and Chairman The review of remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman will be finalised in line with the timing of pay reviews for all of the Groups employees.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the Chairman remuneration arrangements and have proposed some changes.
The Matching Shares vested in May 2016.
The terms of the award prevent the Chairman from disposing of the Acquired Shares whilst he remains a director of the Company and prevent the Chairman from disposing of the Matching Shares until the first anniversary of his ceasing to be a director of the Company.
The proposal is to seek shareholder approval to amend the terms of this arrangement to release the Chairman from the disposal restriction in relation to the Acquired Shares.
At this point in line with normal market practice, the restrictions on the sale of the Acquired Shares would usually be expected to fall away.
However under the terms of the award, the removal of the sale restrictions on the Acquired Shares purchased by Lord Rose requires shareholder approval.
The Remuneration Committee believes that since the Matching Shares would remain subject to an ongoing restriction that prevents sale of these shares, these arrangements alone provide sufficient alignment of interests between the Company and its shareholders and Lord Rose.
Shareholder Approval and Votes at AGM The 2018 Directors Remuneration Report will be subject to a shareholder vote at the AGM.
Entitlement of a Director to remuneration is not made conditional on this resolution being passed.
The Remuneration Committee Chairman is committed to ongoing shareholder dialogue on Directors remuneration and takes an active interest in voting outcomes.
In the event of a substantial vote against a resolution in relation to the Directors Remuneration Report, the 2019 Directors Remuneration Policy or a new share scheme, the Company would seek to understand the reasons for any such vote and would detail in the announcement of the results of voting any actions it intends to take to understand the reasons behind the vote result and also note this in the next annual report.
The Remuneration Committee considers that a vote against that exceeds 20% should be considered significant and requires explanation.
The table below sets out the actual voting in respect of resolutions regarding remuneration at the three previous annual general meetings.

If approved, it will apply to payments made from this date.
The 2019 Policy is intended to apply for a period of three years from the AGM.
The Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2017 annual general meeting.
The current Directors Remuneration Policy includes three variable remuneration plans: the Annual Incentive Plan, Long Term Incentive Plan and Growth Incentive Plan.
The Company is seeking to reduce the number of plans to two by consolidating the current AIP and LTIP into a single incentive plan based on a new AIP and introducing a Value Creation Plan.
The Remuneration Committee has taken on board the feedback received from shareholders both in previous years on matters related to remuneration and governance, and also in respect of the extensive shareholder consultation carried out in advance of putting this 2019 Policy to shareholders for approval.
Our remuneration principles, which we also aim to cascade throughout the business, underpin our remuneration policy.
These principles are that our remuneration should: Support long-term success of the business and sustainable long-term shareholder value.
Be relevant and aligned to the business strategy and achievement of planned business goals.
Reflect and support the entrepreneurial and high performance culture of the business.
Be compatible with the Groups risk policies and systems.
Link above-market payouts only to outstanding results.
Ensure that performance-related pay constitutes a proportion of the overall package appropriate to each level of the organisation.
Provide a balance between attracting, retaining and motivating the right calibre of candidates and supporting equal opportunity and diversity of talent.
Be clear and explainable to appropriate stakeholders.

While the 2019 Policy provides the boundaries for remuneration arrangements, it is intended to provide some isolated discretion for the Remuneration Committee to use in various circumstances relating to particular components of remuneration.
The 2019 Policy does not provide for the exercise of discretion over any aspect of the policy.
The Remuneration Committee may not use any discretion outside the Policy without separate shareholder approval.
The Remuneration Committee operates the share schemes according to their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and other rules and regulations, where relevant.

The Remuneration Committee was pleased with the support most of our largest shareholders gave to our original proposals, in particular the recognition of the challenges the Remuneration Committee faces in setting Director remuneration at Ocado, and the understanding of our rationale for the main changes proposed.
In finalising our proposals, shareholder feedback received to date was carefully considered, in particular the feedback on the proposed one-off VCP.
The Companys 20 largest shareholders were contacted, representing over 80% of our issued share capital at the time of consultation as well as Glass Lewis, The Investment Association and ISS, to consult on proposed changes to our policy.
We carefully considered all feedback, and made some changes to the proposals in response.
The following table sets out full details of the Remuneration Committees rationale for the proposed changes to the current policy, shareholder feedback during the consultation and the final position reached.
Key proposed change Rationale, shareholder feedback and Committee response Simplification of the current The Remuneration Committee recognises that short-term incentives albeit with a large portion of deferral have a remuneration through the greater perceived value to participants as the performance period is shorter meaning there is greater certainty of replacement of the LTIP and value sooner compared to the LTIP.
For this reason, the proposed annual opportunity has been reduced, with the AIP with a single new AIP calculation set out below: Proposed Current AIP Current LTIP 75% of LTIP AIP % of Executive Director % of salary % of salary % of salary salary CEO 125% 200% 150% 275% CFO, COO, CEO of Ocado Solutions 100% 150% 112.5% 215% General Counsel 100% 120% 90% 190% 1.
Proposed AIP is equal to the current AIP level plus 75% of the LTIP.
Rounded for the CFO, COO and CEO of Ocado Solutions.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the best remuneration vehicle to operate alongside the VCP is a new AIP to replace the current AIP and LTIP for the following reasons: a.
The issues associated with choosing meaningful three-year  performance measures have led some stakeholders to comment that the LTIP is not satisfactory.
The commercial sensitivity of long-term targets under the LTIP has prevented the Remuneration Committee from full disclosure about remuneration arrangements to date: b.
Meaningful and robust one-year annual performance targets can be set under the AIP and can usually be disclosed retrospectively in line with best practice: c. Deferred AIP shares vest after three years and are subject to a further two-year holding period.
This is in line with the 2018 Code which states that shares should be subject to a five-year vesting holding period in order to align managements interests with those of shareholders: and d. Management will remain incentivised to meet financial and operational targets with the prospect of being remunerated in both cash and deferred shares.
Shareholders supported the simplification of the remuneration structure and commitment to transparency in targets and performance against them.
Some commented positively on the operational nature of the AIP measures proposed for 2019.

The single total shareholder return performance measure of the VCP enables the Remuneration Committee to be fully transparent about targets and performance against them and there is no requirement to adjust the parameters of the VCP once set if the Group strategy implementation shifts.
The plan incentivises significant and sustained growth over both the full performance period and each year of the period, and directly supports the Boards view that the key output of the effective implementation of the Companys strategy is substantial and sustained total shareholder return.
There is a direct alignment between shareholders and managements interests, with the benefit received by management being proportionate to the return received by shareholders.
There is a substantial risk that where performance has been good but not exceptional the Executive Directors will not benefit, but this is balanced by the potential for a higher level of reward when stretching levels of return are achieved.
The cap on annual vesting, where the excess is rolled forward and eligible to vest in future years, provides an ongoing locked-in shareholding, which is aligned with shareholders interests.
During the consultation, many shareholders agreed that the VCP was the appropriate incentive plan for the Company, due to the Companys ambitious management team and the strategic rationale presented.
The long-term nature of the plan, direct shareholder alignment, and annual cap on vesting were features particularly supported by shareholders.
In response to shareholder concerns, the Remuneration Committee reduced the proposed potential quantum delivered under the VCP, and, in addition, increased the hurdle rate to ensure the plan delivered value to the Executive Directors only in the case of the achievement of exceptional growth.
Additional holding periods Vested shares become unrestricted no earlier than five years from the start of the relevant AIP award and the VCP.
This ensures alignment with the 2018 Code, and further increases the alignment of Director interests with those of the shareholders.
This change was supported by shareholders.
Increase to the minimum Increasing the shareholding requirement for the Executive Directors will further link their interests with that of shareholding requirement shareholders.
Introduction of a postIntroducing a post-cessation shareholding requirement for the Executive Directors ensures that they consider cessation shareholding effective succession planning and provides an ongoing exposure to the impact of decisions made during their requirement employment through the Company share price post-cessation.
This is also in line with the 2018 Code requirements.
This was supported by shareholders.
Reduction in maximum Although the Executive Directors pension contributions are currently 8%, the change to the 2019 Policy means that Executive Director pension pension contributions for any new appointments to the Board will not exceed 8%, thereby ensuring greater fairness contribution across the Company.
Statement of Consideration of Employment Conditions Elsewhere in the Company The 2019 Policy is designed in line with the remuneration principles outlined on page 107.
This review covers changes to pay, benefits, pension and share schemes for all employees in the Group, including the percentage increases in base pay for monthly and hourly paid employees.
When making decisions on Executive Remuneration, the Remuneration Committee did not consult with employees when drawing up the 2019 Policy, but referenced a number of factors related to the wider workforce, including the all-employee remuneration report and potential cascade of remuneration framework changes.
The remuneration arrangements for employees below Board level reflect the seniority of the role.
The components and levels of remuneration for different employees differ from the remuneration framework for the Executive Directors.
The Group operates some tailored bonus and long-term incentive arrangements for certain groups of employees, but has not adopted a universal approach to these elements of remuneration for all employees.

Adherence to requirement these guidelines is a condition of continued participation in the equity incentive arrangements for Executive Directors.
This To align Executive policy ensures that the interests of Directors and those of shareholders are closely aligned.
Directors and The following table sets out the minimum shareholding requirements: shareholders.
Role Shareholding Requirement % salary Group Chief Executive Officer 400% Other current Executive Directors 300% Other future Executive Directors 300% Chairman The Chairman is expected to hold shares equivalent to one years annual fee.
Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors are expected to hold shares equivalent to one years annual fee.
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to increase the shareholding requirements.
In addition, a post-cessation shareholding requirement will apply to Executive Directors who leave the Company.
Leavers will have a requirement to hold 100% of their pre-cessation shareholding requirement for 12 months from leaving.
Changes from previous Policy Minimum shareholding requirements increased for all existing Executive Directors from 200% of salary, and post-cessation shareholding requirement introduced.
Increased shareholding requirement for existing Executive Directors further supports shareholder alignment, encouraging sustainable share price growth.
The higher requirement for existing Executives is fulfilled by the current shareholdings that Directors already hold.
Introducing a post-cessation shareholding requirement for Executive Directors will ensure Executive Directors consider effective succession planning and provides an ongoing exposure to the impact of decisions made during their employment through the share price of Ocado post-cessation.
Notes to the Policy Tables Other than as described in the Policy table, there are no components of the Executive Directors remuneration that are not subject to performance conditions.
Under a jointly owned equity JOE award the Executive Director acquires shares jointly with the trustee of the Companys Employee Benefit Trust, where the Executive Director has an interest in the growth in value of the jointly-owned shares above a hurdle price.
The Executive Director may only realise value from the JOE award at the same times and to the same extent as from a linked share award, and any value the Executive Director receives from the JOE award will be offset against the value that the Executive Director may receive under the linked share award.
No incremental remuneration arises from the operation of the JOE award.
While the Group has a policy of remunerating its employees through share scheme participation, it does not have formal remuneration arrangements for all employees akin to all of the components of Directors remuneration.
The Company may make any remuneration payment or payment for loss of office including exercising any discretion in connection with such payments notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy table set out above if the terms of that payment were agreed i before the Companys first shareholder-approved directors remuneration policy came into effect: ii before the 2019 Policy came into effect provided that those terms were in line with the directors remuneration policy in force at the time: or iii at a time when the individual was not a Director of the Company and the Remuneration Committee determines that they payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director.
For these purposes, payments include awards of variable remuneration and the terms of such a payment are agreed when the award is granted.

Malus is the adjustment of the AIP payments, unvested AIP deferred shares, unvested LTIP awards, or unvested VCP awards because of the occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below.
The adjustment may result in the value being reduced to nil.
Clawback is the recovery of cash payments made under the AIP or vested LTIP, deferred AIP and VCP awards as a result of the occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below.
Clawback may apply to all or part of an Executive Directors payment under the AIP, LTIP or VCP award and may be effected, among other means, by requiring the transfer of shares, payment of cash or reduction of awards or bonuses.
The Remuneration Committee may apply malus clawback when there are exceptional circumstances.
Such exceptional circumstances include without limitation : a material mis-statement in the published results of the Group or one of its members: an error in assessing any applicable performance condition or the number of shares subject to an award: misconduct on the part of the Executive Director concerned: where, as a result of an appropriate review of accountability, the Remuneration Committee determines that the Executive Director has caused wholly or in part a material loss for the Group as a result of i reckless, negligent or wilful actions or omissions or ii inappropriate values or behaviour: where, as a result of an appropriate review of accountability, the Remuneration Committee determines that the Executive Director has caused wholly or in part a corporate failure of the Company: a Group member being censured by a regulatory body: and events or behaviour on the part of the Executive Director leading to significant reputational damage to the Group.
The first four of the above triggers are applicable to the LTIP and GIP, and all seven triggers are applicable to the AIP and the VCP.

An Executive Directors employment may be terminated by the Company giving to the Executive Director not less than 12 months notice or by the Executive Director giving to the Company not less than six months notice.
If an Executive Directors service contract is terminated without cause, Ocado Central Services Limited can request that the Executive Director work their notice period, take a period of garden leave or pay an amount in lieu of notice equal to one times their basic salary, benefits and pension for the remainder of their notice period.
The Companys remuneration principles provide that any payments should be reduced in certain circumstances where the Executive Directors loss has been mitigated, for example, where he moves to other employment.
If employment is terminated by the Company, the Remuneration Committee retains a discretion to settle any other amounts reasonably payable to the Executive Director including but not limited to: Legal fees incurred by the Executive Director in connection with the termination of employment and obtaining independent legal advice on a settlement or compromise agreement: and Outplacement and relocation costs for returning the departing Executive Director and his family.
Other than described above, there are no relevant contractual provisions that are, or are proposed to be, contained in any Executive Director service contract that could give rise to remuneration payments or payments for loss of office, but which are not disclosed elsewhere in the 2019 Directors Remuneration Policy.
The Remuneration Committee generally has discretion to determine the treatment of a leaver, but will be conscious of the remuneration principle that it should not reward poor performance or behaviour.
In addition to the discretion listed below, in each case the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to determine that an Executive Director is a good leaver see Note 1 at the bottom of the table.
It is the Remuneration Committees intention to only use this discretion in circumstances where appropriate, which will be explained to shareholders.

However, the Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to include any other remuneration component or award in the remuneration package which it considers to be appropriate.
In determining the remuneration arrangements for a new Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will take into account all relevant factors including but not limited to the specific circumstances, the calibre of the individual, the market practice for the candidates location, the nature of the role they are being recruited to fulfil and any relevant market factors, including any competing offers the candidate may be considering.
The Remuneration Committee is at all times conscious of the need to pay no more than is necessary.
Where promotion to an Executive Director role is from within the Company, prevailing elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured and form part of the ongoing remuneration of the person concerned, provided such element if not otherwise within the terms of this Policy was not made in contemplation of such person becoming an Executive Director.
The Companys detailed policy when setting remuneration for the appointment of new Executive Directors is summarised in the table below: Remuneration element Recruitment Policy Salary, Benefits Salary, benefits and pension will be set in line with the 2019 Policy for existing Executive Directors.
and Pension AIP Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the 2019 Policy and will not exceed 275% of salary.
VCP The Plan will allow for grants to new joiners as approved by the Remuneration Committee.
The new Executive Directors share may be reduced to reflect the time elapsed from the grant of the initial awards, and the date of joining.
The hurdle will remain unchanged and the starting price will be set at a minimum at the starting price for other Executive Directors.
All awards limits and caps, as set out in the 2019 Policy, will apply to any new joiner.
LTIP No LTIP awards will be granted to new recruits in line with the operation of the 2019 Policy.
Buy-Out To facilitate recruitment, the Remuneration Committee may, to the extent permitted by relevant plan rules or Listing Rules, of incentives make a one-off award to buy-out incentives or any other compensation arrangements forfeited by the appointee on forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
cessation of In doing so the Remuneration Committee will ensure that any such awards offered should be on a comparable basis, taking employment into account all relevant factors including: any performance conditions: the likelihood of those conditions being met: the proportion of the vesting or performance period remaining: and the form of the award.
In determining whether it is appropriate to use such judgement, the Remuneration Committee will ensure that any awards made are in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders.
Relocation In instances where the new Executive Director is required to relocate or spend significant time away from their normal Policies residence, the Company may provide one-off compensation to reflect the cost of relocation for the Executive Director.
However, these payments must reflect actual financial loss or cost of moving the Executive Director, their family or assets, and the market practice in the geographical location to which the Executive Director is moving to or from.
The Company may provide relocation costs by funding services or a cash payment or a combination of both.
Recruitment of Non-Executive Directors The remuneration package for newly appointed Non-Executive Directors will be in line with the structure set out in the remuneration policy table for Non-Executive Directors.
