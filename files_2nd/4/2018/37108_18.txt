The TSR performance condition is monitored by an independent advisor whilst EPS growth is derived from the audited financial statements: 3 The Committee operates its share plans in accordance with the plan rules and the Listing Rules and the Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the plans e. g. treatment of awards for leavers, change of control, adjustments to performance targets : 4 Consistent with HMRC legislation, the all-employee arrangement does not have performance conditions: and 5 In approving the Directors remuneration policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any past commitments entered into with current or former Directors including the vesting of share awards granted in the past.
Malus and clawback provisions Malus and clawback provisions operate in respect of the annual bonus cash and deferred shares and LTIP awards, with Committee discretion to apply them in the event of i misstatement of results: ii an error in determining the share award: or iii gross misconduct.
The Committee may decide to operate the malus and clawback provisions within a three-year period commencing on the date that the cash part of any annual bonus is paid for cash and deferred share bonus awards, and within a three-year period of any LTIP vesting date.
