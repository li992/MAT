Clawback can be applied where the event occurs between the date of grant and the second anniversary of the date the award vests is paid.
The clawback may be effected through a withholding of variable pay by reducing the size of, or imposing further conditions on, any outstanding or future awards, or by requiring the individual to return the value of the cash or shares delivered to recover the amount overpaid.

and Non-executive Directors may be provided with benefits associated with their role.
Setting Executive Director remuneration When considering how to position the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors, the Committee considers market data from UK-listed companies of a similar size and complexity.
The Committee also receives and takes into account information from the Global Human Resources Director on pay and employment conditions applying to other Group employees, consistent with the Groups general aim of seeking to reward all employees fairly according to the nature of their role, their performance and market forces.
In designing an appropriate incentive structure for the Executive Directors and other senior management, the Committee seeks to set challenging performance criteria that are aligned with the Groups business strategy and the generation of sustained shareholder value.
The Committee is also mindful of the need to avoid inadvertently encouraging risky or irresponsible behaviour including behaviour that could raise environmental, social or governance issues.
Balance of fixed versus variable remuneration The Committee believes that an appropriate proportion of the executive remuneration package should be variable and performance related in order to encourage and reward superior corporate and individual performance.
The following charts updated from those included in the Remuneration Policy included in the 2016 17 Annual Report to take account of the current salary levels of continuing Executive Directors illustrate executive remuneration in specific performance scenarios.
For the purposes of simplicity, no share price growth or dividend payments have been included in the values included for share-based awards.

To facilitate the hiring of candidates of the appropriate calibre, the Committee may make an award to buy out variable remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors including the form of award, the value forfeit, any performance conditions and the time over which the award would have vested.
The intention of any buy-out would be to compensate in a like-for-like manner as far as is practicable.
The maximum level of variable pay that may be awarded to new Executive Directors excluding buy-out arrangements in respect of their recruitment will be in line with the maximum level of variable pay that may be awarded under the annual bonus plan and PSP, i. e. a total face value opportunity of 300% of salary.
The Committee will ensure that such awards are linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance measures and will be forfeited if performance or continued employment conditions are not met.
Appropriate costs and support will be covered if the recruitment requires relocation of the individual.
Executive Director contracts and loss of office payments Executive Directors have one year rolling service contracts and no Executive Director has a notice period in excess of one year or containing any provision for predetermined compensation on termination exceeding one years salary and benefits in kind.
Details of each Executive Director's service contract are summarised below: Name Date of contract G A Kanellis 1 June 2007 1 C G Davis 1 June 2007 B H Leigh 1 June 2007 1 Mr Davis stepped down from the Board on 27 September 2017 and ceased employment on 31 December 2017.
Upon the termination of an Executive Directors employment, the Committees approach to determining any payment for loss ofoffice will normally be guided by the following principles: the Committee shall seek to apply the principle of mitigation where possible, as well as seeking to find an outcome that isinthe best interests of the Company and shareholders as a whole, taking into account the specific circumstances: relevant contractual obligations, as set out above, shall be observed or taken into account: the Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith to satisfy an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of any such obligation or to settle or compromise any claim or costs arising in connection with the employment of an Executive Director or its termination or to make a modest provision in respect of legal costs and or outplacement fees: and the treatment of outstanding variable remuneration shall be as determined by the relevant plan rules, as set out on the next page.

Deferred bonus awards will normally vest in full on a takeover or winding-up of the Company.
In the event of a special dividend, demerger or similar event, the Committee may determine that awards vest on the same basis.
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, awards may be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding company.
Similarly, in the event of a merger of equals, the Committee may invite participants to voluntarily exchange their awards that would otherwise vest for equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding company.
The Committee may in the circumstances referred to above determine to what extent any bonus should be paid in respect of the financial year in which the relevant event takes place, taking into account the extent to which the Committee determines the relevant performance metrics have been or would have been met.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company When reviewing and setting Executive Director remuneration, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of all employees of the Group.
The Group-wide pay review budget is one of the key factors when reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors.
Although the Group has not carried out a formal employee consultation regarding Board remuneration, it does comply with local regulations and practices regarding employee consultation more broadly.
Communication with shareholders The Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with shareholders and seeks the views of significant shareholders when any major changes are being made to remuneration arrangements.
The Committee takes into account the views of significant shareholders when formulating and implementing the Policy.

5 With effect from 1 June 2008, the Executive Directors became eligible for membership of the Companys defined contribution pension arrangement.
Messrs Kanellis and Leigh each receive a salary supplement equivalent to 20% of base salary: these amounts are included in the column headed Pension.
Until his retirement on 31 December 2017, Mr Davis continued to participate in the defined contribution pension arrangement but as the amount of Company contributions was less than 20% of his salary, the difference between those contributions and 20% of his base salary was paid as a salary supplement.
Both the pension contributions and the salary supplement are included in the column headed Pension.
Included in the column headed Pension above for Mr Davis is the payment of a cash equivalent transfer value totalling 690,848.
This relates to the Companys liability in connection with his funded and unfunded pension benefits accrued during his employment with the Company.
The calculation of the value of the benefits to which he was entitled was undertaken by an independent actuary and in line with HMRC guidance.
The lump sum payment was consistent with past practice at the Company with the cash equivalent transfer value discharging the Companys liability in full and having been calculated on a no gain no loss basis tothe Company.

From 1 September 2018, the base salary of each of Mr Kanellis and Mr Leigh will increase by 2%, in line with the average UK increase in the Group.
The base salaries for the year ended 31 May 2017 and the year ended 31 May 2016 are also set out below: 01 09 2016 01 09 2017 01 09 2018 Base salary Base salary Base salary Increase % G A Kanellis 580,500 595,012 607,000 2.0 1 C G Davis 363,200 370,464 n a n a B H Leigh 357,200 364,344 371,700 2.0 1 Mr Davis stepped down from the Board on 27 September 2017 and ceased employment on 31 December 2017.
Non-executive Director fees As reported in last years report, following the biennial review of Non-executive Director fees on 1 June 2017, the annual fees payable to Mr Nicolson were increased from that date by 2,500 to reflect the time commitment and responsibilities associated with his role as Senior Independent Director.
The annual fees payable to each of the other Non-executive Directors remained unchanged.
During the year, the annual fees payable to Mr Nicolson were increased by a further 5,000 to 62,500 per annum to reflect his appointment on 1 January 2018 as Chair of the Good4Business Committee.
No other changes were made during the year to the fees payable to Non-executive Directors.
The current fee structure is as follows: Role Fee Board Chair 250,000 Non-executive Director base fee 52,500 Additional fees for Committee Chair Audit & Risk 10,000 Remuneration 10,000 Good4Business 5,000 Additional fee for Senior Independent Director 5,000 Annual bonus Bonus for the year ended 31 May 2018 In respect of the year ended 31 May 2018, each of the Executive Directors participated in the Annual Bonus Scheme.
Under this scheme, the CEO was eligible to earn a cash bonus of up to 150% of base salary and the CFO and COO were each eligible to earn a cash bonus of up to 125% of base salary.
Any bonus awards earned in excess of 100% of base salary are deferred into Company shares vesting three years after the award is determined, subject to recovery and withholding provisions and continued employment.
For the 2018 financial year, the bonus included challenging financial and strategic targets set to align the Executive Directors with delivering against the Boards approved budget and planning for the year ahead.
As in prior years, and consistent with our KPIs, the performance metrics included profit before tax and exceptional items including separate target and stretch elements and net working capital and operating contribution margin.
Together these financial targets comprised 80% of the overall bonus opportunity.
A number of strategic objectives comprised the remaining 20%of maximum bonus opportunity.

As a result of the above, no bonus was payable to Mr Kanellis or Mr Leigh.
Upon the retirement of Mr Davis, the former COO, on 31 December 2017, his entitlement to any bonus under the scheme wholly lapsed.

No change is to be made to themaximum opportunity and 80% of maximum bonus opportunity will continue to be subject to financial performance with thebalance of 20% subject to the attainment of key strategic and CSR objectives.
The Directors consider that the Groups future targets are matters that are commercially sensitive: they could provide our competitors with insights into our business plans and expectations and should therefore remain confidential to the Company atthis time although they will be retrospectively disclosed in next years Report on Directors Remuneration.
There has been nochange to the level of opportunity available under the Scheme and the principal features of the Scheme are as follows: maximum opportunity remains at 150% of salary for the CEO and 125% of salary for the CFO: any bonus awards earned in excess of 100% of base salary will be deferred into Company shares vesting three years after theaward is determined, subject to recovery and withholding provisions as detailed below and continued employment: annual bonuses will again be based on the achievement of stretching profit before tax and exceptional items 62% of the total bonus, net working capital 9% of the total bonus and operating contribution margin performance targets 9% of the total bonus : the bonus award for delivering target financial performance will remain at 60% of the overall maximum opportunity: 20% of maximum opportunity will be available for delivering strategic objectives with bonuses to be earned against objectives relating to key strategic drivers of growth: strategic NPD and disruptive channel strategy, transformational margin improvement projects, further organisational changes and Good4Business targets in respect of reduction in the use of plastics: and bonuses are payable at the discretion of the Committee and subject to a broad assessment of the Companys overall performance before individual bonus awards are determined.
Awards made under the Annual Bonus Scheme in respect of the year ending 31 May 2019 will be subject to recovery and withholding provisions that would enable the Committee to recover any value overpaid as a result of i a material misstatement of audited results, ii employee misconduct associated with the governance or conduct of the business or iii an erroneous calculation of a performance condition.
The ability to apply these provisions operates for a period of up to two years for awards toExecutive Directors and other senior executives.
Long-term incentive plans Performance Share Plan Executive Directors and certain senior executives are generally eligible to participate in the Performance Share Plan, which provides for the grant of conditional rights to receive nil cost shares subject to continued employment over a three year vesting period and the satisfaction of certain performance criteria established by the Committee.
The current version of the Plan, the 2014 Performance Share Plan, was approved and adopted at the 2014 Annual General Meeting.
Awards vesting in respect of the year ended 31 May 2018 The year ended 31 May 2018 represented the final year of the three year performance period for awards made under the Performance Share Plan in 2015.

These awards are subject to adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS growth targets measured over the single three year performance period commencing on 1 June 2017.
No proportion of the awards may vest unless the Groups adjusted EPS grows by at least 3% per annum compounded over the relevant performance period.
25% of the award will vest where adjusted EPS grows by 3% per annum rising on a straight line prorata basis to 100%, which vests if adjusted EPS grows by 10% per annum or more, in each case compounded over the performance period.
Any awards earned in excess of 100% of salary on grant will vest not at the end of the three year performance period but will be deferred and vest in equal amounts four years and five years after the date of grant.
Face value has been calculated using the average mid-market closing share price on 26 July 2017 of 363.7p, which was the share price used to determine the number of shares subject to the award in accordance with the rules of the Performance Share Plan.
Awards to be granted in the year ending 31 May 2019 The Committee intends to make awards under the Performance Share Plan to Executive Directors and other senior executives during the year ending 31 May 2019 on the same basis as the prior year and in line with the Companys Remuneration Policy.
Award levels remain unchanged from awards made in the prior year and the Committee proposes to continue to make awards subject to the attainment of the same growth in adjusted EPS targets as applied in the prior year.
On that basis, the minimum threshold compound EPS growth target, at which 25% of awards will vest, will accordingly be compound EPS growth of 3% per annum whilst the target for maximum vesting will be compound EPS growth of 10% per annum.
The range of EPS targets was reviewed in light of both internal plans and external expectations for the Companys future performance.
Setting the range to require 3% per annum EPS growth to 10% per annum EPS growth based on the results of the year ended 31May 2018 was considered to provide a demanding range of targets, particularly at the top end of the performance range.
Thiswas on the basis of the continued retail challenges in our UK and European markets at the same time as the ongoing pressures on consumer income in Nigeria.
The Committee has considered the introduction of an additional performance measure but remains of the view that this is not currently appropriate for the Company and that EPS remains the most meaningful measure of long-term performance, providing a valuable line of sight for management and alignment with the interests of shareholders.
Use of EPS growth targets is also aligned with our long-term objective of delivering profitable growth and sustaining a progressive dividend policy.
The Committee will, however, continue to review its approach to metrics and target setting in respect of awards in future years.
The awards to be granted in the year ending 31 May 2019 will be subject to a two-year holding period on vested shares such that all shares other than any shares required to be sold to meet any tax liabilities will need to be retained for a minimum period of 5years from grant.
In line with awards made under the Senior Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, awards made under the Performance Share Plan for the year ending 31 May 2019 will continue to include recovery and withholding provisions that would enable the Committee to recover excess value on vesting as a result of i a material misstatement of audited results, ii employee misconduct associated with the governance or conduct of the business or iii an erroneous calculation of a performance condition.
The provisions apply for a period of up to two years from vesting of awards made to Executive Directors and other senior executives in the event.
