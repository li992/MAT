Henry Birch stepped down from the board on 7 May 2018.
Alan Morgan was appointed to the board on 7 May 2018.
Alex Thursby was appointed to the board on 1 August 2017.
Owen ODonnell stepped down from the board on 19 October 2017.
Taxable benefits comprise car allowance, fuel benefit, and life, long-term disability and private medical insurances, as detailed on page 80.
Unaudited note: The 2014 15 LTIP award was a block award covering three annual awards with no awards made in 2015 16 and 2016 17 and a performance period ending on 30 June 2017.
This structure resulted in a reported LTIP vesting value for 2016 7 once the performance period had finished with no vesting value in 2017 18 or 2018 19.
If this value was spread by reference to the tranches capable of vesting each year, the 2017 18 vesting value would be 148,998 for the finance director reflecting the first tranche that vested on 1 December 2017 based on the average share price for the three months to 30 June 2018 of 2.1787, making his respective 2017 18 total remuneration 519,892.
Henry Birch, the former chief executive, would have 0 because his outstanding awards lapsed upon leaving.
Pension values have been restated as a result of an administrative error.
LTIP vesting values under the 2014 15 LTIP for which the performance period ended on 30 June 2017.
Following the end of the performance period, 37.5% of the total number of shares awarded was capable of vesting, subject to the directors meeting the service requirements, on 1 December 2017, being 515,132 shares for the chief executive and 227,961 shares for the finance director.
The value has been updated in respect of the first tranche that vested on 1 December 2017 to reflect the share price on the date of vesting of 237.8p.
The remaining two tranches will vest, subject to Committee approval, on 1 December 2018 30% and 1 December 2019 25% respectively.
As Henry Birch stepped down from the board during the year, the second and third instalments of his award lapsed in full.
The Committee determined that as Clive Jennings was a good leaver the second and third instalments of his award would vest on 1 December 2018.
Unaudited note: As noted above, the block award structure of the LTIP results in a reported LTIP vesting value for 2016 7 once the performance period has finished with no vesting value in the two subsequent years.
If this value was spread by reference to the tranches capable of vesting each year, the 2016 17 vesting value would be 336,695 for the chief executive and 148,998 for the finance director reflecting the first tranche that vested on 1 December 2017, making their respective 2016 17 total remuneration 1,176,626 and 616,287.
88 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial STATEMENTS Non-executive directors receive fees only, details of which are provided on page 94 together with the non-executive chairmans fees.
These amounts are within the maximum annual aggregate amount of 750,000 currently permitted by the Companys articles of association.
The aggregate total annual amount received by all directors during the year ended 30 June 2018 is shown below: 1 2017 18 2016 17 Executive directors 1,059,200 3,059,504 Chairman and non-executive directors 441,004 418,500 Total 1,500,204 3,478,004 1.
Unaudited note: The aggregate total amount received by the executive directors in 2016 17 includes the total value of the 2014 15 LTIP award.
This LTIP was a block award covering three annual awards with no awards made in 2015 16 and 2016 17 and a performance period ending on 30 June 2017.
This structure results in a reported LTIP vesting value in 2016 17 with no vesting value in the two subsequent years.
If this value was spread by reference to the tranches capable of vesting each year, the aggregate total received by EDs would be 148,998 for 2017 18 i. e. including 30% of the shares that were capable of vesting in connection with the second tranche.
On the same basis, the aggregate adjusted total for 2016 17 would be 2,102,404 i. e. only including the 45% of the shares capable of vesting in connection with the first tranche.
Base salary Audited Salaries were subject to a review during the year with any increases applying from the salary review date, 1 April 2018.
Clive Jennings received a base salary increase of 1.5%, which was in line with increases awarded to the wider workforce albeit lower than the average percentage increase.
John OReilly and Alan Morgan joined the board after the salary review date and therefore their salaries will remain unchanged from appointment until salaries are next reviewed in April 2019: 1 April 2018 1 April 2017 % change Chief executive 500,000 - N A Finance director 319,730 315,000 1.5% Managing director, retail 375,000 - N A The total annual bonus awarded to Alan Morgan was 173,541.

Threshold Target Maximum Payout Pay-out 0% 50% 100% Actual % of max PAT 59.9m 63.0m 69.3m 35.9m 0% Straight line vesting between targets.
Below target performance meant that no payments were made to executive directors under the annual bonus plan on the basis of these financial measures.
However, the Committee has discretion under the Policy, acting fairly and reasonably, to alter the bonus outcome in light of the underlying performance of the Group or an individual, taking account of any factors it considers relevant.
The Committee exercised such discretion in respect of Clive Jennings, finance director, and awarded a discretionary bonus of 10,000 3.13% of salary to reflect his individual performance.
The Committee determined to exercise its discretion to award such bonus to Clive, notwithstanding his departure from the Company on 17 August 2018.
Alan Morgan, managing director, retail, received a bonus which was determined in accordance with the arrangement in which he participated prior to becoming an executive director, and reflects his contribution to the financial performance of the Mecca business during the year under review, which exceeded managements expectations.
On a simple time-pro-rated basis, 25,675 of the annual bonus awarded to Alan relates to the period for which he was an executive director 7 May to 30 June 2018.
