The proposed new Remuneration Policy will be put to a binding vote at the AGM on 21 June 2018.
Pages 112-121 set out full details of the proposed Policy.
Further information on this years outcomes is given in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 106-111.
Overall summary The table on pages 89-91 summarises the following information: the current Remuneration Policy and the Proposed Remuneration Policy: and the operation of the current Policy in 2017 18 and the proposed operation of the new Policy in 2018 19.
Remuneration philosophy This remains unchanged between the current Policy and the new Policy.
The Remuneration Policy and strategy are designed to stimulate sustainable, value creating growth and performance for the business and to reward Executives performance accordingly.
The Companys core principles of remuneration are to support: sustainable long-term value creation: profitable growth and strong cash generation: and attraction and retention of high-calibre individuals.
The Committee will review the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and the Executive Team annually drawing on trends and adjustments made to all employees across the Group and taking into consideration: our business strategy: overall corporate performance: market conditions affecting the Company: the recruitment market in which Saga competes for talent: broader remuneration practices within the Company: and changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
Long-term nature of our proposed Remuneration Policy The graphic below illustrates the time horizons for each of the key elements of our Policy: Key elements of the Policy and time horizon Year ending January 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Base salary Benefits and pension Annual bonus cash Deferred shares Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Shareholding requirement Ongoing All Employee Share Plan Chairman and Non-Executive Director NED fees Key Performance period: Vesting period: Holding period: Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 88 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Details of each of these elements and any proposed changes are included in the table below: Summary table Base salary Current Policy The Remuneration Committee ensures that maximum salary levels are positioned in line with companies of a similar size to Saga in the comparator group.
The companies in the comparator group are the constituents of the FTSE 250.
In general, salary increases for Executive Directors will be in line with the increase for employees.
Operation in 2017 18 Executive Directors received a 2% increase on 1 February 2017 all employee rise 2%.
As a result, the salaries for the Executive Directors are: Lance Batchelor: 689,785 Jonathan Hill: 424,483 Proposed operation Executive Directors will not receive an increase on 1 February 2018 all employee rise 2%.
in 2018 19 As a result, the salaries for the Executive Directors remain as: Lance Batchelor: 689,785 Jonathan Hill: 424,483 Benefits Current Policy The Executive Directors receive family private health cover, death in service life assurance, a car allowance, subsistence expenses and staff discounts in line with other employees.
in 2018 19 Pension Current Policy The maximum contribution to an Executive Directors pension or salary supplement is 20% of gross basic salary.
A salary supplement would not itself be pensionable or form part of salary for the purposes of determining the extent of participation in the Companys incentive arrangements.
Proposed Policy The maximum value of the pension contribution allowance is 15% of gross basic salary for current Executive Directors and limited to 10% of salary for newly appointed Executive Directors.
Operation in 2017 18 Executive Directors received the following: Lance Batchelor: 15% of salary supplement in lieu of pension: Jonathan Hill: 15% of salary supplement in lieu of pension.
in 2018 19 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 89 Governance Remuneration Summary Report continued Annual Bonus Cash and Deferred Shares Current Policy The Remuneration Committee will determine the maximum annual participation in the Annual Bonus Plan for each year, which will not exceed 150% of salary.
The Remuneration Committee can determine that part of the bonus earned under the Annual Bonus Plan is provided as an award of shares under the DBP.
The maximum value of deferred shares is 50% of the bonus earned.
The main terms of these awards are: minimum deferral period of three years: and the participants continued employment at the end of the deferral period unless he she is a good leaver.
Proposed Policy Normal maximum bonus opportunity as a percentage of salary is unchanged: Group Chief Executive Officer 150% Group Chief Financial Officer 125% Operation in 2017 18 The annual bonus is paid in cash and deferred shares.
Two thirds of the total bonus to be paid immediately in cash and one third deferred into shares for three years.
Performance measures were: 1 Group PBT 55% 2 Group cash flow 15% Personal objectives 30% See page 107 for the FY17 18 targets.
Proposed operation No change in policy.
in 2018 19 Performance measures are: 3 Group PBT 55% 2 Group cash flow 15% Personal objectives 30% Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Current Policy LTIP maximum grant is 200% of salary p. a.
Awards will vest at the end of three years subject to the achievement of: EPS performance which ensures the achievement of the annual profit performance targeted by the Annual Bonus Plan flows through to long-term sustainable EPS growth: and TSR performance of the Company compared to the FTSE 250 excluding real estate and equity investment trusts which measures the success of the implementation of the Companys strategy in delivering an above market level of return.
Proposed Policy LTIP awards will be subject to a two year holding period post vesting.
Operation in 2017 18 2017 LTIP award: No change in the LTIP grant levels and no change to the type of performance measures from the 2016 LTIP award.
4 Introduction of a new additional measure of Organic EPS.
A reweighting of the performance measures to reflect the new EPS component as follows: 30% Basic EPS growth of 5% p. a. for 25% of this element of the award to vest with full vesting occurring for EPS growth of 12% p. a: 4 30% Organic EPS growth of 12% p. a. for 25% of this element of the award to vest with full vesting occurring for EPS growth of 21% p. a: 40% Comparative TSR performance the relative TSR comparator group and the vesting schedules for this element are unchanged from the 2016 award.
Proposed operation 2018 LTIP award: in 2018 19 No change in the LTIP grant levels.
Performance measures for the 2018 LTIP will be: Comparative TSR 40%, Organic 4 EPS 30% - growth of 12% p. a. for 25% of this element of the award to vest with full 5 vesting occurring for EPS growth of 21% p. a. ROCE 30% 10.5% p. a. for 25% of this element of the award to vest with full vesting at 11.5% p. a.
See page 92 for rationale behind the change.
Straight line vesting to take place from 25% to 100% of the award.
Introduction of a new two year holding period after vesting for Executive Directors.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 90 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholding Requirement Current Policy The Remuneration Committee has adopted formal shareholding guidelines that will encourage the Executive Directors to build up over a five-year period, and then subsequently hold, a shareholding equivalent to a percentage of base salary.
Group Chief Executive Officer 200% of salary Group Chief Financial Officer 150% of salary Proposed Policy Increase to the minimum shareholding requirements.
Group Chief Executive Officer 250% of salary Group Chief Financial Officer 200% of salary Operation in 2017 18 Group Chief Executive Officer 200% of salary Group Chief Financial Officer 150% of salary Proposed operation Group Chief Executive Officer 250% of salary in 2018 19 Group Chief Financial Officer 200% of salary All Employee Share Plan Current Policy The Company operates a HMRC Share Incentive Plan.
Operation in 2017 18 Saga continued to operate the Share Incentive Plan for all employees in 2017, with a free share award of up to 300 in July 2017 to all eligible employees.
Proposed operation Saga will continue to provide eligible employees the opportunity to participate in in 2018 19 employee equity arrangements.
Chairman & NED Fees Current Policy The fees for Non-Executive Directors are set at broadly the median of the comparator group.
In general the level of fee increase for the Non-Executive Directors will be set taking account of any change in responsibility and will take into account the general rise in salaries across the UK workforce.
Operation in 2017 18 2% rise in line with Group employees for the Chairman fee and Board fee no change in Committee Chair fee or Senior Independent Director fee.
Chairman and Non-Executive fees with effect from 1 June 2017 were: Chairman fee: 286,110 Board fee: 63,672 Committee Chair fee: 10,000 Senior Independent Director fee: 20,000 Proposed operation No increase in the Board fee, Committee Chair fee or Senior Independent Director fee.
in 2018 19 Non-Executive fees will remain from 1 June 2018 as: 6 Chairman fee: 325,000 Board fee: 63,672 Committee Chair fee: 10,000 Senior Independent Director fee: 20,000 Notes: 1 Measured as profit before tax excluding derivatives and the Ogden impact see page 83 of the 2016 17 annual report 2 Defined as net available cash generation 3 Defined as profit before tax excluding derivatives 4 Defined as post-tax profit excluding the effect of reserve releases divided by the fully diluted number of shares in issue 5 Defined as earnings before interest and tax divided by the carrying value of shareholders equity plus long-term liabilities debt 6 This is the fee for the newly appointed Chairman who was appointed after a full market search.
There are no other benefits apart from the fee Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 91 Governance Remuneration Summary Report continued 2018 LTIP performance conditions and targets As part of the strategic business review conducted in the year, the Remuneration Committee considered the performance conditions and targets for the 2018 LTIP award to ensure that they aligned with, and supported, the strategic business plan.
Following the findings of this review, the following changes were proposed: The current weighting of the performance condition for comparative TSR be retained at 40% of the total award.
Maintain the current comparator group FTSE 250 and the vesting schedule.
That the Organic EPS target be maintained at 30% of the award.
This is the EPS element calculated on underlying EPS growth excluding the impact of reserve releases.
We are also proposing that the target range for this metric be maintained at 12% - 21% cumulative growth from Threshold to Maximum.
Removal of the Basic EPS metric in favour of replacing this with ROCE metric which we believe is more aligned with our strategy including heavy investments over the next few years as we invest in systems and ships, for which we expect superior returns.
We propose that the payment range for this ROCE condition be 10.5% - 11.5% between Threshold and Maximum.
The definition of ROCE is the ratio of earnings before interest and tax to shareholders equity plus long-term liabilities debt, expressed as a percentage.
This is a measure of how well a company uses all its sources of long-term financing to generate a profit before tax and interest.
Implementation of a two year holding period for the LTIP grant in 2018 and thereafter.

The indications for the LTIP performance in the table on page 92 are as at 31 January 2018.
The relative TSR target for the 2015 LTIP is substantially but not fully completed as at 31 January 2018.
The EPS target is complete.
The Committee has included the current position for the 2016 and 2017 LTIP awards to allow shareholders to see the potential value in the long-term remuneration over the next three years.
The final level of performance and corresponding level of vesting of the LTIP awards will be dependent on the performance at the end of the relevant performance period.
See the Remuneration Committee Chairs Annual Statement on pages 83-87 for additional details on bonus and LTIP outcomes.
Long-term performance The following chart shows the single figure of remuneration for the Group CEO since IPO compared to the Companys TSR over the same period.
The chart demonstrates that if the one-off buyout award made to the Group CEO on recruitment is excluded, there has been strong correlation between returns to shareholders and the remuneration paid to our Group CEO.
As per regulations, the value of the award was calculated based on quarterly average share price up to the reporting date.
The three month average share price to 31 01 2018 was 146.8p.
The performance period of the TSR element of the award is due to be tested in June 2018.
The value in the table above assumes zero vesting under the TSR element based on performance to year end.
For 2016 17 the final value of the 2014 LTIP award as at vesting date is shown which has been restated from the 2016 17 annual report.
The share price at vesting date of 30 06 2017 was 209.4p 2 Reflects the value of the defined benefit pension accrual in the year and the pension cash supplement.
Pension salary supplement paid to Executive Directors is the difference between the employer contribution into the Saga Pension Scheme and 15% of the Executive Directors base salary For the full single figure table, please see page 106 in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

The elements of remuneration have been categorised into three components: i Fixed: ii Annual Bonus: and iii LTIP.
In addition, for the purposes of comparison we have included the actual single figure remuneration paid in 2017 18.

In addition, dividend equivalents have not been added to deferred share bonus and LTIP share awards.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Saga plc 94 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Pay at risk The charts below set out the elements of the remuneration provided under the Policy which remain at risk.
For example: payment is subject to continuing employment for a period deferred shares and LTIP awards : performance conditions must still be satisfied LTIP awards : or elements are subject to clawback or malus for a period, over which the Company can recover sums paid or withhold vesting.
Figures have been calculated based on target performance fixed elements plus 60% of maximum annual bonus and 60% of the maximum LTIP.
The charts have been based on the same assumptions as set out on page 94 in Illustration and application of the current Remuneration Policy in 2017 18.
Malus is the adjustment of unvested awards in specific circumstances.
Clawback is the recovery of vested awards or payments in specific circumstances.

The one-off IPO share option award for the Group Chief Executive Officer has an exercise price of 185.00p hence there was no gain on this award at 31 January 2018 Unvested LTIP shares and options do not count towards satisfaction of the shareholding guidelines Overall link to remuneration, equity and wealth of the Executive Directors It is the Committees view that it is important when considering the remuneration paid in the year under the single figure to take a holistic view of the Directors total wealth linked to the performance of the Company.
In the Committees opinion, the impact on the total wealth of the Director is more important than the single figure in any one year: this approach encourages Directors to take a long term view of the sustainable performance of the Company: this is critical in a cyclical business.
The ability for the Directors to gain and lose is dependent on the share price performance of the Company at a level which is material to their total remuneration is a key facet of the Companys Remuneration Policy.
The following table sets out the single figure for 2017 18, the number of shares held by the Executive at the beginning and end of the financial year and the impact on the value of these shares taking the opening price and closing price for the year.
Shares held includes those owned outright as well as nil-cost options currently held under incentive plans which have not yet vested.
