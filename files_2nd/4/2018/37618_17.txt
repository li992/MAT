I also wanted to share with you our plans for the salaries of the Core Management Fee PBT bonus targets for 2018 executive directors in 2019.
As indicated last year, as Mark Jones was brought in on a salary more than 20% below his predecessor, Actual 2017 2018 Bonus Actual 2018 it was our intention to keep this under review and, if appropriate Metric Threshold Target Maximum and always subject to continued strong performance, increase it progressively.

A high calibre, motivated workforce, appropriately rewarded for their contributions, is a critical component of our successand the table below illustrates remuneration paid to the executive directors in the context of the wider workforce.
It also includes the CEO ratio, adopted early and calculated according to Option A of the new legislation which comes into effect for reporting periodscommencing from 1January 2019.
The ratio of CEO pay to all three employee data points is significantly lower than in 2017, partially explained by the switch to the new LTIP plan which means no long-term variable pay is included in the single figure for the CEO, as laid out elsewhere in the report.
Bonuses are below last year for both the CEO and the wider UK employee population.

Remuneration outcomes in 2018 3.1 Single total figure of remuneration for executive directors The table below sets out a single figure for the total remuneration received by each executive director for the year ended 31 December 2018 and the prior year.
The threshold, targetand maximum ranges are considered to represent appropriately stretching levels of performance, as explained in detail in the Chairmans statement, and are set by reference to internal budgets and strategic plans, industry backdrop and external expectations.
Thetargets for Core Management Fee PBT and Core Total PBT including adjusted Performance Fee PBT have been adjusted to exclude non-core management fees relating to discontinued business, in order to ensure the directors are incentivised only using stretching targets for metricsover which they have direct control.
2018 has been a year of continued growth building on the exceptional performance delivered in 2017.
Industry-leading growth in net inflows was again delivered and good relative investment performance.
However, the investment environment, for most asset classes, was challenging and this has negatively impacted on absolute performance.

Vested shares are subject to a further two year holding period.
In 2017, the long-term variable remuneration was awarded under the Deferred Executive Incentive Plan which has been replaced by the LTIP.
5 Pension benefits are paid into the Man Group Self-Invested Personal Pension with any contributions exceeding the annual or lifetime allowance paid as cash on a cost neutral basis tothe Company.
6 Other includes non-taxable benefits e. g. life insurance, Group income protection and fund fee rebate.
The fee rebates were higher in 2018 as the scheme only came into force in January 2017 and, therefore, the calculation period was longer in 2018.
7 50% of the bonus is paid in cash with the remaining 50% deferred into Man Group plc shares: when a director achieves their shareholding requirement, up to half the deferral may be into Man Group plc funds and the balance into shares.

The majority of Man Groups direct competitors are unlisted and equivalent information for these firms is not available.
As set out elsewhere in the report, the first performance period for the new LTIP commences on 1January 2019 and 25% of the outcome will be determined by Mans TSR performance compared to the FTSE 250 Index.

5.4 2018 Committee evaluation Following a mid-year review, by the Chairman, of the 2018 priority actions identified in the Committees 2017 evaluation, anindependent external consultant undertook a full year evaluation of the operation and effectiveness of the Committee during 2018.
Thetopics covered included progress on the priorities for 2018 and the conduct and outcomes of specific areas of Committee activity andfocus during the year, including the support and advice available to the Committee.
In the evaluation feedback, the Committee again acknowledged the quality of the advice provided by its advisers and the thorough and professional papers delivered to the Committee to support its decision-making.
The following specific areas of focus were agreed for 2019: deliver the 2018 DRR continue the Committees engagement with shareholders as appropriate to ensure the Committee retains an excellent understanding ofany areas of particular concern or focus and responds accordingly implement and embed the approach to oversight of workforce remuneration for the purposes of taking this into account in determining executive remuneration ensure a robust process exists for explaining to the workforce how executive remuneration aligns with wider company pay policy keep the compensation models below Board level under review keep the remuneration advice and industry knowledge available to the Committee under review as a matter of ongoing good governance 5.5 Benchmarking and peer groups Benchmarking is one of a number of factors considered by the Committee in its deliberations on remuneration as it is important that theCommittee understands the level of remuneration paid by Man Groups competitors for similar positions and which they may be offering in themarket place.
Man Group variously uses three separate peer groups as detailed in the tables below.
A group of asset managers and related businesses listed on the London Stock Exchange: 2.
A group of similar businesses listed on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq: and 3.
Businesses within the privately owned hedge fund industry.
All three of these sources are relevant.

Man Group is one of the few listed companies anywhere in the world that operates inthe hedge fund industry.
The majority of businesses in this industry are privately owned and systematic remuneration data is not publicly available.
Nevertheless, Man competes for talent against these businesses and staff move between Man Group and these private companies.
Man Group operates globally witnessed in the geographic footprint of its operations, the spread of its client base and in the breadth of assets itmanages.
It also creates and distributes a wide range of products: hedge funds, long only funds and quantitative funds.
None of the companies referred to above have these same characteristics and, although some of them are larger than Man Group, the Committee believes that, while they are broadly comparable, Man Group tends to be more diverse geographically and have a wider range of fund strategies.
However, these groups share some of Man Groups characteristics and, in some cases, information regarding the remuneration of directors is publicly available.
The privately owned hedge fund market is made up of a large number of participants, some of them small and single product and others very large.
As noted earlier, little information is available publicly on the compensation quantum and structures in these businesses.
Thesenior management of those few hedge fund companies which are publicly listed are generally the founders of the original private company who retained very significant shareholdings at the time of listing.
Man Group endeavours to make up this gap in publicly available data byreviewing available information on privately owned peers, some of whom are listed in the table above.
Man Group has also obtained direct information about remuneration in those privately held companies that Man Group has acquired.
Interpreting peer group data and benchmarking involves a number of complexities and the Committee looks at this data to provide important market context for its decisions.
Unless otherwise stated, all information in the Directors Remuneration report is unaudited.
