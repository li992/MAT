UNAUDITED INFORMATION Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2019 This section provides an overview of how the Committee is proposing to implement our Remuneration Policy, as set out in the Policy Report, in 2019 for the current Executive Directors.
Base salary Salary details for the current Executive Directors are set out below.
Salary from Salary from Annualised 1 April 2018 1 April 2019 % increase Nick Varney CEO 609,432 621,620 2% Anne-Francoise Nesmes CFO 399,567 407,558 2% The average salary increase for the Merlin UK workforce effective from 1 April 2019 is 2% and both the CEO and CFO will receive this increase, as noted in the Chairmans Statement.
Pension and benefits As in 2018, the current Executive Directors will receive a Company pension contribution worth 25% of salary.
Nick Varney will receive this contribution as a cash allowance and Anne-Francoise Nesmes will receive a contribution to the Group Pension Plan of no more than the minimum annual allowance for pensions of 10,000 and a cash allowance in respect of the balance.
To the extent that a cash allowance is paid, this is reduced by the corresponding amount of employer National Insurance contributions.
They will also receive a standard package of other benefits consistent with those received in 2018.
Annual bonus The structure of the annual bonus plan for 2019 remains broadly consistent with the 2018 plan.
Key features are as follows: The maximum annual bonus potential will be 150% of salary for the CEO and 135% for the CFO.
One-third of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares for three years under The Merlin Entertainments plc Deferred Bonus Plan.
Bonus payments and deferred share awards will be subject to potential withholding or clawback during the three year period following the award of the bonus in exceptional circumstances of evidence coming to light of misconduct justifying summary dismissal or of a material misstatement of the financial accounts or an error in the calculation of the extent of payment or vesting of an incentive.
The Committees discretion includes the ability to adjust bonus awards to ensure they reflect underlying business performance, including health and safety issues.
The annual bonus for 2019 for Executive Directors will be determined as detailed below: Measure as a percentage of maximum bonus opportunity CEO CFO Underlying operating profit 80% 80% Personal objectives 20% 20% Total 100% 100% Following a review of the structure of the plan, the Remuneration Committee has removed the previous dependency of personal objectives on the financial performance in the year in order to better reflect the achievement of medium to longer term goals.
The targets themselves, as they relate to the 2019 financial year, are deemed to be commercially sensitive.
However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next years Directors Remuneration Report to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION MERLIN E NTERTAINME NTS PLC 81 Performance Share Plan Performance Share Plan PSP awards are granted over Merlin shares with the number of shares under award determined by reference to a percentage of base salary.
Vesting of the awards is conditional upon satisfaction of challenging three year performance conditions and is usually also conditional upon continued employment until the awards vest.
In addition, a health and safety underpin is attached to all PSP awards.
This affords the Committee the ability to scale back or cancel awards in the case of a major health and safety incident if it decides it is appropriate to do so.
A similar structure as operated for the 2018 awards is planned to operate for the 2019 awards i. e. awards to Executive Directors at 250% of salary with challenging EPS 40% weighting, ROCE 40% weighting and strategic targets 20% weighting.
With regard to the strategic targets to apply to the Chief Financial Officers award, it is anticipated that these will mirror the form and structure of the strategic targets to apply to wider participants for the 2019 awards as opposed to including a specific element on her commercial role so that the team are similarly aligned to deliver the Companys strategy and the overall approach is simplified.
In light of factors detailed in the Chairmans introductory statement on pages 74 to 75, work remains ongoing as to the range of financial targets to apply to the 2019 awards with the Committees intention being that the targets will remain similarly challenging to those set for the 2018 awards see pages 83 to 84 allowing for the current commercial outlook.
The range of targets set and the operation of the strategic targets for the 2019 awards will be the subject of discussions with our major shareholders and the leading shareholder advisory bodies prior to the grant of the awards at which time the targets will be disclosed i. e. in the market announcement of the awards.
It is expected that full details of next years long term incentive awards will be included in the 2019 Directors Remuneration Report prior to the grant of the awards.
Employee Share Plan Invitations to UK employees including Executive Directors to participate in the Employee Sharesave Plan UK Sharesave Plan have been issued each year from 2014.

Scheme interests awarded during the financial year Performance Share Plan awards An award was granted under the PSP to selected senior executives, including Nick Varney and Anne-Francoise Nesmes, on 11 April 2018.
These awards are subject to the performance conditions described below and will vest on 12 April 2021.
At the date of the Remuneration Report in 2017 the structure of the award to the CFO was subject to review given the new strategic plan and her specific responsibilities.
Including the feedback from extensive consultation with key shareholders, the Committee concluded that the PSP award to the Chief Financial Officer should be set at the same level as the Chief Executive Officer, at 250% of salary increased from 225% of salary.
The increased award level reflected the enhanced role at Merlin of the Chief Financial Officer which includes operational responsibility for the commercial function.
The targets applied to the enhanced award 25% of salary were set exclusively against her commercial responsibilities within the strategic element of the award.

There is no ability to retest any element of the performance targets.
With regard to the Chief Financial Officer, the same structure detailed for the Chief Executive Officer will apply to 50% of her strategic targets i. e. 10% of her total award with the balance subject to the targets relating to her commercial responsibilities.

Statement of Directors shareholding and share interests A shareholding guideline of 200% of base salary by the fifth anniversary of appointment applies to the Executive Directors.
The CEO had a shareholding that exceeded that guideline at 29 December 2018.
The CFO joined in August 2016 and is in the process of building up her shareholding to meet the guideline by her fifth anniversary.
Executive Directors are expected to achieve the shareholding guideline primarily by retaining at least 50% of any share awards that vest under the PSP and the Deferred Bonus Plan after selling sufficient shares to satisfy tax liabilities.
Individuals are expected to be compliant with their shareholding guideline within five years of that individual becoming subject to the guideline.
The Committee reviews ongoing individual performance against the shareholding guideline at the end of each financial year.

1 In accordance with the PSP rules, the Committee has determined that an additional award of shares will be made in respect of shares which vest under PSP awards to reflect the value of dividends which would have been paid on those shares during the vesting period calculated on the assumption that dividends are reinvested in Company shares on a cumulative basis.
The figures in the table above relate to assumed reinvestment of the dividends paid since grant.
As disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts, the performance period for the 1 April 2016 awards was the three financial years to 29 December 2018.
The calculation of the performance conditions is as follows: Adjusted EPS growth by comparing EPS for the financial year ending 29 December 2018 with EPS for the financial year ending 26 December 2015.
TheAdjusted EPS for the financial year ended 26 December 2015 was 17.8 pence.
Average ROCE an average of ROCE for the three individual financial years ending 31 December 2016 53 weeks, 30 December 2017 and 29 December 2018.
The compound annual growth rate of Adjusted EPS over the performance period was 8.8% and the average ROCE was 9.4%.
The performance conditions set out above yield a vesting of 36.5% of maximum.
