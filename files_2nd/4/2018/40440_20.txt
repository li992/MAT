Bonus payments in FY17 were 78% for the CEO and on average 73% for those in the Group Bonus Plan.
In FY18, achievement for the CEO was 0% and for those who are UKbased and in the Thomas Cook Bonus Plan the average payment level will be 22%.
The difference is caused by the operation of the financial hurdles which reduced the calculated bonus of the CEO by 100% but UK based employees received a bonus based on their personal objectives and any segment outcomes albeit that this was reduced by 50% through operation of the financial hurdles.
