DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT Statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee In March 2018, we welcomed Kevin Hostetler as our new Chief Executive and as a Board we are very pleased with the progress that Rotork has made under his leadership.
2018 has delivered robust financial performance, with growth in both order intake and revenues and our Growth Acceleration Programme is performing well.
As our strategy has evolved, so too has our remuneration policy, enabling us to drive a stronger focus on performance and to better align with the market.
In addition to the appointment of Kevin, this has also enabled us to attract and retain talented individuals throughout the organisation.
We consulted widely on the changes that we made to executive remuneration in 2017 and 2018.
Whilst the majority of shareholders remain supportive, we are aware that not all of the Company's shareholders were in favour of all of our proposals.
After the 2018 AGM result, we embarked upon a further Committee members engagement exercise and Sally James, the Senior Independent Gary Bullard Director, and I had meetings with a number of shareholders to Lucinda Bell fully explain the rationale of the decisions taken in 2017 and our 1 Ann Christin Andersen intended approach for 2018 and 2019 including the review of the 1 Tim Cobbold Chairman's fee and the proposed changes to the LTIP rules.
These Sally James meetings also afforded our shareholders the opportunity to raise Peter Dilnot any other concerns they had, and following these useful discussions we have further committed to: 1 Ann Christin Andersen and Tim Cobbold were Improve the level of disclosure provided in the remuneration appointed to the Board in December 2018 and report.

Show restraint in relation to executive salary increases.
Dates of Remuneration Committee meetings Continue to set robust and stretching targets for our incentive plans and provide full and transparent disclosure on the JAN FEB MAR out-turn under such plans.
Adopt other areas of good governance, a number of aspects of which are reflected in the new long-term incentive plan rules that will be put to shareholders for approval at the AGM.
We will continue to maintain an open and transparent dialogue with APR MAY JUN shareholders and welcome any feedback they may wish to provide.
Remuneration in 2018 Bonuses for 2018 were based on annual profit, cash generation, lost time incident rate and individual strategic targets.
In line with JUL AUG SEP our pay for performance philosophy, we set ambitious targets for the annual bonus, particularly in relation to profitability.
The Group has made good progress in 2018 and as a result, the bonus for Kevin Hostetler and Jonathan Davis for 2018 paid out at 113.6% and 90.4% of salary respectively, of which part will be paid in OCT NOV DEC deferred shares.
Full details of the bonus targets and performance against them are set out on pages 76 to 77.
The 2016 LTIP awards which were based on earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR performance over the three years to 31 December 2018 exceeded the threshold performance targets resulting in 79.2% of shares vesting to Jonathan Davis and other members of the senior management team.
Kevin Hostetler, having joined Rotork in 2018, was not a participant in this award cycle.
The Committee values executive share ownership and believes that it ensures a high level of alignment w ith shareholders' interests.
The Company operates a share ownership guideline whereby executive directors are required to maintain a shareholding at least equal to 250% of their base salary.
Details of executive directors' shareholdings are set out on page 80.

The role of the Committee and the Company's remuneration philosophy The policy for the executive directors, which is described later in this report, is aligned with Rotork's overall philosophy on remuneration and operates as an extension of the broader reward framework.
The Remuneration Committee is kept informed of pay conditions across the Company, as well as any material changes to pay policies and practices that have been made or are proposed, and takes this into account when setting executive directors' pay.
In line with the guidance set out in the updated Code, the Committee has reviewed its terms of reference during the year to ensure that they are compliant with governance standards going forward.
The Committee's remit, therefore, has been expanded such that, from 2019, it is responsible for setting pay for all members of the Rotork management board as well as the Chairman and executive directors.
In addition, the Committee will oversee remuneration policies and practices across the workforce, which will be facilitated through regular updates from the Group HR Director.

The policy was approved by shareholders at our AGM on 28 April 2017 and is intended to remain in place for three years.
Shown below is the policy in full, as approved by shareholders, updated where appropriate to reference how the policy will be applied in 2019.
Role of the Remuneration Committee The principal role of the Remuneration Committee is to determine the framework and policy for remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman, ensuring that remuneration levels are sufficient but not excessive in order to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to successfully run the Company.
The full terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee can be found on the Company's website at www.
com en investors index committees.
Key responsibilities include: Within the approved policy, determining individual remuneration packages for the Chairman and executive directors, including the terms of any discretionary share schemes in which executive directors may be invited to participate, taking account of the level of remuneration for other Rotork management board members and being aware of remuneration conditions throughout the Group.
Agreeing the terms and conditions to be included in service agreements for executive directors, including termination payments.
Selecting, appointing and setting terms of reference with any remuneration consultants who may advise the Remuneration Committee.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company The Remuneration Committee is sensitive to employee remuneration conditions in the Group and in determining remuneration takes account of Group remuneration conditions.
The Remuneration Committee invites the Group HR Director to its meetings to provide, amongst other things, details of employee remuneration conditions and metrics, such as pay rises awarded to employees to inform the Remuneration Committee's decision making.
The Remuneration Committee also monitors internal relativities and pay ratios to ensure that they remain appropriate.
Consideration of shareholder views In formulating the Policy Report, the Remuneration Committee takes into account guidance issued by shareholders, their representative bodies and proxy agencies including the Investment Association and Institutional Shareholder Services.
The Remuneration Committee also takes into consideration any views expressed by shareholders during the year including at the AGM and encourages an open dialogue with its largest shareholders.
Major shareholders are consulted in advance about changes to the Policy Report or any significant proposed changes to the way in which it is implemented.

Performance measures Performance measures are used to determine the extent of any awards made under the variable elements of the executive directors' remuneration mix, being the annual bonus and the LTIP.
The performance measures used are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The performance measures are selected because of their use as key performance indicators KPls to assess Company performance and to align the interests of the directors to those of the shareholders.
Non-financial KPls constitute part of the annual bonus award and these are selected to ensure that performance measured by financial KPls is not delivered at the expense of important.
"z l z "" Clawback and malus The payment of any bonus is at the ultimate discretion of the Remuneration Committee and the Remuneration Committee also retains an E absolute discretion to reclaim or withhold some, or all, of any annual bonus paid in exceptional circumstances, such as misstatement of results, an error in the calculation of the performance targets and or award size and gross misconduct."
m z.... V, In terms of the LTIP, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to reclaim some, or all, of a vested LTIP award in exceptional circumstances the categories for clawback being the same as for the annual bonus plan.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee may lapse or reduce an award prior to vesting where the participant is found to be guilty of serious misconduct.
Differences between the Policy Report and the policy on employee remuneration The Board recognises that it is appropriate for a significant proportion of executive directors' remuneration to be contingent on the performance of the Group, and that such remuneration is at risk subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions.
Consequently, executive directors and other senior managers are invited to participate in the LTIP where shares awarded will vest 0 contingent upon performance conditions over a three-year period.
"Executive directors and other senior managers are also invited to "" :::: participate in the annual bonus scheme wh ich will result in a bonus payment being made if targets are achieved, part of which for z executive directors may be deferred in shares."
"- z 0 For employee remuneration, employees share in the success of the Group through a profit based bonus plan w hich is inked to the ""' :::: performance of their business unit, Group performance and their own individual performance."
This is coupled with the opportunity, for eligible employees, to receive free shares from the Company, paid from the Company's profits.
6 z ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 73 DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Approach to recruitment remuneration Base salary levels will be set in accordance with the Policy Report, taking into account the experience and calibre of the individual and their existing remuneration package.
Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, a series of increases to salary may be given over subsequent years subject to individual performance.
Benefits will generally be provided in accordance with the Policy Report, with relocation expenses an expatriate allowance paid for if necessary.
The structure of the variable pay element will be in accordance with the Policy Report.
The maximum aggregate variable pay opportunity under the policy is up to 275% of salary.
Different performance measures may be set initially for the annual bonus, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial year that the executive joined.
In the case of an external hire, it may be necessary to buy-out incentive pay or benefit arrangements which would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer.
This would be provided for taking into account the form cash or shares and timing and expected value i. e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria of the remuneration being forfeited.
Replacement share awards, if used, may be granted using Rotork's existing share plans to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms of grant.
Fees for a new Chairman or non-executive director will be set in line with the Policy Report.
Service contracts and policy on payments for loss of office Under the executive directors' service contracts, up to 12 months' notice of termination of employment is required by either party.
Should notice be served, the executive directors can continue to receive basic salary, benefits and pension for the duration of their notice period during which time the Company may require the individual to continue to fulfil their current duties or may assign a period of garden leave.
The Company applies a general principle of mitigation in relation to termination payments and the service contracts expressly include the use of monthly phased payments following termination in lieu of notice which can be reduced to the extent that alternative remunerated employment is found.
The service contracts also enable the Company to elect to make a payment in lieu of notice equivalent in value to 12 months' base salary only.
In the event of cessation of employment, the executive directors may still be eligible for a bonus at the discretion of the Committee, on a pro-rata basis for the period of time served from the start of the financial year to the date of termination and not for any period in lieu of notice.
Different performance measures to the other executive directors may be set for the bonus for the period up until departure, as appropriate, to reflect changes in responsibility.
Any unvested shares held under the deferred annual bonus plan will ordinarily vest on the normal vesting date, save where the departure is as a result of summary dismissal, in which case the awards will lapse on cessation of employment.
The Remuneration Committee may also determine that the shares shall vest on an earlier date including the date of cessation if the Remuneration Committee, in its discretion, considers that the circumstances of the cessation merit early vesting of the awards.
The rules of the LTIP set out what happens to awards if a participant leaves employment before the end of the vesting period.
Generally, any unvested LTIP awards will lapse when an executive director leaves employment except in certain circumstances.
If the executive director ceases to be employed as a result of death, injury, retirement, transfer of employment or any other analogous reason, they may be treated as a 'good leaver' under the plan rules.
The shares for a good leaver will vest subject to an assessment of performance, with a pro-rata reduction to reflect the proportion of the vesting period served.
Awards for a good leaver may then vest on the normal vesting date, unless the Remuneration Committee determines that they should vest early for example, following the death of the participant.
In determining whether an executive director should be treated as a good leaver and the extent to which their award may vest up to the pro-rated amount, the Remuneration Committee will take into account the circumstances of an individual's departure.
Outplacement services and reimbursement of legal costs may be provided where appropriate.
Any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination would be paid as necessary.
Any legacy benefits under the Company's defined benefit pension schemes will be allowed to be paid under the terms of those schemes and as set out in the Policy Report.
Outstanding share awards would ordinarily vest early on a change of control of the Company.
In the case of unvested awards under the LTIP, performance would be measured to the date of control with a pro-rata reduction to reflect the proportion of the vesting period served.
The Chairman and non-executive directors do not have service contracts, they serve under letters of appointment and are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM.
The term of appointment for non-executive directors and the Chairman is three years and their appointments are subject to termination on three months' notice 12 months for the Chairman.
In the event of the termination of their position, they are entitled to reimbursement of any outstanding fees and expenses due.
74 ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Illustration of the application of the Policy Report The charts below illustrate how the remuneration policy would function for minimum, on-target and maximum performance for 2019 for each executive director.
In addition, the fourth bar illustrates the value of total remuneration should both the annual bonus and LTIP pay out in full, and if LTIP awards are subject to 50% share price appreciation over the relevant period.

Taxable benefits are shown as the cost to the Company of supplying those benefits for the year ending 31 December 2018.
On-target performance, for illustrative purposes, assumes achievement of 60% of the maximum available bonus and threshold LTIP vesting 13.
Maximum performance assumes achievement of the maximum bonus and full vesting of the LTIP shares.
The LTIP grant level is 150% for Kevin Hostetler and 125% for Jonathan Davis.

iii The 2018 figures relate to the vesting of the 2016 LTIP award based on performance to 31 December 2018.
These awards are not eligible to vest until March 2019 and as such an indicative share price of 279p being the average closing share price over the three-month period to 31 December 2018 has been used for the purpose of valuing these awards.
This value will be restated in next year's report.

m z.... LTIP awards vesting based on performance to 31 December 2018 audited V, The Company's LTIP rewards the creation of shareholder value which is a strategic priority.
Performance is measured over a three-year period using a combination of EPS, TSR compared to a comparator group, and a capital return measure for the 2017 LTIP awards onwards.
The LTIP awards granted on 6 March 2016 were based on performance to 31 December 2018 and were subject to the following performance targets: Measure Weighting Performance period Threshold target' Stretch target' Performance outcome Earnings per share 50% 01 01 2016 9% 35% EPS performance of 22.3% was above the - 31 12 18 15% vesting 100% vesting threshold target resulting in 58.4% vesting for this part of the award.

ii Vesting if the minimum performance EPS, TSR and capital return economic profit conditions are achieved.
The three equally-weighted performance measures are: a.
Earnings per share - EPS growth must be at least 9% for 15% vesting, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for EPS growth of 35% and above: b.
Total shareholder return - measured relative to the constituents of the FTSE 350 Industrial Goods and Services Sector, 25% vesting for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance and above: and c. Capital return economic profit - measures the extent to which a post-tax return in excess of the weighted average cost of capital WACC is created, rewarding management for increasing levels of economic profit, on a cumulative basis, over the three-year performance period.
No payout will be received for a negative economic profit.
The threshold target requires average economic profit over the three-year period to exceed that generated in 2017 and the maximum target has been set such that it will require double digit growth in post-tax profits alongside improved balance sheet efficiencies.
Details of the exact targets are considered by the Remuneration Committee to be commercially sensitive.
However, full details of the targets and how economic profit has been calculated will be disclosed on vesting.

CEO pay ratio disclosure Although it is not compulsory to include a CEO pay ratio in the annual report on directors' remuneration, now that the statutory calculation method has been set out in legislation, we include this below.
Year Method 25th percentile pay ratio Median pay ratio 75th percentile pay ratio 2018 Option B 49:1 45:1 33:1 Option B has been used for the calculation of the pay ratio.
Under this method, the latest gender pay gap data has been used to identify on an indicative basis three UK employees at 25th, median and 75th percentile.
This methodology has been chosen as the data is readily available and avoids the challenge in collecting and verifying accurately the variable pay elements for all UK employees across many subsidiaries in the short period of time available.
To provide further context, the table below shows the CEO and the employee percentile pay used to determine the 2018 pay ratios.

The targets will be based on adjusted underlying EPS i. e. excluding the impact of any material restructuring costs.
However, the Remuneration Committee will use its discretion to increase the targets as appropriate, to take into account the Board's expected return on any restructuring investment during the period.
33% will be based on a capital return measure economic profit.
The threshold target will require the average economic profit over the three-year period to exceed that generated in 2018 and the maximum target has been set such that it will require double digit growth in post-tax profits alongside improved balance sheet efficiencies.
