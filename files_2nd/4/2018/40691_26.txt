Pay for performance scenarios The charts overleaf provide an illustration of the potential future reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under four different performance scenarios: Minimum, On-target, Maximum and Maximum including the impact of a 50% share price appreciation on LTIP awards.
Potential reward opportunities are based on Unites remuneration policy, applied to the base salaries effective 1 March 2019.
The annual bonus and LTIP are based on the maximum opportunities set out under the remuneration policy for normal circumstances: being 140% of salary and 200% of salary respectively.
Note that the LTIP awards granted in a year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value is based on the face value at award rather than vesting i. e. the scenarios exclude the impact of any share price movement over the period.
The exception to this is the last scenario which, in line with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code, illustrates the maximum outcome assuming 50% share price appreciation for the purpose of LTIP value.

The on-target scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus bonus payout of 70% of salary and LTIP threshold vesting at 25% of maximum award.
The maximum scenario is shown on two bases: excluding and including the impact of share price appreciation on the value of LTIP outcomes.
In both cases, the scenario includes fixed remuneration and full payout of all incentives 140% of salary under the annual bonus and 200% of salary under the LTIP, with the final scenario also including the impact of a 50% increase in Unites share price on the value of the LTIP in effect valuing this element of pay at 300% of salary.
Approach to recruitment remuneration External appointment to the Board In the cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director from outside the Company, the Remuneration Committee may make use of all the existing components of remuneration, as follows: Maximum annual Component Approach grant value Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and their current basic salary.
Where new appointees have initial basic salaries set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period of two to three years subject to the individuals development in the role.
Pension New appointees will receive company pension contributions or an equivalent cash supplement aligned to that offered to a majority of employees across the Group at the time of appointment.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may include but are not limited to the provision of a company car or cash alternative, private medical insurance and any necessary relocation expenses.
SAYE New appointees will also be eligible to participate in all-employee share schemes.
Performance The structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant maximum being 140% of salary Related pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year.

LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other executives, as described in the 300% of salary policy table.
The normal aggregate limit of 200% of salary will apply, save in exceptional circumstances where up to 300% of salary may be awarded.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both Unite and its shareholders.
The Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer on a like-for-like basis, which may be awarded in addition to the remuneration structure outlined in the table above.
In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including time to vesting, any performance conditions attached to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met.
Any such buy-out awards will typically be made under the existing annual bonus and LTIP schemes, although in exceptional circumstances the Committee may exercise the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.

Any buy-out awards would have a fair value no higher than the awards forfeited.

Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company When making decisions on Executive Director remuneration, the Committee considers pay and conditions across Unite.
Prior to the annual salary review, the Group People Director provides the Committee with a summary of the proposed level of increase for overall employee pay.
Currently, the Remuneration Committee does not formally consult with employees on the executive remuneration policy and framework.
Consideration of shareholder views During 2018, the Remuneration Committee consulted with investors representing around two-thirds of Unites issued share capital and with proxy advisors Glass Lewis, the Investment Association and ISS to seek their views on the proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy, as well as remuneration at Unite more broadly.
The Committee is grateful for investors taking the time to participate in the consultation and we welcome the positive and constructive feedback received.
The Committee used the direct feedback, along with updates to investor body principles published around the time of the review, to refine and further develop the final proposals.
We are confident that these proposals reflect the developments in best practice while also supporting Unite in attracting, retaining and motivating the Executive Directors and other senior employees.
The Committee will continue to monitor trends and developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the structure of the executive remuneration remains appropriate.

Incentive outcomes for the year ended 31 December 2018 audited Performance Related Annual Bonus in respect of 2018 performance The 2018 annual bonus consists of two elements, corporate and individual.
The corporate element of the bonus is calculated on a sliding scale up to a maximum of 120% of base salary, in accordance with which on target performance by the Group results in a corporate bonus of an amount equivalent to 70% of base salary.
To determine the actual bonus payment to an Executive Director, a multiplier being the individual element of the scheme, ranging between zero and 1.2, is applied against the corporate bonus.
Applying the maximum individual multiplier of 1.2, against the maximum corporate bonus of 120% of base salary, results in a maximum annual performance-related bonus opportunity of 144% of base salary.
However, bonus payments at that level would only be made subject to the achievement of extremely stretching corporate performance targets and exceptional individual performance by the relevant Director.
Target performance typically requires meaningful improvement on the previous years outturn, and, for financial measures, targets are typically in line with the upper end of market consensus.
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 87 Corporate governance ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED The performance-related bonuses awarded in respect of 2018 reflect corporate bonuses of 97.3% of base salary.
After applying individual multipliers, actual performance-related bonus payments awarded to the Executive Directors were 107.0% of their respective base salaries 74.3% of their maximum bonus opportunities.
