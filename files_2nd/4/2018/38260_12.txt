Governance Directors Remuneration Report 2018 Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for 2018.
I would like to take this opportunity to provide you with an overview of the principal work of the Committee during 2018 and to provide the context in which decisions were taken by the Committee.
The Committee believe that the management team have again excelled in delivering a further period of continuing growth for the Company during a period of significant internal transformation and integration.
Our strategy continues to be centred on increasing capacity, growing our capabilities and expanding our geographic reach, and continues to deliver significant and sustainable long-term growth.
In 2018, we delivered against these strategic objectives through the expansion of our market position beyond the UAE.
The number of patients attending group facilities in FY2018 grew to 7.5m.
The Groups expansion has also resulted in the number of countries in which we now operate increasing to 19.
In addition, management have, alongside seeking expansion opportunities, focused significantly on operational and financial structures in order that the Company continues to improve the operational efficiency of our facilities, extracting additional value out of both our acquired and legacy assets and therefore maintaining a very disciplined approach to EBITDA growth.
In this context the Remuneration Committee has worked over 2018 to ensure that remuneration policies and practices support the Companys strategy and promote long-term sustainable success.
Accordingly, several key decisions were taken during the year, as summarised below.
Key remuneration decisions Maintenance of an approach of restraint over 2018, continuing that of 2017, in making no adjustment to Directors remuneration.
Adjustment upwards of the LTIP targets governing vesting for 2019 awards.
Introduction of an additional underpin for 2019 LTIP awards, requiring a conversion of EBITDA to net income hurdle to be met.
Inclusion of more transparent disclosure in respect of adjustments made for material corporate events, with the aim being STIP and LTIP targets will be no easier or stretching by virtue of corporate activity.
Introduction of a holding period under the LTIP.
Introduction of more definitive malus and clawback provisions.
These points are discussed further in this years Remuneration Report and I anticipate they will be viewed positively by shareholders.
Corporate Governance As noted in our Corporate Governance Report, the FRC published a revised UK Corporate Governance Code in 2018 new Code which applies to NMC with effect from our 2019 financial year.
The Committee has considered the new Code and determined during 2018 how the new provisions will be implemented.
Apart from influencing the key remuneration decisions outlined, in response to the new Code we have made some changes as well as identified areas for further development.
These include: While the Committee has always had oversight, it now formally approves remuneration for the executive committee, in addition to the Executive Directors.
We have reviewed our incentive award documentation to ensure the Committee has full discretion to adjust pay outcomes where the formulaic outcome may not be in shareholders interests.
Implemented a holding period to apply for 2019 LTIP awards onwards.
In reviewing Executive Director remuneration, the Committee initiated a process for ensuring it will have access to broader information around pay policies and practices across the Company.
Given the acquisition of Aspen Healthcare, NMC will comply with the requirement to publish information on the pay ratio of the Chief Executive to UK employees in our 2019 annual report.
62 NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Group Strategic Financial Other Overview Report Governance Statements Information 2018 Performance 2018 was another year of strong performance.
We successfully delivered EBITDA of US$487.4m, a growth of 37.9%, on a revenue base that grew 28.3% over 2017 to US$2.06bn.
EBITDA margin also improved by 170bps to 23.7% and Adjusted Net Profit by 19.9% from US$236.6m to US$283.6m.
Quality measures are also key to a healthcare business, and we are proud that we have 7 JCI accredited hospitals across the Group and these facilities continue to achieve excellent ratings against JCI performance measures.
Executive Remuneration in 2018 and 2019 Notwithstanding the Companys performance, the Committee is acutely conscious of how executive remuneration remains under close scrutiny in the public arena and we therefore carefully consider how our executives are paid.
While our performance justifies the incentive outcomes detailed below, we believe the Committee continues to exercise restraint and apply good corporate governance in its remuneration decisions which is evidenced in the following ways: CEO Salary Remains Unchanged No change to the Chief Executive Officers base salary or other Executive Directors.
Prasanth Manghat assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer in March of 2017 and, along with the rest of the management team, has made an outstanding contribution to the Companys success.
Despite this promotion and associated increase in his role scope, the Committee has not made any adjustment to his fixed or variable remuneration since 1 January 2017.
As a result his base salary continues to be less than that paid to the previous CEO in 2016.
Benefit levels The majority of employees and Senior Management that the Group employs are ex-patriate employees living and working away from their home country.
Remuneration packages for employees, in our primary markets are therefore structured accordingly.
The Executive Directors have similar benefit arrangements available to them, but have chosen not to take the primary benefit being an accommodation allowance.
The Committee is also aware that, unlike the situation in many other companies, the Company does not provide pension benefits to its employees or its Executive Directors.
The level of benefits paid to the Executive Directors is therefore modest in comparison to typical UK practice.
STIP and LTIP adjustments The Committee is aware from its consultation with shareholders of the concern for greater transparency in adjustments to STIP and LTIP targets to take account of material events.
The Committee accepts that investors will expect targets to be adjusted in the event of a material acquisition which was not envisaged or implied in the original targets.
They would expect either the targets to be increased to reflect the additional contribution or that additional contribution to be adjusted out of the metric used for performance assessment.
The application of this policy has led to two adjustments in the last year in relation to the 2018 STIP which are disclosed within this Directors Remuneration Report.
In addition, adjustments made to existing LTIP awards and the adjustment made in relation to the 2016 LTIP awards which vest in March 2019, are also set out within this Report.
2018 STIP achievement Given the excellent performance of the Group, further details of which are provided in the business overview and financial review sections on pages 13 and 19 of this annual report, and taking account of the adjustments to targets made by the Committee during the year, the Remuneration Committee has approved the maximum entitlement of bonus opportunity for each of the Executive Directors.
We have provided a detailed summary of the measures and targets associated with these STIP outcomes on pages 68 to 69.
2016 LTIP Award vesting In respect of vesting under the 2016 LTIP, performance was assessed against three-year relative TSR and three-year compound annual growth in EPS.
Our TSR for this period was 296.4% significantly ahead of the peer group median and upper quartile of 11.8% and 41.5% respectively with compound annual growth in EPS of 15.81% following significant adjustment for acquisitions.
This strong level of performance has, unsurprisingly, resulted in 100% of the 2016 LTIP awards vesting.
NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 63 Governance Directors Remuneration Report 2018 continued Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman continued Executive Remuneration in 2018 and 2019 continued 2019 LTIP awards Having reviewed and amended LTIP measures in 2018 following shareholder consultation in early 2018, the Committee has decided not to amend for 2019 the measures it uses to incentivise management over the longer term through the Companys LTIP arrangements.
However, the Committee is making the following changes to the LTIP awards it makes for 2019: Increase in the EBITDA growth performance requirement for 2019 LTIP awards from 5% 15% to 10% to 18% CAGR at threshold and maximum respectively: Introduction of an additional underpin capturing the conversion of EBITDA to net income, to provide shareholders with an aggregate view on earnings, cash flow, and capital efficiency.
Failure to meet the underpin will reduce the proportion of the award vesting by up to 50%: and Addition of a 2 year holding period which follows the performance period during which LTIP awards may not be exercised by participants.
In addition, any leavers will normally be subject to the holding period, effectively applying a post-cessation guideline.
The Committee believes that these changes, alongside base salaries and incentive opportunities remaining unchanged, is evidence of sound governance principles and restraint in the application of the remuneration policy at a time when good performance and growth continues.
Shareholder Feedback The Committee engaged with key shareholders over the course of 2018.
This process, along with the new Code, influenced the Committees decision making as outlined above.
The Companys existing Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders on 29 December 2016 and therefore a new Remuneration Policy will be put before shareholders by 29 December 2019.
The Company intends to consult with larger shareholders in relation to the new Policy in H2, 2019 prior to submitting a new Policy for approval by shareholders before the end of 2019.
For this reason, the Committee is not planning any shareholder consultation in advance of the 2019 AGM.
I am, of course, available to discuss any Remuneration matters with shareholders at any time should they so wish.
As we look to 2019, and beyond, we remain committed to delivering continued long-term sustainable growth.
We look forward to shareholders support by voting in favour of the Directors Remuneration Report at the 2019 AGM.

The Remuneration Committee in 2018 Details of the members of the Committee during the 2018 financial year, and its role and responsibility within the Groups Board and governance structure, is set out on pages 54 to 55 of the Governance report.
Principal matters considered in 2018 The Committee met formally four times during the year.
Principal items discussed by the Committee included: Review of varying elements of remuneration for Executive Directors and Senior Management following shareholder consultation and feedback in early 2018, including changes to the Companys LTIP target measures: Adjustment of 2018 STIP targets and review of LTIP award targets to reflect the change in the Group as a result of acquisitions to ensure performance targets are measured on a like for like basis: Approval of a new holding period under which all future LTIP awards, 2019 onwards, would not be able to be exercised for a period of two years following the initial three year performance period: Consideration of post-employment shareholding in light of the new holding period: and Review of the requirements of the updated UK Corporate Governance Code which is effective for accounting periods beginning or after 1 January 2019.
This included a review of incentive plan documentation to ensure discretion could be applied to override formulaic outcomes, and for clearly defined malus and clawback provisions to apply.
66 NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Group Strategic Financial Other Overview Report Governance Statements Information Support and External Advice The Remuneration Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers when discussing and setting Executive Director and Senior Management salary levels.
Deloitte was appointed by the Remuneration Committee and acted as advisors to the Company since 2012.
The Committee have reviewed and considered Deloittes independence, and consider them to be independent advisers to the committee notwithstanding that Deloitte, as an international firm, provide the following services to the group: Some tax advisory services to the Group in Spain: Internal Auditors to our IVF businesses, Clinica Eugin and Fakih IVF: and Transaction services and accounting advice to the Group in the UAE, both before and after some of the Groups acquisitions.
It was noted that none of this advice has related to remuneration matters in the Group, all teams providing these services are based in countries other than the UK where the remuneration advisory team are based and none of these teams have any connection with the engagement partner and team advising the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice they have received from Deloitte during the year has been objective and independent and that the Deloitte LLP engagement partner and team, which provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with NMC that might impair their independence.
The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.
Deloitte are signatories to the remuneration consultants group code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
The Remuneration Committee has direct access to Deloitte as and when required.
The Group Company Secretary liaises with Deloitte where necessary to ensure that all Committee requests and decisions are dealt with and implemented, but does so under the guidance of the Remuneration Committee Chairman.
Deloitte attend meetings of the Committee as required.
Deloitte received fees of 75k charged on a time plus expenses basis for advice received during the year.
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group The remuneration philosophy is the same throughout NMC in that individuals should be remunerated based on their role, responsibilities, experiences and market practice.
NMC has a variety of different roles from senior executives, to doctors and nurses and to administrators and support staff, and therefore remuneration levels and structures vary to reflect the different requirements, expectations and geographic locations of these roles, particularly having in mind the large proportion of ex-patriate employees working in the Group.
The Committee does consider that it is important, however, that Executive Directors and senior executives as a group are remunerated in a similar way to ensure that they are incentivised to collectively deliver the Groups strategy and create long term value for shareholders.
Going forward, the Committee will be updated annually on how broader workforce remuneration and related policies align with the culture of NMC, and review this when deciding on executive remuneration matters.
Results of voting on Remuneration matters at General Meetings of the Company The following summarises voting in relation to the approval of the respective Directors Remuneration Reports at both the Annual General Meeting in 2017 and 2018: Number of Meeting date Resolution Resolution type For Against votes withheld 23 May 2017 To approve the Directors Remuneration Report Advisory 71.36% 28.64% 255,623 28 June 2018 To approve the Directors Remuneration Report Advisory 92.6% 7.4% 3,804 The Committee believes that its consultation with shareholders in early 2018 helped to explain the Committees approach to Executive remuneration and allowed the Committee to take note of the views of the larger institutional investors in development of its 2018 Executive remuneration proposals.
The vote for the Directors Remuneration Policy increased significantly at the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 67 Governance Directors Remuneration Report 2018 continued 2018 remuneration this section is subject to audit This section outlines how the remuneration policy was applied in 2018, together with the outcomes for actual remuneration paid in relation to the financial year under review.
This is shown in two parts Remuneration paid to Executive Directors and a separate section in relation to Non-Executive Directors.
Executive Director Remuneration 2018 Remuneration paid in 2018 single pay figure The table below sets out the remuneration paid to or received by each Executive Director of the Company who served during the financial year ended 31 December 2018.
2 The value shown in the 2017 LTIP awards column is the awards which vested during 2018 and are valued using the execution share price on the respective dates of vesting.
3 The value shown in the 2018 LTIP column is the award which will vest on 15 March 2019.
As it is not possible to provide an actual value attributable to these shares, the value shown above is calculated by reference to the average closing share price of the Company in the Quarter ended 31 December 2018, which was 3,256p per share.
4 Participants also receive additional shares equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period on any shares that vest.
Therefore included in 2017 and 2018 LTIP values above are the value of such shares received or to be received.
Base salaries The base salaries of the Chief Executive Officer during the year was $1.0m AED 3.798m per annum, which was set effective from 1 January 2017.
The base salaries for the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of $685k AED 2.518m and $650k AED 2.390m per annum respectively, were set from their date of appointment as Directors.
The base salaries of the Executive Directors were unchanged during the 2017 and 2018 financial years.
Benefits There was no change to the structure of benefits available to the Executive Directors during the year.
The Benefits paid included the following items: Annual family return flights to Provision of family accommodation Private medical insurance home country $'000 $'000 $'000 Executive Director 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Prasanth Manghat 0.0 0.0 4.0 4.4 15.0 15.2 Khalifa Bin Butti 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Hani Buttikhi 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Outcome of the 2018 STIP The level of STIP award is determined by the Committee based on NMCs performance and where relevant individual Directors performance.
For the purpose of the 2018 annual bonus, the Executive Directors were eligible for maximum bonus awards as follows: Chief Executive Officer: 200% of salary: Executive Vice Chairman: 175% of salary: Chief Investment Officer: 150% of salary.
68 NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Group Strategic Financial Other Overview Report Governance Statements Information Adjustment of STIP targets The Committee reviewed the 2018 STIP targets twice during the financial year to take account of material acquisitions and investments.
The first adjustment was made following acquisitions and additional investments made in January 2018 with a further adjustment made later in the financial year to take account of improved performance of the Group in the second half of the financial year.
In this respect the EBITDA target and stretch levels were increased to $445m and $475m respectively from the original targets of $425m and $435m at target and stretch respectively.
There were no adjustments made to the remaining targets or underpins.
The Committee also considered the acquisition of Aspen Healthcare completed towards the end of August 2018.
Given the timing of such acquisition and the fact that the contribution from that business in the 2018 financial year is not material, the Committee decided to exclude the results of Aspen from both the EBITDA and EBITDA margin targets and performance achievement for the year.
For the year ended 31 December 2018, the Committees assessment of outcomes against the revised targets are set out below.
Performance Measures and targets Weighting Underlying targets Chief Chief Executive Executive Investment Target Maximum Actual Payout % of Measure Officer Vice Chairman Officer Threshold revised revised performance maximum EBITDA 50% 33.3% 33.3% US$415m US$445m US$475m US$489.4m 100% EBITDA Margin 50% 33.3% 33.3% 22.6% 23.6% 24.2% 24.43% 100% Operations & Management Revenue 33.3% US$15m US$19m US$23m US$23m 100% Corporate Development Revenue and cost US$9m US$11m US$13m US$17m synergies 33.3% US$4m US$6m US$8m US$8m 100% As set out in our 2017 Directors Remuneration Report, three underpins central to the Companys quality performance and patient growth must be met before any STIP amount is payable.
For 2018, these underpins and their achievement are summarised below.
Facility quality performance The Company maintains a zero tolerance approach to quality.
All facilities undergoing an accreditation process must pass that process.
In 2018, 2 facilities passed re-accreditation surveys with results significantly ahead of those required by JCI.
Growth in patient numbers Growth in patient numbers aligns with our focus on efficient growth.
For 2018, the Company delivered a growth in patient numbers from existing facilities of 13% against a requirement of 8%.
Occupancy levels Again aligning with the Companys focus on efficient growth, a minimum occupancy level of 60% was established for 2018.
On this basis the Committee has determined that the STIP outcomes above are supported by strong performance in our core underpins.
As such, the Committee approved the following pay-outs for the Executive Directors, with one-third of each award achieved being paid in cash with two-thirds delivered in the form of a deferred share award, which vests equally after periods of one year and two years: 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer 100% of maximum opportunity : 175% of base salary for the Executive Vice Chairman 100% of maximum opportunity : and 150% of base salary for the Chief Investment Officer 100% of maximum opportunity NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 69 Governance Directors Remuneration Report 2018 continued 2018 remuneration this section is subject to audit continued Long Term Incentive Plan Performance in relation to LTIP Awards made in 2016 The Remuneration Committee has reviewed performance against the targets set for LTIP grants made in 2016.
50% of the award was subject to an earnings per share EPS growth performance condition, whilst the remaining 50% of the award was based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return relative to a bespoke comparator group.
A significant adjustment was made to the base year earnings figure when calculating compound annual growth in earnings per share.
The Committees intention in doing so was to ensure the earnings per share target remains comparably stretching as when the awards were made.
Threshold Maximum Measure 25% vesting 100% vesting Actual performance Level of vesting 1 Earnings Per Share 6% p. a. growth 15% p. a. growth 15.81% 100% 2,3 Total Shareholder Return Median Upper quartile or 296.4% 100th 100% above percentile 1 Straight line vesting between threshold and maximum.
2 Pro-rata vesting between median and lower quartile on a ranking basis.
3 Comparator group The companies making up the London Stock Exchange FTSE250 Index excluding investment trusts and the Company.
4 The earnings per share target was adjusted to take account of acquisitions during the performance period ending 31 December 2018.
Unadjusted earnings per share compound annual growth was 32.9%.
However, to reflect the impact of acquisitions, the base year earnings figure was subject to a significant upwards adjustment.
This resulted in a compound growth in earnings per share of 15.81%.
The Committee is pleased with a total shareholder return for the period of 296.4% relative to the peer group performance of 11.8% median and 41.5% upper quartile.
As such, awards will vest in full for this component.
While upwards adjustments to the base year earnings figure made earnings per share performance tougher, compound annual growth performance of 15.81% allows for full vesting of the earnings per share component.
The Committee has therefore determined that the 2016 LTIP awards will vest in full.
As the share price at the date of vesting is not known at the date of approval of this report, the value included within the single figure table is based on the number of shares that vested multiplied by the average share price over the quarter ending 31 December 2018, which is 3,256p per share.
Awards made in 2018 During 2018, LTIP grants were made to the Executive Directors as follows, within the levels permitted by our approved Policy applying during the 2018 financial year.
Mr Prasanth Manghat, Chief Executive Officer 250% of salary Mr Khalifa Bin Butti, Executive Vice Chairman 225% of salary Mr Hani Buttikhi, Chief Investment Officer 175% of salary Performance targets The following performance targets were used in relation to all LTIP awards granted in 2018.
EBITDA growth This measures the Companys annual compound growth in EBITDA over a three year period and represents 50% of the total award.
The table below sets out the EBITDA growth targets for the 2018 award and the corresponding level of vesting: Annual compound growth in EBITDA over the three-year Performance Period Vesting percentage of target 15% or more 100% Between 5% and 15% On a straight-line basis between 25% and 100% 5% 25% Less than 5% 0% 70 NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Group Strategic Financial Other Overview Report Governance Statements Information Total Shareholder Return TSR growth This measures the Companys TSR compared against a comparator group of companies and represents 50% of the total award.
The table below sets out the TSR targets for the 2018 award and the corresponding level of vesting: Companys TSR over three-year performance period compared to the LTIP comparator group as defined below Vesting percentage of target Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 25% and 100% on a ranking basis Median 25% Below median 0% For LTIP grants made in 2018, the TSR comparator group used is the 150 largest companies in the FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts and the Company.
Pension contributions There were no pension contributions in 2017 or 2018.
Non-Executive Director Remuneration 2018 Remuneration paid in 2018 single pay figure The fee and other remuneration paid to each Non-Executive Director during the year ended 31 December 2018 is set out in the following table: FY2018 FY2017 Director Position 000 000 H. J.
Mark Tompkins Independent Non-Executive Joint Chairman 240 228 Dr B. R. Shetty note 1 Non-Executive Joint Chairman 3,548 3,405 Dr Ayesha Abdullah Independent Non-Executive Director 97 103 Abdulrahman Basaddiq Non-Executive Director 95 98 Jonathan Bomford Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 115 103 Lord Clanwilliam Independent Non-Executive Director 105 108 Salma Hareb Independent Non-Executive Director 91 93 Dr Nandini Tandon Independent Non-Executive Director 87 98 Note 1: The Remuneration for Dr B. R. Shetty for 2017 includes remuneration as an Executive Director of the Company from 1 January 2017 to 8 March 2017 when Dr Shetty was appointed Non-Executive Joint Chairman.
The 2017 and 2018 Remuneration Includes the value of Long-Term Incentive and Deferred Share Bonus Plan Awards granted during his term as an Executive Director, and for which the Remuneration Committee permitted retention and continued vesting.
Dr Shetty did not participate in the 2017 STIP and did not receive any awards under the 2017 LTIP.
Other than the continued vesting of legacy LTIP and DSBP awards granted to the Non-Executive Joint Chairman during his service as an Executive Director, none of the NonExecutive directors received any benefits, pension, STIP or LTIP entitlements or payments during FY2017 and FY2018.
With effective from 1 January 2018, the annual fees of the Non-Executive Directors have been structured as follows: Base fees: Joint Chairman 210k Senior Independent Director 85k Non-Executive Director 75k An additional fee of 10k per annum is paid to the Chair of each board committee.
A fee of 4k paid to each Non-Executive Director who attends meetings of the Board in person.
This is to reflect the significant time commitment required for NEDs to attend meetings, often away from their own country of residence.
The above fee structure is reflected in the fees paid to each NED during 2018 as indicated in the table above.
Payments to past directors There were no payments made to past directors during the 2018 financial year.
Payments for loss of office There were no payments made for loss of office to past directors during the 2018 financial year.
NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 71 Governance Directors Remuneration Report 2018 continued 2019 Remuneration Executive remuneration in 2019 This section summarises how the Committee intends to implement the Companys existing remuneration policy in 2019.
Executive Director base salaries Annual base salaries payable with effect from 1 January 2018 remain as follows: Chief Executive Officer US$1,033.4k AED 3.795m Executive Vice Chairman US$685.6k AED 2.518m Chief Investment Officer US$650.7k AED 2.390m The base salary of the Chief Executive Officer was set with effect from 1 January 2017 whilst in the role of Deputy CEO and was not increased upon the promotion of Mr Manghat to CEO in March 2017 or since.
The base salary of the CEO therefore currently remains at a level lower than that paid for the same position in 2016.
The base salary of the Executive Vice Chairman and the Chief Investment Officer were set on appointment of each individual during the 2017 financial year and remain at the same level.
The Committee has not made any adjustments to the remuneration of the CEO or other Executive Directors for 2019.
Benefits There is no change to the structure of benefits in 2019 which will be paid in line with the arrangements in place for the 2018 financial year.
Operation of the STIP for 2019 The maximum STIP opportunity for each of the Executive Directors in 2019 will be as follows: Chief Executive Officer 200% of base salary Executive Vice Chairman 175% of base salary Chief Investment Officer 150% of base salary The way in which any award from the 2019 STIP will be delivered will be one-third of any STIP award being made in cash and two-thirds deferred into shares, half of which will vest one year after any award is made and the other half two years after any award.
The performance targets that will apply for the 2019 financial year have been set, as in previous years, after considering the Groups priorities for the year.
EBITDA and EBITDA margin will remain as key target measures for the year for each Executive Director.
Therefore for 2019 targets will be set against the following measures.
Weighting Measure CEO EVC CIO Rationale EBITDA 50% 50% 50% Directly linked to the Groups strategy.
Represents key metric or UAE and non-UAE operations.
EBITDA margin 50% 50% 50% Key performance indicator for the business.
Executive Vice Chairman Chief Investment Officer Full disclosure of the targets, and the performance against those targets, will be made in the 2019 Annual Report.
In addition, before any bonus is payable, the following underpin conditions will continue to apply for the STIP in 2019 all three underpins must be met.
Underpin Rationale Facility Quality The quality scores obtained across our facilities in different countries remains fundamental to sustainable growth.
As such, a zero tolerance approach will be applied such that all facilities undergoing an accreditation process must pass that process.
NMC has not failed an accreditation to date, nonetheless the Committee is minded to adopt this tough stance to reinforce the importance of quality.
Growth in patient numbers Growth in patient numbers in existing facilities is in line with our focus on efficiency and effective use of our assets.
Occupancy levels A minimum standard will be applied across facilities, again in line with our focus one efficient growth and use of assets.
The Committee selected these measures and underpins in light of feedback from shareholders and is confident that performance against stretch targets on these metrics aligns management performance with shareholders interests.
72 NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Group Strategic Financial Other Overview Report Governance Statements Information Operation of the LTIP for 2019 Within the limit of the provisions set out in the Companys Directors Remuneration policy approved by shareholders on 29 December 2016, the LTIP award levels for the Executive Directors in respect of 2019 will be granted at a maximum level of 250% of base salary.
For 2019, the Committee is again operating a tiered approach to LTIP grants for Executive Directors and Senior Management.
The grants applicable to each Executive Director will be as follows: Maximum opportunity % of base salary Chief Executive Officer 250% Executive Vice Chairman 225% Chief Investment Officer 175% The performance targets that apply for awards to be made under the plan in the 2019 financial year will be as follows: Percentage weighting Purpose and link to for relevant Measure remuneration strategy Performance measure Target individuals Total shareholder To incentivise management TSR growth compared 25% of this element 50% return TSR to deliver long term returns to a comparator group of the award will vest for to shareholders.

annum with 100% vesting for EBITDA growth of 18% per annum.
Vesting is on a straight line basis between these points.
EBITDA has been included again this year given the Groups internal focus on sustainable EBITDA growth.
This growth is adjusted for material acquisitions so that performance is measured on a like-for-like basis.
As such, organic growth, asset utilisation and attainment of efficiencies across the Group are key to performance achievement and in this respect EBITDA growth is the appropriate metric.
However, following feedback from investors, the Committee determined to apply an underpin for 2019 LTIP awards.
As such, an underpin measuring the conversion of EBITDA to net income will be applied.
This underpin will provide shareholders with an aggregate view on earnings, cash flow, and capital efficiency.
Failure to meet the underpin will reduce the proportion of 2019 LTIP awards vesting by up to 50%.
In addition, in the event of an acquisition or disposal during the performance period, the Committee will assess whether the financial performance of the acquired disposed business should be included or excluded, with targets adjusted accordingly.
Holding period Awards under the 2019 LTIP will be measured over a period of three years and subject to a holding period of two years.
Malus and clawback As in prior years, awards under the LTIP for 2017 and beyond are subject to a clawback provision, on top of the existing malus provision.
In reviewing its approach to recovery of remuneration, the Committee has determined that awards under the LTIP and Deferred Share Bonus Plan will be subject to malus and clawback provisions that can be applied for up to five years from the date of grant in respect of the LTIP and within two years of the grant of an award under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The circumstances in which malus and clawback can be applied include, but are not limited to: a material misstatement of the Companys audited results: a material failure of risk management by the Company, any Group Member or a relevant business unit: or serious reputational damage to the Company, any Group member or a relevant business unit as a result of the Participants misconduct or otherwise.
