Mark Crossley was appointed an Executive Director on February 21, 2017.
His base salary, taxable benefits and pension benefits shown for 2017 are from the date of his appointment to December 31, 2017.
Mark Crossley received a total cash bonus of $437.8k under the AIP in respect of the financial year ended December 31, 2017, equivalent to 94.5% of base salary for the entire financial year.
The LTIP award granted to Shaun Thaxter in 2015 vested on March 12, 2018.
The award vested at 73.5% of maximum and had a value of $6,858.9k on the vesting date based on 1,219,432 shares at 404.8p converted to US$ using the GBP US$ exchange rate on the vesting date GB1:US$1.3895.
He also received a cash payment of $154.9k, being the amount equivalent to the dividends that would have accrued during the vesting period.
The estimated value of the award was previously disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report on Remuneration.
The LTIP award granted to Mark Crossley in 2015 vested on February 26, 2018, and the value of the award was previously disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Incentive outcomes for the year ended December 31, 2018 audited AIP 2018 In line with the Remuneration Policy, the maximum AIP opportunity for the Chief Executive Officer was 200% of base salary and 120% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
At the start of the year, the Committee set stretching performance targets in the context of the business plan for the year and taking account of external forecasts.
These were equally weighted between net revenue, net income and key pipeline and product measures.
For threshold performance, 12.5% of the maximum bonus would be paid, for target performance, 50% of the maximum bonus opportunity would be paid, and 100% of the maximum bonus would only be paid for the delivery of exceptional performance significantly above both internal and external expectations.
The outturn is calculated on a straight-line basis between threshold and target, and between target and maximum.
The table below provides an overview of the performance against the targets set in respect of the net revenue and net income measures.

For threshold performance, one point needed to be achieved, for target performance, 15 points needed to be achieved and for maximum performance, 30 points needed to be achieved.

The Committee considered the outturn in the context of the financial performance of the Group in 2018 and the shareholder experience and considered it appropriate to exercise its discretion to override the formulaic outturn and reduce bonus amounts for the Executive Directors to zero.

The deferred conditional share awards vest after two years subject to continued employment as well as malus provisions.
As the outturn of the AIP for 2018 was zero, there will be no bonus deferral in respect of the 2018 financial year.
com Governance LTIP Since the end of the year, the Committee has considered and reviewed the outturn of the conditional awards granted to the Executive Directors under the LTIP in February 2016.
The vesting of these awards was conditional upon continued employment and the achievement of the following performance measures.
Key pipeline and product measure The Committee set one milestone in respect of the key pipeline and product measure.
The milestone related to the successful approval of SUBLOCADE in the US and net revenues generated in 2018.
The schedule below shows the net revenue milestone targets set by the Committee: 12.5% of the maximum award would have vested for achieving threshold revenues, 50% for target revenues and 100% of the maximum award would have vested for achieving net revenues in excess of $130m.
As SUBLOCADE US net revenue in 2018 did not reach threshold, the portion of the award subject to the key pipeline and product measure did not vest.
Performance Threshold Target Maximum Achieved Outturn as a Milestone Weighting $m $m $m $m % of maximum TM US SUBLOCADE net revenue 100% 70 100 130 12 0% TSR measures Relative TSR was assessed over the three-year period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018: 12.5% of the maximum award would have vested for Indivior being ranked median in comparison to the respective peer group, and 100% of the maximum award would have vested for being ranked upper quartile or above.
Awards vest on a straight-line basis between median and upper quartile.
The TSR performance period ended on December 31, 2018, and Indivior was ranked below median in both peer groups and did not therefore reach threshold and, accordingly, the portions of the award subject to relative TSR did not vest.
This has resulted in zero outturn under the LTIP for the Executive Directors.

Shaun Thaxter and Mark Crossley received awards with a value of 500% of base salary.
Conditional awards include the right to receive an amount equal in value to any dividends payable on the number of vested shares between the award date and the release date.

Following the reduction of the annual maximum opportunity for the Chief Executive Officer from 600% to 500% of salary in 2018, threshold vesting for the Chief Executive Officer only was increased from 12.5% to 15% of the maximum award for Indivior being ranked median in comparison to the peer group, and 100% of the maximum award will vest for Indivior being ranked at the upper quartile or above.
For the Chief Financial Offer, 12.5% of the maximum award will vest for Indivior being ranked median in comparison to the peer group, and 100% of the maximum award will vest for Indivior being ranked at the upper quartile or above.
The awards will vest on a straight-line basis between median and upper quartile, with none of the award vesting if Indivior is ranked below median.
The Committee considers that these measures balance the fact that Indivior is a FTSE 250 listed company but also recognizes that Indivior operates within a specialized sector where the majority of its peers are listed in the US.
The key pipeline and product measure relates to the delivery of the pipeline and advancement of our product portfolio.
The actual targets have not been disclosed prospectively as the Committee believes that these details are commercially sensitive.
We will disclose the actual targets and the level of performance achieved against them in 2021, following the completion of the performance period in December 2020, at which point the targets will no longer be considered commercially sensitive.
Executive Directors shareholding and share interests audited In line with Indiviors Remuneration Policy, Executive Directors are required to build a shareholding with a value equivalent to 500% of base salary.
They have five years from the date of demerger or the date of appointment, whichever is later, in which to reach this shareholding requirement.
Members of the Executive Committee are expected to build a shareholding of 150% of base salary within the same time frames.
The table below shows the shareholding of each of the Executive Directors together with interests held by their connected persons and a summary of outstanding awards as at the date of this report.
Shaun Thaxter had previously achieved the shareholding requirement, but has fallen below the requirement as a result of the decline in share price in 2018.

In line with Indiviors Executive Shareholding Guidelines adopted in February 2019, the Executive Directors shareholdings as a % of base salary have been calculated based on shares owned outright valued using the three-month average share price to December 31, 2018 156.0p and the US UK exchange rate over the same period 1:US$1.2869.
There have been no changes in the interests of the directors in the shares of Indivior PLC between December 31, 2018, and the date of this report.
com Governance Outstanding awards under the LTIP Details of conditional awards over shares granted to the Executive Directors subject to performance conditions are shown below.
These awards were granted under the LTIP.
Awards granted under the LTIP are subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period.
Shaun Thaxter and Mark Crossley hold vested but unexercised market value options over 921,461 and 210,619 shares respectively.
These options were granted in December 2014 on demerger at an option price of 111p per share and are scheduled to lapse on December 28, 2024.
Payments to past Directors Cary Claiborne stepped down as a Director on March 7, 2017, and remained an employee until January 31, 2018.
His remuneration arrangements on leaving were in line with the approved Remuneration Policy and were reported in the 2017 Annual Report on Remuneration.
The LTIP award granted to Mr Claiborne in 2015 vested on March 12, 2018.

Mr Claiborne also received a cash payment of $98.5k, being the amount equivalent to the dividends that would have accrued during the vesting period.
The LTIP award granted to Mr Claiborne in 2016 which was scheduled to vest on February 19, 2019, was subject to the achievement of performance conditions measured over the three-year period from 2016 to 2018.
The Group did not achieve threshold performance in respect of the performance conditions set and consequently the award lapsed.
Payments for loss of office There were no payments for loss of office.

Dilution limits Indiviors share plans provide that awards can be satisfied by newly-issued shares, the transfer of treasury shares or existing shares purchased in the market and held in an employee benefit trust.
Indiviors share plans state that the aggregate number of shares that may be issued to satisfy awards made under those plans must not exceed 10% of the Companys issued share capital in any 10-year period.
The Committee has reviewed the number of shares subject to award to ensure that these limits would not be breached by the granting of awards in 2019.
Implementation of Executive Director Remuneration Policy for 2019 Base salary Base salaries are reviewed taking into account competitive practice for similar roles in the Companys remuneration peer group.
The Executive Directors received a 3% salary increase, in line with the average merit increase provided to the wider workforce in both the UK and US with effect from January 1, 2019.
The base salaries of the Executive Directors as at January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2018, are set out below.

The Chief Executive Officer will receive pension contributions or equivalent cash allowances of 17.5% of salary, plus any Company matching on 401 K elected deferrals.
This is made up of profit-sharing contributions of 4% of pay directed into the Indivior Inc. Profit Sharing and 401 K plan, with any outstanding balance between these contributions and the 17.5% of annual base salary paid in cash and or the deferred compensation account.
The Chief Financial Officer, Mark Crossley, will receive pension contributions of profit-sharing contributions of 4% of pay directed into the Indivior Inc. Profit Sharing and 401 K plan, plus any Company match of 75% on elected deferrals up to 4.5% of pay.

The Executive Directors do not have a prospective entitlement to a defined benefit pension.
Indivior Annual Report 2018 7 73 3 Directors remuneration report continued AIP 2019 No changes have been made to the opportunity under the AIP for 2019.
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will have a maximum bonus opportunity of 200% and 120% of base salary, respectively.
As a result of the strategic decision to reduce investment in certain research and development activities in the short term in order to reduce the Groups operational cost base, the Committee considered the performance measures for the 2019 AIP and concluded that they would be based on three financial metrics.
In line with our Policy, 75% of any bonus amount will be delivered in cash and 25% will be deferred into shares for a period of two years.
Bonuses for 2019 will be based on the following measures and weightings: Measure Weighting TM SUBLOCADE net revenue 40% Cash management 40% TM PERSERIS net revenue 20% As an additional underpin, if the Group violates its debt covenants, no award will be paid in respect of the cash management portion of the annual bonus.
We have not disclosed the actual performance targets for 2019, as we consider them to be commercially sensitive.
However, we commit to disclosing the performance targets retrospectively in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
LTIP Following consultation with shareholders in 2018, the maximum opportunity under the LTIP for the Chief Executive Officer was reduced from 600% to 500% of base salary for awards granted from 2018 onwards.
The Committee carefully considered the quantum of awards to be granted in 2019 in the context of the material decline in the Companys share price in 2018.
The Committee concluded that it was appropriate to reduce the quantum of all LTIP awards to be granted in 2019 by 35%: the Executive Directors will therefore receive awards with a reduced maximum opportunity of 325% of base salary 162.5% at target.
The awards will be subject to a three-year performance period and an additional two-year post-vesting holding period.
The Committee also considered the LTIP performance metrics in the current business context and concluded it would be appropriate to adjust the measures and has therefore determined that awards granted in 2019 will be subject to relative TSR versus the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts: and relative TSR versus the constituents of the S&P 1500 Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index: each with equal weighting.
Measure Weighting Rationale for metric Relative TSR vs. FTSE 250 50% Provides alignment with shareholders through the relative excluding investment trusts outperformance of other UK listed companies.
Relative TSR vs. S&P 1500 50% Provides alignment with shareholders through the relative Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index outperformance of direct sector peers who are subject to similar market influences.
Following the reduction of the annual maximum opportunity for the Chief Executive Officer in 2018, threshold vesting for the Chief Executive Officer only was increased from 12.5% to 15% of the maximum award for Indivior being ranked median in comparison to the peer group, and 100% of the maximum award will vest for Indivior being ranked at upper quartile or above.
For the Chief Financial Offer, 12.5% of the maximum award will vest for Indivior being ranked median in comparison to the peer group, and 100% of the maximum award will vest for Indivior being ranked at upper quartile or above.
Awards will vest on a straight-line basis between median and upper quartile, with none of the awards vesting if Indivior is ranked below median.
