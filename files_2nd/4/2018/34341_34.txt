Impact of the RAI acquisition on 2016 LTIP awards Following the acquisition of the remaining shares of RAI which the Group did not already own on 25 July 2017, the Committee has taken time to consider how the impact of this major acquisition should be treated for the purposes of the 2017 performance year within the 2016 LTIP award.
As a result of this review, the following treatments have been applied in respect of the RAI acquisition: relative TSR and EPS growth no further adjustments were needed as the incremental costs and benefits associated with the acquisition are already factored into performance: and adjusted revenue growth and underpin the 2017 performance year was measured based on organic BAT performance excluding the impact of RAI and other 2017 acquisitions to allow for a like-for-like comparison.
The 2018 performance year was measured on a representative basis: please refer to page 259 for further details.
The Remuneration Committee believe this is the correct, fair and appropriate way to treat the acquisition of RAI.

This comparator group is considered to be the most appropriate group as Executive Directors are employed on UK contracts.
Using a more widely-drawn group encompassing the worldwide nature of the Groups business would also present practical difficulties in collation and a less relevant comparator, given the significant variations in employee pay across the Group, the differing economic conditions and wide variations in gross domestic product per capita.
The 5.9% increase to average base salary and the increase in short-term incentive awards for UK-based employees is due to an increase in the proportion of more senior staff within the population.
UK-based employees were awarded performance-based pay increases in 2018 in the range 0% to 8% with an average of around 3%.
The data for the UK-based employees comparator group is made up as follows as at 31 December 2018: 1 the weighted average base salaries: 2 the average taxable benefits per grade: and 3 an estimated weighted average target bonus based on that population as at that date.

Waiver of compliance with guidelines: this is permitted with the approval of the Remuneration Committee in circumstances where a restriction on a requested share sale could cause undue hardship.
No such applications were received from the Executive Directors during 2018.

Impact of the RAI acquisition on 2017 and 2018 LTIP awards The Committee has taken time to consider how the impact of the RAI acquisition should be treated for the purposes of the 2017 and 2018 performance years.
As a result of this review, the following treatments will apply: relative TSR and EPS growth no further adjustments are needed as the incremental costs and benefits associated with the acquisition are already factored into performance: adjusted revenue growth the 2017 performance year has been measured based on organic BAT performance versus the 2016 base year toallow for a like-for-like comparison.
The contribution of RAI and other 2017 acquisitions has been included from 2018 onwards, with the growth against 2017 being on a representative basis: and operating cash flow conversion ratio the 2017 performance year has been measured based on organic BAT performance, excluding RAI profitand cash, and any additional costs related to the acquisition.
The contribution of RAI and other 2017 acquisitions has been included on a representative basis for the 2018 performance year.
The Committee believes this is the correct, fair and appropriate way to treat the acquisition of RAI.

108 BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Introduction Audit Nominations Remuneration Responsibility & Board Committee Committee Committee of Directors 8 Summary of our Directors Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Policy, that sets the basis for remuneration in 2018, for the Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Directors was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 27 April 2016.
The full Directors Remuneration Policy is set out in the Remuneration Report 2015 contained in the Annual Report for the year ended 2015, which is available at www.
To assist in reviewing our Annual Report on Remuneration, we have summarised the key elements of the Directors Remuneration Policy as it principally applies to remuneration paid during 2018.
Directors Remuneration Policy summary: our remuneration strategy Our principles of remuneration summary The Remuneration Committees remuneration principles seek to reward the delivery of the Groups strategy in a simple and straightforward manner which is aligned to shareholders long-term sustainable interests.
The remuneration structure comprises fixed and variable elements.
These rewards are structured and designed to be both transparent and stretching while recognising the skills and experience of the Executive Directors and ensuring a market competitiveness for talent.
The fixed elements comprise base salary, pension and other benefits.
The variable elements are provided via two performance-based incentive schemes asingle short-term cash and share incentive annual bonus plan STI, and a single long-term incentive plan LTIP.
In applying these principles, the Remuneration Committee maintains an appropriate balance between fixed pay and the opportunity to earn performance-related remuneration with the performance-based elements forming, at maximum opportunity, between 75% and 85% of the Executive Directors total remuneration.
An annual review is conducted to ensure application and alignment of the Directors Remuneration Policy with the business needs to promote the long-term success of the Company.
How each key element of our remuneration supports the strategic priorities Fixed remuneration: attract and retain high calibre individuals to deliver the Companys strategic plans by offering market-competitive base salary pension benefits levels of guaranteed cash to reflect an individuals skills, experience and role within the Company: provide competitive post-retirement benefit arrangements which recognise both the individuals length of tenure with the Group and the external environment in the context of attracting and retaining senior high calibre individuals to deliver the Groups strategy: and provide market-competitive benefits consistent with the role which: 1 help to facilitate the attraction and retention of high calibre, senior individuals to deliver the Companys strategic plans: and 2 recognise that such talent is global in source and that the availability of certain benefits e. g. relocation, repatriation, taxation compliance advice will from time to time be necessary to avoid such factors being an inhibitor to accepting the role.
Variable remuneration: incentivise the attainment of corporate targets aligned to the strategic objectives of the Company on an short-term incentives annual basis: performance-based award in the form of cash and deferred ordinary shares, so that the latter element ensures alignment with shareholders long-term interests: strong alignment and linkage between individual and corporate annual objectives via the application of an individual performance adjustment factor to the corporate result: and ensure, overall, a market-competitive package to attract and retain high calibre individuals to deliver the Groups strategy.
Variable remuneration: incentivise long-term sustainable growth in total shareholder return TSR, adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS long-term incentives and adjusted revenue growth, together with the achievement of a consistently high measure of operating profit conversion ratio over a three-year period: to facilitate the appointment of high calibre, senior individuals required to deliver the Companys strategic plans: and to promote the long-term success of the Company: and to put in place a combination of measures with appropriately stretching targets around the long-term plan that provides a balance relevant to the Groups business and market conditions, as well as providing alignment between Executive Directors and shareholders.
In setting performance criteria and thresholds targets, the Remuneration Committee takes account of the Groups long-term plans and market expectations.

BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2018 111 Remuneration Report Annual Report on Remuneration continued Directors Remuneration Policy summary: other policy provisions in relation to Executive Directors Service contracts The current Executive Directors are employed on a one-year rolling contract, executed at the time of the original appointment.
The Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to award twoor three-year contracts in the event that the Executive Director is recruited externally or from overseas.
Contracts with an initial period of longer than one year will then reduce to a one-year rolling contract after the expiry of the initial period.
Policy on payment for loss of office Principles The principles on which the Remuneration Committee will approach the determination for payments on termination are as follows: compensation for loss of office in service contracts is limited to no more than 12 months salary and benefits excluding pension: in the event that the contract is terminated for cause such as gross misconduct, the Company may terminate the contract with immediate effect and no compensation would be payable: and the service contracts of the Executive Directors are terminable on the expiry of 12 months notice from either the Director or the Company which means that, where an internal successor has not been identified, the Company would have sufficient time to replace the Executive Director through an orderly external recruitment process and ideally have a period of handover.
Treatment of awards under the share incentive schemes: STI DSBS and LTIP: All-employee scheme: SRS Executive Directors do not have contractual rights to the value inherent in any awards held under the share incentive schemes.
The release ofawards is dependent on leaver status and is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion in deciding good leaver status other than in cases of automatic good leavers as set out in the applicable provisions of the DSBS and LTIP rules.
The discretionary powers are intended to provide flexibility as Executive Directors may leave employment for a broad variety of reasons which may not necessarily fall within the prescribed category of good leaver.
The Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion by reference to guidelines which set out its agreed relevant factors to assist in the determination of a leavers status.
In exercising its discretion, the Remuneration Committee will also take into account the individuals overall performance as well as their contribution to the Company during their total period of employment.
Details of how leavers are assessed as good leavers are set out in the Remuneration Policy.
