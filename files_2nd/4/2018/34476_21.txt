Christopher Bailey Remuneration for Christopher Bailey is for the full FY 2017 18 as he stepped down from the Board on 31 March 2018.
Christopher has agreed to remain with Burberry in an advisory capacity until December 2018, which provides valuable continuity and helps ensure a smooth transition.
The figures shown in the table above reflect the impact of his departure on his outstanding share awards, including where relevant his decision to surrender a total of 830,550 shares awarded to him under Burberrys share plans, which represents a face value in excess of 14m based on the share price at his date of departure from the Board.
Further details on his leaving arrangements can be found on page 110.
The amount shown for the 2015 ESP award vesting for Christopher Bailey for year to 31 March 2018 is based on a share price of 16.34 average share price over the three months to 31 March 2018 as this award has not yet vested and includes an estimated payment in lieu of dividends of 14,157.

103 GOVERNANCE REPORT The following sections detail additional information for each element of remuneration set out above in the single figure remuneration table.
In addition, the Remuneration Policy summary table on pages 101 to 102 sets out how these remuneration elements are operated and in the final column how they will be implemented in the FY 2018 19 year.
SALARY, PENSION AND BENEFITS AUDITED The table below details salaries as at 31 March 2018 and those that will apply from 1 July 2018.
When setting FY 2018 19 salaries for the executive directors, the Committee took into account a number of factors, including the approach for our wider employee population, individual performance and overall contribution to the business during the year, cost to the Company, the external economic climate, and market positioning, which included a review of equivalent roles in global luxury competitors where publicly available and FTSE100 excluding financial services companies.
Following careful consideration, the Committee determined that a salary increase of 2% for both Marco Gobbetti and Julie Brown was appropriate.
For Marco Gobbetti, this reflects the fact that Burberry has to compete in the global luxury goods market, where pay levels for highly experienced leaders continue to rise, and also recognises that the CEO role has not seen an increase in salary for a number of years.
For Julie Brown, a 2% increase is considered to fairly recognise the contribution she has made to the business since appointment.

ANNUAL BONUS OUTCOMES FOR FY 2017 18 AUDITED Annual bonuses for FY 2017 18 were based entirely on Adjusted PBT in line with the Remuneration Policy for executive directors.
For the year to 31 March 2018, the FY 2017 18 Adjusted PBT achieved was just ahead of the target level set by the Committee, which resulted in bonuses for the executive directors of 51% of maximum or 102% of target.
The Committee applied no discretion.
The bonus payment for Marco Gobbetti is for the period from when he became CEO from 5 July 2017.
104 GOVERNANCE REPORT The table below sets out the targets and actual performance for FY 2017 18.
Maximum Level of FY bonus FY 2017 18 2017 18 FY 2017 18 FY 2017 18 FY 2017 18 Annual bonus opportunity Adjusted PBT Adjusted PBT bonus payment bonus payment bonus payment for FY 2017 18 % of salary target m achieved m % of maximum % of salary 000 Marco Gobbetti 200% Threshold: 471.6 102% 833 Julie Brown 200% Target: 484.6 485.2 51% 102% 714 Christopher Bailey 200% Maximum: 508.6 102% 1,122 The bonus outcome is calculated using the average exchange rates of FY 2016 17.

The maximum bonus award for executive directors will remain at 200% of base salary, and will continue to be based fully on adjusted PBT in line with Policy.
The Board considers the forward-looking Adjusted PBT bonus targets to be commercially sensitive as they are linked to the Companys financial and strategic plans, and as such targets will be disclosed retrospectively.
Targets have been set to reflect the period of transition where operating margins and adjusted PBT are expected to be broadly stable and are considered by the Committee to be of an equivalent stretch to those set in prior years.
EXECUTIVE SHARE PLAN The following section sets out details of: 2015 ESP awards vesting during FY 2017 18 2017 ESP awards granted during FY 2017 18 2018 ESP awards to be granted in FY 2018 19 105 GOVERNANCE REPORT 2015 ESP AWARDS VESTING IN FY 2017 18 AUDITED On 22 July 2015, Christopher Bailey was granted an ESP award with vesting subject to performance from 1 April 2015 to 31March 2018.
50% of this award is due to vest on 22 July 2018 with the remaining 50% due to vest on 22 July 2019.
As set out on page 110, as part of his leaving arrangements, Christopher has waived the 50% of the award that was due to vest in July 2019.
The table below sets out the performance conditions, targets and actual performance achieved against these.
Over the three-year period to 31 March 2018, Adjusted PBT declined at CER and so none of this element 50% of the award will vest.
Revenue growth at CER over the three-year period to 31 March 2018 was below the threshold growth required of 3% p. a and so none of this element 25% of the award will vest.
The companys average ROIC over the three-year period was 15.8% which is above the threshold level of performance resulting in a vesting of 24,158 shares, being 10% of Christophers maximum award.
However, given Christophers waiver of the second tranche of the award, only 12,079 shares 5% of the shares underlying the original award, being 10% of the reduced award, will vest in July 2018.

The ESP shares were granted on 31 July 2017 and will vest 50% after three years and 50% after four years from grant date, subject to the performance conditions outlined above.
No shares may be sold until five years from grant date.
The face value of each award has been calculated using the three-day average price prior to the date of grant 17.21p which was the price used to determine the number of shares awarded.
As receipt of these is conditional on performance, the actual value of these awards may be nil.
Vesting outcomes will be disclosed in the 2019 20 Directors Remuneration Report.
On 3 April 2017, it was announced that Burberry had entered into an agreement with Coty Inc. under which Coty Inc. acquire the exclusive long-term global licence rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare.
For the purpose of assessing Revenue growth performance for the ESP awards granted in 2015 and 2017, revenue for the base year has been re-calculated on the assumption that this agreement had applied in that year to ensure revenue growth is being calculated on a like-for-like basis with the way targets have been set.
On 31 October 2017, it was announced that Christopher Bailey would be leaving Burberry and had therefore decided to surrender his 2017 ESP award in full.
Further information on Christophers leaving arrangements is included on page 110.
The vesting outcomes based on each of three-year revenue and three-year Adjusted PBT growth are calculated using revenue and Adjusted PBT as disclosed in the annual accounts, subject to any adjustments down or up made by the Committee to reflect constant exchange rates and any other items deemed to be outside managements control.
Adjusted retail wholesale ROIC measures the efficient use of capital to ensure that returns on future investment are attractive.
Group ROIC includes the contribution from the high-return licensing business.
Given the licensing business is not capital-intensive, ROIC will continue to be measured on Burberrys retail wholesale business only.
Retail wholesale ROIC, for the purposes of the ESP performance measure, is calculated as the retail wholesale post-tax adjusted operating profit divided by the average retail wholesale operating assets, measured over the three-year period, on a reported currency basis.
A calculation of adjusted retail wholesale ROIC is included in the five-year summary on page 182.
107 GOVERNANCE REPORT 2018 ESP AWARDS TO BE GRANTED IN FY 2018 19 As set out in the table on page 102, 2018 ESP awards for the executive directors will continue to be based on Adjusted PBT, Group revenue and ROIC performance, calculated on the same basis as set out above for FY 2017 18 awards.
2018 ESP awards will vest 50% after three years and 50% after four years from the grant date, subject to the performance conditions see below.
Other than to meet tax liabilities, no shares may be sold until five years from grant date.
The table below sets out the performance measures, targets and award levels for the 2018 ESP.

The vesting outcomes based on each of three-year revenue and three-year Adjusted PBT growth will be calculated using revenue and Adjusted PBT as disclosed in the annual accounts, subject to any adjustments down or up made by the Committee to reflect constant exchange rates and any other items deemed to be outside managements control.
In considering the targets under these measures, the Committee has aimed to set a performance range which is stretching to achieve, yet realistic in the context of our business plan for the next three years.
In November 2017, we announced a multi-year strategy to establish Burberrys position firmly in luxury fashion, the consequences of which will see a two-year period of investment to strengthen our brand positioning, during which time revenues and operating margin are expected to be broadly stable, followed by an expected acceleration of growth in subsequent years.
Given this financial profile, the Committee recognises that on an absolute basis, the three-year adjusted PBT and ROIC targets for the 2018 ESP awards are lower than those under the 2017 ESP.
However, the Committee firmly believes that in the context of our new multi-year strategy the targets are at least as stretching as those in previous years.
Additionally, the Committee was also mindful that the ROIC measure is very sensitive to exchange rate movements, such that continued exchange rate volatility relative to sterling may have a significant impact on vesting if the target range were to be overly narrow.
Given this, the target range has been widened from that used in previous years to ensure that outcomes are not unduly influenced by exchange rate movements.
In broadening the range, the Committee has ensured that proportionally more of the additional width has been incorporated at the upper end of the range, further increasing the overall stretch of the profile.

110 GOVERNANCE REPORT The Committee assessed performance for the 2014 exceptional award for the period 1 April to 5 July 2017 and determined that 40% of maximum should vest to reflect performance during this period.
Further detail on this performance assessment is set out in the table below.
Performance Performance element Assessment weighted 1 April 2017 to 5 July equally, 2017 of maximum 25% each Commentary for each element 1.
Strategic In the 2016 17 DRR we set out details of Burberrys strategic development 25 25 100% development to 31 March 2017.
This included the plans outlined in May 2016 to accelerate our productivity and efficiency agenda, including a programme of action to deliver significant cost savings.
We also described the substantial progress that had been made embedding the five key strategies in the business and delivering on these objectives.
As Chief Creative Officer and CEO Christopher continued to lead the development of this strategy and its expected implementation in the period to 5 July 2017 and therefore the Committee determined that this element of the criteria was fully delivered during the period.
Financial To 5 July 2017 the business made good progress on delivering financial 0 25 0% performance performance during FY 2017 18.
Notwithstanding this, given that the adjusted PBT performance over the period from 1 April 2014 was below the level of the CIP performance condition threshold of 5% growth the benchmark set at the time of grant, the Committee determined that no portion of this element of the award should vest.
Personal Christopher continued to drive the business through this transitional 15 25 60% contribution period, whilst evolving the key strategies.
He ensured that the senior executive team remained focused on both the delivery of the key strategies and the management of the business in a challenging economic climate.
Furthermore, Christopher oversaw significant change across the senior team and embedded new executives and retained existing talent.
Notwithstanding Christophers personal commitment in the period to 5 July 2017, the Committee determined a 60% outcome to this measure, again noting the level of financial performance.

The Committee determined that, as our performance was behind that of our luxury peers, no portion of this award should vest.
Overall outcome 40 100 40% Boss, Ferragamo, Hermes, Kering, LVMH, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Richemont, Swatch, Tapestry formerly Coach, Tiffany, Tods 111 GOVERNANCE REPORT This outcome, when combined with the outcomes for Award 2 previous years FY 2014 15: 85%: FY 2015 16: 50%: FY On leaving his previous employer, Marco also forfeited 2016 17: 50%, gives an overall vesting for the second aseries of annual long-term performance share awards tranche of the award of 59.9% of maximum.

The award was immediately exercisable from this date.
Marco exercised his award on the same date and, other than selling to cover taxes, retained all the shares.
112 GOVERNANCE REPORT JULIE BROWN As set out in the 2016 17 DRR, in order to secure Julie Browns appointment and to allow her to join Burberry at the earliest opportunity, the Committee agreed to buy out incentives that she forfeited on leaving her previous employer.
The 2016 17 DRR also set out that Julie had been granted an award under the ESP on 30 January 2017.
On 26 June 2017, the Company announced that Julie Brown had decided to waive: nil-cost options over 94,860 shares 75% of the ESP award she had been granted on 30 January 2017 due to overlap of the 2016 17 performance period nil cost options over 47,099 shares she was granted on 30 January 2017 her buyout award in the light of the vesting outcome of her 2014 award from her former employer The Remuneration Committee welcomed and agreed with Julie Browns decision.
The surrender caused: the 2016 17 ESP nil-cost options to immediately lapse in respect of 94,860 shares: Julie continues to hold nil-cost options over the balance, being 31,620 shares under the 2016 17 ESP the buyout award nil-cost options to immediately lapse in respect of 47,099 shares: the balance of nil-cost options over 167,901 shares vest subject to continued employment as per the following schedule: 38,901 shares vested on 22 July 2017: 64,500 shares due to vest on 22 July 2018: 64,500 shares due to vest on 22 July 2019.
These changes to Julies share awards are reflected in the information set out in the table of total interests in shares on page 109.
Other aspects of Julies buyout arrangements are unaffected and are as set out in the 2016 17 DRR.
In March 2018Julies previous employer publishedthe level of vesting of the award relating to the second tranche of her buy-out 64,500 shares.
The Committee noted that this vestingoutcome at her prior Company was higher than the valueat which Burberry had bought it out.
The following sections are not subject to audit.

For the period 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, Julies fees for this appointment were CHF360,000 c. 267,000.
Neither Marco Gobbetti nor Christopher Bailey held anyexternal appointments during the year ended 31March2018.
CHANGE IN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS REMUNERATION RELATIVE TO ALL EMPLOYEES The table below sets out Marco Gobbettis base salary, benefits and bonus received as CEO for FY 2017 18.
As Marco was appointed to the role of Chief Executive Officer on 5 July 2017, the year-on-year change reported compares his actual salary, benefits and bonus received to that received by Christopher Bailey for the same pro-rated period of FY 2016 17.
The year-on-year change FY 2017 18 vs. FY 2016 17 of salary, benefits and annual bonus received for a comparator group of UK-based employees is also shown.
Salary Benefits Bonus CEO 000s 816 90 833 Year-on-year change % 0% -74% n a Employees Year-on-year change % 2% 0% 11% The comparator group includes all employees in corporate roles based in the UK.
This group has been chosen as these employees most closely reflect the economic environment in which the Chief Executive Officer operates.
For the comparator group of employees, the salary and bonus year-on-year changes include the annual salary review but exclude any additional changes made in the year, for example on promotion.
In FY 2017 18, the bonus outturn based on Adjusted PBT performance was 51% of maximum, compared to 46% of maximum in FY 2016 17.
The 0% increase for benefits for the comparator group of employees reflects no change to benefits policies or levels during the year.
It does not reflect any changes to the level of benefits an individual may have received as a result of a change in role, for example on promotion.
A meaningful year-on-year change for benefits and bonus for all Group employees cannot be provided due to the variation in structure of these pay elements across roles and regions.
Christopher Bailey received no annual bonus in respect of FY 2016 17 and therefore a percentage comparison is not possible.
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SPEND ON PAY FOR FY 2017 18 The table below sets out the total payroll costs for all employees over FY 2017 18 compared to total dividends payable for the year and amounts paid to buy back shares during the year.
The average number of full-time equivalent employees is also shown for context.
The Committee is mindful of the likelihood of new regulations that will require UK companies to publish their Chief Executive Officers pay relative to that for all employees.
The Committee awaits the final draft of the regulations and further Government guidance on the method of calculation, but the current intention is to publish this information in the 2018 19 Directors Remuneration Report.

CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHAREHOLDINGS AUDITED The shareholding guideline for the Chairman and non-executive directors is to hold shares with a market value of 6,000 for each year of their appointment.
The table below summarises the total interests of the Chairman and non-executive directors in ordinary shares of Burberry Group plc as at 31 March 2018.

Jeremy intends to purchase shares in the near future to fulfil his guideline.
There have been no changes in the period up to and including 15 May 2018.
These include beneficial and conditional interests and the interests of their connected persons in shares.

The rationale for the review was to provide greater clarity of the Committees remit and responsibility given the increasing external focus on executive remuneration and the internal changes to the structure of the senior executive team.
The updated Terms of Reference are published on the Burberry Group plc website at www.
In addition to setting the remuneration of the executive directors, the Committee continues to directly oversee the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Committee.
The Committee also now has a remit to take into account remuneration throughout the Group when considering executive arrangements, and to this end is presented with appropriate information to perform this role effectively.
During the year we also discussed our approach to, and results of, Burberrys gender pay gap reporting.
Looking ahead, the Committee notes and welcomes the UK Financial Reporting Councils review of the UK Corporate Governance Code, which along with broader matters, includes proposals arising from the Governments consultation during 2017 on executive pay, directors duties and board composition.
We look forward to explaining in next years Annual Report and Accounts what changes were ultimately made to the Code and how the Company has responded to them.
