888. com Directors Remuneration Report Review of the Policy During the year, the Committee carried out a detailed review of the Directors Remuneration Policy, taking into consideration alignment of the policy to the Groups strategy and long-term sustainable business success, corporate governance developments and UK best practice.
As a result of this review, the Committee is proposing the following changes to the Policy which will be brought to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting on 21 May 2019: A two-year post-vesting holding period will be introduced for LTIP awards granted in or after 2019 The Committee will have discretion to adjust annual bonus payments and LTIP vesting levels in line with the Corporate Governance Code where the formulaic outcome does not reflect underlying corporate performance, investor experience or employee reward outcome The circumstances in which malus and clawback may be operated for both the annual bonus and LTIP will be broadened to incorporate corporate failure, a failure of risk management and reputational damage The Committee is not at this time introducing a post-employment shareholding requirement in respect of beneficially owned shares not subject to holding periods but will keep market practice in this area under review.
It is, however, ensuring that annual bonus deferred share awards and LTIP post-vesting holding periods continue post-employment to ensure that there continues to be alignment to shareholder interests and longer-term corporate performance post-employment Dividend equivalent payments on vested awards granted under the new Policy will be payable in shares and only in exceptional circumstances in cash.
Previously they could be payable in cash or shares.

Purpose and Link to Strategy Bonus targets percentage of salary are based on objective and disclosable calculations where possible.
Operation The precise weightings between metrics may differ each year, although there will be always be a greater focus on financial as opposed to non-financial performance.
Any bonus payment in excess of 100% of salary is deferred into shares which vest in equal tranches after one, two and three years.
The deferral period continues on cessation of employment.
The Committee may adjust the formula-driven outturn of the annual bonus calculation in the event that the Committee considers that it does not reflect underlying performance, overall shareholder experience or employee reward outcome.
Any such use of discretion would be detailed in the Chairmans annual statement and Annual Report on Remuneration.
A dividend equivalent provision operates enabling dividends to be accrued in shares on unvested deferred bonus shares or options and only in truly exceptional circumstances cash.
The bonus is subject to recovery and withholding provisions which may be applied if the financial statements of 888 were materially misstated, an error occurred in assessing the performance conditions of a bonus, if the Executive ceased to be a Director or employee due to gross misconduct, or in an event of corporate failure, failure of risk management or reputational damage.
The maximum opportunity is 150% of base salary.
Opportunity The level of pay-out for the achievement of target performance, as set by the Committee is 50% of the maximum amount.
The threshold level of payment may be up to 25% of the maximum.
Financial performance Performance Metrics The financial component is based on 888's key financial measures of performance.
A sliding scale of targets applies for financial performance targets which are measured annually.
The degree of stretch in targets may vary each year depending on the business aims and the broader economic or industry environment at the start of the relevant year.
Non-financial performance Non-financial performance conditions will be based on KPIs in line with the business plan which the Committee considers will enhance future financial performance, the long-term sustainability of the business and shareholder value.

Link to Strategy Enables Executive Directors to build a meaningful shareholding over time and align goals with shareholders.
LTIP awards are made annually in the form of nil cost options or conditional awards with vesting dependent Operation on the achievement of performance conditions over at least three financial years, commencing with the year of grant.
A post-vesting holding period applies to awards granted in or after 2019, which requires vested shares or shares acquired on the exercise of vested options to be retained for two years post-vesting except for any earlier sale of shares to meet any tax liabilities triggered on vesting.
This holding period continues on cessation of employment.
The Committee may adjust the formula-driven outturn of an LTIP award in the event that the Committee considers that it does not reflect underlying performance, overall shareholder experience or employee reward outcome.
Awards are subject to recovery and withholding provisions which may be applied if there is a material misstatement in 888s financial statements, an error in the calculation of any performance conditions, if the Executive Director ceases to be a Director or employee due to gross misconduct or in an event of a failure of risk management, corporate failure or reputational damage.
A dividend equivalent provision operates enabling dividends to be accrued in shares on LTIP awards to the extent they vest and only in truly exceptional circumstances cash.
Award levels are determined primarily by seniority.
A maximum individual grant limit of 200% of salary Opportunity applies, based on the face value of shares at the date of grant.
Awards vest at the end of a three-year performance period based on performance measures reflecting the Performance Metrics outputs of the long-term strategy of the business at the time of grant.
Awards will vest based on a range of challenging financial, total shareholder return TSR, or strategic measures.
Strategic measures, if used, will represent a minority of the award.
The Committee will review the weightings between measures and the target ranges prior to each LTIP grant to ensure that the overall balance and level of stretch remains appropriate.
A sliding scale of targets applies for financial or TSR metrics with no more than 25% of the award vesting at threshold performance.
Share Ownership Guidelines Executive Directors are expected to build and maintain an interest equivalent in value to no less than two times salary.
Beneficially owned shares, fully vested unexercised nil-cost options valued on a net of tax basis and unvested awards subject to a service requirement for vesting only valued on a net of tax basis will be included when determining the extent to which the guideline holding is achieved.
Until such time as the guideline threshold is achieved.
Executive Directors are required to retain 50% of the net of tax value of awards that vest under the LTIP or deferred annual bonus.

Link to Strategy The Chairman and the Executive Directors determine the fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors.
The Operation Chairmans fees are determined by the Remuneration Committee with reference to prevailing fee rates amongst other gaming companies.
Fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors are set by reference to an assessment of the time commitment and responsibility associated with each role, and prevailing fee rates amongst other gaming companies.
Levels take account of additional demands placed upon individual NonExecutive Directors by virtue of their holding particular offices, such as Committee Chairman and or Senior Independent Director, and travel time to Board meetings which are held outside the UK.
Additional fees may be paid as appropriate to reflect increased time commitments of the role.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any bonus plan, pension plan, share plan, or long-term incentive plan of 888.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for any reasonable travel and accommodation and other expenses incurred in the performance of their duties including any tax incurred thereon including any expense deemed a taxable benefit in kind and the tax payable thereon.
Opportunity Discretions retained by the Committee in operating its incentive plans The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan, deferred annual bonus plan and LTIP according to their respective rules.
The Committee retains discretion in a number of regards to the operation and administration of these plans.
These include, but are not limited to, the following: the determination of vesting and the extent to which performance targets have been met: the determination of the treatments of leavers: determination of the extent of vesting in the event of a change of control: and adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events and special dividends.
Approach to setting remuneration for a new recruit The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would take into account the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as is required to attract the most appropriate candidate while paying no more than is necessary.
The annual bonus and LTIP award would be in line with the Policy.
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share based elements to replace benefits, deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer.
It would ensure that these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of delivery mechanism cash or shares, vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms or adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
The Committee may agree that 888 will meet relocation expenses as appropriate.
64 888 Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Governance Service contracts and loss of office payment policy for Executive Directors Executive Directors have service contracts with up to 12-month notice periods.
In the event of termination, the Executive Directors contracts provide for compensation up to a maximum of base salary plus the value of any benefits including pension, and in the case of the Chief Financial Officer, annual bonus for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
This is a legacy contractual obligation and will not be provided in the contracts of any new appointments.
888 seeks to apply the principle of mitigation in the payment of compensation on the termination of the service contract of any Executive Director.
There are no special provisions in the service contracts for payments to Executive Directors on a change of control of 888.
In the event of an exit of an Executive Director, the overriding principle will be to honour contractual remuneration entitlements and determine on an equitable basis the appropriate treatment of deferred and performance linked elements of the package, taking account of the circumstances.
Failure will not be rewarded.
If an Executive Director resigns or is summarily dismissed, salary, pension and benefits will cease on the last day of employment and there will be no further payments.
There are no other obligations to pay remuneration, or which could impact remuneration, contained in any service contract other than the terms of the Executive Directors service agreements described herein.
Directors service agreements are available for inspection at 888s registered office and at each annual general meeting.
Remuneration for leavers Fixed pay Salary, pension and benefits will be paid up to the length of the agreed notice period or agreed period of gardening leave.
Variable pay Where a Director leaves for certain specified reasons such as retirement, as a result of injury, illness or disability or otherwise with the agreement of the Committee sometimes referred to as good leaver reasons the following will apply: Annual bonus and annual bonus deferred shares Subject to performance, a bonus may be payable at the discretion of the Committee pro-rata for the portion of the financial year worked.
Unvested deferred bonus shares will ordinarily vest in full at the end of the normal vesting period.
The Committee has discretion to permit in exceptional circumstances such unvested awards to vest early rather than continue on the normal vesting timetable, taking into account the Companys policy for bonuses from FY19 for Executive Directors to retain an interest in shares in the Company for two years post-employment.
LTIPs Unvested awards under the 888 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2015 would normally vest on the normal vesting date unless the Committee determines that such awards shall instead exceptionally vest at the time of cessation, taking into account the Companys policy for awards granted from FY19 for Executive Directors to retain an interest in shares in the Company for two years post-employment.
Unvested awards will only vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied over the full or curtailed period as relevant.
A pro-rata reduction in the size of awards would normally apply, based upon the period of time after the grant date and ending on the date of cessation of employment relative to the normal vesting period.
Where a Director leaves for any other reason, all annual bonus, annual bonus deferred shares and LTIP awards will lapse immediately on cessation.
Depending upon circumstances, the Committee may consider other payments to settle statutory entitlements, legal claims or potential legal claims, in respect of an unfair dismissal award, outplacement support and assistance with legal fees, including the statutory obligation in Israel to make a severance payment on cessation for any reason equal to one months gross salary for every year of service.
Terms of appointment for Non-Executive Directors The Non-Executive Directors serve subject to letters of appointment and are appointed subject to re-election at each annual general meeting.
The Non-Executive Directors are typically expected to serve for three years, although the Board may invite a Non-Executive Director to serve for an additional period.
Their letters of appointment are available for inspection at 888s registered office and at each annual general meeting.

How the views of shareholders are taken into account when determining Directors pay 888 engages with significant investors regarding remuneration issues and in respect of any proposed changes to the Directors Remuneration Policy and significant changes to operation of that policy and intends to continue doing so.
Views of shareholders and their representative bodies expressed at the annual general meeting and feedback received at other times will be considered by the Committee.
How the views of employees are taken into account when determining Directors pay 888 does not currently formally consult employees on remuneration but has a timetable and agenda of actions for 2019 to ensure it is compliant with the new requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code including consideration of workforce policies and practices and how it can best fulfil its obligations to engage with the wider workforce to explain the alignment of Executive Director pay to the wider organisation.
In determining the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, the Committee takes account of the policy for employees across the workforce.
In particular, when setting base salaries for executives, the Committee takes into account the salary increases being offered to the workforce as a whole.
The overall structure of the remuneration policy for Executive Directors is broadly consistent with that for other senior employees, but reflects the additional risks and responsibilities borne by the Executive Directors.
Executive remuneration and remuneration of senior employees is weighted towards performance-related pay.
888s Senior Vice Presidents all participate in the same annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements as the Executive Directors at varying levels of quantum and 888s Business Leadership Forum also participate in a long-term equity plan.

888. com Directors Remuneration Report Continued Operation of Remuneration Policy for 2019 Set out below is the proposed application of the Remuneration Policy for 2019.
Base salaries Salaries for 2019 are set out below: CEO Itai Pazner: Salary on appointment as Chief Executive Officer of ILS 2,520,000.
Salary remains unchanged from 2018 while Mr Frieberger remains as a Director during his notice period.
Salary increased by 2% compared to an average workforce increase of 4% 2018: 450,000.
Annual bonus The CEO, CFO and Mr Frieberger will have a maximum bonus opportunity of 150% of salary.
The Annual bonus will continue to be determined by like-for-like adjusted EBITDA with target payment of 50% of maximum for achieving a stretching budget figure increasing to full pay-out for a stretching target above budget.
For the first time this year, the target range will be lower than the prior year actual EBITDA, reflecting the extremely challenging regulatory environment in which 888 operates and the outlook for the year ahead.
The Committee considers that the targets are as stretching as those set last year given the outlook and regulatory environment and that preserving profitability at this level would represent an excellent result for 2019.
The Committee has determined that the target range is commercially sensitive, and therefore cannot disclose the targets in this report.
However, targets and performance against them will be disclosed retrospectively in next years annual report on remuneration.
Any bonus above 100% of salary will be deferred into shares in 888 which will vest in equal tranches over one, two and three years.
Long-term incentive plan Award levels The CEO will be granted an award under the 888 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2015 of 200% of salary, and the CFO 150% of salary.
No LTIP award will be granted to Mr Frieberger.
Performance conditions The Committee has considered carefully the performance metrics for the 2019 LTIP awards, given the increasingly difficult regulatory environment in which 888 operates and recognising the difficulty of setting accurate long-term financial performance conditions for the next 3-year LTIP performance period.
The Committee has, therefore, determined that all of the 2019 LTIP award will be based on a single performance condition measuring 888s total shareholder return performance relative to its peers.
The Committee believes this approach provides a strong alignment of interest between executives and shareholders.
Detail and target ranges TSR targets for 2019 awards: The Committee reviewed the relative TSR peer group to ensure it contains all relevant peers and is sufficiently large enough to provide a robust measure of performance and has arrived at a slightly revised group with the addition of five other sector peers.
The revised group will be used for awards granted from 2019.
The new peer group comprises the companies used in 2018, GVC Holdings plc, Sportech plc, Playtech plc, Paddy Power Betfair plc and William Hill plc, with the addition of Betsson AB, International Game Technology plc, JPJ Group plc, Kindred Group plc and OPAP SA.
25% of the award will vest if 888s TSR is equal to the TSR of the median company in the comparator group Threshold, and 100% will vest if 888's TSR is 33% i. e. 10% per annum compound or more above the TSR of the median company in the comparator group Maximum.
The Committee has reviewed whether the 10% out-performance requirement remains appropriate and is comfortable that, with the additional companies in the group, the 10% stretch target is sufficiently stretching, being equivalent to upper quartile performance or above.
Vesting will be on a proportionate basis for performance between Threshold and Maximum.
In addition to achieving the TSR condition, there will be an additional requirement that the Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR is reflective of underlying financial performance.
The 2019 awards will be subject to a two-year post vesting holding period.

Annual bonus payments in respect of 2018 performance The annual bonus opportunity was 150% of base salary and the bonus was determined by reference to challenging like-for-like adjusted EBITDA performance conditions.
Annual bonus in excess of 100% of salary is deferred into shares in one-third tranches for one, two and three years.
EBITDA performance The extent to which the EBITDA performance conditions in respect of 2018 performance were achieved is as follows: Actual Threshold Target Max performance Bonus awarded Performance Measures 25% pay-out 50% pay-out 100% pay-out % of maximum US$ 000 Like-for-like adjusted EBITDA growth per annum 5% 12.5% 20% 29.2% Itai Frieberger 387 Aviad Kobrine 251 To enable a like-for-like comparison with the prior year and to be comparable with the basis on which the growth targets were original set, the Committee has determined a range of criteria, which have been applied consistently for several years.
On this basis EBITDA growth is adjusted to take into account of: the Group's withdrawal from any markets during the year, to provide an assessment of the underlying performance of the core business: changes to gaming taxes arising in the year that were not included at the start of the year when the targets were set: and movements in foreign exchange rates from budgeted rates like-for-like adjusted EBITDA growth is calculated on constant currency basis.
70 888 Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Governance EBITDA performance continued The Committee agreed the following adjustments to the FY18 reported adjusted EBITDA for bonus purposes.
2018 Adjusted Reported Adjustments EBITDA US$ million US$ million US$ million YoY% Reported Adjusted EBITDA 107.1 6.4% Constant currency adjustment 2.3 104.7 Partial exit in 2017 and no operations in 2018 in certain markets 3.6 108.3 Indirect tax adjustments net 1.3 107.0 Like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA 107.0 6.3% Taking into account the underlying financial and operational performance of the business during the year, including the significant resources devoted again this year by the senior management team in assessing and delivering improvements to 888s responsible gaming tools, processes and technology, the Committee considered that the overall bonus out-turn was reflective of the solid performance of the Company and the management team over the year and that the pay-out levels were appropriate and that therefore no discretion was required to adjust the formulaic outcome.
There is no bonus deferral in shares as the bonus payable is less than 100% of salary.
