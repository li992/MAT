As highlighted in the following table, a majority of our performance measures are based on group KPIs as indicated by, which directly relate to strategy.
A reconciliation between measures used for the bonus assessment and the KPIs set out from page 20 can be found on page 130.
The Group scorecard is used in the determination of bonus payouts for all AstraZeneca employees.
Each metric within the scorecard is assessed on a standalone basis and has a defined payout range.
100% of target bonus will payout for on-target performance.
For employees, 200% of target bonus will payout for the maximum level of performance, however in line with our Remuneration Policy maximum bonus payouts for the CEO and CFO are capped at 180% and 150% of salary respectively equivalent to 180% and 167% of target bonus respectively.
The payout range for each metric is capped in line with each Executive Directors maximum bonus opportunity to ensure underperformance against one metric cannot be compensated for by overachievement against another.
As shown in the table below, this has resulted in a lower scorecard outcome for the CEO and CFO than the rest of the eligible employee population.
Performance below the specified threshold level for a metric will result in 0% payout for that metric.

The Return to Growth target is set and evaluated at budget exchange rates at the beginning of the year and evaluated at those rates at the end ofthe performance period, so that any beneficial or adverse movements in currency, which are outside the Companys control, do not impact reward outcomes.
The Return to Growth scorecard measure excludes certain medicines that are included in Growth Platform Product Sales reported elsewhere in this Annual Report, due to differences in definitions.
The difference for 2018 primarily arose as the scorecard measure included only new medicines within the Oncology Growth Platform.
The Cash flow measure is evaluated by reference to net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets and is set and evaluated at the actual exchange rate.
The Core EPS and Total Product Sales measures are evaluated by reference to budget exchange rates, again so that any beneficial or adverse movements in currency, which are outside the Companys control, do not impact reward outcomes.
The financial metricsreconcile with other disclosures in this Annual Report as follows: Proceeds from Group scorecard KPI disclosed Exchange Product Sales Capital disposal of outcome on pages 20-23 rate impact excluded expenditure intangible assets Product Sales from Growth Platforms $17,116m $18,464m $59m $1,407m Cash flow $3.9bn $2.6bn $1.0bn $2.3bn Core EPS $3.60 $3.46 $0.14 Total Product Sales $21.1bn $21.0bn $0.1bn Overall individual and business performance assessment Individual assessment During 2018, the Executive Directors individual performance was assessed in the following key areas which align with the Companys objectives: Pascal Soriot Focus on Under Pascal Soriots leadership, AstraZeneca has turned the corner and returned to Product Sales growth, made innovative science possible by Mr Soriots determined focus on the innovative science and investment necessary to deliver a new generation of medicines for patients, with a rebuilt and sustainable pipeline.
Mr Soriots exceptional leadership was also evident throughout 2018 to benefit AstraZenecas shareholders, employees and other important stakeholders.
For example, he represented AstraZeneca and the innovative biopharmaceutical industry in meetings with world leaders and senior politicians in key markets such as China, Russia, France and Germany, as well as the UK.
Demonstrating Following from his Chairmanship of the UK Brexit Industry Group in 2017, Mr Soriot co-chaired the Life Sciences leadership to support Council LSC with the UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the UK Secretary of developments within State for Health.
The LSC, accountable for the strategic direction of life science policy in the UK, developed detailed UK and global life strategies to develop the UK life sciences industry, as well as prepare for alternative Brexit scenarios.
sciences industry Mr Soriot has been influential in supporting industrial developments globally, including attending the CEO Council with the Chinese President Xi Jinping in June, the China Development Forum Fall Summit, and the WuXi World IOT Internet of Things congress in September 2018 as a keynote speaker.
Embedding a culture Through Mr Soriots leadership in 2018, AstraZeneca continued to be recognised as a global leader in this important focused on integrity area.
For example, AstraZeneca was ranked third in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and was ranked third and sustainability among all UK companies and 34th overall in the Global 100 Index a ranking of the worlds most sustainable companies across all sectors, placing AstraZeneca in the top 2% of companies for sustainability performance.
Making AstraZeneca During 2018, our internal KPIs were exceeded with 19.4% of leaders coming from Emerging Markets, an a great place to work improvement from 13.5% in 2017.
We also saw an increase in the percentage of senior roles held by women and were achieve pleased that AstraZeneca was included in the 2018 Hampton-Alexander Review 7th for women in executive demonstrable committee roles and their direct reports and as the only major pharmaceutical company listed in Bloombergs advances in Gender-Equality Index.
Employee engagement is high with internal surveys showing 94% of respondents inclusion, diversity understand AstraZenecas future direction and strategic priorities and 83% would recommend AstraZeneca as a and employee great place to work compared with the Global Pharmaceutical norms of 87% and 80% respectively.

He has also focused the Company on making productivity improvements as it moves into the next phase of its strategy which, over time, should result in margin improvements.
While maintaining the global organisations focus on delivering AstraZenecas 2018 financial objectives, under Mr Dunoyers stewardship, Global Finance Services were rolled out to our top 12 markets providing standardised and centrally managed efficient financial services.
This has driven productivity and created value through robotics and innovation.
He has also successfully executed a functional transformation rebalancing finance resources to Regional Delivery Centres in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Warsaw, Poland, and San Jose, Costa Rica, improving efficiency and reducing cost.
Develop Global In addition to his responsibilities as CFO, Mr Dunoyer leads the Companys Global Business Services GBS Function.
Business Services GBS is a key enabler of our strategic performance, leveraging digital technology, data analytics and artificial intelligence function to achieve to create capacity, to simplify and improve processes, and to provide greater automation and smart analytics.
Under Mr cost savings Dunoyers leadership, savings of $53 million were realised in 2018 through initiatives such as the expansion of our Global Content Centre, providing local AstraZeneca commercial markets standard product and promotional materials, eliminating inefficiencies and duplication.
Achieve Scientific Mr Dunoyers additional responsibilities include leading AstraZeneca in Japan, which delivered a strong performance in Leadership Japan 2018 exceeding its performance target overall.
Seven successful launches in Japan in 2018, including for Fasenra, Lynparza, Tagrisso and Imfinzi were significant contributions.
An example of the excellent performance delivered under Mr Dunoyers leadership is the fact that two thirds of patients new to biologic treatments had been treated with Fasenra within five months of its approval.
Embedding a culture Mr Dunoyer is the Champion for our Young Health Programme YHP which the Board was proud to see named focused on integrity Community Investment Program of the Year by the 2018 Ethical Corporation Responsible Business awards.
YHP reflects and sustainability our commitment to building a sustainable future: its an investment in young people and an investment in health by empowering young people with knowledge and skills to make healthy choices and take control of their future.
In September 2018, Mr Dunoyer visited our YHP site in Kenya to provide some direct support on the ground.
By midSeptember, the YHP in Kenya had trained 40 peer educators and 54 community-based health workers and volunteers and was working with 47 primary and secondary schools to operationalise school health clubs.
It has also trained 129 community leaders on non-communicable disease risk behaviours, Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health and gender equality.
Business assessment The Committee then reviewed the formulaic Group scorecard outcome for 2018 in the context of business performance and shareholder experience over the year.
A number of significant events and one-off items, both positive and negative, that were unforeseen when targets were set were considered.
These included: unanticipated reductions in corporate income tax rates that positively impacted Core EPS : a one-off cash inflow following the resolution of long-running litigation: and a decision of the European Medicines Agency limiting the approval of Imfinzi in Europe to a narrower lung cancer patient population than other regulators.

2019 Annual bonus performance measures and operation The Group scorecard measures and weightings for 2019 differ from the 2018 Group scorecard as follows: Two new Accelerate Innovative Science indices replace Achieve Scientific Leadership metrics, measuring regulatory milestones submissions and approvals and milestones in clinical trials, reflecting lateand early-stage science progression.
Moving to dual indices simplifies our remuneration structure, by reducing the number of metrics.
The weighting of the Cash flow metric within the Group scorecard has been increased from 10% to 20%, with financial measures now accounting for 80% of the scorecard.
This change in weightings reflects the importance of cash flow generation for the phase our business has now entered, as we aim to sustain investment in our pipeline while meeting our capital allocation priorities.
The Cash flow metric remains as net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets.
The Return to Growth measure will now be known as Deliver Growth and Therapy Area Leadership reflecting the next phase of strategy: the underlying measure has not changed.

The 2015 AZIP awards granted on 27 March 2015 are due to vest and be released on 1 January 2023 on completion of a further four-year holding period.
In 2016, the Committee replaced the original cliff vesting approach for outstanding AZIP awards with a sliding scale, whereby 25% of an award will lapse in respect of any year in the performance period in which either of the performance targets are not achieved.
Performance over the period from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2018 will result in 75% of the 2015 AZIP vesting, as the dividend cover target was not met in the fourth year of the performance period.

The Return to Growth measure is thus considered to be commercially sensitive and will be disclosed following the end of the performance period.
This measure is evaluated by reference to budget exchange rates.
Achieve Scientific Leadership The Achieve Scientific Leadership measure includes three equally weighted metrics: NME approvals, major life-cycle management approvals and Phase III registration.
These metrics are an indicator of the Companys longer-term strategic priorities and are thus considered commercially sensitive: the metrics will be disclosed following the end of the performance period.
PSP performance measures for 2019 grant The 2019 PSP measures differ from the 2018 PSP measures as follows: Two new Accelerate Innovative Science indices measuring regulatory events and NME Phase III registrational volume replace the Achieve Scientific Leadership metrics.
Moving to dual indices simplifies our remuneration structure by reducing the number of metrics and allows disclosure of targets at the beginning of the performance period.

The Deliver Growth and Therapy Area Leadership and EBITDA measures are evaluated by reference to budget exchange rates such that beneficial or adverse movements in currency, which are outside the Companys control, do not impact reward outcomes.
The EBITDA measure is assessed using cumulative Reported EBITDA, excluding non-cash movements on fair value of contingent consideration on business combinations and gains on disposals of intangible assets.
The Cash flow measure is evaluated using net cumulative cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets.
The companies in the TSR comparator group are shown on page 140.
As described on page 128 in relation to annual bonus targets, the Committee similarly takes into account a wide range of data to ensure that thestretching nature of PSP hurdles is robustly tested and that financial targets are aligned with the businesss Long Range Plan.
While the adjustments to Reported EBITDA, described above, mean that the PSP hurdles are not directly comparable with market consensus, the Committee will take consensus into account when determining the appropriate level of stretch.

136 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2018 Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Directors shareholdings Audited Minimum shareholding requirements The CEO is required to build a shareholding and hold shares amounting to 300% of base salary and the CFO is required to hold shares amounting to 200% of base salary, each within five years of their dates of appointment.
Shares that count towards these minimum shareholding requirements are shares beneficially held by the Executive Director and their connected persons and share awards that are not subject to further performance conditions.
Share awards included are DBP shares in deferral periods and PSP and AZIP shares in holding periods, on a net of tax basis.
On this basis, as at 31 December 2018 Mr Soriot and Mr Dunoyer held shares worth 569% and 808% of base salary respectively and had fulfilled their minimum shareholding requirements.
The Committee has introduced a further post-employment shareholding requirement for Executive Directors.
For two years following cessation of employment, Executive Directors are required to hold shares to the value of the shareholding guideline that applied at the cessation of their employment: or, in cases where the individual has not had sufficient time to build up shares to meet their guideline, the actual level of shareholding at cessation.

Over that period Mr Soriot has gifted 512,699 beneficially owned Ordinary Shares to family members for nil consideration.
The family members to whom the shares have been gifted do not constitute connected persons for the purposes of this disclosure, so are not included within Mr Soriots beneficial shareholding figure in the above table.
A detailed breakdown of the Executive Directors interests under Company share plans is set out on page 138.
Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to build up, over a period of three years, a shareholding in the Company with a value approximately equivalent to the basic annual fee for a Non-Executive Director 88,000 during 2018 or, in the case of the Chairman, approximately equivalent to his basic annual fee 625,000 during 2018.
All Non-Executive Directors who had served for a period of three years or more as at 31December2018 held sufficient shares to fulfil this expectation.

138 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2018 Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Remuneration in the wider context When making decisions about executive remuneration and setting the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee takes into account the arrangements in place for AstraZenecas wider workforce.
The Committee undertakes a detailed review of global workforce remuneration data annually.
It also considers data on pay trends and practices, such as gender pay gap information, and this year for the first time, the CEO to worker pay ratio.
The approach to determining the compensation of employees globally follows the same principles as for our executives.
We offer competitive payand career opportunities, which attract the best talent: we believe in recognising strong individual performance, and we differentiate rewardaccordingly.
When determining compensation, managers consider how the employees pay compares to the local market alongside otherfactors, such as the individuals experience and sustained performance.
Bonus budgets are based on the Group scorecard outcome andmanagers will determine final employee bonuses based on individual performance.
Around 25% of the global workforce are eligible forLTIawards.
Being a great place to work is a key pillar of our strategy, and at the heart of our efforts to foster the talents of our people.
Pay is just one factorthat helps us to attract, retain and develop a talented and diverse workforce.
We encourage employees to take ownership of their own development, with the support of leaders throughout the business.
Initiatives such as our Women as Leaders programme, which aims to encourage more women into senior roles: tailored online learning platforms for managers and employees covering topics such as unconscious bias: and employee networks, such as our LGBT network, help us to fulfil our commitment to fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace.
Employee surveys show that 83% of our employees would recommend AstraZeneca as a great place to work: more information about this important part of our strategy is set out on pages 38 to 49.
Change in CEO remuneration compared to other employees In the table below, changes to the CEOs salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus are compared to a group of employees over the same period 2017 to 2018.
The comparator group includes employees in the UK, US and Sweden who represent approximately 25% of our total employee population we consider that this group is representative of the Groups major science, business and enabling units.
These employee populations are also well balanced in terms of seniority and demographics.
We have used a consistent employee comparator group, so the same individuals appear in both the 2017 and 2018 figures, allowing a meaningful comparison of salary increases.
Percentage change for Average percentage change CEO against 2017 for employees against 2017 Salary 2.5% 4.6% Taxable benefits 0.4 % 4.6% Annual bonus 3.0 % 13.3% CEO and employee pay ratios The table below sets out the ratios of the CEO single total figure of remuneration to the equivalent pay for the lower quartile, median and upper quartile UK employees calculated on a fulltime equivalent basis.
The ratios have been calculated in accordance with the Companies Miscellaneous Reporting Requirements 2018 the Regulations, which were published during 2018 and will first apply to AstraZenecas financial year beginning 1 January 2019.
These pay ratios form part of the information that is provided to the Committee on broader employee pay policies and practices to inform remuneration decisions for the Executive Directors.
Year Method 25th percentile pay ratio 50th percentile pay ratio 75th percentile pay ratio 2018 Option A 230:1 160:1 103:1 Pay data 000 Base salary Total pay CEO remuneration 1,251 11,356 UK employees 25th percentile 36 49 UK employees 50th percentile 50 71 UK employees 75th percentile 70 110 The comparison with UK employees is specified by the Regulations.
This group represents approximately 10% of our total employee population.
The Regulations provide flexibility to adopt one of three methods of calculation: we have chosen Option A which is a calculation based on all UK employees on a full-time equivalent basis.
The ratios are based on total pay which includes base salary, benefits, bonus and long-term incentives.
The CEO pay is as shown in the single total figure of remuneration table, on page 126.
For UK employees, quartile data has been determined as at 31 December 2018, with calculations based on actual pay data for January to November 2018.
Estimates have been used for December 2018 pay, annual bonus outcomes and dividend equivalents.
As explained earlier in this Report, the majority of the CEO total pay for the year is driven by performance-related elements, notably the long-term incentive element and share price growth during the period.
The ratios may therefore vary significantly year-on-year depending on bonus and PSP outcomes and share price movements.
The ratio of CEO pay excluding LTI versus median UK employee pay is 51:1.
