Our current remuneration policy was approved at the 2017 Annual General Meeting and it will therefore be renewed next year at the 2020 Annual General Meeting.
The Companys remuneration structure for senior executives remains straightforward and closely linked to performance.
The package comprises three elements: Copper production increased Fixed pay salary and benefits: by 14% and revenues increased Annual bonus: and Long-term performance-based share awards.

Performance highlights in 2018 Lynda Armstrong OBE In 2018, the Group continued to deliver high growth in production, Chair of the Remuneration Committee earnings and operating cash flows, from its portfolio of low cost copper mines.
Copper production increased by 14% and revenues increased by 12% year on year, whilst the Group maintained its position in the first quartile of the cost curve.
Its net cash cost of copper remains amongst the lowest of any pure play copper company globally.
The new Bozshakol and Aktogay mines are now fully ramped up and the Group is focused on consistently operating at design capacity, identifying opportunities for improving efficiency and reducing costs in existing operations.
We are also planning for, and looking forward to delivering, future growth from the Aktogay expansion and our newly acquired Baimskaya copper project inRussia.
The Group is entering an important phase in the construction of the Aktogay expansion project, with the main structural works set to commence in 2019.
This project will add 80 kt per annum of copper production between 2022 and 2027 which will generate additional cashflow to help finance our future growth.
In August 2018, the Group agreed to acquire the Baimskaya copper project in Russia, with Initial Completion taking place in January 2019.
Baimskaya is a large scale, copper porphyry deposit with a low strip ratio of 0.8 and a strong gold by-product, making it similar to Bozshakol but with higher average copper and gold grades with projected lower capital intensity.
Through this acquisition and the Aktogay expansion project, we have established a pipeline of value-accretive major projects, to enable the Group to continue delivering high growth in copper production.

Executive Directors Long Term Incentive Plan awards Awards granted to executive Directors under the LTIP in 2015 and 2016 were subject to a relative TSR performance condition, with TSR measured against a bespoke group of global mining companies over two different performance periods consistent with the approach and vesting schedule from prior years described on pages 99 and 100.
The vesting outcome for the 2015 and 2016 awards is summarised in the table below: Weighting as a % 2015 LTIP award of total award Performance period Performance Vesting Sub-award 1 50% 3 years to 31 December 2017 Above upper-quartile 100% performance disclosed in 2017 Remuneration Report Sub-award 2 50% 3 years to 31 May 2018 Above upper-quartile 100% Total vesting 100% 2016 LTIP award Sub-award 1 50% 3 years to 31 December 2018 Above upper-quartile 100% Sub-award 2 50% 3 years to 31 May 2019 N A Total vesting Final vesting will be determined following the end of the performance period for the second sub-award.
For the 2016 LTIP award, the first sub-award is subject to TSR performance measured over the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018.
Over this period the Company has significantly outperformed peers in terms of total shareholder return, a period over which copper production grew from 85 kt in 2015 to 295 kt in 2018.
The Company was positioned in second place against the comparator group and this is reflected in the values achieved from the plan.
The vesting outcome for the second sub-award of the 2016 LTIP award is based on TSR performance measured over the period from 1 June 2016 to 31 May 2019 and will therefore be assessed at a later date.
The 2016 award including any vesting of the first sub-award will be eligible for vesting during 2019, after the assessment of performance over both periods.
Circa 75% of the value shown for the LTIP in the 2018 single figure table, is attributable to share price growth and dividends.
There is a strong alignment between the LTIP outcomes and the shareholder experience.
