DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY The Policy described in this section was approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM on 28 April 2017.
Minimal wording changes have been made to the Policy below to reflect the approval of the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP at the 2016 AGM, to remove the legacy pension arrangement for the former Chief Executive Officer and to update the scenario charts for the 2019 Executive Director remuneration levels.
The full version of the Policy approved by shareholders can be found in the 2016 Annual Report available online at www.
Policy overview The Groups Remuneration Policy is to reward senior management competitively, enabling Ultra to recruit, motivate and retain executives of a high calibre, whilst avoiding making excessive remuneration payments.
The remuneration of Executive Directors and senior managers is aligned with the Groups objectives and the interests of shareholders.

2 The Remuneration Policy, described above, provides an overview of the structure that operates for the most senior executives in the Group.
Lower levels of incentive operate for employees below executive level, with remuneration driven by market comparators and the impact of the role.
Long-Term Incentives are reserved for those anticipated as having the greatest potential to influence the Groups earnings growth and share price performance, although as the Committee is aware of the benefits which wider employee share ownership can generate, all employees are encouraged to participate in the AESOP and Savings Related Share Option Scheme in the countries in which they are offered.
3 The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflect the Committees view that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging and largely tied to financial performance.
Underlying operating cash conversion and profit are both Key Performance Indicators of the Group.
The performance conditions applicable to the LTIP 2019 awards were selected by the Committee on the basis that: Total Shareholder Return TSR, one of the Groups Key Performance Indicators, aligns the performance objectives of the Executive Directors more closely with the interests of the shareholders: Organic revenue growth provides an indication of the rate at which the Groups business activity is expanding: Organic operating profit growth demonstrates that the additional revenue is being gained without profit margins being compromised: and ROIC is felt to be an appropriate measure for the Company to focus on over the medium to long term and an appropriate measure of how well the Company is performing and being managed.
4 None of the employee share plans operate performance conditions.
5 As highlighted above, Ultra has a share ownership policy which requires the Executive Directors to build up and maintain a target holding equal to 200% of base salary.
Details of the extent to which the Executive Directors had complied with the policy are set out on page 73.
6 For the avoidance of doubt, authority is given to Ultra to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors such as, but not limited to, the payment of a pension or the vesting exercise of past share awards that have been disclosed to and approved by shareholders in previous Remuneration Reports.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.

DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY continued Director recruitment policy The Nomination Committee typically considers both internal and external candidates before any new appointment is made.
New Executive Directors are provided with remuneration consisting of base salary, short-term incentive, long-term incentive and other benefits.
Salary Ultras policy is to set pay for Executive Directors at industry-competitive levels, taking market capitalisation and annual sales into account.
It is recognised that a new appointee may not have as much experience as someone at a competitive level and may therefore be offered a salary below competitive levels, but at a level that is sufficient to attract the right person for the job.
Their salary would then be increased to an industry-competitive level as they gain experience.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee may exercise its discretion to offer an above-industry, competitive-level salary in order to attract the best person.
Short-term incentives Short-term incentives are offered in line with those paid to other Executive Directors.
Maximum opportunities will be in line with current plan maximums for existing Executive Directors i. e. 125% of salary p. a..
The Company may also apply different performance measures if it feels these appropriately meet the strategic objectives and aims of the Company whilst incentivising the new appointment.
Long-term incentives Long-term incentives are offered in line with those paid to other Executive Directors.
Maximum opportunities will be subject to the maximum levels described in the Policy table.
Other benefits Other benefits are offered in line with those paid to other Executive Directors.
Buyouts To facilitate recruitment, the Committee may make an award to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Committee will take account of all relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards and the time over which they would have vested or been paid.
Ultra may make use of the flexibility provided in the Listing Rules LR 9.4.
2 to make awards if appropriate.
Where possible, incentives will be bought out on a like-for-like basis with respect to vesting payment dates, currency i. e. cash versus shares and the use of performance targets.
Non-Executive Directors The approach to the recruitment of Non-Executive Directors is to pay an annual fixed fee, having considered existing Non-Executive Directors fee levels, market levels and expected time commitment.
In deciding whether to accept any fee increase the Non-Executive Directors consider Company performance.
Executive Directors' service contracts The Groups policy is to ensure that the Executive Directors service contracts have a notice period of one year, which the Committee considers appropriately reflects both current market practice and the balance between the interests of the Group and each Executive Director.
The following table provides more information on each Executive Directors service contract: Name Effective date of contract Notice Period S Pryce 18 Jun 2018 12 months A Sharma 2 May 2016 12 months No Executive Directors have provisions in their contracts for compensation on early termination other than for the notice period.
External appointments of Executive Directors Executive Directors may accept no more than one external appointment as a Non-Executive Director excluding Chair.
Up to 50% of any time spent undertaking such external duties can be taken as additional unpaid leave with the remainder being treated as annual holiday.

10 No current Executive Directors have LTIP awards vesting in the year.
Annual bonus for year under review Audited Annual bonuses in relation to 2018 were based upon the achievement of a sliding scale of underlying profit before tax and underlying operating cash flow targets.
Targets were derived from the annual budgets approved by the Board and adjusted where appropriate to provide a suitable degree of stretch challenge and incentive to outperform.
Profit and cash are two of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured.
Please refer to pages 10 and 11 for details.
The bonus targets set by the Committee for 2018 were: a maximum of 31.25% of salary subject to the achievement of 101.4m underlying profit before tax : and a maximum of 93.75% of salary subject to achieving an underlying operating cash flow of 100.8m and the Committee exercising its discretion on movements in working capital to ensure working capital management throughout the financial year was in the short and long-term interests of the Company.
The Committee assessed the achievement of performance against each target as follows: 1 Threshold Maximum 0% payable 100% payable Actual achieved Bonus payable '000 '000 '000 % Underlying profit before tax 91,244 101,382 101,379 31.25% Underlying operating cash flow 70,560 100,800 89,253 57.00% 1 The underlying operating cash flow element is payable only if the profit element achieves threshold.
The Committee determined that bonuses of 88.25% of salary would be payable to the Executive Directors.
The bonus for Simon Pryce was pro-rated to reflect time served in the year.
In line with the policy, 20% of any bonus awarded is deferred into shares for three years.
