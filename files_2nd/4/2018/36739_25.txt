The Remuneration Committee does not have a formal positioning policy for base salary as it is acutely aware of the issues around setting pay solely by reference to a benchmark reference point.
During the period under review the Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors and other senior executives, in the context of the current performance of the Company and the levels of pay increases applied throughout the Groups national and international businesses.
This approach is consistent with previous years.

Such appointments are seen as a way in which Executive Directors can gain a broader business experience and, in turn, benefit the Company.
Currently, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director do not hold any external Non-executive Directorships.
Service contracts and loss of office payments The Companys policy in relation to contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, is that they should be fair to the individual, the Company and shareholders.
In the case of termination by the Company, the Director will be given twelve months notice, including where there is a change of control.
The Director will give not less than six months notice, except where there is a change of control when it will be ninety days.
Where a Director receives a payment in lieu of notice this will include base salary and benefits, to which the Executive Director is entitled including any bonus accrued up until the date of termination notwithstanding that the date of termination may be prior to the date the bonus is actually paid.
The Remuneration Committee also has discretion to incorporate payments under the performance-linked elements of the package under good leaver scenarios.
More details can be found in the Companys Remuneration Policy on the Companys website.
How the Remuneration Policy will be implemented for 2019 Executive Directors Salary Base salaries were reviewed in December 2018 and as from 1 January 2019 are: Chief Executive 520,000 Finance Director 364,000 This represents an increase of 2.4% which is in line with the increase to other employees within the Group.
Salaries will next be reviewed in December 2019 for the financial year 2020.
Annual bonus The annual bonus opportunity for 2019 will remain unchanged as follows: Chief Executive Maximum opportunity of 125% of base salary 80% paid in cash 20% delivered in shares Finance Director Maximum opportunity of 125% of base salary 80% paid in cash 20% delivered in shares The Committee can disclose that for the 2019 financial year the annual bonus targets will be equally weighted towards: Growth in UEPS: Budgeted underlying operating profit: Underlying operating margins: and Achievement of budgeted internal ROIC at budgeted exchange rates.
The Remuneration Committee will determine an appropriate performance range for each measure used.
The Committee considers that the performance targets are commercially sensitive and so will not be disclosed prospectively.
However the Committee will disclose performance against these measures and their targets in the Companys 2019 Annual Report.
Share plans The Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the Companys AGM in May 2017, permits the Committee to grant awards under the LTIP up to a maximum of 150% of base salary.
However the Committee has no plans to exercise this approval to the maximum and intend to make an award in 2019 in respect of the performance period 1 January 2019 31 December 2021, of 125% of base salary, subject to the following performance conditions: Vesting amount Absolute UEPS growth over three years 50% TSR 50% of the award of the award 0% Vesting Less than 15% Below median 25% Vesting 15% Median Maximum vesting 30% Upper quartile Straight line vesting will apply between these two points.

Explanation of chosen performance measures and how targets are set Performance measures have been selected that reflect the Groups strategy.
Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual bonus and LTIP awards.
In setting these stretching performance targets the Remuneration Committee will take into account a number of different reference points such as the Groups business plans and strategy.
The Remuneration Committee considers that underlying EPS and profit before tax are closely aligned to the Groups key performance metrics and, in conjunction with the other annual bonus performance metrics, provide a balanced measurement of performance that encourages sustainable growth.
The UEPS and TSR performance conditions attaching to the LTIP align managements objectives to those of shareholders and reward the delivery of year on year growth and delivery of value to shareholders.
For the relative TSR performance condition there will be no vesting for performance below median compared to the comparator group.
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust the performance targets and measures where it considers it appropriate to do so.
For example, to reflect changes in the strategy or structure of the business or in prevailing market conditions and to assess performance on a fair and consistent basis from year to year.
Operation of share plans The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to operate the Companys share plans in accordance with their rules, including the ability to adjust awards in the event of a variation of capital or other relevant corporate event, and settle awards in cash.
Differences in the Groups policy for the remuneration of employees generally The Group aims to provide a remuneration package that is market competitive in the employees jurisdiction of employment and which: is appropriate to attract, retain, motivate and reward, without paying more than necessary: is fairly and consistently applied: and includes an element of incentive to share in the financial success of the Group through: annual bonuses, based upon the performance of individual business units, executive share options and a UK SAYE scheme, all of which are aligned to the strategic objectives and performance of the Group.
