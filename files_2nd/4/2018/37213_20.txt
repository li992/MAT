Remuneration Committees REMUNERATION CONTEXT The new corporate governance guidelines were published on 16 July report for the year ended 2018, some of which the Company already follows as good practice, others it will be implementing in line within the required time frames 31 December 2018 during 2019.
As already mentioned in the wider Annual Report, during the second half of the year, the PRA announced its industry-wide consultation CP13 18 on equity release mortgages, creating market uncertainty that required Just to assess a variety of potential outcomes and subsequently affecting various aspects of the business.
In relation to people and reward, it impacted the Companys ability to attract talent to the Group and retain some individuals.
Despite these challenges, the Group has continued to achieve significant growth in sales and underlying operating profit and remains focused on serving its customers while growing its profits and margins.
During the third quarter of the year Simon Thomas, Chief Financial Officer, left the Company with prior agreement.
In light of his long service and the on-going consultation on CP13 18 it was of particular importance to retain Simon Thomas.
The Committee deemed that good leaver treatment of his remuneration was in the best interest of shareholders.
Full details of how his remuneration was treated can be seen in a separate section below.
REMUNERATION IN 2018 At the AGM in May 2017, a binding vote approved our new Remuneration Policy the Policy, which reflected developments in markets and good remuneration practice.
Remuneration practices in 2018 were focused primarily on embedding our Policy for the Group and reviewing the remuneration arrangements of senior employees, including our three Executive Directors, an outline of which is described below: Base salary increases for 2018 Salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed with effect from 1 April each year along with those of the overall employee population.
As disclosed last year, the three Executive Directors received an average salary increase of 2.5%, consistent with other employees.
Short Term Incentive Plan STIP Pages 73 and 74 detail the targets and outcomes relating to 2018, as well as remuneration received relating to the year.
For performance in 2018 the Committee approved awards for the Executive Directors at 92% level for the financial measures, reflecting the strong financial performance of the Group.
Taking into account the non-financial performance element, this resulted in total bonuses of between 76% and 92% of the maximum being awarded.
In line with the policy, two-thirds of bonus earned was paid post-tax in cash and one-third deferred into shares for three years, except for Simon Thomas as noted STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 65 below.

REMUNERATION FOR EMPLOYEES BELOW THE BOARD General Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Policy for the wider Group is designed to attract, retain and motivate new and existing employees.
It is in line with the sector in which we operate and our overall total remuneration approach is to pay a market competitive level of remuneration that is structured to appropriately reward employees, align them with the interests of our shareholders and customers and be relevant to the markets geographies in which we operate.
We define total remuneration as base salary, annual incentive STIP and any benefits, for example pensions.
For those eligible to participate in the LTIP this will also be included.
Summary of the remuneration structure for employees below Executive Director Remuneration element Policy approach BASE SALARY To attract and retain key employees we pay salaries which deliver market competitive total remuneration.
We take into account the following when determining the base salary: the size of the role and its scope, the required skills, knowledge and experience, relevant pay in terms of the wider organisation and appropriate market comparative data.
For 2018 the average salary increase for all employees was set at 2.5%.
This is an average figure, with individual increases varying within a range depending on the factors above.
SHORT TERM INCENTIVE Most of our employees participate in a discretionary bonus plan, unless an alternative plan, for example in relation PLAN to sales roles, is in operation.
This plan is based on the achievement of corporate Company performance and personal performance, the latter is based on objectives, behaviours in line with our culture and conduct in the role.
For regulated roles, for example in risk, audit or compliance roles, an element of the financial performance may be replaced by functional performance.
The Group also operates bonus plans for certain types of roles, for example sales, based on objectives, behaviours in line with our culture and conduct in the role.
The Remuneration Committee has the ultimate discretion on all incentive plans and these are reviewed on an annual basis.
Bonuses for all of the executive team who are not Board members have an element of bonus deferred into shares for three years.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE Participation in the LTIP is for a small number of executives and key roles each year in recognition of the strategic PLAN and critical roles that they hold in supporting the strategic direction of the business and delivering Company performance.
In 2018 fewer than 50 people were granted awards.
OTHER SHARE PLANS The Company operates a deferred share bonus plan DSBP which provides the vehicle for the deferral of the STIP award.
PENSION All employees are provided with the opportunity to participate in the Group defined contribution pension plan.
OTHER BENEFITS All employees are able to participate in the private medical cover scheme.
