Ourdiscretionary approach also ensures we can reflect performance on management of risks and adherence to compliance controls in pay outcomes see page 89.
We have comprehensively reviewed the peer groups that we use when considering pay outcomes for the executive Directors.
No peer group is perfect: all companies are different so there are few if any that face exactly the same opportunities and challenges that we do.
However, in setting annual bonus outcomes we focus primarily on paying for performance rather than positioning against market rates, with the peer groups used as a sense check for remuneration decisions rather than as a driver.
As such, we concluded that both ourasset management and FTSE-100 financial services peer groups provide useful context for our decision-making, as well as the wider FTSE-100 see page 80.
The 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code includes new provisions onexecutive pay, against which we are well positioned.

Our remuneration principles The overall remuneration policy is designed to promote the long-term success of the Group.
The Committee has developed the remuneration policy with the following principles in mind: Aligned with A significant proportion of higher-earning employees and material risk takers variable remuneration clients is granted as fund awards, which are notional investments in funds managed by the Group, thereby aligning the interests of employees and clients.
This includes the executive Directors, other members of the GMC and other key employees such as senior fund managers.
Aligned with A significant proportion of variable remuneration is granted in the form of deferred awards over shareholders Schroders shares, thereby aligning the interests of employees and shareholders.
Executive Directors and other members of the GMC are required, over time, to acquire and retain a significant holding of Schroders shares or rights to shares.
On stepping down, the executive Directors are required to maintain a level of shareholding for two years.
Aligned with The total spend on remuneration is managed as a percentage of net income, the total compensation financial ratio.
This ratio is determined by the Committee and recommended to the Board.
This approach performance aligns remuneration with financial performance.
The bottom section of this table outlines how each of our key performance indicators is factored into determining the variable elements ofthe executive Directors remuneration.
Competitive Employees receive a competitive remuneration package, which is reviewed annually and benchmarked by reference to the external market.
This allows us to attract and retain highly talented people, who know that good performance will be rewarded.
Designed to Deferred variable remuneration does not give rise to any immediate entitlement.
Awards normally encourage require the participant to be employed continuously by the Group until at least the third anniversary retention of grant in order to vest in full.

Under the Groups malus and clawback policy, these terms can be used to risk-adjust deferred remuneration awards in a range of circumstances.
In addition, the executive Directors contracts extend clawback terms to the upfront cash portion of any annual bonus awards, in the event of individual misconduct.
Personal To align their interests with those of shareholders, the executive Directors are required to acquire and retain a holding shareholding ofSchroders shares or rights to shares equivalent to 300% of base salary, or 500% of base salary for the Group Chief policy Executive.

Variable remuneration awards for individual employees, other than those determined by the Committee or the Group Chief Executive, are recommended to the Group Chief Executive by members of the GMC, taking account of individual performance against objectives, the performance of the relevant business area and the levels of reward for comparable roles in the market.
The Committee determines the remuneration for the executive Directors and Group Company Secretary, monitors and reviews remuneration for other GMC members, control function heads and other MRTs, and also provides oversight of the compensation review outcomes for employees more broadly.
For 2018, the Committee was satisfied that the year-end process was rigorous and that the allocation of the pool and the individual bonus awards took account of both financial and non-financial performance, including conduct and behaviours as described on page89.

An assessment of each individuals performance was also made, including business performance within each individuals responsibilities, and the extent to which they have met annual objectives.
Financial factors such as profitability, cost control and investment performance represent the majority of measures the Committee considers to ensure that remuneration outcomes are aligned to the value created for shareholders.
Both short-term and long-term performance are taken into account.
Strategic progress is also a key element of the Committees consideration.
Non-financial factors such as risk management, conduct and employee engagement are also considered, although normally have less prominence in determining the annual bonus award.
Based on its assessment of performance, the Committee applied its judgement to determine annual bonus awards, without attaching a weighting to each performance factor or setting a value payable for achievement of each target.
The Group Chief Executives recommendation was taken into account for the Chief Financial Officer.
Group-wide factors considered when determining the executive Directors annual bonus awards include: Criteria Target Performance in 2018 Extent to which target has been met Financial factors Trend in profit Ratio of total cost to 64% 2017: 61%.

Performance against many of these metrics is disclosed in the half-year and annual results announcements and in the Annual Report and Accounts.

The criteria for determining the extent of vesting are set out below.
The composite index against which EPS performance was measured for these awards was set at the time they were granted, as 60% equities, measured by the Morgan Stanley Capital International MSCI All Country Index, and 40% fixed income, measured by the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Index.

For the executive Directors, the sum of employer contributions and cash in lieu each year is reflected in the single total remuneration figures on page 79.
Employer contributions represent contributions paid into DC pension arrangements during the year and exclude any contributions made by the Directors.
There has been no DB pension accrual since 30 April 2011.
Accrued DB pensions are subject to actuarial reduction on early retirement so there is no enhanced benefit entitlement in these circumstances.
