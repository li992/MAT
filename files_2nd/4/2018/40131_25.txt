Following this review, the triggers for which malus and clawback may be applied have been extended to include wider range of scenarios.
Thenew malus and clawback policy will apply to variable pay in relation to awards made from 1 March 2019 for all participants and also, for Executive Directors and the senior leadership team, to the cash element of the annual bonus.

The Committee reviewed the Groups performance and agreed that no scale-back was appropriate.
2 The Committee retains the discretion to amend each element of the bonus, up or down, within the overall cap of 150% of salary, to take into account other relevant factors such as the Groups performance compared to competitor organisations or, for instance, an exceptional positive or negative event which impacts the Group.

3 Half of the bonus is paid in cash, with the remainder being invested in the Companys shares and deferred for three years, under the Groups deferred bonusplan.
In setting the operating profit target for the year it was assumed that the combined operating experience variance and operating assumption changes would have a neutral impact on the outcome for the year.
The actual outcome for the year included a combined positive impact of 50.4 million to the operating profit and therefore had a positive effect on the base figure on which bonuses are calculated.
The Committee concluded that this positive outcome was asaresult of management action during the year and should therefore be included when assessing the bonus payout for the year.

These willvest on 24 March 2019, being the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The vested shares for Executive Directors are subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period other than to sell shares to settle tax on vesting or exercise.
The performance conditions which applied to the 2016 PSP awards, and the actual performance achieved against these conditions, are set out in the tables below: Average annual adjusted EPS growth Average annual adjusted EPS growth including the unwind of the discount excluding the unwind of the discount 1 2 3 TSR relative to the FTSE 51 to 150 rate in excess of RPI rate in excess of RPI Performance % of one third Performance % of one third Performance % of one third Performance level hurdle required of award vesting required of award vesting required of award vesting Below threshold Below Median 0% Below 5% 0% Below 5% 0% Threshold Median 25% At least 5% 25% At least 5% 25% Stretch or above Upper Quartile or above 100% 16% or above 100% 16% or above 100% Actual Achieved 33 out of 82 companies 56.1% 25.1% 100% 32.1% 100% 1 FTSE 51-150 index excluding investment trusts and companies in the FTSE oil, gas and mining sectors.

This measure excludes the direct impact of the stock market fluctuations and changes in economic assumptions on the final years performance.
3 The second EPS performance condition is calculated by reference to an adjusted post-tax EEV operating profit, which strips out the unwind of the discount rate.
The adjustment is intended to remove indirect impacts of stock market fluctuations and economic assumptions from all years, thus removing any impact from the opening value of in-force and the risk-free rate in the final years performance.
4 Straight line vesting occurs in between threshold and maximum vesting.
5 No discretion was exercised by the Committee to override the outcome referred to above.
Therefore, the total percentage of the 2016 PSP awards vesting was 85.3%, which resulted in the following awards to the Executive Directors: Percentage of Number of Value of Total number of awards vesting shares shares vesting 1 Director shares granted % vesting 000 Andrew Croft 73,874 85.3 63,063 640 Ian Gascoigne 73,874 85.3 63,063 640 Craig Gentle 48,805 85.3 41,662 423 David Lamb 73,874 85.3 63,063 640 1 As these awards will not actually vest until 24 March 2019, a deemed share price is used to calculate the value of shares vesting for the purposes of this Report.

The face value of the award figure is calculated by multiplying the number of shares awarded by the average share price figure of 11.08.

To calculate the ratio in accordance with the regulations, we ranked all our UK employees by their annualised full-time equivalent salary as at 31 December 2018.
From this we identified the three individuals at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles known as P25, P50 and P75, respectively.
We then calculated the total remuneration figure known as Y25, Y50 and Y75, respectively for each of these employees for the year ending 31 December 2018, in line with the same reporting regulations that apply to our Executive Directors.
This is known as Option C under the regulations.
As very few companies have so far published a ratio, it is not possible to precisely compare this to our peers.
However, we expect our median ratio of 42:1 is relatively low by comparison with many companies in the FTSE 100, where disclosure to date indicates this is typically between 50:1 and 100:1.
The median ratio is consistent with our pay, reward and progression policies for employees which relate pay levels to performance and market benchmarks.
In 2018, 64% of our Chief Executives total remuneration was delivered through variable pay schemes as shown in the bar chart below.
These are directly linked to the Companys performance as well as share price movements over the longer-term.
Whilst none of the three employees identified at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles are eligible to receive PSP Awards, all three received a bonus within the year and are invited to participate in the SIP and SAYE on the same terms as the Chief Executive.

ANNUAL BONUS FOR 2019 The Executive Directors maximum bonus opportunity for 2019 will be the same as for 2018 being 150% of salary.
Half of the annual bonus will be determined by EEV operating profit and half by key strategic targets.
50% of the annual bonus earned for performance in 2019 will be paid in cash and the remaining 50% will be deferred in the Companys shares for a three-year period and subject to continued service.
The EEV operating profit target set by the Committee is based on a sliding scale to progressively reward incremental performance.
The EEV result is calculated based on best estimate assumptions and any deviation or changes from these assumptions are reported as an experience variance or an operating assumption change.
In setting the operating profit target for the year it is assumed the combined operating experience variance and operating assumption changes will have a neutral impact on the outcome for the year.
In setting the 2019 EEV Operating Profit target, the Committee maintained the new business and expense growth objectives at the same level as in previous years.
The Board considers that the performance targets for the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and is not disclosing them at this time.
Theperformance metrics and performance against them will be disclosed in the 2019 Remuneration Report to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time.
The strategic element of the 2019 annual bonus will be assessed by reference to key strategic targets based around the 2019 business plan, including elements relating to clients, shareholders and other key stakeholders.
Specific objectives include: the delivery of good service to the Groups clients as measured by surveys and other client feedback: continuing to enhance the range of investment funds and maintaining strong investment performance: the successful recruitment and retention of high quality Partners and Advisers: successfully implementing thenext phase of the administration systems and transferring certain existing assets onto that system: successfully controlling and mitigating the material risks that could impact the Group: and maintaining the Groups good relations with its shareholders and regulators.
