The salaries shown above are reported before any such adjustments are made.
2 Benefits relate to company car, Share Incentive Plan company contributions and medical benefits.
3 The pension value represents the cash value of pension accrued over one year x a multiple of 20 less director contributions in line with statutory reporting requirements.
4 The AIP figures above show the full value of the award before 33% was deferred in shares.
5 The PSP figures for 2017 have been readjusted in line with statutory reporting requirements, following last years report to show the actual value upon vesting.
The estimated value shown in the table for 2018 is based on the average share price in the three months to 31 March 2018 of 1,253.88p, as required by the reporting regulations.
The award remains subject to service until May 2018 and so the prior year comparative will be restated in next years report to show the actual value on vesting, as is required by the regulations.
6 Directors have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration other than as disclosed in the table.
7 Martin Pibworth was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2017 on a salary of 500,000.
The figures above show his remuneration pro-rata from this date, including his AIP but excluding his PSP award granted in 2015 which vests on the same basis as the other Executive Directors and is worth 121,964.
Rationale for 2018 single total figure of remuneration As indicated on page 127 and shown in specific detail in the following sections, failure to meet the threshold performance conditions for relative total shareholder return measures has resulted in a reduced out-turn of the Performance Share Plan PSP.
Therefore, there is a year-on-year decrease for the Chief Executive and Finance Director in the above table.
In this context, the Committee is satisfied that the total single figure outcomes are appropriate.
Base salary The salaries shown in the table reflect a 2017 18 salary, effective from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, of 864,362 for the Chief Executive and 668,082 for the Finance Director.
This represented an increase of 2.4% from the previous year, which was in line with the average performancebased salary increase for the wider SSE employee population.
The Wholesale Director was appointed to the Board on a salary of 500,000 on 1 September 2017, a level which the Committee felt was appropriate relative to the other Executive Directors and in line with our below market philosophy.
Benefits Benefits are provided at an appropriate level taking into account market practice at similar sized companies and the level of benefits provided for other employees in the Company.
Core benefits include car allowance, private medical insurance and health screening.
The Executive Directors participate in the Companys all-employee share schemes on the same terms as other employees.
Pension The Chief Executive and Finance Director are members of the Southern Electric Pension Scheme and the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme respectively, and their plan membership predates their Board appointments.
These are both funded final salary pension schemes and the terms of these schemes apply equally to all members.
The Directors service contracts provide for a possible maximum pension of two thirds final salary from the age of 60.
In relation to Executive Directors who are subject to the scheme-specific salary cap which mirrors the provisions of the previous HMRC cap arrangements the Company provides top-up unfunded arrangements which are designed to provide an equivalent pension on retirement from the age of 60 to that which they would have earned had they not been subject to the salary cap.
From 1 April 2017 pensionable earnings increases were capped at RPI 1%.
These are legacy arrangements and would not be used for any new external appointments.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director, in common with all other employees who joined at the same time, have the following pension provisions relating to leaving the Company: for retirement through ill-health an unreduced pension based on service to expected retirement is paid: in the event of any reorganisation or redundancy an unreduced accrued pension is paid to a member who is aged 50 or above, with at least five years service or, for a member who has not yet reached that age, it will be payable with effect from 50: and from the age of 55, a scheme member is entitled to leave the Company and receive a pension, reduced for early payment, unless the Company gives consent and funds this pension on an unreduced basis.
Dependent on the circumstances surrounding the departure of the Executive Director and financial health of the Company at the time, the Committees policy is to give consideration to a cash commutation of the unfunded unapproved retirement benefit UURB pension at the time of leaving.
Any cash commutation will limit SSEs liability, taking into account valuations provided by independent actuarial advisors, and will be calculated on what was judged to be a cost neutral basis to SSE.
The Wholesale Director, who has been with SSE since 1998, was already in receipt of a pension allowance of 30% of salary and this remains unchanged.
His arrangements are consistent with the approach used for other members of the Group Executive Committee, who have elected to receive a cash allowance in lieu of accruing future pension benefits.
Prior to the cash allowance arrangement he was a member of the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme although he stopped accruing any further pension on 1 April 2016.

Annual Incentive Plan and Performance Share Plan In setting targets and assessing performance, the following process is used for both the AIP and PSP: 1.
Apply discretion measures aligned performance performance of wider if required with strategy targets environment 2017 18 Annual Incentive Plan 1.

Set stretching performance targets The financial performance targets were set at the start of the financial year taking into account internal financial plans, external consensus where it exists and the expected impact of identified opportunities and threats to the business in the context of wider economic conditions.
The performance target range is set on a realistic basis but requiring true outperformance for Executive Directors to achieve the maximum.
The Remuneration Committee has a history of setting challenging targets, evidenced by the average AIP payout over the previous five years of 66%.

Assess performance continued When setting non-financial measures and targets, the Committee ensures they are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely SMART objectives.
By their nature, some objectives require a more subjective assessment than others and this is done by the Committee following the input from the wider Board and other Board Committees as appropriate.
The Committee is committed to providing as much retrospective detail of the measures as possible, setting out clearly the decision making process and the levels of attainment achieved, but mindful that any information which could be considered commercially sensitive cannot be disclosed.
The tables below provide detail on each of the non-financial measures and the assessment of performance against each one.

He was eligible for a separate bonus arrangement for the five months he served as a member of the companys Group Executive Committee.
2 Both the cash and deferred element are subject to clawback provisions.
Take account of wider environment The Remuneration Committee believes that the range of measures used in the AIP ensures that performance is assessed using a balanced approach, without undue focus on a single metric which could be achieved at the expense of wider initiatives.
Given the performance noted above and wider operational achievements noted in the Strategic Report on pages 26 and 27 the Committee is comfortable that the AIP outcomes represent a fair reward for performance delivered.
Apply discretion if required In 2016 17, the Remuneration Committee applied its discretion and made a downward adjustment to the Executive Directors AIP award after taking into account overall performance during the year.
For 2017 18, no adjustment has been made.
Set performance measures aligned with strategy PSP performance measures encourage strong financial, customer, share price and dividend performance over a three year performance period.

Alignment of Directors remuneration policy with pay across the wider workforce The table below shows how the Chief Executives earnings compare to those of all employees expressed as a ratio over three years.
Chief Executive Average SSE 1 2 earnings earnings Pay ratio 2017 18 2,693,000 43,144 62:1 2016 17 2,917,000 40,723 72:1 2015 16 1,696,000 39,990 42:1 1 The Chief Executives earnings are calculated on the same basis as the single total figure of remuneration table shown on page 124.
2 Average employee earnings are based on staffing costs calculated on the same basis as Note 8.1 of the accounts, excluding social security costs.
The movement in the pay ratio from 2015 16 to 2016 17 is explained largely by the increase in Chief Executives earnings in 2017 as a result of improved performance through AIP and PSP and the 2016 increase to the maximum AIP level by 50%.
Conversely, the narrowing of the pay ratio from 2016 17 to 2017 18 is as a result of slightly lower PSP performance and a reduced figure for the Chief Executives pension as shown in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 124.
In addition, average SSE earnings increased by 6% and the Chief Executives single total figure of remuneration went down by 8%.

132 SSE plc Annual Report 2018 Risk assessment During the course of the year, the Committee undertook a remuneration risk assessment exercise to identify and evaluate the risks inherent in our Directors Remuneration Policy.
Important risk mitigators identified included the broad balance of clear financial and non-financial performance measures, targets which are set in line with SSEs business plans and an overall approach to pay design which rewards the delivery of strong, yet sustainable, performance.
The close coordination with the Audit Committee was also highlighted as a strength.
Specific areas of focus for the future in respect of remuneration risk include simplicity, ensuring fair pay outcomes and applying discretion to do so, and the internal alignment of pay design and outcomes.

The Chairmans fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The fees for non-Executive Directors are a matter for the Chairman and Executive Directors.
Care is taken to ensure no Director is present when their own remuneration is discussed.
For 2018 19, it is proposed that the Chairmans and the non-Executive Directors fees are increased by 3% in line with the wider employee population with effect from 1 April 2018, with the exception of the SHEAC Chair fee which is proposed to increase from 12,000 to 14,000 reflecting the increased remit of that Committee.
The new fees are shown in the table below.
As at 1 April 2018 Chairman 388,800 Base fee 70,000 Additional Senior Independent Director fee 17,500 Additional fee for being Remuneration Committee Chairman 17,500 Additional fee for being Audit Committee Chairman 17,500 Additional fee for being SHEAC Chairman 14,000 Changes in the SSE Group and impact on share plan participants As covered in detail on page 6 and 7 subject to necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals, a decision was taken in November 2017 to enter into an agreement with innogy SE in respect of a proposed demerger of SSEs household energy supply and services business in Great Britain and combination with innogys subsidiary npower Group plc, to form a new independent energy supply and services business in the Great Britain market.
As a result of this the Committee has started to consider the impact the transaction will have on the various employee share plans.
The Committee will review the rules of the plans with appropriate advice from the Committees advisors and make appropriate decisions in relation to all employees, both those remaining within the SSE Group and those likely to leave.
