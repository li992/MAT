STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REMUNERATION REPORT Following the approval of the 2016 LUCINDA RICHES remuneration policy and the ability to CHAIR OF THE increase the maximum awards under REMUNERATION COMMITTEE the Deferred Bonus Plan DBP and Performance Share Plan PSP some shareholders thought that maximum awards would be used without a corresponding increase in performance targets.
The Committee has determined not to increase the incentive opportunities for the executive directors for 2017 18.
There was a divergence of opinion between investors on the calibration of the PSP performance targets.
I have set out the Committees position in more detail below.
Calibration of PSP measures Other than the relative TSR metric, all Dear Shareholder three of the other performance metrics in the PSP EPS, RoI and Leverage are I am pleased to be able to present the Remuneration report for the derived directly from the Companys Company following my appointment as chair of the Remuneration KPIs.

increases for the executive directors While the policy was approved, a minority of 3% in line with average increases of shareholders raised some concerns.
I have summarised below our responses to those concerns: Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 69 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The Living Wage I am pleased to report that with effect from 1 May 2017 all eligible A-Plant employees will be paid the Living Wage as recommended by The Living Wage Foundation and A-Plant became an accredited Living Wage Employer.
Sunbelt employees will be paid an hourly rate in excess of the state and federal recommended wage.
Company performance It is pleasing to report, once again, a year of strong performance across the business with market share gains, both in the US and the UK.
We are delighted to be reporting another year of record profits and record dividends.
The following is a breakdown of our performance for the year.
Group underlying pre-tax profit 793m 2016: 645m growth of 23% Sunbelt operating profit $1,088m 2016: $1,014m growth of 7% A-Plant operating profit 72m 2016: 67m growth of 7% Proposed dividend of 27.5p 2016: 22.5p Deferred Bonus Plan Profit is the metric used for the DBP.
The following table sets out the profit targets and their level of satisfaction for this year.

The budgeted exchange rate for the financial year was 1:$1.45.
For the purpose of the DBP, the Company has and will continue to measure performance on a constant currency basis using the budgeted exchange rates.
This ensures that the executives do not enjoy any benefit or suffer any detriment from fluctuations in the exchange rate.
Whilst reported Group pre-tax profit was 793m, at budgeted exchange rates this equated to 713m and it is on the latter figure upon which the executives bonuses have been calculated.
The Remuneration Committee sets challenging targets for the DBP.
The Committee was able to determine maximum bonuses for Geoff Drabble, Suzanne Wood and Brendan Horgan.
In relation to Sat Dhaiwal and A-Plant, this was adjusted to 95% of maximum to reflect award levels within the business.
The Committee feels that this is an appropriate level of reward for the performance of the Company and the hard work put in by its executive directors.
2014 PSP award vesting The sustained long-term performance of the Company is reflected in the full vesting of the 2014 PSP award.
The award will vest on expiry of the three-year vesting period in June 2017.
The following table sets out the performance conditions and targets, weightings, actual performance and associated level of vesting.

70 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Future years The Committee will continue to focus its remuneration policy implementation on: supporting the Groups strategy over the next stage of its development: attracting, retaining and motivating the executive directors who are critical to executing the business strategy and driving the continued creation of shareholder value: ensuring the remuneration is competitive against companies of similar size and complexity: and reflecting practice in the Groups listing environment whilst being cognisant of its relatively diverse shareholder base and its main area of operation being North America.
The Committee will continue to have regard to pay and employment conditions across the Group, especially when determining salary increases.
Conclusion Following the extensive shareholder engagement of last year and the subsequent approval of the Remuneration Policy at the 2016 AGM the key decisions relating to the implementation of the Policy are set out below: the executives will receive a salary increase of 3%: the maximum DBP opportunity will remain at 200% of salary for 2017 18: the maximum PSP opportunity will remain at 200% of salary for 2017 awards: the PSP leverage target will reduce to two times net debt to EBITDA, averaged across the award period: and for the 2017 PSP awards and beyond, a two-year post vesting holding period will be operated.
At this years AGM there will be a single resolution regarding the implementation of the remuneration policy, details of which are more fully set out in the Notice of Meeting.
I believe the decisions made by the Committee both reflect and build on the constructive shareholder dialogue which I intend to continue going forwards.
I hope you will agree and will therefore be able to vote in favour of this years remuneration report.
LUCINDA RICHES Chair of the Remuneration Committee Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 71 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED INTRODUCTION This report has been prepared in accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the relevant sections of the Companies Act 2006 and The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 the Regulations.
It explains how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration, as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Regulations require the auditor to report to the Companys members on elements of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The audited information is included on pages 78 to 83.
An ordinary resolution concerning the Directors remuneration report excluding the remuneration policy will be put to shareholders at the AGM on 12 September 2017.

Notes to the policy table: 1.
In relation to the DBP, individual awards to directors are dependent on the most relevant measure of profit for the role which they perform, and thus over which they have the most direct influence.
Profit is a key component of earnings per share, one of the Companys key performance indicators and is considered the primary measure which aligns with shareholders interests.
Total shareholder return measures the relative return from Ashtead against an appropriate comparator group, providing alignment with shareholders interests.
Earnings per share is also a key measure ensuring sustainable profit generation over the longer term and is a measure which is aligned with shareholders interests.
c. Return on investment is a key internal measure to ensure the effective use of capital in the business which is highly cyclical and with high capital requirements.
d. The use of leverage alongside the other performance measures ensures there is an appropriate dynamic tension and balance, maintaining leverage discipline in a capital-intensive business.
For awards up to and including 2016, the leverage target was 2.5 times.
For 2017 and subsequent awards, it will be 2 times, averaged across the three-year period.
In relation to both the DBP and the PSP, malus and clawback provisions exist which enable the Committee to reduce or eliminate the number of shares, notional shares or unvested shares held or reduce the amount of any money payable or potentially payable and or to require the transfer to the Company of all or some of the shares acquired or to pay to the Company an amount equal to all or part of any benefit or value derived from, or attributable to, the plans in case of material misstatement of accounts or action or conduct of an award holder or award holders which in the reasonable opinion of the Board, amounts to fraud or gross misconduct.
Share-based incentives and dilution limits The Company observes an overall dilution limit of 10% in 10 years for all company share schemes, together with a limit of 5% in 10 years for discretionary schemes.
74 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Remuneration policy on new hires When hiring a new executive director, the Committee will seek to align the remuneration package with the remuneration policy summarised above.
In addition, where the executive has to relocate, the level of relocation package will be assessed on a case by case basis.
Although it is not the Committees policy to buy-out former incentive arrangements as a matter of course, it will consider compensating an incoming executive with like-kind incentive arrangements for foregone incentives with their previous employer, taking into account the length of the period they were held and an assessment of the likely vesting value.
The Committee will ensure that such arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company and the shareholders without paying more than is necessary.
Total remuneration opportunity Our remuneration arrangements are designed so that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of short and long-term objectives designed to create shareholder value.
The graphs below illustrate the potential future reward opportunity for each of the executive directors, based on the remuneration policy set out on pages 72 to 74 and the base salary at 1 May 2017 and the sterling dollar exchange rate at 30 April 2017.

Service contracts The Companys policy is that executive directors have rolling contracts which are terminable by either party giving the other 12 months notice, which are available for inspection at the Companys registered office.
The service contracts for each of the executive directors all contain non-compete provisions appropriate to their roles.
Policy on payment for loss of office Upon the termination of employment of any executive director, any compensation will be determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of the directors employment contract and the rules of any incentive scheme which are summarised overleaf.

There is no agreement between the Company and its directors or employees, providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs as a result of a takeover bid.
The Committee reserves the right to make payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of a legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation : or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an executive directors office or employment.
When determining any loss of office payment for a departing individual the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the Company whilst seeking to address the circumstances at the time.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company The constituent parts of the senior management teams remuneration package mirror those of the executives.
The performance conditions attaching to PSP awards are common throughout the Company.
When considering executive compensation, the Committee is advised of, and takes into account, changes to the remuneration of employees elsewhere within the Company.
The Committee does not consider it appropriate to consult with employees when determining executive remuneration.
Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 77 REMUNERATION REPORT ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION Remuneration policy for non-executive directors The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
None of the non-executive directors has a service contract with the Company and their appointment is therefore terminable by the Board at any time.
When recruiting a non-executive director, the remuneration arrangements offered will be in line with the policy table below: Approach to fees Basis of fees Fees are set at a level to attract and retain high calibre Each non-executive director is paid a basic fee for undertaking non-executive directors.

Consideration of shareholder views The Committee believes that it is important to maintain an open and transparent dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters.
Looking forward, the Committee will continue to engage with shareholders regarding material changes to the application of the approved policy or proposed changes to the policy.
Other taxable allowances include car, travel and accommodation allowances.
ii The amounts for Sat Dhaiwal and Geoff Drabble represent cash payments in lieu of pension contributions at 20% and 40% of salary, respectively.
The amounts included for Brendan Horgan and Suzanne Wood represent the co-match under Sunbelts 401K defined contribution pension plan and 409A deferred compensation plan.
iii DBP includes the cash received by each director from the DBP for 2016 17 performance as explained on pages 79 and 80.
This includes all this years bonus and the brought forward deferred share equivalents for each director.
iv The PSP value is calculated as the number of shares vesting, valued at the market value of those shares, plus the payment in lieu of dividends paid during the vesting period.
Market value is the market value on the day the awards vest if they vest before the date the financial statements are approved or the average market value for the last three months of the financial year if the awards vest after the date the financial statements are approved.
The 2014 award will vest in full on 19 June 2017 and has been valued at an average market value of 1,662p for the three months ended 30 April 2017, plus 51.75p per share in lieu of dividends paid during the vesting period.
The PSP value for 2016 has been adjusted both to reflect the actual market value on the date of vesting of 1,068p and the actual proportion 97.5% vesting.
78 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The value attributable to the PSP awards within the single total figure for remuneration reflects the appreciation of the share price since the awards were granted.

The Company makes a payment of 40% of Geoff Drabbles base salary in lieu of providing him with any pension arrangements.
This was agreed prior to his joining the Company in 2006 and reflected the fact that he was leaving a generous defined benefit arrangement at his previous employer.
Brendan Horgan and Suzanne Wood are members of the Sunbelt 401K defined contribution pension plan and the 409A deferred compensation plan.
They are entitled to a company co-match conditional on contributing into the 401K plan or deferring into the 409A plan.
The co-match is limited to amounts permitted by regulatory agencies and is effected either by a company payment into the 401K plan or an enhanced deferral into the 409A plan and was $17,500 for Brendan Horgan and $24,000 for Suzanne Wood in 2016 17.
At 30 April 2017, the total amount available to Brendan Horgan but deferred under the Sunbelt deferred compensation plan was $515,495 or 398,435.
This includes an allocated investment gain of $58,655 or 45,315 2016: loss of 17,039.
The amount available to Suzanne Wood under the same plan was $445,470 or 344,311.
This includes an allocated investment gain of $66,893 or 51,679 2016: loss of 9,489.

The performance targets for Geoff Drabble and Suzanne Wood for the year to 30 April 2017 related directly to the underlying pre-tax profits of Ashtead Group.
The targets for Brendan Horgan and Sat Dhaiwal, related to the underlying operating profit of Sunbelt and A-Plant respectively.
For the year to 30 April 2017, the underlying pre-tax profit for Ashtead Group was 713m at budget exchange rates and underlying operating profit for Sunbelt and A-Plant was $1,088m and 72m respectively.
As a result, Geoff Drabble, Suzanne Wood and Brendan Horgan earned 100% of their maximum bonus entitlements.
In relation to Sat Dhaiwal, his award was adjusted to 95% of maximum to reflect award levels in the A-Plant business.
These are equivalent to 200% of base salary for Geoff Drabble and 150% of base salary for Suzanne Wood and Brendan Horgan and 143% of base salary for Sat Dhaiwal.

97.5% of the 2013 PSP award vested on 4 July 2016 with EPS compound growth over the three years of 39% exceeding the upper target of 12% and the Companys TSR performance ranked it 50th within the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
RoI was 19% and leverage 1.7 times.
EPS is based on the profit before exceptional items, fair value remeasurements and amortisation of acquired intangibles less the tax charge included in the accounts.
Historically TSR performance has been measured relative to the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts rather than a specific comparator group of companies because there are few direct comparators to the Company listed in London and because the Company was a FTSE 250 company.
For 2014 15 and 2015 16, the comparator group is comprised of those companies in the FTSE 350 ranked 75th to 125th by market capitalisation excluding investment trusts and thereafter those companies ranked 50th to 100th.
