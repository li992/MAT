As Dechra continues to expand internationally we receive regular feedback and requests from employees and managers who want to be able to enjoy the benefits of participation in a share save scheme.
We have therefore agreed, subject to shareholder approval, to offer a SAYE internationally on as close a basis as possible to its operation in the UK, and in the USA to offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP.
This will enable the majority of our existing employee base the opportunity to benefit from share ownership which will, in turn, ensure a more equitable approach to our global reward schemes.
The current SAYE scheme rules are due for renewal in October 2020.
However, in view of the above, it is proposed to ask for shareholder approval of new UK rules along with an International Plan at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting in October 2018 and to authorise the Directors to adopt ESPP as a sub-plan of the International SAYE.
More information is included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Initially the offer will be limited to our larger territories and it is hoped that we will be able to launch it in October 2019.

Annual bonuses were awarded by the Committee in respect of the 2018 financial year having regard to the performance of the Group and personal performance objectives for the year.
The amount achieved for the year ended 30 June 2018 against targets for the 2018 financial year is as follows: 2018 Financial Year Targets Amount Achieved for the Year Ended 30 June 2018 Underlying profit before tax performance: 10% of salary payable The underlying profit before tax target was 87.8 million at CER.
Actual upon the achievement of 95% of Group profit target rising to 90% underlying profit before tax was 93.7 million, resulting in a payment worth 1 of salary payable upon the achievement of 110% of Group 66% of salary.

or Ian Page and Richard Cotton and 8% of salary for Tony Griffin.
The 2 objectives are based on key aspects of delivering the Groups strategy.
Total Annual Bonus Earned for the Year Ended 30 June 2018 76% of salary for Ian Page and Richard Cotton and 74% for Tony Griffin.
1 The Committee considered the effect of the financing of the acquisition of AS Farma B. V. and Le Vet Beheer B. V. the Acquisition, including in particular the impact on the underlying profit before tax if the Acquisition had been purely financed purely by cash rather than 25% in equity and 75% in cash.
The Committee concluded that if the Acquisition had been funded solely by cash, the interest associated with the debt financing would have made a minimal impact on the underlying profit before tax figure and it would not have affected the resulting payment of 66% of salary.
2 The Committee considers that the objectives for the forthcoming financial year 2019 are commercially sensitive as they give our competitors insight into our business plans and therefore are not detailed in this report.
They will be disclosed in the 2019 Annual Report & Accounts.
The personal objectives of each Executive Director for the year ended 30 June 2018 are set on an individual basis and are closely linked to the corporate, financial, strategic and other non-financial objectives of the Company.
This enables the Committee to reward the Executive Directors contribution to both the annual financial performance and the achievement of specific objectives.
A summary of the objectives is set out below along with a description of the performance against them.
The Committee reviewed the performance of each Executive Director against their specific objectives based on a report by the Chief Executive Officer and with respect to the Chief Executive Officer, a report by the Chairman.
Director Objective Performance Ian Page Acquisition Acquisition of RxVet Limited, AST Farma B. V. and Le Vet Beheer B. V.

com LTIP Awards Vesting in Respect of the Year Ended 30 June 2018 The LTIP awards granted on 15 September 2015 are due to vest on 15 September 2018.
Ian Page and Tony Griffin were granted LTIP Awards on 15 September 2015, the performance targets for which are as follows: 50% of the award is subject to a performance condition based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over the performance period relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts over the performance period as follows: TSR performance Vesting percentage Below median 0% Median 25% of the TSR portion will vest Between median and upper quartile Pro rata vesting between 25% and 100% based on the Companys ranking in the comparator group Upper quartile 100% of the TSR portion will vest 50% of each award is subject to a performance condition based on the growth in the Companys underlying diluted earnings per share EPS over the performance period as follows: EPS compound annual growth rate CAGR Vesting Percentage 8% CAGR 0% 8% CAGR 25% of the EPS portion will vest CAGR between 8% and 16% Pro rata vesting between 25% and 100% 16% CAGR 100% of the EPS portion will vest This reflects the EPS performance requirement for maximum vesting as increased by the Committee, from the original level of 13%, to reflect the acquisition of Putney, as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report for the 2016 financial year.
Both the TSR element and the EPS element are subject to an additional return on capital employed ROCE performance measure.
Unless the Groups ROCE is 10% or more in the final year of the performance period, the awards will lapse in full regardless of TSR and EPS performance.
The percentage vesting will be reduced by 10% for every 1% that ROCE falls below 15%.
The Companys TSR performance was over 185.6% compared with a 51.1% TSR for the upper quartile company in the comparator group FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts.
Therefore 100% of the TSR element will vest.
In addition, the compound annual growth in the Groups underlying diluted EPS for the performance period was 24.2%.
Accordingly, 100% of the EPS element will vest.
Overall, taking into account that ROCE performance for 2018 was 15.4%, the LTIP awards will vest as to 100% of maximum opportunity.
In the single figure table on page 85, the value attributable to this award is calculated by multiplying the number of shares in respect of which the award is expected to vest by 27.707 being the average market value of a share over the last quarter of the Companys financial period ended on 30 June 2018.
Recruitment Award for Richard Cotton As disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report for the 2016 financial year, as part of his recruitment, the Committee agreed to award Richard two buyout awards in respect of incentives forfeited as a consequence of joining Dechra.
Each award was over shares with a value of 350,000 at the date of grant, 7 March 2017.
The vesting of the first of those awards was subject to a performance condition based on the Chief Executive Officers assessment of his performance during the first year of his appointment 3 January 2017 to 3 January 2018.
Based on the Chief Executive Officers assessment of his performance over this period, the award vested as to 100% on 3 January 2018.
In the single figure table on page 85 the value attributable to this award is calculated by multiplying the number of shares in respect of which the award vested 21,033 by 20.64 being the mid market value of a share on 3 January 2018.
The vesting of the second award was subject to the same performance conditions as those applying to the LTIP awards granted on 15 September 2015, as detailed above.
Therefore this second award vested as to 100% on 28 August 2018.
In the single figure table on page 85 the value attributable to this award is calculated by multiplying the number of shares in respect of which the award vested by 27.707 being the average market value of a share over the last quarter of the Companys financial period ended on 30 June 2018.

Each of Ian Page and Richard Cotton has also been granted a tax qualifying option over 1,197 shares at an exercise price of 25.06 as part of their LTIP award.
These tax qualifying options are linked to the nil cost option such that, at the time of exercise, to the extent that there is a gain in the tax qualifying option, the nil cost option will be forfeited to the value of that gain, to ensure that the pre-tax value of the LTIP award is not increased by the grant of the tax qualifying option.

Implementation of the Directors Remuneration Policy in the Year Ending 30 June 2019 Unaudited : The Directors Remuneration Policy outlined on pages 94 to 98 will be implemented in the year ending 30 June 2019, as set out below.
Salary and Fees The next review of Executive Directors salaries will be undertaken in September 2018.
It is planned that the Executive Directors salaries for 2018 will increase in line with the range of increases proposed for the wider workforce.
Following a review of the Non-Executive Directors base and additional fees, it was agreed that no changes will be made to the base fee for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors for the year ending 30 June 2019.
With regards to the additional fees, it was agreed to increase the fees as follows: 2018 2019 Fee Fee Office 000 000 Remuneration Committee Chairmanship additional fee 5 8 Audit Committee Chairmanship additional fee 5 10 Nomination Committee Chairmanship additional fee 5 Senior Independent Director additional fee 3 5 Annual Bonus No changes have been made to the bonus structure.
Consequently Executive Directors will have a bonus opportunity of 100% of salary for the year ending 30 June 2019, on the same basis as for the year ended 30 June 2018.
Details of the bonus structure can be found on page 86.
In the opinion of the Board, the performance targets applying to the annual bonus are commercially sensitive, and prospective disclosure could provide competitors with insight into the Groups business plans and expectations.
However, the Company will disclose how any bonus earned relates to performance against targets on a retrospective basis when the targets are no longer considered commercially sensitive, as shown on page 86 in respect of bonuses for the Groups 2018 financial year.
LTIP The Committee proposes that LTIP awards for the year ending 30 June 2019 the 2019 Grant will be made at the level of 200% of salary for Ian Page, 150% for Richard Cotton and 100% of salary for Tony Griffin.
The performance measures remain as per the grant of LTIP awards made on 2 March 2018, details of which can be found on page 90.
In setting the EPS growth targets for the 2019 Grant, the Committee had regard to the Acquisition.
The Committee concluded that maintaining the same growth targets appropriately balanced the required level of stretch with incentivisation.
The Committee will consider the targets again in advance of the grants in respect of the awards for the year ending 30 June 2020, recognising that the base year for those awards will include a full year of AS Farma and Le Vet.
The awards will ordinarily be subject to a two year post vesting holding period.

Stock Code: DPH 97 Directors Remuneration Report continued Recruitment Remuneration Policy When hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee will typically align the remuneration package with the above Policy.
When determining appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Committee may include other elements of pay which it considers are appropriate.
However, this discretion is capped and is subject to the limits referred to below.
Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the experience of the Executive Director being appointed.
This may include agreement on future increases up to a market rate, in line with increased experience and or responsibilities, subject to good performance, where it is considered appropriate.
Pension will only be provided in line with the above Policy.
The Committee will not offer non-performance related incentive payments for example a guaranteed sign-on bonus.
Other elements may be included in the following circumstances: an interim appointment being made to fill an Executive Director role on a short term basis: if exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a Non-Executive Director takes on an executive function on a short term basis: if an Executive Director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or long term incentive award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance.
Subject to the limit on variable remuneration set out below, the quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may be transferred to the subsequent year so that reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis: if the Director will be required to relocate in order to take up the position, it is the Companys policy to allow reasonable relocation, travel and subsistence payments.
Any such payments will be at the discretion of the Committee.
The Committee may also alter the performance measures, performance period, vesting period and holding period of the annual bonus or LTIP, subject to the rules of the LTIP, if the Committee determines that the circumstances of the recruitment merit such alteration.
The rationale will be clearly explained in the next Directors Remuneration Report.
The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted excluding buyout awards as referred to below is 300% of salary.
The Committee may make payments or awards in respect of hiring an employee to buyout remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to the forfeited arrangements and the time over which they would have vested.
The Committee will generally seek to structure buyout awards or payments on a comparable basis to the remuneration arrangements forfeited.
Any such payments or awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above.
Buyout awards will ordinarily be granted on the basis that they are subject to forfeiture or clawback in the event of departure within 12 months of joining Dechra, although the Committee will retain discretion not to apply forfeiture or clawback in appropriate circumstances.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under Dechras ordinary share plans.
If necessary and subject to the limits referred to above, recruitment awards may be granted outside of these plans as permitted under the Listing Rules which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of an Executive Director.
Where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue in accordance with their terms.
Fees payable to a newly appointed Chairman or Non-Executive Director will be in line with the policy in place at the time of appointment.
Policy on Service Contracts: Details of the Executive Directors service contracts and Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment are set out on page 93.
Whilst the Committees policy is for the service contract of any newly appointed Executive Director to have a notice period of not more than 12 months, the Committee retains discretion to set an initial notice period of up to 24 months, reducing to 12 months after the initial 12 months of employment.
