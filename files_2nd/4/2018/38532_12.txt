B5 REMUNERATION REPORT This report covers the activities of the Remuneration Committee for the year ended 30 September 2018 and sets out the remuneration details for the executive and non-executive directors of the Company.
It has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of The Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008, as amended in August 2013, and the principles of the Code.
This report consists of the Statement by the Chairman of the Committee B5.1 and the Annual Report on Remuneration B5.2.
The policy summary tables extracted from the detailed Remuneration Policy are reproduced for reference as Section B5.3.
The full Remuneration Policy is set out in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 September 2016, a copy of which can be found at www.
B5.1 S tatement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholder Introduction Following my appointment as Remuneration Committee Chairman on 19 June 2018, I am pleased to present Hugo Tudor the Companys remuneration report for the year ended 30 September 2018.
Chairman of the Audit Committee I have been a member of the Remuneration Committee since my appointment to the Board in November 2014 and I recognise and support the philosophy the Group has adopted towards pay throughout the organisation: seeking to recognise fairly and equitably the contributions to the Group of all employees.
For executive directors, the aim is to ensure that their rewards are aligned with the interests of shareholders through the achievement of the Groups strategic objectives and with a focus on appropriate risk management.
The Committee and I are pleased and encouraged by the continued high level of shareholder support illustrated by a vote of above 98% in favour of the Annual Report on Remuneration at the 2018 AGM.
An active dialogue with shareholders has been maintained throughout the year.
As part of our annual governance review myself, the Chairman, the People Director and the Company Secretary met with a number of major shareholders in October 2018.
These meetings were positive in tone whilst appropriately challenging.
Business performance The year saw growth in the Groups loan books, with new lending up 25.9% to 2,333.2 million, including loans made by the acquired businesses, which contributed to an increase in underlying profit by 7.8% to 156.5 million.
Profit before tax on the statutory basis grew by 25.3% to 181.5 million after including a 28.0 million gain on sale of Idem Capital assets.
This led to underlying EPS increasing by 11.3% to 48.2 pence 2017: 43.3 pence and statutory EPS increasing to 55.9 pence 2017: 43.1 pence.
Funding was enhanced with the growth of the Groups savings deposit base to 5.3 billion from 3.6 billion a year earlier.
The Groups capital position remains strong, with a regulatory CET1 ratio of 13.8% 2017: 15.9%, representing a more efficient capital position.
PAGE 86 Corporate Governance PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC 2018 Annual Report and Accounts Remuneration outcomes for the year The Committee recommended salary increases for the executive directors of 3%, in line with the average increase for the wider workforce.
This came into effect from 1 October 2018.
Strong financial performance and risk management resulted in bonus out-turns of 90% of maximum opportunity for all of the executive directors.
Details of the performance relating to these bonuses are provided in Section B5.2.
In assessing personal performance, the Committee took into account the continued excellent growth and focus on an expanding portfolio at a time when a major Group legal and regulatory re-structuring was also taking place.
Full retrospective disclosure of the target range for the bonuses for the year ended 30 September 2018 will be included in the 2019 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Awards granted under the Performance Share Plan PSP in 2015 and which vested in respect of performance in the three years ended 30 September 2018 were subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition, measured against the FTSE 250 index 50% of the award, and an EPS growth condition 50% of the award.
Awards vested at 72.47% of maximum.
Changes proposed for 2019 Changes proposed for the coming financial year are minimal.
The TSR comparator group has been reviewed to reflect the changes in the financial services sector over the last few months and consequently constituents have been amended slightly.
The Chairmans fees and non-executive directors fees are unchanged.
We have broadened the trigger events which permit the application of malus and clawback to the bonus and PSP awards to include significant failure of risk management.
During the coming year the Committee will be reviewing the current remuneration policy and preparing for the next binding vote on remuneration at the 2020 AGM.
As part of this review we will be taking into account the Groups regulatory journey as it grows in size.
We will also be addressing the impact of the new 2018 Code to ensure that our new policy is fit for purpose in light of those changes, including the provisions governing holding periods for long term incentives and guidelines on post-employment shareholdings.
We will be consulting with shareholders over the course of the coming year before finalising our proposals.
The Committee will continue to engage with shareholders and hopes that it can rely on your continuing support at the AGM on 14 February 2019.

Allowances and benefits includes private health cover, fuel benefit and company car provision or company car allowance 10,000 to 12,000.
2 Benefits in kind from the performance of duties the Company reimburses executive directors in respect of certain travel costs incurred in connection with the performance of their duties.
The Company has been advised that the reimbursement of some of these costs constitutes a taxable benefit in kind.
The Company has agreed to provide an allowance to these directors to cover the tax liability.
The amounts shown represent the payments HMRC treats as taxable together with an allowance to cover the tax.
3. Dividend on v ested bonus is the accrued dividends to the date of exercise paid on deferred bonuses which were exercised during the year.
Under the policy which was adopted at the 2017 AGM, dividends will accrue to the point of vesting on deferred share awards made in respect of the year ended 30 September 2016 and thereafter.
The share awards value for the year ended 30 September 2017 has been restated to reflect the market value of the shares under the PSP that vested on 18 December 2017 as at that date.
The pension settlement relates to a legacy payment due to Richard Woodman for past service.
Further detail is provided in the pensions note below.
PAGE 90 Corporate Governance PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC 2018 Annual Report and Accounts Pension allowance and pension accruals Nigel Terrington, Richard Woodman and John Heron were members of the Paragon Pension Plan the Plan, the Groups defined benefit pension plan, until 30 September 2016.
Following which time, they took a cash equivalent transfer of benefits in the Plan, receiving a lump sum value on a no gain, no loss basis.
They had no further entitlement under the Plan as at 30 September 2018 or 30 September 2017.
The executive directors had previously ceased pension accrual under the Plan in return for a cash supplement calculated, as a percentage of salary, to equate to the cost of the Groups contributions towards future service benefits had each individual stayed within the Plan for their future service accrual.
This supplement was assessed every three years and was last assessed by the Groups actuaries during 2017.
Following this assessment, recognising the substantial cost to the Group of meeting these obligations, the Committee asked the executive directors to agree to fix this cash supplement at 45% of base salary so that the Group would have known costs associated with pension provision.
For all three directors, the fixed percentage was a lower amount than their actual contractual entitlement based on the most recent figures presented by the Groups actuaries.
These contributions in respect of further pension provision for each of the directors are shown as pension allowance in the single total figure of remuneration table.
The change to 45% was made with effect from 1 April 2017, and no compensation was paid or payable to the executive directors in respect of this change.
In assessing these values, the percentage due to Richard Woodman was higher due to an outstanding amount owed which related to past service i. e. what the Group would legally be required to pay him if he left the Group.
This was paid to him during 2017 and is shown in the single figure table above as pension settlement.
The consequence of settling this legacy contractual liability, which related to past not future service, was to reduce the calculated pension supplement to 63% from the original 103%.
As explained above, Richard Woodman agreed to reduce this supplement to 45% without compensation.
Annual bonus The annual bonus for the year ended 30 September 2018 was based on performance against business, financial and risk measures and personal strategic objectives.

The vesting percentage has been reviewed by the Committee and details of the estimated vesting outcome are set out below.
This is subject to the Committees final determination, in accordance with the financial underpin, that the level of vesting reflected the overall financial performance of the Group.
In accordance with the rules of the PSP, participants are entitled on exercise to additional value equal to the dividends that would have been paid on vested shares in respect of dividend record dates between the grant date and vesting date.
Accordingly, the share award values also include 42.1 pence per vested share in respect of such dividends.
The PSP value has been determined using the average closing share price for the three months ended 30 September 2018 as an estimate.
The actual value of the awards will not be finalised until the closing share price is known when the awards vest in December 2018.
Awards granted during the year ended 30 September 2018 During the year ended 30 September 2018 the following awards were granted under the PSP on 8 December 2017, each with a face value of 200% of salary.
On the same date, as part of the above PSP award, each executive director was granted a tax qualifying option under the Company Share Option Plan CSOP over 6,279 shares at an exercise price of 4.7776 per share.
The CSOP options are subject to performance conditions described below.
If a CSOP option is exercised at a gain, the number of shares the director will receive under the PSP will be reduced by the same value, to ensure that the total pre-tax benefit is not increased by the grant of the CSOP options.
Therefore, the value of each award, in aggregate, is equivalent to that of a PSP award over the number of shares stated in the table above, and the CSOP options may be disregarded in determining award value.
Based on the average closing mid-market price of the Companys shares on each of the five dealing days following the announcement of the Companys results for the financial year ended 30 September 2017, being the price used to determine the number of shares in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Policy.
The PSP awards are subject to the following performance conditions, with a performance period of the three years ending 30 September 2020: Weighting Threshold vesting at 25% of Maximum Performance measure maximum award vesting Relative TSR 50% Median performance Upper quartile performance EPS growth 25% RPI plus 3% p. a. RPI plus 7% p. a.
Based on an assessment of a balanced scorecard of risk and compliance Risk 25% factors see below There is straight-line vesting between the points and no reward below threshold performance.
In addition, prior to any awards vesting under any element, the Committee must be satisfied that the requirements of a financial underpin test have been met.
In line with the applicable tax legislation, the CSOP options are not subject to: 1 the risk performance condition and accordingly, two thirds of each CSOP option is subject to the relative TSR condition and one third to the EPS growth condition : or 2 the underpin.
They will only deliver value to the extent the share price increases between grant and exercise.

In addition to the unvested PSP awards in the table, each executive director holds a CSOP option over 6,279 shares, at an exercise price of 4.7776 per share, as part of the awards granted on 8 December 2017, as described above.
F or the purposes of the table above the awards granted in December 2015 are assumed to be vested but unexercised in respect of the percentage which it is estimated will vest 72.47% as referred to previously and to have lapsed in respect of the balance.
The interests of the Chairman and the non-executive directors at 30 September 2018, which consist entirely of ordinary shares, beneficially held, were as follows: 2018 F J Clutterbuck 8,372 A K Fletcher 30,000 P J N Hartill 7,000 P J Newberry - B A Ridpath - H R Tudor 225,000 F F Williamson - G H Yorston - As at 31 October 2018, the last practicable date prior to approving this Report, the Company has not been advised of any changes to the interests of the directors and their connected persons as set out in the tables above.
Share ownership guidelines All executive directors are encouraged to hold a minimum number of shares in the Company with a value of 200% of their salary, calculated at 31 December each year.
The valuation for shares held before 1 January 2017, is based on the average price of the Companys shares over a rolling three-year period.
For shares acquired after that date the valuation is based on the market value of the shares at the date of acquisition.
The value, net of income tax and national insurance, of vested but unexercised shares granted under the DSBP and under the PSP count towards the aggregate shares held by each director in respect of the policy.
PAGE 97 Corporate Governance PARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC 2018 Annual Report and Accounts The chart below compares the executive directors holdings at 30 September 2018 to those required by the guidelines, expressed in value terms as a percentage of salary at 30 September 2018.
Directors shareholding guidelines 30 September 2018 At 30 September 2018, all of the executive directors holdings were in accordance with guideline levels.
Due to the high level of personal shareholdings and the length of tenure of the three executive directors, the Committee decided, for the present, not to mandate that executives hold awards granted under the PSP for an additional period after the vesting date.
For any new external appointment, however, the Committee has introduced a holding period of two years to encourage share participation.
