I confirm that the implementation of Executive Director remuneration complied fully with our Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2017, and the Committee has not exercised any discretion in arriving at 2018 reward entitlements.
I would like to thank shareholders for the support they showed for the Annual Report on Remuneration 2017 which received 98.96% votes in favour at the AGM in May 2018.
2018 Performance-based rewards The Chairs Statement on pages 2 to 3, shows that the Company made impressive progress in 2018 with Group revenue up 7% and adjusted operating profit up 12%, both on an organic basis contributing to adjusted earnings per share EPS growth of 13% and a return on capital employed ROCE of 54.3% as determined under Annual Incentive Plan AIP rules.
The Company delivered a total shareholder return TSR of 119.6% for the three years ending 31st December 2018 as determined under our Performance Share Plan PSP, which is in the top decile of our TSR comparator group.
An increase in the total dividend for the year extends our dividend progress to 51 years.
TSR performance growth This graph demonstrates the growth in value of a 100 investment in the Company compared to the FTSE 350 Industrial Goods and Services Supersector from December 2008 to December 2018.
This comparison is chosen as it is the supersector within which the Company is classified and it is a broad equity market index including companies of a similar size, complexity and sector.
We have also shown a comparison relative to the FTSE 100, following the Companys recent entry into the Index.

It is important to note that, over the past five years, the Executive team has led the Company and our employees in the delivery of upper quartile performance to shareholders, as measured by organic sales growth, trading profit margins, ROCE, EPS and TSR.
Our Remuneration Policy is designed to ensure that a significant percentage of Executive Director pay is based on the achievement of demanding performance targets and is, therefore, at risk.
Maximum payout in the AIP and PSP is only possible as a result of significant strong performance by the business.
Following feedback from some shareholders, we decided to introduce a cash measure into the 2018 AIP, to the maximum amount permitted by the Policy.
The Committee has undertaken a robust and full assessment of performance during the year, taking into account both financial and non-financial measures.
Arising from this, payments to Executive Directors under the AIP range from 79.2% to 115.6% of salary and I am pleased to confirm 100% vesting for the 2016 PSP award.
The Committee considers that the remuneration paid to Executive Directors in 2018 given as a single figure for each Director on page 95 reflects the excellent progress made by the Company during 2018 as well as over the last three years.

Remuneration Annual Report on Remuneration 2018 Strategic alignment The Committee ensures that the remuneration paid to the Executive Directors, and the Group Executive Committee, is closely aligned with and reinforces the Group strategy.
At their meeting in June 2018 the Board reviewed the strategic plan.
This alignment is achieved by using the strategic plan to set financial and individual strategic objectives for the Executive Directors, and the Group Executives, and, from this, bonus targets are agreed and approved by the Committee.
This process forms part of the annual Board calendar, with the bonus targets approved in the early part of the financial year.
The Groups strategic themes are set out on page 20.

Annual bonus Executive Directors participate in the annual bonus plan, which rewards them for financial performance both at Group level and, where relevant, the business segment for which they are responsible.
Targets are reviewed annually to ensure continuing alignment with strategy and are agreed at the start of the year.
Resulting awards are determined following the end of the financial year by the Committee, based on performance against these targets.
For the Group Chief Executive, achievement of target performance results in a bonus of 75% of salary, increasing to 125% of salary for maximum performance.
For the other Executive Directors, achievement of target performance results in a bonus of 60% of salary, increasing to 100% of salary for maximum performance.
96 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2018 Bonus payments are subject to a contractual right for the Company to clawback or apply malus for up to three years following payment.
Circumstances that may result in a clawback or malus include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct.
In accordance with Policy, Executive Directors must use any bonus earned over 60% of base salary or 75% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive, net of tax, to buy shares until their shareholding guideline has been met.
This is, in effect, a bonus deferral mechanism.
The majority of each Executive Directors bonus opportunity 90% is based on the achievement of stretching financial performance targets in areas that directly align with our areas of strategic focus.
The remaining 10% is based on the achievement of individual strategic objectives, tailored to each Directors areas of responsibility.
Performance standards are agreed and communicated at the start of the year.
Financial measures have an established threshold, target and maximum with a sliding scale between each.
Individual strategic measures are subject to three possible achievement levels: fully achieved, partially achieved and not achieved.
The table below sets out the performance measures that each of the Executive Directors bonus awards were subject to.

The performance measures are adjusted to reflect certain items including the amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets and exceptional reorganisational costs and to exclude any profit contribution and other impacts such as major acquisitions during the period.
2018 was a good year for the Group, which delivered strong organic sales growth, grew earnings per share and increased dividend to shareholders.
The annual bonus payments to Executive Directors ranged between 79.2% and 115.6% of salary.
The bonus is payable in cash where the relevant Executive Director has met the share ownership requirement, otherwise any part of the bonus above target, net of tax, must be used to buy shares until the shareholding requirement has been met.

Personal strategic objective assessment The Executive Directors were each obliged to complete an appraisal self-assessment on their performance against each personal strategic objective.
The Group Chief Executive reviewed this self-assessment with the Executive Director and made his own assessment.
In the case of the Group Chief Executive, the Chair of the Board conducted the assessment.
A report was submitted to the Committee and, at its February 2019 meeting, the Committee reviewed the recommendations and approved a final decision.

Prior to award, the Committee reviews the performance targets for each measure to ensure they remain sufficiently stretching.
For EPS this includes a review of analysts forecasts.
PSP awards are subject to malus reduction in the amount of deferred and as yet unpaid compensation and clawback reimbursement of compensation that has already been paid for up to three years following the award, and can be applied during a holding period.
Circumstances that may result in a clawback or malus adjustment include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct.
For awards made in 2018, as well as those made in 2016 and 2017, vesting is based on two performance conditions measured over a three-year period, which have been chosen as they are aligned with our strategy: Performance measure Weight Threshold requirement Maximum requirement 1 EPS growth 60% Global IP 2% pa Global IP 8% pa Relative TSR 40% Median TSR Upper quartile TSR 1 The Global IP data source is the CHR Metals Global IP Index, providing data that incorporates over 90% of global industrial output.
Performance in line with threshold results in 25% of the award vesting: vesting between threshold and maximum is calculated on a straight-line basis.
The EPS element of the PSP is based on growth in excess of global industrial production growth rates, often referred to in our industry as Global IP, rather than UK RPI.
Global IP is a measure that the Board and management have used for some time as there is well documented evidence that it is the best predictor of the global and industrial markets within which the Group operates.
For these reasons, Global IP was used in the formulation of the long-term strategic plan and targets for EPS growth approved by the Board.
In setting the initial performance range in 2016, which was intended to be long-term in nature, the Committee reviewed the historical and projected data 2007 to 2020, including the Groups performance, market benchmarks and analysts consensus.
The Committee remains confident that this range remains sufficiently challenging across various market environments.
The TSR element of the PSP assesses TSR performance relative to a comparator group of companies that comprises the constituents of the FTSE 350 Industrial Goods and Services Super Sector at the start of the performance period.
This is the same sector classification as Spirax Sarco, and was selected as it objectively provides a sufficiently robust number of companies to compare performance against, that also operate in the industrial goods and services arena.
While the exact number of companies varies from year-to-year, the comparator group generally has between 50 and 60 companies.

Remuneration Annual Report on Remuneration 2018 continued PSP awards vesting over 2016-2018 In 2016 the Executive Directors received share awards under the PSP, with vesting subject to EPS growth and relative TSR performance.
The following diagrams set out details of the performance measures and targets that applied, along with the actual performance during the period 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2018.
Relative TSR performance 40% of PSP award Over the three-year period to 31st December 2018, the Company delivered an increase in TSR of 119.6%.
This ranked in the upper decile TSR of the comparator group above the level required for full vesting.
The comparator group, comprising 56 companies, for the purpose of measuring relative TSR performance was the FTSE 350 Industrial Goods and Services Supersector constituents at the start of the performance period.

EPS growth 60% of PSP award Over the three-year period to 31st December 2018, the Company delivered adjusted EPS growth of 75.3%.
This equated to growth of approximately 20.6% per annum over the three years.
EPS is derived from the audited Annual Report for the relevant financial year but adjusted to exclude the items shown separately on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement and augmented following the acquisitions of Gestra and Chromalox.
EPS is based on growth in excess of global industrial production growth rates see page 101.

1.4 Payments to past Directors audited There were no payments to former Directors during the year ended 31st December 2018.

In 2016 the guidelines were 125% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 100% for the other Executive Directors, over a maximum period of five years from date of appointment to the Board.
Following the approval of the Remuneration Policy at the AGM in May 2017, the share ownership guidelines were increased to 200% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 125% for the other Executive Directors.
This increase applies to the period from 2017.
Executive Directors are expected to achieve the increased maximums within five years.
Progress against the guidelines is illustrated below.
The value of the shareholding is taken at 31stDecember 2018 as a percentage of 2018 base salary.

Target increased from 100% to 125% with effect from May 2017.
Increased target also applies to other Executive Directors EDs.
In accordance with Policy, Executive Directors must use the part of bonus over target, net of tax, to buy shares until their shareholding guideline has been met.
To demonstrate our commitment to this principle, prior to the introduction of our 2020 Policy our Group Chief Executive has volunteered that any bonus earned above 125% will be subject to this mechanism for a two-year holding period.
The share ownership guidelines have been met by all Executive Directors except Kevin Boyd.
Kevin Boyd has made significant progress since he joined in May 2016 and will use that part of his bonus over 60% of base salary to buy more shares to reach the applicable targets.
As noted in the Committee Chairs Statement on pages 91 to 92, the shareholding guidelines have again been increased, with effect from January 2019, to 300% for the Group Chief Executive, and 200% for the other Executive Directors.

Over the last five years, the Group has grown rapidly from mid FTSE 250 to FTSE 100, outperforming the FTSE 100 and our engineering peers, and has increased EPS by 80%.
During that same period, our pay levels have fallen behind market due largely to our historically conservative pay practices and a number of internal promotions.
In order to retain our strong incumbent team, the Committee believes it is important to make a meaningful one-time change, within our shareholder approved Remuneration Policy.
This change helps to ensure that total pay reflects the skills and responsibilities required to fill the Executive Director roles, and that business continuity is maintained as we work to integrate and drive performance in our acquisitions and manage a more complex business with new technology.
Shareholder consultation in relation to 2019 implementation In the second half of 2018, concluding in January 2019, we undertook an extensive consultation process in which we met with 17 of our top shareholders, representing over 50% of our total shares outstanding.
We are grateful for the helpful and constructive advice we received.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 107 Annual Report 2018 Governance Report Governance Report 5.
Remuneration Annual Report on Remuneration 2018 continued Overview of Executive Director Policy implementation in 2019 The changes approved by the Committee result in situating on target remuneration base, target bonus, target PSP vesting, and the combination of each of these elements approaching median for the Group Chief Executive and at, or below, the lower quartile for the other Executive Directors.
For the purpose of assessing pay levels relative to market, the Committee primarily considered practices in 15 peer companies Bodycote, Cobham, Halma, IMI, Meggitt, Morgan Advanced Materials, QinetiQ Group, Renishaw, Rotork, RPC Group, Senior, Smiths Group, Spectris, Ultra Electronics Holdings, and Weir Group.
Against this group of UK-listed industrial engineering peers, Spirax Sarcos revenue is positioned at median, and above the upper quartile with respect to market capitalisation and oneand three-year TSR.
Accordingly, the Committee determined that a position of approaching median for the Group Chief Executive and lower quartile for the other Executive Directors was reasonable and appropriate in the context of the market median positioning that we target for our broader workforce.
The changes are detailed below and are all within our current Policy.

The following points relate to 2019 remuneration: 2019 Annual Bonus The same performance measures and weights apply in 2019 as was the case in 2018, as they continue to align with our strategic focus to deliver self-generated growth that outperforms our markets, by improving on what we already do well.
As in previous years, the specific targets associated with each measure that were approved in February 2019 are not disclosed in this Report as they are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive.
The targets will be retrospectively reported in the Annual Report next year.

In light of the increased award levels, the Committee has reduced the value that can be earned for threshold performance from 25% of the award to 18%.
This has the effect of delivering the same absolute value for threshold performance.
In February 2019, the Committee approved the three-year EPS targets, which remain unchanged at Global IP 2% per annum to Global IP 8% per annum.
Having reviewed our own forecasts, analysts expectations and performance expectations of our peers, we remain satisfied that to achieve growth of Global IP 2% per annum to Global IP 8% per annum over the coming three years remains appropriately challenging and exceeds market consensus.

Therefore, the Committee has committed to make a number of changes to the Remuneration Policy in 2020 to further align our Policy with emerging best practices and the expectations of our shareholders.
108 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2018 We commit to: no salary increases for our Executive Directors above the UK or USA as appropriate workforce norm during the term of the 2020 Policy save for a transformational and significant change in the scale of the Group : enhance our bonus deferral policy to reflect more conventional market practices as part of the 2020 Policy.
Prior to the introduction of our 2020 Policy, our Group Chief Executive has volunteered, with immediate effect, to defer into shares, for a two-year holding period, any bonus earned above his current maximum opportunity of 125%: formally adopt the increase in shareholding requirements from 200% to 300% of salary for the Group Chief Executive, and from 125% to 200% of salary for the other Executive Directors.
As is the case under our Policy, the Executive Directors will have five years, to May 2025, in which to achieve the increased ownership guideline: adopt a post-employment requirement in relation to the level of Company shareholdings that must be maintained by Executive Directors for a defined period of time: and set any new Executive Director pension in line with wider UK workforce opportunity.
Implementation of Non-Executive Director fee policy in 2019 Effective from 1st January 2019, the Non-Executive Director basic fee was increased by 2.9%, which is in line with the average UK employee salary increase of 2.9%.
The Committee Chair and Senior Independent Directors fees were unchanged.
1.13 Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors remuneration Operation of the Remuneration Committee in 2018 Membership and attendance Each Committee member is an Independent Non-Executive Director and thus brings independence to all aspects of Board remuneration and the application of professional advice to matters relating to remuneration.
During 2018, the Committee was chaired by Jane Kingston and the members comprised: Trudy Schoolenberg, CliveWatson, JamiePike up to his appointment as Chair of the Board on 15th May 2018 and Peter France with effect from his appointment to the Board on 6thMarch 2018.
In 2018, the Committee met six times and all members attended each meeting relative to their Committee membership, with PeterFrance attending five meetings from his appointment on 6th March 2018.
On his appointment to Chair of the Board, Jamie Pike ceased being a formal member of the Committee, but continued to attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee Chair.
The Chair of the Board was independent on appointment and did not formally vote on matters approved by the Committee.
Advisers to the Committee During 2018, the Committee sought advice and information from Bill Whiteley, the Chair up to 15th May 2018, and Jamie Pike, the Chair with effect from 15th May 2018: Nicholas Anderson, the Group Chief Executive: and Jim Devine, the Group Human Resources Director.
None of the invitees participated in any discussions regarding their own remuneration or fees.

In addition, the Committee received external advice from Willis Towers Watson, who was appointed by the Committee and provided material advice to the Committee on various matters such as Executive remuneration levels and structure, performance updates in respect of the PSP, the Remuneration Report and attendance at Committee meetings.
Willis Towers Watsons fees in respect of these services totalled 89,100 in 2018.
In addition, Willis Towers Watson work with management on other matters relating to remuneration with the approval of the Committee.
A separate advisory team within Willis Towers Watson provides support and advice to management on pensions and other employee benefit-related matters.
The Committee is of the opinion that the advice received is objective and independent, given that Willis Towers Watson are a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct, the manner in which advice is delivered and the separate teams that advise management more generally.

114 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2018 2.2 Notes to the Policy table Changes to the Remuneration Policy The proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy are as follows: AIP award: increase potential maximum award from 125% to 150% of salary: PSP award: increase potential maximum award from 100%-150% of salary to 200% of salary: PSP holding period: introduce a two-year post-vesting holding period currently there is no holding period : share ownership requirements: increase share ownership requirements from at least 125% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and at least 100% of salary for the other Executive Directors to 200% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and 125% of salary for the other Executive Directors: remove the Committees discretion to grant one-off awards for recruitment or retention in exceptional circumstances: and reserve the Committees right to adjust for the effects of divestments or major acquisitions from the EPS results, to ensure those results are in line with the primarily organic growth principles that support the EPS targets.
Additional details and an explanation of the changes can be found in the Statement by the Chairman of the Committee on pages 85 and 86.
Outstanding incentive awards Details of outstanding incentive awards granted to Executive Directors prior to the Policy coming into force, including awards granted in 2016, and details of the performance targets are set out on pages 89 to 92 of the Annual Report on Remuneration 2016.
All incentive awards granted prior to this Policy coming into force will continue on their existing terms including the exercise of discretion to amend such awards.
Remuneration policy for other employees The Companys approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, level of experience, responsibility, individual performance and market pay levels.
The most senior managers in the business approximately 80 people globally participate in bonus arrangements with similar targets, measures and relative weightings to the Executive Directors.
Target and maximum potential values are lower and determined by the grade of the managers role.
Performance targets are based on an appropriate combination of Group, divisional and local operating company financial measures.
Contractual terms and benefits for the wider workforce are subject to local employment legislation and best practice.
Measure selection and the target setting process Measures are selected taking into account the key strategic priorities of the Company, shareholder expectations and factors that sit within an individuals span of control.
Targets are set with reference to internal and external forecasts to ensure that they are realistic, yet sufficiently stretching.
An appropriate mix of longand short-term targets will be used, informed by the nature of the measure.
2.3 External directorships Directors are permitted to hold external directorships in order to broaden their experience, to the benefit of the Company.
Such appointments are subject to approval by the Board and the Director may retain any fees paid in respect of such directorships.
The Board ensures compliance by Directors with Code provision B.
2.4 Approach to recruitment and promotion remuneration When appointing external hires, promoting executives, or an Executive Director internally, the Committee will continue to act in the best interests of shareholders when determining remuneration, in line with the stated policy.
The main elements of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Director appointments are: Base salary will be set on appointment taking into account the factors set out in the Policy table, but also the individuals experience.
Depending on an individuals prior experience, the Committee may set salary below market norms, with the intention that it is realigned over time, typically two to three years, subject to performance in the role.
In this situation, the Committee is permitted to exceed the normal rate of annual salary increase set out in the Policy table.
On-going annual incentive pay opportunity will not exceed 350% of salary, in line with the maximums stated in the Policy table up to 150% of salary for annual bonus and an award of up to 200% of salary under the PSP.
In the year of appointment an off-cycle award under the PSP may be made by the Committee to ensure an immediate alignment of individual interests.
In addition to the standard elements of remuneration, on the appointment of an external candidate, the Committee reserves the right to buy-out incentive awards that the individual has foregone by accepting the appointment, if appropriate.
The terms of such awards would be informed by the amounts being forfeited and the associated terms for example the extent to which the outstanding awards were subject to performance, the vehicles and the associated time horizons.
Awards would be made either through the existing share plans or in accordance with the relevant provisions contained within the Listing Rules.

Remuneration Remuneration Policy Report 2017 continued When an internal appointment to the Board is made, any pre-existing obligations may be honoured by the Committee and payment will be permitted under this Remuneration Policy.
For internal promotions, salary will be capped at that of the incumbent Group Chief Executive.
Details of the remuneration for any new Chairman or Executive Director appointed to the Board will be disclosed on the Groups website, www.
2.5 Service agreements and termination policy The Companys policy on service agreements and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below.
Service agreements are designed to reflect the interests of the Company, as well as the individual concerned.
Executive Directors service agreements are kept at the Companys headquarters in Cheltenham.
In accordance with the Code and guidelines issued by institutional investors, Executive Directors have service agreements that are terminable by either the Company or the Executive Director on 12 months notice.
In the event of termination or resignation, and subject to business reasons, the Company would not necessarily hold the Executive Director to his or her full notice period.
All Directors are subject to election if newly appointed in the year or re-election at the AGM.
Service agreements set out restrictions on the ability of the Executive Director to participate in businesses competing with those of the Group or to entice or solicit away from the Group any senior employees or to solicit deal with clients of the Group or interfere with supply, in the 12 months following the cessation of employment.
Salary, pension and benefits are included in the agreements and are treated as described in the policy table on pages 100 to 103.
There is no contractual entitlement to payment of an annual bonus or granting of an award under the PSP, until individual participation, level of award, measures and targets have been set for a particular year.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but serve the Company under letters of appointment, for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election at the AGM.
Group Chief Executive and new appointments from 1st January 2013 The details of the service agreements of the Group Chief Executive and for new appointments to the Board are outlined below and comply with best practice.
In the event of a material change in role, function or responsibilities, Executive Directors agreements will be reviewed and will be expected to be updated to meet the requirements outlined below.
Notice period 12 months by the Executive Director and 12 months by the Company Termination No payment if Executive Director commits a repudiatory breach of the service agreement or for gross misconduct or in certain circumstances.
No additional termination payment if notice worked.
If notice only part worked part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice, otherwise 12 months base salary only.
Company discretion to pay in lieu of notice in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control, when a lump sum will be paid.
If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits, excluding long-term incentives, earned in new paid employment in that period.
No automatic entitlement to payments under the annual bonus or PSP.
Robust post-termination restrictions on confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and non-interference with customers or suppliers.
Service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of certain events, such as gross misconduct or financial misstatement.
Clawback or Bonus payments and PSP awards are subject to clawback or malus for up to three years following award.
malus Circumstances include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct.
116 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2018 Executive Directors legacy agreements Within the legacy agreements of Executive Directors, termination of agreements is subject to a 12 month notice period.
Where payment is made in lieu of notice on termination, the payment of a sum in respect of lost future bonus opportunity based on an average of the preceding three years bonus payments is subject to the Committees discretion.
The Committee has the power to reduce the amount to reflect performance on the part of the Executive Director that is considered by the Committee to be unsatisfactory.
On termination of such an Executive Directors service agreement, the Committee will take into account the departing Executive Directors need to mitigate his or her loss when determining the amount of bonus.
Payment will only be made at the discretion of the Committee after taking into account individual performance in order to ensure that there will be no payments for failure.
In any event, payments will be subject to clawback or malus provisions.
Executive Directors service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of certain events, such as termination for gross misconduct or financial misstatement.
While the Executive Directors service agreements include a provision to deal with termination on a change of control, in the event of an offer being made, shareholders have discretion to accept the offer or not.
The decision to recommend acceptance, or not, is a matter for the Board, and the Committee is of the clear view that the change of control provision within the Executive Directors service agreements would have no influence on the voting pattern of those Executive Directors.
Executive Directors legacy agreements are summarised in the table below.
If notice only part worked part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice.
Otherwise 12 months base salary, the value of other benefits, plus the cost of pension credits or contributions for the period plus the average of the prior three years annual bonus payments, with Committee discretion to reduce the amount of the bonus that would otherwise be calculated, to reflect performance on the part of the Executive Director that is considered by the Committee to be below the required standards, provided that termination by the Company does not occur within 12 months of a change of control.
Committee discretion to pay in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control when a lump sum will be paid.
If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits excluding long-term incentives, earned in new paid employment in that period.
No automatic entitlement to payments under the current annual bonus or PSP.
Treatment of leavers under the incentive plans Whilst it is not an entitlement, it is expected that where an Executive Director is a good leaver ie where the cessation of employment is due to death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company business in which he she works being disposed of or where the ending of employment is instigated by the Company and is not for cause, payments will be made under the annual bonus plan if performance targets are met subject to, and in accordance with, the plan rules.
If the Executive Director is not a good leaver it is expected that no bonus will be paid.
The treatment of leavers under the PSP is determined in accordance with the shareholder approved PSP rules.
Any awards granted within six months prior to termination or the giving or receiving of notice will lapse.
Any awards granted six months or longer prior to termination of employment but prior to the end of the performance period will lapse unless the Executive Director is considered to be a good leaver.
In the case of a good leaver the award will vest on the termination date, or the normal vesting date, at the Committees discretion.
This is subject to the satisfaction of the performance targets at that date and a pro-rata reduction in the number of shares to take account of the shortening of the performance period.
For awards granted on or after 1st March 2012, if the Executive Director is a good leaver where the ending of employment is not for cause, the number of shares vested may be reduced including to zero by the Committee in its absolute discretion.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 117 Annual Report 2018 Governance Report Governance Report 5.
Remuneration Remuneration Policy Report 2017 continued If an Executive Director ceases employment or notice is given on or after the end of the performance period but prior to the date on which the Committee has determined the extent to which the award has vested, if the Executive Director is a good leaver, his her award will be preserved and will be treated in the same way as if his her employment had continued, whereas if the Executive Director is not a good leaver, his her award will lapse on the earlier of his her cessation of employment and the giving of notice.
In relation to the ESOP, as an HMRC approved plan, where an Executive Director leaves the treatment will be in line with the approved plan rules and HMRC guidance.
Change of control Bonus: if termination occurs within 12 months of a change of control, the Executive Director is entitled to i a lump sum payment in lieu of notice and ii receive a full bonus payment calculated by reference to the average of the preceding three years bonus payments without any reduction for performance.
PSP: the rules provide that in the event of a change of control, outstanding share-based awards will vest to the extent that performance targets are met at the date of the event.
Any such vesting would generally be on a time pro-rated basis.
The Committee may, at its discretion, increase the level of vesting if it believes that exceptional circumstances warrant such treatment.
2.6 Illustrations of application of the Remuneration Policy Under the Remuneration Policy, a significant portion of remuneration is variable and depends on the Companys performance.
Below and overleaf we illustrate how the total pay opportunity for the Executive Directors varies under three performance scenarios: maximum, on target, and below threshold.
The scenarios for 2017, informed by the current application of our pay policy, are as follows: Element Fixed pay, benefits and ESOP Fixed pay and ESOP does not vary with performance and comprises: base salary effective 1st January 2017: benefits value based on 2016 disclosure: pension value DB 2016: as reported: cash allowance: rate applied to 2017 salary : and ESOP participation of up to 1,500 1:1 matching shares for eligible Executive Directors.
Percentage of base salary Below threshold On target Maximum Annual bonus % of salary 0% 75% CEO 125% CEO 60% ED 100% ED 1 PSP % of salary at award 0% 37.5% CEO 150% CEO 31.25% ED 125% ED 1 A level of 25% vesting for on target performance is equivalent to threshold performance under the PSP, which the Committee believes to be a fair assumption for on target performance given the approach taken to setting performance targets.
118 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2018 2.7 Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group When determining the remuneration of Executive Directors, the Committee considers the pay of employees across the Group.
When conducting the annual salary review, the average base salary increase awarded to the UK workforce and senior managers across the Group provides a key reference point when determining levels of increase for Executive Director remuneration.
The Remuneration Policy was drawn up by the Committee without the need for any consultation with employees.
The Committee also determines the principles and policy of remuneration which shall apply to the Groups senior managers.
The responsibility for determining precise compensation packages that meet local practice and performance targets lies with the Group Chief Executive and the responsible Executive Director.
To ensure consistency in Remuneration Policy across the Group and to encourage a performance culture, senior managers participate in the PSP.
The Board believes that share ownership is an effective way of aligning the interests of managers and shareholders and to strengthen the development of the business.
2.8 Statement of consideration of shareholder views In developing and reviewing the Companys Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and other senior executives, the Committee seeks and takes into account the range of views of shareholders and institutional shareholder advisers.
The Committee Chairman actively engages with major shareholders and institutional shareholder advisers when appropriate and takes into account their views when reviewing and implementing the Companys Remuneration Policy.
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from institutional shareholder advisers more generally.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during the year at meetings with shareholders, is considered as part of the Companys annual Remuneration Policy review.
At the AGM in 2016, the advisory vote on the 2015 Annual Report on Remuneration received 97.2% in favour.
At the AGM in 2014 the Remuneration Policy received 98.5% in favour.
In finalising the 2017 Remuneration Policy the views of shareholders and institutional shareholder advisers have shaped the: introduction of an additional two-year post-vesting holding period for PSP grants: rebalance of long-term and short-term compensation opportunities by way of the Directors PSP opportunity now being more substantive than the AIP: agreement to disclose AIP targets retrospectively: increase in share ownership requirements: removal of the Committees discretion to grant one-off awards for recruitment or retention in exceptional circumstances: keeping of the PSP performance metrics under review, including the consideration of organic growth measures: and reserving of the Committees right to adjust for the effects of divestments or major acquisitions from the EPS results, to ensure those results are in line with the primarily organic growth principles that support the EPS targets.
