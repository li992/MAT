These adjustments are intended to leave the Company broadly cost neutral in relation to its increased costs arising from the Chief Executive Officers short-term commuter assignment to the US to develop our strategy and business there.
The US assignment began on 1 April 2018 and so the target bonus for 2018 is 100% of salary to 1 April 2018 and 90% of salary thereafter The table below sets out the break down of the single figure of remuneration for each Executive Director in 2018 and 2017.
As noted above, the Company has provided accommodation for the period of Andrew Rashbass short-term assignment to the US.
The cost of this accommodation is exempt from tax and so it has not been included in the benefits figure 2 A djusted pre-tax EPS was 101.19p.
This equates to 819.91 percentage points above 11 pence and 405.95 percentage points above 20 pence.
The full-year profit share amount equates to 734,715: this is pro-rated for eight and a half months until retirement in June 2018, resulting in a payment of 520,423 3 Includes any amount deferred into nil-cost options for two years, with vesting subject to continued employment other than in limited good leaver circumstances 4 F or 2017, the value of Andrew Rashbass buy-out award vesting was calculated using the average mid-market price of the five days preceding vesting on 30 September 2017 of 11.74.
Due to being in a close period, no vesting of the buy-out award occurred in 2017.

In determining the final level of bonus payable, the Committee also considered whether the overall bonus outcome was appropriate.
On the basis of the above, the annual bonus will pay out at 60.1% of maximum opportunity and an overall bonus of 676,350 90.2% of salary.
Under our Remuneration Policy, any annual bonus earned in excess of 100% of salary will be paid as a nil-cost option, the vesting of which will be deferred for two years.

These were based around internal controls, risk management and the actions on the internal structure of the finance function.
The Committee assessed the CFOs performance against these objectives and determined that performance against those individual objectives was on target.
On the basis of the above, the annual bonus will pay out at 50% of maximum opportunity against the individual objectives and an overall bonus of 27,734 62.5% of salary after pro-rating to reflect the proportion of 2018 that Wendy Pallot was on the Board.

For these purposes, shareholder return represents the theoretical growth in value of a shareholding over a specific period, assuming that dividends are reinvested to purchase additional shares.
The Company is a constituent of the FTSE 250 index and, accordingly, this is considered to be the most appropriate benchmark.

The Directors feel that this group of people is the most appropriate as a comparator because employee pay is determined annually by the Committee at the same time as that of the CEO and under the same economic circumstances.
The Directors believe this demonstrates the best link between the changes in average remuneration compared to the CEO.

Relative importance of spend on pay The table below illustrates the Companys spend on employee pay in comparison to profits and distributions to shareholders.
These are deemed by the Directors to be the significant distributions made during the year and will assist stakeholders in understanding the relative importance of spend on pay.

For the year under review, the Committee also sought advice and information from the Companys Chief Executive Officer, Finance Director Chief Financial Officer, the Global HR Director and the Global Reward Director.
The Committees terms of reference permit its members to obtain professional advice on any matter.
Guidance was sought from Deloitte on an ad hoc basis and fees of 500 were payable for this advice.
Deloitte was appointed in 2013 by the Committee.
Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
The Committee is satisfied as to the independent nature of their advice.
The key activities of the Committee in the year included: Assessing performance against the bonus performance measures for 2017 bonus payment to the Chief Executive Officer Assessing performance measures for 2017 profit share payment to the Finance Director Approving 2017 bonus payments for the Group Management Board individuals Finalising the 2017 Directors Remuneration Report, including the new Remuneration Policy which was put to shareholders for approval at our 2018 AGM Approving the performance measures and targets to apply to annual bonus payments for 2018 Approving the performance measures and performance targets to apply to PSP awards granted during the year Determining the leaving arrangements for the Finance Director and the remuneration package for the new Chief Financial Officer Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 73 Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Implementation of the Remuneration Policy in 2019 Basic salary Directors salaries from 1 October 2018 are: Andrew Rashbass: 750,000 Wendy Pallot: 355,000 Salaries will be reviewed in April 2019 Pensions and benefits No change to prior year for Andrew Rashbass or Wendy Pallot Annual incentive The weightings for the individual and financial objectives for Andrew Rashbass and Wendy Pallot under the Annual Bonus Plan in 2019 will remain the same as 2018 with 75% based on adjusted profit before tax Annual Bonus Plan and 25% on individual objectives.
The Committee considers that disclosing the precise targets, which are commercially sensitive, of the Annual Bonus Plan would not be in shareholders interests and awards made will be published at the end of the performance period where possible.
Annual bonus deferral Any amount above 100% of salary for Andrew Rashbass and Wendy Pallot will be deferred into nil-cost options for two years, as was the case for 2018.
Long-term incentive The value of the PSP awards due to be granted to Executive Directors in December 2018 will be equivalent to 170% of salary for Andrew Rashbass and 150% of salary for Wendy Pallot.
The performance measures attached to these PSP awards will be adjusted diluted EPS 75% weighting and adjusted operating profit margin 25% weighting, as was the case for 2018 awards.
For the adjusted diluted EPS performance measure, the threshold target level will be compounded annualised adjusted diluted EPS growth of 3% over the performance period and would result in 25% vesting.
Maximum vesting would occur at compounded annualised EPS growth of 8%.
Vesting occurs on a sliding scale between the threshold and maximum level.
For the adjusted operating profit margin performance measure, the threshold target level will be adjusted operating profit margin of 25.5% over the performance period and would result in 25% vesting.
Maximum vesting would occur if adjusted operating profit margin is 28%, with vesting taking place on a sliding scale between the threshold and maximum level.
Directors employed in the UK are eligible to participate in the SAYE.
