Directors remuneration report Focusing and incentivising delivery Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 31 January 2018.
This is the second report under our Remuneration Policy the Policy, and follows the completion of Year 2 of our five year strategy focused on becoming the leading home improvement company.
Pursuing our ambition means operating in a totally IMAGE REMOVED different way: our strategy will transform Kingfisher and deliver a more valuable investment proposition for our investors whilst also creating value for our customers, our colleagues, our suppliers and broader society.
It is my objective in this report to provide an update on how the Policy is supporting the delivery of the transformation plan as well as to report on the remuneration decisions wehave taken for 2017 18.
We are also very conscious of the evolving public Contents focus on executive remuneration and the Committees 70 Annual Statement from the Chairman of the role in ensuring that rewards are fair and proportionate.
Remuneration Committee To respond to this, I also provide an update on activity underway to ensure that all colleagues can also share 73 At a glance and rationale for structure in the success of the transformation.
74 Annual Report on Remuneration 81 Statement of implementation of the Remuneration Supporting delivery of the ONE Kingfisher plan Policy for 2018 19 The Policy, approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM, 85 Directors Remuneration Policy for reference delivers competitive reward in an innovative way, tightly aligned to the execution of our strategy.
It represents a simplified approach to executive remuneration, consisting About this report of two components: This report has been prepared in compliance with the remuneration disclosures required under the Large An annual package for executives comprised of fixed and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts pay, a reduced cash bonus based on strategic targets and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013. and Alignment Shares granted subject to underpins on balance sheet and business health metrics measured over three years: and A long-term Transformation Incentive linked to improving EPS and ROCE over the five year strategy period as laid out at the Capital Markets Day in January2016.
The diagram on the next page demonstrates the elements of our reward structure, the link with our strategy and the benefits to shareholders.
In summary our approach has been to use the cash bonus to incentivise management to deliver the milestones necessary for execution of the strategy.
They are held strongly accountable for balance sheet strength and business health through the transformation by the Alignment Shares construct, and for ultimate financial improvements and growth created by the strategy through the five-year Transformation Incentive.

com 73 Transformation Alignment Annual Base Incentive Shares Bonus Salary Directors remuneration report continued Annual Report on Remuneration The Annual Report on Remuneration outlines how the Committee implemented the Directors Remuneration Policy for the financial year ended 31 January 2018.
This report, together with the Annual Statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, will be put to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 12 June 2018.
Shareholder approval is on an advisory basis only.
These reports have been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 and include the items required to be disclosed under 9.8.

Where information disclosed has been subject to audit by the Groups auditor, Deloitte LLP, this is highlighted.
Single total figure of remuneration for the executive directors audited information The table below sets out the remuneration of each of the executive directors for the financial year ended 31 January 2018 and the comparative figures for the financial year ended 31 January 2017.
Base Salary audited information Executive directors salaries were increased at the start of the 2017 18 financial year with effect from 1 April 2017.
No other reviews took place during the year.
As at 1 April2017 As at 1 April 2016 000 000 % increase Executive directors Vronique Laury 770.1 755.0 2% Karen Witts 586.5 575.0 2% As disclosed in the 2015 16 Annual Report on Remuneration, there is an intention over the life of the current Policy to move the salary of the CEO toward the market median, and to move the salary of the CFO to an appropriate position between the FTSE 25-75 and the retail peer group.
For 2017 18, the CEO requested that the Committee award her and the CFO no more than the average increase to the broader workforce, recognising that the transformation strategy remains in its early stages.
The Committee agreed this was appropriate and awarded an increase of 2% to both executive directors.
It remains the Committees intention to realign the executive directors salaries against market as execution of the strategy continues to proceed successfully, which may result in increases above the average of the workforce.
Taxable Benefits audited information The benefits provided to executive directors for both 2017 18 and 2016 17 included car benefit or cash allowance, private medical insurance, death-in-service cover, financial advice and, where applicable, relocation support.
Vronique Laury opted for a company car.
Karen Witts opted for the cash allowance.
This benefit relates to ongoing annual tax preparation assistance provided to the CEO in the UK and France.
This assistance is provided in recognition of the international nature of the CEOs role and is limited to income tax return preparation required in respect of the CEOs employment income.
Note that this figure is inclusive of tax payable on expenses reimbursed.
Annual Bonus audited information The purpose of the Annual Bonus is to focus executives on the achievement of strategic milestones that are critical to the transformation of Kingfisher.
The 2017 18 annual bonus was based on strategic milestones within the following four pillars: Unique & Unified Offer: Digital: Operational Efficiency: and People.
The table below sets out the targets that were set in respect of each of the four pillars, the corresponding achievement against these targets during the period ending 31 January 2018 and the resulting payout.

Total achievement prior to Committee discretion 92% Total achievement post discretion see below 87% At the Committee meeting in September, the Committee approved amendments to the milestones on the implementation of key elements of ecommerce and continued roll-out of the Groups unified IT platform.
The agreed amendments re-prioritised these milestones to focus on larger Operating Companies in France and Poland, and increased the difficulty of achieving the milestones.
The Committee requested and received evidence to satisfy itself that these changes would not impact the 2020 21 financial or operational commitments under the transformation.
The Committee considered the annual bonus outcome in view of the performance against the strategic milestones as set out above.
It was concluded that all milestones had been substantially met, resulting in a payout of 92% of maximum.
The Committee also recognised that certain aspects of the transformational activity caused some disruption to sales.
They therefore exercised their discretion and reduced the payout by 5% to 87%.
This resulted in a bonus of 69.6% of salary be payable to the executive directors.
This equates to 534,238 for the CEO and 406,870 for the CFO.
The 2017 18 annual bonus will be paid in April 2018, and will be paid entirely in cash.

Alignment Shares audited information In line with our Policy, the Committee determined that personal performance for both the CEO and CFO had been strong throughout the 2016 17 financial year and approved the grant of Alignment Shares at the level of 80% of salary.
Further detail on the performance of the executive directors during 2016 17 can be found in last years remuneration report.

The number of shares shown represents the proportion of the Alignment Share award granted in April 2017, which vested immediately.
Calculated using the closing share price on the date of vesting of 337.2p.
LTIP audited information The value of LTIPs shown in the single figure table shows the level of award vesting based on targets set and measured over the relevant reporting period financial year ended 31 January 2018.
The table below sets out the LTIP due to vest in 2018 in respect of the performance period ended 31 January 2018.

The Committee concluded that it remained appropriate to retain the formulaic outcome from the measure, and that no adjustment should be made.
As a result, the 2015 LTIP awards lapsed in full.
As explained in previous reports, Kingfisher no longer reports using the KEP measure.
KEP represents earnings after a charge for the annual cost of capital employed in the business and is derived from the concept of Economic Value Added.
Earnings for KEP purposes exclude exceptional items and property lease rentals.
A charge is then deducted by applying the weighted average cost of capital WACC to capital employed.
For the purposes of consistency both WACC and capital employed are lease-adjusted.
Leases are capitalised based on an estimate of their long-term property yields.
In order to focus on controllable factors both WACC and longterm property yields are based on those in place when KEP was introduced.
Pensions audited information Executive directors based in the UK are eligible to join the UK defined contribution pension plan the DC Scheme.
No executive director has a prospective right to a defined benefit pension.
The company operates a policy to limit the combined employer and member pension contributions during a tax year to the annual allowance, with the excess employer contribution being directed into a taxable monthly cash allowance.
In addition, directors may choose to opt out of the scheme completely, if for example, they have reached the lifetime allowance.
A summary of the arrangements for the executive directors is set out below.
Notional employer contribution rate into Cash allowance in lieu Equivalent cash defined contribution pension scheme for Member of the of employer contributions allowance rate as Executive directors which the individual is eligible UK DC Scheme into DC Scheme % of salary Vronique Laury 14% No Yes, in full 12.5% Karen Witts 20% Yes Yes, in excess of the 17.5% annual allowance Notes: Karen Witts own member contributions took up the annual allowance headroom, meaning that the full employer contribution was paid as a cash alternative.
Cash allowances are provided on a cost neutral basis for the company.
This means that a discount is applied to those directors joining after the introduction of pension salary sacrifice SMART pensions in 2012.
This accounts for the fact that employers national insurance is payable on the cash alternative, whereas it is not payable on employer pension contribution into the defined contribution scheme.
Accordingly, the cash alternative for Vronique Laury is 12.5% of salary and for Karen Witts it is 17.5% of salary.

The holding of such roles can provide valuable insight for the executive directors, which can be of benefit to Kingfisher.
Subject to the Committees agreement, the individual may retain any fees applicable for these roles.

Sir Ian Cheshire stepped down as Chief Executive Officer on 8 December 2014, at which point Vronique Laury took over the position.
Sir Ian Cheshires remuneration in the table is from the start of the financial year up until 8 December 2014, and Vronique Laurys is from 8 December 2014 to the end of the financial year.
The single total figure in the table above shows the combined total remuneration for both Sir Ian Cheshire and Vronique Laury.
This represents 25% of the total Alignment Share award equivalent to 80% of salary granted in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
This portion vested upon grant.
The remaining 75% of this award equivalent to 60% of salary will vest three years after the date of grant, subject to performance against the underpin measures set out in the corresponding Remuneration Report.

The UK employee workforce was chosen as a suitable comparator group as the Chief Executive Officer is based in the UK albeit with aglobal role and responsibilities and pay changes across Kingfisher vary widely depending on local market conditions.
The reduction in the CEOs taxable benefits from the prior year reflects the additional relocation support, in the form of tax advice, provided to the CEO in 2016 17.

The Committee agreed that it was appropriate to award an increase above that for the wider workforce 2% for UK employees to both executive directors.
Benefits Implemented in line with policy.
Pension Implemented in line with policy.
Annual Bonus Implemented in line with policy.
The Annual Bonus will have a maximum opportunity of 80% of salary.
The Annual Bonus will be judged based on the achievement of a number of strategic milestones critical to the delivery of the transformation as set out below: 2018 product range implementation including unified COGS and growth in unified & unique sales and gross margin: Unified IT implementation roll-out of unified systems: Digital implementation including implementation of the ecommerce platform and other home improvement services: Goods not for resale GNFR implementation including measures on benefit delivered for the financial year 2018 19: Operating model including the implementation of new, simpler and more effective ways of working: and People motivating employees as we move through our transformational journey.

In the opinion of the Committee, the detail of the Annual Bonus measures and targets for 2018 19 are commercially sensitive and accordingly are not disclosed.
These will be disclosed next year.
The targets are aligned to the operational milestones set out in the Strategic Report on pages 25 to 27.
It is the Committees policy to gradually progress from process objectives to a greater focus on strategic output measures as the Company progresses through to delivery of the transformation.
com 81 Directors remuneration report continued Alignment Shares Implemented in line with policy.
The Committee recognised the strong personal performance of both the CEO and CFO throughout 2017 18 and so Alignment Share awards will be made at the level of 80% of salary in line with policy.
A summary of the personal performance for each executive director is set out below: Vronique Laury demonstrated strong personal performance through: strong leadership of the wider team: maintenance of the ongoing business in a toughening retail environment: operational delivery through the transformation, in line with expectations: and, the continued delivery of the strategic milestones see Strategic Report pages 22-24 for further details.
Karen Witts demonstrated strong personal performance through: her leadership and development of the Finance team: her role in building trust and confidence in our Transformation with key investors: the delivery of the second stage of the goods not for resale GNFR benefits: oversight of our Romanian business, including the acquisition of Praktiker Romania: and through her contribution to the development of the operating model which will facilitate the sustained future performance of the business.
The underpin conditions for the Alignment Share awards relate to maintaining the underlying health of the business over the course of the five year strategy period, to the end of 2021 22.
The underpin conditions for the 2018 19 awards, which will apply throughout the duration of the three-year vesting period are: maintenance of the 10.1p dividend subject to dividend cover being above 1.75 times: and maintenance of ratio of lease adjusted net debt to EBITDAR below 2.5 times.
If one underpin condition is not met, then up to 50% of the unvested shares would lapse.
If both are not met, then up to 100% of the unvested award would lapse.
The Committee will determine the appropriate deduction considering business performance and progress against the capital return plan.
Performance against the underpin will be considered annually and any reduction will apply to the award next due to vest.
In the event that the lease-adjusted net debt to EBITDAR ratio is exceeded due to Board-approved acceleration of investment plans, then the Committee may apply discretion to allow vesting.
In these circumstances, the Committee would consider delaying vesting inwhole or part by a further year to ensure sustainability of performance.

88 Kingfisher plc Annual Report 2017 2018 Approach to recruitment remuneration Area Policy and operation Overall When hiring a new executive director, or making internal promotions to the Board, the Committee will apply the same policy as for existing executive directors, as detailed in the Remuneration Policy.
The rationale for the package offered will be explained in the next Annual Report on Remuneration.
For internal promotions, any commitments made prior to appointment may continue to be honoured as the executive is transitioned to the new remuneration arrangements.
Where an individual is promoted after the Transformation Incentive grant in the policy period, an award may be made to bring the executive onto the in-flight cycle at an opportunity level reflecting their new role, subject to the limits set out in the Policy.
Awards may bepro-rated to reflect the remaining portion of the vesting period.
Any award will take into consideration awards granted prior to promotion.
The policy below is consistent with the principles of the previous recruitment policy which have been adapted in line with the new remuneration structure.
Base salary Base salary would be set at an appropriate level to recruit the best candidate based on their skills, experience and current remuneration.
Benefits Benefits provision would be in line with normal policy.
Where appropriate the executive may also receive relocation benefits or other benefits reflective of normal market practice in the territory in which the executive director is employed.
Pension Pension provision would be in line with normal policy.
Incentive awards Incentive awards would be made under the Annual Bonus, Alignment Shares and Transformation Incentive in line with the normal policy.
Where an individual joins after the Transformation Incentive grant in the policy period, an award may be made to bring the executive onto the in-flight cycle subject to the limits set out in the policy.
Awards may be pro-rated for the portion of vesting period served.
Buy-out awards In addition to normal incentive awards, buy-out awards may be made to reflect value forfeited through an individual leaving their current employer.
If a buy-out award is required, the Committee would aim to reflect the nature, timing, and value of awards forgone in any replacement awards.
Awards may be made in cash, shares, Alignment Shares, Transformation Incentive or any other method as deemed appropriate by the Committee.
Where possible, share awards will be replaced with share awards.
Where performance conditions applied to the forfeited awards, performance conditions willbe applied to the replacement award or the award size will be discounted accordingly.
In establishing the appropriate value of any buy-out the Committee would also take into account the value of the other elements of the new remuneration package.
The Committee would aim to minimise the cost to the company, however, buy-out awards are not subject to a formal maximum.
Any awards would be broadly no more valuable than those being replaced.
Shareholding requirements To ensure the alignment of the interests of executives and shareholders over the long-term, executive directors are required to build a significant shareholding.
The shareholding requirement is 350% of salary for the CEO and 250% for any other executive director.
All shares beneficially owned and nil-cost awards which have vested but that the executive has yet to exercise are considered to count towards the shareholding on a notional post-tax basis.
Deferred bonus shares, awarded under the previous Remuneration Policy, are not included in the assessment of the shareholding requirement until the transfer of beneficial ownership to the executive at the end of the three year deferral period.
Until the shareholding requirement is met, executive directors are required to retain 100% of vested post-tax Alignment Shares, retain 50% of vested post-tax Transformation Incentive shares, and retain 50% of post-tax shares that vest from awards granted under the previous Remuneration Policy.
It is expected that executives would retain 100% of post-tax shares from the Transformation Incentive until the requirement is met.
Upon leaving the company, the shareholding requirements will continue to apply for two years.
This will be 100% of the shareholding requirement for the first year and will be 50% of the shareholding requirement for the second year after departure.

These provisions enable the company to reduce including, if appropriate, to nil the payout and vesting levels or to recover the relevant value following the cash bonus payout or vesting of shares.
Clawback will apply to the cash bonus for a period of three years following payment and for a period of two years following vesting under the Alignment Shares and Transformation Incentive.
These provisions could take effect in the event of financial misstatement, serious reputational damage, or material misconduct in individual cases.
Change of control In the event of a change of control, share awards will normally vest subject to performance conditions.
Alignment Shares and Transformation Incentive awards will normally be reduced on a time pro-rated basis in line with the treatment for good leavers which is set out in the Service contracts and the policy on payment for loss of office section of this Directors Remuneration Policy.
The Committee may alternatively consider that such a reduction is inappropriate, e. g. if it is agreed with an acquirer to rollover outstanding awards.
Other awards may be reduced at the Committees discretion.
Discretions The Committee retains certain discretions in relation to the Annual Bonus Plan which are set out in full in the plan rules, which include but are not limited to: the determination of and timing of any bonus payment: the impact of a change of control or restructuring: and any adjustments required as a result of a corporate event such as a transaction, corporate restructuring event, special dividend or rights issue.
Discretions set out as part of this Remuneration Policy provide the Committee with discretion in certain matters regarding the administration and operation of the Alignment Shares and Transformation Incentive as set out in the corresponding plan rules approved by shareholders, including, but not limited to the following: any adjustments to performance conditions or awards required as a result of a corporate event such as a transaction, corporate restructuring event, special dividend or rights issue : and minor administrative matters to improve the efficiency of the operation of the plans or to comply with local tax law or regulation.
In relation to the Annual Bonus Plan, Alignment Shares, and Transformation Incentive, and in line with the plan rules, the Committee retains the ability to amend the performance conditions and or measures in respect of any award or payment if one or more event s occur which would lead the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to do so, provided that such an amendment would not be materially less difficult to satisfy than the unaltered performance condition would have been but for the event in question.
Should the Committee use any of the discretions set out above, these would, where relevant, be disclosed in the next Annual Report on Remuneration.
The views of major shareholders may also be sought.
Discretion in relation to the companys All-Employee Share Plans Sharesave and Share Incentive Plan would be exercised within the parameters of the HMRC approved plan status and the Financial Conduct Authoritys Listing Rules.

Differences in remuneration policy for all employees The remuneration structure for members of the Group Executive follows the same approach as for the executive directors but with a lower maximum opportunity as appropriate.
The Transformation Incentive is granted only to the executive directors and members of the Group Executive.
For the next tier of management below the Group Executive, the remuneration structure consists of base salary, benefits, pension, bonus, and Alignment Shares.
Performance measures are tailored to reflect the relevant position of the individual and the relevant part of the business in which they operate.
All other employees are entitled to base salary and benefits and may also receive bonus, pension, profit share and share awards which vary according to local jurisdiction and market practice.
The maximum provision and incentive opportunity available are determined by the seniority and responsibility of the role.
