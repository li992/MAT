Following the evaluation last year, there were no major issues to report.
During 2018, Committee members were updated on the latest developments on executive remuneration and all members received briefings from the Company Secretary and the Committees remuneration advisers throughout the year, to keep them updated on topical matters and developments relating to executive remuneration.
Remuneration advisers Korn Ferry were appointed external advisers to the Committee with effect from April 2017.
The Committee is satisfied that there was no over reliance on Korn Ferry and that advice received was independent and objective.

Fees paid to Korn Ferry for remuneration advisory services in 2018 were 63,558 excluding VAT.
