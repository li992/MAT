His total single figure includes payments of Balance Sheet Carry that were awarded several years ago, before he held a board position.
Philip Keller has continued to contribute significantly to the success of the Group and the record FMC profits.
He has also delivered a successful balance sheet refinancing and overseen the development of the Groups infrastructure platform in terms of both quality and scalability.
Accordingly, he has been awarded an annual bonus of 250,000 and PLC Equity awards of 2,250,000 in respect of FY18.

The Government is proposing the mandatory disclosure of the ratio of the Chief Executives single total figure remuneration to the remuneration of the median UK employee.
As a result of our inclusive and progressive remuneration structure, the CEO : median employee pay ratio for ICG is lower than most comparable UK companies, at 30:1.

While it is extremely challenging to obtain publicly available data on many private companies, we are able to gain insight into this area by commissioning bespoke research by leading external recruitment consultants and other independent providers of compensation data.
As part of our most recent compensation review project ahead of the Remuneration Policy renewal, a market wide review was carried out.
This identified median pay and upper lower quartile pay at a range of leading asset management and private equity firms, as well as listed financial services firms.
The data gathered was used to create the banding ranges for the maximum, on target and minimum awards used for our Executive Directors, which are summarised on page 82 and these remain unchanged from last year.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 75 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SECTION 3 Employee context REMUNERATION POLICY FOR ALL EMPLOYEES All employees of ICG are entitled to a base salary, benefits and, in the UK and most locations, pension.
The variable compensation for all employees is drawn from the AAP and is allocated by reference to role, responsibility and performance and with regard to regulatory requirements.
Awards to individuals may be made up of different types of award as appropriate to incentivise them depending on their role within the business.
Awards made from Annual Award Pool Awards from Third Party Funds Third Performance Balance Party and Fees on Annual Equity Performance Sheet Shadow Third Party Position Bonus Award Fees Carry Carry Funds Executive Director Investment Executives Marketing Executive, Business Infrastructure Partner or Director Other employees The variable compensation mix may be varied from the above if required by law or regulation.
The quantum of each of these awards is determined by the size of the AAP, an individuals seniority, contribution and their individual performance as determined by the annual appraisal process.
In addition, all UK employees are eligible to join the Intermediate Capital Group plc SAYE Plan 2014.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company and employee views The Remuneration Committee considers the employment conditions and the remuneration structures in place for all employees of the Group when setting the Directors remuneration policy.
The Remuneration Committee also reviews the remuneration arrangements of senior investors and senior management and control function employees and oversees the remuneration structure and market positioning for other roles.
The overall and average salary increase across the Group is approved by the Remuneration Committee each year.
The Remuneration Committee does not consult with employees when setting the Directors Remuneration Policy but employees views are represented at Remuneration Committee meetings through the Head of HR and Head of Reward.
The Pre-Incentive Cash Profits resulting largely from successful realisations and strong fund management profitability were 254.9m.
Although lower than 2017, which saw unusually high realisation levels, this was significantly higher than the previous two years.
As this is a core measure which aligns the interests of Executive Directors and employees with shareholders, and taking into account increased headcount and high investment rates, the Committee considered that it was appropriate to increase overall spend on annual awards across the Group whilst also taking the opportunity to protect the future sustainability of the business.
76 ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 CHAIRMANS BOARD OF CORPORATE COMMITTEE REMUNERATION DIRECTORS LETTER DIRECTORS GOVERNANCE REPORTS REPORT REPORT SECTION 3 Employee context CONTINUED CEO pay ratio The ratio of the pay of our Chief Executive to the pay, calculated on a similar basis, of our median employee is 30:1.
The most recent data produced by PIRC shows a FTSE 350 average mean ratio of 52:1.
Our ratio is significantly lower due to an inclusive remuneration policy.
Percentage change in remuneration of director undertaking the role of chief executive The table below details how changes to the CEOs pay compare with the change in the average pay across all employees of the Group.
Each figure is a percentage change of the values between the previous financial year and the financial year under review.
The total permanent workforce has been selected as the comparator for salaries and fees and short term incentives.
The comparison of the increase in taxable benefits has been made for UK permanent employees only as their remuneration packages are most directly comparable to that of the Chief Executive.
Salaries Taxable Short term Percentage change and fees benefits incentives Chief Executive Officer 3.0 5.4 - All employees 3.9 -6.3 6.7 The year on year decrease for all employees benefits is reflective of the decrease in premiums as a result of the successful re-negotiation of the medical insurance contract.
Gender pay As noted in the Chairmans statement, we were not required to report our gender pay gap this year but nevertheless believe that, as a FTSE 250 company, we should address this issue in a transparent way, and we will be voluntarily disclosing both our gender pay gap data and further information about our Diversity and Inclusiveness programme.
This will be published on our website over the summer.

The AAP is determined by the Executive Directors and Remuneration Committee through an assessment of ICGs financial performance.
Cash profit provides a link between income generation for shareholders and employee compensation, ensuring that excessive awards to employees are not made and that any awards that are made are affordable on a cash basis.
Management information is provided to the Executive Directors and Remuneration Committee on performance to ensure that financial results are put into the context of wider performance and risk appetite.
The table below includes the cost of incentives drawn from the AAP for the financial year under review and the four previous years.
This percentage may be exceeded in any year but must not be exceeded on an aggregate average basis over five years.
Managing the AAP by reference to a five year rolling average is a shareholder protection to ensure that variable awards to employees are made in a considered long term way rather than as a reaction to a single years exceptional performance.
Realised cash profits are significantly driven by the realisation of investments, which is unpredictable and often beyond the Companys direct control.
In a strong cash profit year, the Committee may choose not to distribute the full AAP, but can instead retain some of it for potential use in future years, while in a lower cash profit year the Committee may distribute some of the retained AAP.
This approach allows the Committee to plan over multiple years and smooth fluctuations in realisations.
In strong cash profit years, the Committee is not compelled to make awards which may be excessive, while in years with a lower cash profit and or no investment realisations, employees can still be appropriately incentivised to protect the long term interests of the business and mitigate the risk of undesirable loss of talent.
In both cases due regard is given to projected results of future periods and to ongoing management and retention of employees.
The amounts awarded therefore may not fully correlate to annual variations in cash profit, but this reflects the multi-year approach taken by the Committee.
The Committee is mindful each year of the appropriate level of compensation to ensure the retention of employees at all levels, and seeks to ensure that employees are rewarded against appropriate benchmarks.
The table opposite sets out the size of the AAP for FY18 and the total compensation spend for that year.

In the case of Benot Durteste, 84.6% of the long term incentive payments received in the period relate to awards made in his role as an Investment Executive prior to his appointment as an Executive Director.
Due to fluctuations in realisations the amount disclosed may be higher in future years.

ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 81 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Compensation summary LONG TERM NATURE OF CASH PROFIT An overview of our remuneration arrangements including details of FY18 Cash profit is generated by realising investments and receiving fund management fees.
The holding awards to Executive Directors and period for investments is typically 48 years.
This characteristic means that the Annual Award Pool other staff.
is inherently deferred as it includes realisations from a number of investment vintages.
By generating the award pool in this way we ensure that staff are only rewarded when returns are crystallised.

At the beginning of the financial year under review, the Committee assigned the Executive Directors a number of Key Performance Indicators KPIs broadly in the areas of fundraising and growth, investment portfolio performance, operational and risk management measures, performance management and financial performance.
A summary of the KPIs, and the Executive Directors performance against these objectives is set out below.
The targets and ranges are set annually for each KPI.

The Committee believes that this is appropriate in order that the collaborative leadership structure, which has been so important to the overall success of the Group, is maintained.
This approach has, over many years, ensured that all Executive Directors are aligned with and jointly responsible for the Groups strategic direction and key decision making.
This year, for the first time, the weighting applied to each KPI has been varied between the Executive Directors to reflect the focus of their individual roles.
In addition to the above KPIs, each Executive Director is individually measured against the effective application of commercially appropriate risk management practices, metrics and controls.
In some years, strategic initiatives may be too sensitive to be disclosed as KPIs.
It is the intention of the Committee that these will be retrospectively disclosed in future years once they are less sensitive.
There were no such sensitive KPIs this year.
In addition, the Executive Directors are evaluated by the Board in order to establish how effectively they are operating as a team in terms of their complementary knowledge and skills mix, their strategic thinking, decision making, communications, relationship and resource management.
Overall, the Board assessed their performance in FY18 to be good.
The Executive Directors are also individually appraised and that appraisal is informed by the Board evaluation, peer, HR and Compliance feedback.
In considering the appropriate level of awards for the Executive Directors, the Committee considered a broad range of metrics, including but not limited to: Pre incentive cash profit PICP Performance against KPIs Collaboration and leadership to deliver the Groups strategy Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group Whilst PICP of 255m was down 37% against a record 407m in the prior year, largely the result of the prior year benefiting from the realisation of a small number of large legacy Investment Company assets, overall delivery against the Groups strategic objectives has been excellent.
The Groups strategy is to grow our specialist asset manager and, as demonstrated by outperformance against the KPIs, this has been a strong year with fundraising, capital deployment and fund management profits all at record levels, and ahead of internal targets.
In line with our growth ambition the Groups fundraising and Fund Management Company operating margin shareholder targets were increased during the year.
The Committee also gave thoughtful consideration to the evolution of risk management, compliance and operational scalability when assessing the performance of the Executive Directors during the year.
The Committee considered that it was appropriate to increase overall spend on annual awards across the Group taking into account increased headcount, record levels of deployment and the overall strategic delivery of growing our specialist asset manager.
The Committee agreed that awards to each of the Executive Directors should reflect their respective contributions to the overall achievements of the Group and their individual performance against the KPIs set.
It was therefore determined that the awards to Benot Durteste would remain consistent with the value of awards made to the prior Chief Executive Officer in the previous year, and that the awards to Philip Keller would be towards the higher end of the range specified in the policy.
The awards to Benot Durteste reflect his seamless transition to the role of Chief Executive Officer of the Group and the material contribution he has made to increasing long term shareholder value by maximising the profitability of existing strategies and actively pursuing the addition of a number of new, scalable strategies to the portfolio.
This success is particularly reflected in the excellent performance in respect of the two fundraising KPIs.
The Committee also wanted to recognise the fact that Benot Durteste had maintained the investment discipline of the Group which is vital to its future success, particularly given macroeconomic uncertainties demonstrated by the successful outcome on the KPIs relating to realisations and impairments.
Philip Kellers awards reflect his contribution to the overall achievements of the Group, his role in supporting the transition of Chief Executive Officer and effective representation of the interests of the PLCs investments through his participation on certain Investment Committees.
He has contributed significantly to the success of the Group and has also secured the medium term financial security of the Group by overseeing the successful refinancing of the Groups bank facilities.
The gearing and ROE KPIs were both contributory factors when the Committee made its assessment.
He has also continued to oversee progress on risk management, compliance and operational scalability in an increasingly complex environment.
As a result the Committee agreed that Philip Kellers awards should be towards the higher end of the range for his role.
The Executive Directors KPIs for FY19 have been set in the same categories as those disclosed above along with more specific individually weighted targets.
The specific short term targets are not disclosed due to commercial sensitivity but will be disclosed in next years Annual Report.
