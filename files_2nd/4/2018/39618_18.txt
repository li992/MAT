The use of these measures together, and across both our long and short-term incentive 2017 18 remuneration review and approach for programmes, ensures management are consistently focused on delivering 2018 19 results and driving shareholder value for the medium and long-term.
As communicated with a number of our investors, and in response to investor feedback, this year we have reviewed the operation of our various incentive plan Assessing performance and target setting structures, within our shareholder-approved Policy.
There are a number of points to highlight in respect of the way in which the This review included invitations to 30 of our shareholders to consult with us Committee set targets and assess performance in relation to profit-based and I would like to express my thanks and appreciation for their constructive measures at the end of the financial year.
dialogue which has resulted in additional changes to the original proposals.
Profit targets are set with reference to internal Overall, investors were supportive of the direction we have taken for the strategy plans, incorporating recent acquisitions, and referencing external financial year ending 31 March 2019 and have encouraged us to continue this analyst consensus forecasts and a wider view of macroeconomic journey with a detailed and comprehensive review of the Policy, ahead of its factors which may act as a tailwind during the performance period.
Management must have made good acquisitions and deliver on ambitious The key features of the approach for the coming year are as follows: integration synergies.
n Simplification We have removed the moderator construct in both the n We use judgement in assessing performance and review multiple vesting Annual Bonus Plan ABP and the Performance Share Plan PSP and replaced scenarios to ensure we are comfortable with outcomes.
When assessing it with a more typical additive structure, which is simpler and commonly profit performance we look at acquisitions on a case by case basis but seen in other listed companies in the UK.
generally include acquisitions made in the first half of the financial year and exclude acquisitions from the second half.
However, the Committee reserves n Use of Return on Capital Employed ROCE in the PSP We have introduced judgement in assessing performance and does not slavishly follow any Return on Capital Employed ROCE into the PSP, alongside total shareholder formulaic approach or outcome.
For example, despite the formal calculation return TSR and earnings per share EPS.
As with the ABP, the use of being non-prescriptive on acquisition costs profits to allow for judgement the moderator has been removed and instead these measures will work we still test performance with and without acquisitions to provide comfort alongside, but independently from each other.
Under the new construct, that management are being rewarded only for successfully delivering results 40% of the award will be subject to the Companys TSR performance and not just for short-term earnings enhancing acquisitions.
Over all recent against the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts, with 40% based on EPS vestings, the Committee has challenged itself to review the Companys performance and 20% based on ROCE.
The use of return on net operating results and how they translate into each PSP vesting profile or ABP outcome assets RONOA has been removed from the PSP, but given its prominence as profile under multiple scenarios in order to ensure that management a key performance indicator within the business, it has been included in the rewards are commensurate with the overall performance of the business.
n We are also careful not to disincentivise management from doing the right n Profits still important, but reduced emphasis Under the ABP, the weighting thing for the business and must continue to do so.
The Committee are on adjusted profit before interest and tax PBIT is reduced from 100% to focused on continuing to incentivise management to do the right deal at the 60%.
Under the PSP, the weighting on EPS is reduced from two thirds to right time this represents a key part of our business strategy as discussed 40% and EPS now has equal weighting with TSR, both with 40%.
Buying businesses, integrating them into the Group and n Enhanced disclosures Within this statement, I have included a section delivering synergistic benefits is an important part of our management discussing how the Committee sets targets and assesses performance in teams role.
The Board remains of the view that focusing on the right deal relation to profit measures under the ABP and PSP, and how we ensure that will continue to be a critical part of our strategy, and is of the view that management is only ever rewarded for good acquisitions.
alongside delivering great results in our heritage businesses, these actions will deliver shareholder value.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 79 Governance Remuneration outcomes for 2017 18 All decisions taken in respect of remuneration during the year were done so in accordance with the Policy that was adopted at the AGM in July 2016.
The key decisions taken by the Committee included: n 87.5% of the maximum opportunity was awarded under the ABP in respect of performance in the year ended 31 March 2018.
Adjusted PBIT was 425m, which exceeded the maximum target of 420m.
FCF was 229.2m, which was below the target of 239m and therefore the moderator was applied, reducing the bonus by 12.5%.
ROCE was 14.8%, which was above the target of 13% and therefore no further reduction to the bonus was applied.
50% of the bonus will be deferred into shares for three years.
n 100% of the maximum will vest in respect of 2015 PSP awards, for which the year ended 31 March 2018 represents the final year of the 3-year performance period.
Adjusted basic EPS has more than doubled from 35.4p in the financial year ended 31 March 2015 to 72.0p in the year under review.
Growth of 26% per annum, is significantly in excess of the requirement for maximum vesting of CPI 12% per annum, and therefore there was full vesting under the EPS element.
Absolute TSR performance of 80% over the 3 year performance period was in the top 20% versus the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts and therefore there was also full vesting under the TSR element.
The Committee is satisfied that the total variable pay outcome is a fair reflection of the strong corporate and individual performance throughout the relevant performance periods.
Further discussion is set out in our ARR on page 83.
On a related note, during the year, the Committee exercised its discretion to reduce the award sizes for the 2017 PSP awards to the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
This was a one-off decision to reflect the environment at the time of the award and reflects our commitment to taking a responsible approach to executive pay.
The Chief Executives PSP award was reduced to 180% of salary down from 200% and the Group Finance Directors PSP award was reduced to 160% of salary down from 175%.
AGM I would like to thank shareholders for their continued engagement and feedback in respect of our remuneration arrangements and we look forward to receiving your support in respect of our ARR at the AGM on 18 July 2018.

The Committee noted that a notable minority of shareholders failed to support the vote to approve the Directors Remuneration report.
As in previous years, the Committee carried out a full shareholder consultation process during the year and values the feedback provided by shareholders.
Some shareholders remained concerned in respect of the second phase of the salary increases for the executive directors which were originally disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report.
The Committee was comfortable that the implementation of the second phase of the increases was appropriate in the context of the performance of both the Group and the executive directors during the year and the continued increase in the size and scope of the roles.
Other shareholders raised some concerns in respect of the performance measures used for incentive plans and the way in which performance against the targets was calculated.
To further align with strategy the Committee conducted and completed a review of the performance measures and targets used under both the ABP and PSP, details of which can be found in the statement on page 78.
Payments for loss of office There were no payments for loss of office paid to any directors or to any past directors during the year.
Policy implementation for year ending 31 March 2019 Base salary The average salary increase of 3% for the executive directors 2% for the Chief Executive and 4% for the Group Finance Director effective from 1 April 2018 is in line with average salary increases across the general employee population.

The employers obligation will continue to be capped at a maximum of 20% of salary.
Simon Kesterton participates in a defined contribution pension plan in the UK with an employers maximum pension contribution of 15% up to the annual allowance and a salary supplement which in aggregate is 20% of salary.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 89 Governance 2018 19 ABP The ABP for 2018 19 will operate on a different basis to the prior year.
Following consultation with the Companys major shareholders the Committee introduced the changes to the performance measures employed in the ABP.
As a result measures used for the 2018 19 year will include adjusted PBIT 60% of opportunity, free cash flow 30% of opportunity and RONOA 10% of opportunity.
Further detail of the process and rationale for these changes can be found on page 78.
The Committee maintains an overall discretion to reduce bonus outcomes if overall performance is unsatisfactory and this will include taking into account the RAFR performance during the year.
50% of any bonus will be paid in cash and 50% deferred into shares which are held for 3 years subject to continued employment.
Recovery and withholding provisions apply for a period of three years from payment or vesting in relation to a material misstatement, gross misconduct, and material error in calculation or an exceptional negative event.
As the Board deems the performance targets for the upcoming year to be commercially sensitive the Committee has taken the decision to not disclose the targets in advance.
However, the targets are set on a challenging basis, requiring incremental growth to the year ending 31 March 2019, and will only be met if recent acquisitions continue to deliver as planned.
The performance targets and performance against them will be disclosed retrospectively in next years ARR when the Committee is comfortable that the information is no longer commercially sensitive.
2018 PSP Awards Awards made under the PSP in 2018 will operate on a different basis to the 2017 awards.
Following consultation with the Companys major shareholders the Committee introduced the following changes to the performance measures employed in the PSP.
Weighting of performance measures Performance targets Threshold 0% vesting Maximum 100% vesting Adjusted Basic EPS 40% 79p 88p Relative TSR vs constituents of FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts 40% Median ranking Upper quintile ranking 12.5% 17.5% ROCE 20% Pim Vervaat and Simon Kesterton will receive awards equivalent to 200% and 175% respectively.
These will be subject to the performance measures and targets to be measured over a three year period as set out in the table below: Awards will vest on a straight line basis between the threshold and maximum performance targets.
Following the end of the performance period awards will be subject to a further two year holding period.
Malus and clawback provisions will apply for a period of three years from the vesting date in relation to a material misstatement, gross misconduct, and material error in calculation or an exceptional negative event.
The EPS and ROCE performance targets which have been set as pence targets for the year ending 31 March 2021 are based on organic growth excluding the impact of any future acquisitions.
They have been set based on internal strategy plans, incorporating recent acquisitions, and external analyst consensus and a wider view of macroeconomic factors which may act as a headwind in the next performance cycle.
The targets are considered to be challenging, particularly to achieve full vesting, but remain realistic within an acceptable risk profile.
