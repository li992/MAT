Where the Committee seeks advice from employees, this never relates to their own remuneration.
Following the confirmation that the Committees former advisers, PwC, were to be appointed the external auditor of the group, a number of remuneration consultants were approached in November 2017 to tender for the position of external adviser to the Committee.
Following the review, Deloitte LLP a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group were appointed in February 2018.
Fees paid to Deloitte during the year were 40,150.
During the year Deloitte also provided advice on the IRB programme.
The Committee is satisfied that the provision of these other services does not affect the objectivity and independence of the remuneration advice provided by Deloitte.
At an early stage of the audit tender process, the PwC remuneration advisory role was identified as a potential conflict.
A provisional plan was agreed at that stage by the chairs of the Audit and Remuneration Committees to manage the potential conflict should PwC be successful in the tender.
Following the recommendation to appoint PwC as auditor in May 2017, the board approved a much reduced transitional remuneration advisory role for PwC to take effect from 1 August 2017, ensuring no conflict would arise.
During the period between August and December 2017 PwC provided some interim management advice on a number of minor matters consistent with the board-approved transition role.

The three-month average to 31 July 2017 was used for the 2017 report given that the awards were vesting after publication of the report.
3 The figures for the performance award for 2018 have been calculated using the three-month average to 31 July 2018.
The charts below compare the EDs single total remuneration figures for 2017 and 2018.

Adjusted operating profit has increased 4% in the year to 278.6 million, and it has grown 7% per annum compounded over the last three financial years on a reported basis.
RoE remains strong at 17.0% and dividend growth was 5% this year, with dividend cover remaining at 2.2 times.
The strong RoE has been reflected in the EDs bonuses, with the element of the bonus determined on RoE being 80.0% of the potential maximum.
The EDs also achieved strong performance against their group-wide balanced scorecard with payouts ranging from 90% to 95%.
For the 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan vesting this year, 80% of the vesting is based on the financial goals and 20% is based on risk, 01 compliance and control objectives.
For the financial goals the adjusted EPS growth of 16.3% over the last three years was below the threshold performance target of 18.8% and consequently has not vested within the EPS element of the LTIP.
The compounded TSR of 3.3% per annum has not met the threshold target of 10.0% per annum under the LTIP and has also not vested.
These vesting levels reflect lower growth in earnings at the current stage of the cycle as well as modest share price performance in the last three years.
The continued prudent approach to capital management combined with a good performance in risk, compliance and controls mean that the risk management objectives element vested at 92.9%.
As a result, the LTIP will vest at 18.6% overall this year see page 93 for further details.
The LTIP vesting levels have significantly reduced the single total remuneration figures, despite the ongoing good performance of the company, reflecting the stretching targets set by the Committee which may not be met at the current stage of the business cycle.
Additional disclosures on the single total remuneration figure for EDs table Audited 02 Salary The per annum salaries paid during the year are as shown in the single total remuneration figure table on page 88.
There were modest increases, 2.0% or lower, between 2017 and 2018.
When reviewing salary levels, the Committee takes into account the individuals role and experience, pay for the broader employee population and external factors, where applicable.
No salary increases have been awarded to the current EDs for the 2019 financial year, whilst the average increase for the general employee population is 3%.
Benefits The EDs each received an allowance in lieu of a company car.
Preben Prebensen received 18,000 while the others received 12,000.
These allowances have not been increased since 2012.
They also received private health cover.
The discount to the share price on grant of SAYE options is included in the year of grant.
03 Pension The EDs all received a monthly cash pension allowance equivalent to 22.5% of base salary.
They do not receive any additional pension provision.
Annual bonus Maximum bonus potential for the 2018 financial year was 300% of salary for Preben Prebensen and Jonathan Howell, and 120% of salary for Elizabeth Lee.
The bonuses for EDs were determined with reference to RoE targets and a group-wide balanced scorecard.

This includes measures relating to strategy: people and customers: and risk, compliance and conduct, and is common to all EDs.
Annual performance objectives are determined by the Remuneration Committee at the start of each financial year, and are designed to support the groups wider strategic objective of protecting, improving and extending its successful model.

Governance Financial Statements Close Brothers Group plc | Annual Report 2018 93 Long-term performance awards The performance awards in the single total figure of remuneration include the 2015 LTIP grant and the 2015 Matched SMP Shares.
Both of these will vest on 3 October 2018, and the overall vesting is outlined in the table below.
Details of the overall vesting for the LTIP and SMP Performance measure Threshold target Maximum target Actual achieved Overall vesting 1 Adjusted EPS growth 40% weighting RPI 3% p. a. RPI 10% p. a.

The share price for the LTIP and Matched SMP Shares increased by 2% over the three-year period from the date of grant to the end of the performance period.
The average share price used to value the awards due to vest in October 2018 was 1,518.2p from 1 May 2018 to 31 July 2018, which was the performance measurement period.
The 2015 LTIP and SMP awards were originally granted at 1,493.4p.
While the increase in share price remains positive over the performance period, the single total figures of remuneration for the EDs are down from the previous year, primarily due to the lower overall vesting of the long-term performance awards.
02 The performance awards also include the amount in cash or shares equal to the dividends which would have been paid during the period from the beginning of the performance period to the time that the awards vest.
Details of the assessment of the risk management objectives for the LTIP and SMP The Committee considers it to be of critical importance that remuneration arrangements continue to incentivise discipline in the management of the firms capital and balance sheet and in the delivery of the business model.
The Committee undertakes a robust assessment of performance against the risk management objectives to ensure that payments to EDs are fair and appropriate with consideration for individual and corporate performance.
In doing so, the Committee assesses performance against a number of key measures in making its determination.
03 Performance was assessed after each of the three years of the LTIP performance period, with each years review carrying a weighting of one-third towards the overall vesting for the award, ensuring a fair assessment of progress over the three-year period.

2 Salary effective from the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
Base salaries were determined with reference to the EDs role and experience, increases for the broader population and external factors.
The Committee determined that it was appropriate for the EDs salaries not to be increased, in line with the salary guidance for all senior employees.
The average salary increase across the wider employee population was 3%.
The EDs will receive benefits in line with those outlined in the remuneration policy table on page 82.
There will be no increases to the allowances for benefits other than any potential increase in the cost of providing them.
The current EDs will continue to receive a cash allowance in lieu of a pension equivalent to 22.5% of base salary.
Mike Morgan, whose 03 appointment as the new group finance director will take effect on the date of the 2018 Annual General Meeting, will receive 10% of base salary cash allowance in lieu of a pension less employers national insurance contributions, in line with the level of benefit offered to the general employee population.

For the current EDs, annual bonuses will be subject to the same caps as applied in respect of the 2018 performance year.
Mike Morgan will have a maximum bonus potential of 175% of salary following his appointment to the board.
His annual bonus relating to the proportion of the year before his appointment as group finance director will be determined in line with other group Executive Committee members, and his annual bonus for the proportion of the year as an ED will be determined as per the above table.
RoE continues to be our long-standing metric for the financial element.
The Committee considers it to be the primary measure of business performance, as it provides the strongest evidence of adherence to the business model.
