Strategic Report Directors Report Accounts Directors remuneration report Dear Shareholder We have a I am pleased to present our remuneration report for 2018.
In line with best practice we are aiming to continue with our transparent and transparent and open approach towards remuneration at Greggs.
We will continue to ensure that our report is clear, simple and easy to read providing explanations and rationale open approach to our decision-making throughout the different sections of the report.
towards The report is made up of three key sections: My annual Chairs letter.
remuneration Our remuneration policy report, which sets out a summary of the Directors remuneration policy for all Directors of Greggs.
This policy was formally agreed at our AGM held on 19 May at Greggs 2017 and approved with a majority vote of 93.91 per cent.
Our annual remuneration report, split into two sections that set out: how our remuneration policy will be implemented in 2019: and how our remuneration policy was implemented in 2018.
This is an audited section of the report outlining the remuneration of the Companys Executive and NonExecutive Directors during the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018.
The annual remuneration report will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2019 AGM.
We are in year two of a three-year policy, and in developing Favourite Greggs snack: how we apply this policy the Remuneration Committee is Greggs doughnuts are very aware that executive remuneration continues to be a the perfect sweet treat.
key focus for shareholders, as well as being a topic that is regularly discussed in the public domain.
Throughout 2018, the Committee has continued to assess the effectiveness of overall levels of remuneration and the alignment with business strategy and has reviewed the new UK Corporate Governance Code, emerging market practice and the best-practice expectations of investors and others.
The Committee has taken into account a number of reference points, both internal and external.
Independent advice was also sought, where appropriate, from the Committees advisers.
Remuneration policy The existing remuneration policy consists of the following elements: fixed pay base salary, pension and benefits: and variable pay annual bonus paid in both cash and deferred shares and performance share plan PSP measuring longterm performance and delivered in shares.
The Committee believes that the current structure works well.
It is simple and consistent, with pay outcomes dependent upon performance linked to our business strategy as well as taking into account our wider workforce and culture.
It ensures a significant proportion of pay is delivered in shares to provide alignment with investors and incorporates a number of bestpractice features, including a two-year post-vesting holding period for PSP awards.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 57 Directors remuneration report continued Remuneration policy continued Since announcing our five-year strategic plan in 2013, transforming the business from a traditional bakery into a modern , we have delivered excellent operational and financial performance.
In the five years since 2013 our companymanaged shop like-for-like sales have grown by 20 per cent and pre-tax profit excluding exceptional items has increased by 118 per cent, reflecting sales growth combined with significant savings arising from structural changes and investment in better processes and systems.
This is reflected in strong pre-exceptional EPS growth averaging 19 per cent per annum since 2013.
There is a strong alignment of interest between Executive Directors and shareholders, with incentive plans focused on long-term, sustainable value creation for our shareholders.
We are comfortable that the policy remains appropriate to ensure the team running the business is incentivised going forwards, whilst at the same time remaining flexible enough to be applicable over the final year of the policy period.
Accordingly there are no formal changes to our policy proposed for 2019.
However, as recommended by the new UK Corporate Governance Code, we have reviewed the clawback and malus provisions within our incentive schemes and have decided to broaden the circumstances in which these provisions would apply, with effect from the awards to be made in 2019.
We have also ensured that full discretion is able to be applied to incentive plan outcomes to ensure payments reflect broader performance factors.
During 2019 we will start the process of reviewing the remuneration policy ahead of presenting a new policy for shareholder approval at our AGM in 2020.
Performance in 2018 and incentive payments As disclosed last year, the annual bonus scheme for 2018 was set up with performance targets based on profit 50 per cent, sales 20 per cent and strategic objectives 30 per cent.
As also disclosed, the strategic element incorporated measures linked to cost savings ten per cent, specific project delivery within the change management programme regarding processes and systems ten per cent and specific project delivery within the supply chain restructuring programme ten per cent.
The metrics linked to the change management programme involved the delivery of new systems and processes in two of our supply chain operations.
However, early in the year the Board took the strategic decision not to proceed with these upgrades in 2018 due to timing issues and the desire to avoid unnecessary disruption to our activities during a critical trading period.
The Remuneration Committee subsequently used its discretion to remove the related element from the bonus scheme, and the ten per cent of the bonus which had been attributed to the change management programme was redistributed between the other strategic metrics, such that cost savings accounted for 15 per cent of the overall bonus and supply chain restructuring programme for 15 per cent.
The Committee believes that the use of its discretion in this fashion was appropriate as it was not considered fair to assess management against a measure which was effectively redundant following the Boards decision not to proceed with the system and process upgrade at the beginning of the year.
Redistributing the bonus between the other metrics was viewed as more appropriate than setting new targets part way through the year.
The Committee is satisfied that taking this approach did not result in a bonus outcome that was inconsistent with the performance of the Company in 2018.
The bonus targets used for 2018 are described in the annual remuneration report on pages 68 and 69.
Performance against the stretching targets set for the bonus was impacted in 2018 by some significant weather conditions.
Although economic conditions improved somewhat in 2018 as inflationary pressures eased slightly and consumers saw growth in disposable incomes, the weather had a significant impact on trading.
After a good start to the year the severe wintry conditions in early March hit sales badly and a more subdued trading period followed.
In June and July the unusually prolonged heatwave affected sales, but as soon as temperatures reverted to the seasonal norm we saw a pick-up in sales growth, and this strengthened further through the fourth quarter.
As a consequence of performance over the year, both the profit and sales elements of the bonus were significantly impacted and the targets were not met in full.
The profit element resulted in 38.85 per cent of a maximum of 50 per cent being achieved, with 5.2 per cent of a maximum of 20 per cent sales performance being achieved.
Cost pressures remain, particularly in labour cost growth, and despite a tight control on costs the cost savings element of the bonus resulted in 5.4 per cent of the maximum of 15 per cent being achieved.
There was a stronger performance in the strategic objectives that were set and we made good progress with our supply chain change programme.
This resulted in 9.75 per cent bonus payment against a maximum of 15 per cent for this strategic element.
Overall, annual bonuses were paid at a level of 59.2 per cent of the maximum for both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
This equates to payments of 74 per cent out of a maximum possible of 125 per cent and 53.3 per cent out of a maximum possible of 90 per cent of salary to the Chief Executive and Finance Director, respectively.
Any element of the bonus earned above 50 per cent of the maximum will be paid in shares and will be subject to a two-year holding period.
Under the PSP, awards made in March 2016 are due to vest in March 2019.
These awards are based on EPS growth in excess of RPI growth over the three years to 29 December 2018 and average annual ROCE over the three-year performance period 2016 to 2018.
EPS has grown in excess of RPI by 4.83 per cent and our average annual ROCE was 27.47 per cent.
This meant that the EPS performance condition was achieved at a rate of 30.19 per cent and the ROCE performance condition vested in full.
The calculation of total remuneration payable is therefore based on a 80.19 per cent vesting rate for the award.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 58 Strategic Report Directors Report Accounts The Committee is very comfortable that the level of performance achieved justifies vesting at the above level and there has been no need to apply discretion to adjust the outcome.
Approach for 2019 The salary increase for both the Chief Executive and Finance Director was in line with that of the base increase for the workforce generally at 3.0 per cent.
The increases to salaries took effect from 1 January 2019.
The fees payable to Non-Executive Directors increased by the same percentage with effect from the same date.
As part of the Committees ongoing review of best practice and a review of the market, the target-setting process for the annual bonus has been reviewed.
The Committee believes that the nature of the current measures profit, sales and strategic objectives remains appropriate and no changes are proposed to the measures or the mix.
Financial targets for these measures for the 2019 annual bonus have been set in line with the financial plan for the business for the year and the rolling strategic plan, and continue to be stretching.
We will also continue to require any bonus earned over 50 per cent of the maximum to be payable in shares and be subject to a two-year holding period.
The percentage pay out for on-target performance for the profit and sales element of the bonus remains at 50 per cent with threshold performance remaining at a ten per cent pay out.
Due to the commercial sensitivity of the 2019 bonus targets they are not disclosed within this report, but will be disclosed retrospectively in next years report.
For the PSP, the Committee has considered the performance conditions and has determined that EPS and ROCE should continue to apply with an equal weighting given to each.
The Committee has ensured that targets have been set for the year ahead which reflect the strategic plan and business outlook over the performance period.
Consequently, the ROCE range has been reduced in light of the performance outlook in the coming period.
The new ROCE range will be 24 per cent to 28 per cent, a slight reduction on the 25 per cent to 29 per cent range which applied to the awards granted in 2018.
The Committee believes that this revised range remains appropriately stretching in light of the Companys business strategy, without encouraging undue risk-taking.
During 2019, the Committee will be considering the impact of the introduction of IFRS 16 on the EPS and ROCE targets set for PSP awards and on the profit targets set in the bonus scheme.
Further details on these adjustments will be provided in next years report.
Concluding remarks I hope that you will find this report transparent, clear and informative.
The Committee has continued to ensure that executive remuneration is closely aligned to the delivery of Greggs business strategy as well as remaining relevant to market and best practice.
I look forward to receiving your continued support at this years AGM.

Our Directors remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at our AGM on 19 May 2017 and became effective for three years from that date.

There is no prescribed Non-Executive and experienced Non-Executive maximum.
Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee and the Chairs of the Chairman and Chairman and Directors.
Main Board Committees and the Senior Independent Director SID Directors fees are paid an additional fee to reflect their additional responsibilities.
Where the SID role is combined with that of chairing a Committee then only one fee is paid.
These fees are reviewed and set annually in December and implemented from 1 January.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for pension scheme membership, bonus or incentive arrangements.
They are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses and tax thereon.
They may also receive limited travel or  benefits in connection with their role as a Director.
Difference in remuneration policy across the Group The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is designed having regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole.
There are differences in salary levels and in the levels of potential reward depending upon seniority and responsibility, although a key reference point for executive salary increases is the average increase across the general workforce.
A higher proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration package is delivered through performance-related pay and in share-based form, which provides a good link to long-term Company performance.
All colleagues with one years service or more may participate in the SAYE scheme and in the SIP that are run annually.
Under the SAYE scheme, at the end of a three-year saving period, colleagues can buy Greggs shares at a discounted rate.
With the SIP, all colleagues may purchase Company shares from pre-tax salary subject to HMRC limits.
After six months service all colleagues are eligible to participate in the profit-sharing scheme in which they share ten per cent of our profits.
Policy discretion The Committee will operate incentive plans in accordance with their respective rules, the Listing Rules and the HMRC limits where relevant.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plan rules.
These include but are not limited to the following: who participates: the timing of the grant of award and or payment: the size of an award up to plan policy limits and or a payment: discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction: determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes and the treatment of leavers: adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends : and the ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports.
Details of any of these payments to former Directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 61 Directors remuneration report continued Remuneration policy report continued Policy on recruitment remuneration The Committee will aim to set a new Executive Directors remuneration package in line with the Companys approved policy at the time of appointment.
The Committee will take into account, in arriving at a total package and in considering the quantum for each element of the package, the skills and experience of the candidate, the market rate for a candidate of that experience as well as the importance of securing the best available candidate.
Annual bonus and PSP awards will not exceed the policy maxima not including any arrangements to replace forfeited deferred pay.
Participation in the annual bonus plan and PSP will normally be pro-rated for the year of joining.
The Committee may make one-off additional cash and or share-based awards as it deems appropriate, and if the circumstances so demand to take account of deferred pay forfeited by an Executive Director on leaving a previous employer.
Awards to replace deferred pay forfeited would, where possible, reflect the nature of awards forfeited in terms of delivery mechanism cash or shares, time horizons, attributed expected value and performance conditions.
Other payments may be made in relation to relocation expenses and other incidental expenses as appropriate.
Any buyout awards would be made under existing arrangements where possible or as permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according to its terms and any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment would continue.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy at that time.
Service contracts and policy on cessation Executive Directors service contracts contain the following remuneration-related aspects: Provision Detailed terms Remuneration Salary, pension and benefits: company car or cash allowance: private medical health care for the Director: permanent health insurance: participation in annual bonus and profit share subject to scheme rules : participation in long-term incentive schemes or similar arrangements subject to scheme rules : and life assurance.
Notice period Chief Executives contract is terminable on 12 months notice served by either the Company or the Director: Finance Directors service contract is terminable on 12 months notice served by the Company or by six months notice served by the Director: and any future Executive Directors service contracts will be terminable on 12 months notice served by either party.
Termination payment Payment in lieu of notice equal to any unexpired notice of termination given by either party: and payment in lieu shall not include: any bonus payment: any payment in respect of benefits which the Director would have been entitled to receive: and any payment in respect of any holiday entitlement that would have accrued during the period for which the payment in lieu is made.
Details of the circumstances in which the Committee has the ability to exercise discretion with regards to termination payments are set out on the next page.
The Companys policy is that current Executive Directors service contracts do not have a specific duration but may be terminated with twelve months notice from the Company and six months notice from the Executive Director 12 months in the case of the Chief Executive.
Any future Executive Directors service contracts will be terminable on 12 months notice served by either party.
Under their service contracts the Executive Directors are entitled to salary, pension contributions and benefits for their notice period save where a payment in lieu is to be made.
The Company would seek to ensure that any payment is mitigated by use of phased payments and offset against earnings elsewhere in the event that an Executive Director finds alternative employment during his notice period.
There are no contractual provisions in force other than those set out above that impact any termination payment.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 62 Strategic Report Directors Report Accounts Areas where the Committee can exercise discretion with regards to termination payments: annual bonus may be payable pro-rated for that part of the year worked: deferred bonus shares must normally be retained in trust until the end of their two-year holding period and will be subject to recovery and withholding in the event of misstatement of performance, error or misconduct, where this has led to an overpayment in the view of the Committee for a period of three years from the payment date: any unvested awards held under the PSP will lapse at cessation, unless the individual is leaving in good leaver circumstances defined under the plan as death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement, his office or employment being with either a Company which ceases to be a Group member or relating to a business or part of a business which is transferred to a person who is not a Group member, a change of control or any other reason the Committee so decides.
In these circumstances, unvested awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date other than on death or where the Committee decides they should vest at cessation subject to performance conditions being met and scaling back in respect of actual service as a proportion of the total vesting period unless the Committee decides that scaling back is inappropriate.
Vested awards will normally be subject to the mandatory two-year holding period although the Committee will have discretion to waive this in exceptional circumstances: and the Committee may agree to payment of disbursements such as legal costs and outplacement services if appropriate and depending on the circumstances of cessation.
The table below sets out the details of the Executive Directors service contracts: Director Date of contract Roger Whiteside 4 February 2013 Richard Hutton 7 April 2006 Raymond Reynolds stepped down from the Main Board on 19 May 2017.
The service contracts are available for inspection during normal business hours at the Companys registered office, and are available for inspection at the AGM.

The Committee reviews the key performance indicators KPIs each year and varies them as appropriate to reflect the priorities for the business in the year ahead.
Where appropriate a sliding scale of targets is set for each KPI to encourage continuous improvement, or sustained high performance.
There will be an underpin to the sales and strategic objectives elements of the bonus whereby any payment under these elements may be scaled back potentially to zero at the discretion of the Committee, if the profit performance for the year is judged to be running significantly below that required for the achievement of the long-term strategy.
Bonus targets for the forthcoming year are considered to be commercially sensitive and so have not been disclosed.
Targets are set at the start of the year by the Committee and are set using the outturn and performance of the previous year as well as the business plan to determine an appropriately stretching sliding scale.
Retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be made in next years annual report on remuneration, as will any considered impact of the introduction of IFRS 16 on these bonus targets.
PSP award 2019 PSP awards will be granted as follows: Chief Executive 115% of base salary Executive Directors 95% of base salary Performance conditions will be based on an equal split of two different financial measures, EPS and ROCE for discrete parts of an award.
EPS and ROCE are two of our eight strategic KPIs and together provide a rounded assessment of our overall profitability against stretching targets set in line with the strategic plan and business outlook over the performance period.
For these awards the ROCE range has been set to ensure that the targets remain appropriate in light of our business strategy over the coming three-year period.
The EPS targets require the same level of growth as for last years award, albeit the base point from which the growth is measured is higher than last year.
For the 2019 awards the target ranges will be as follows: The EPS performance condition will require average annual growth of EPS of five per cent to 11 per cent over three financial years measured from the 2018 financial year end.
The ROCE condition will require average annual ROCE over the three-year performance period 2019, 2020 and 2021 to be in the range 24 per cent to 28 per cent.
In both cases 25 per cent of an award will vest on achieving threshold performance and thereafter straight-line sliding scales will apply until stretch performance is achieved.
In order to improve alignment of interest between Executive Directors and shareholders, a holding period is attached to vested PSP awards granted in the policy period, requiring the vested shares to be held net of tax and other deductions for a further two years.
EPS and ROCE are measured excluding exceptional items.
Any required adjustments following the introduction of IFRS 16 will be outlined in next years annual report on remuneration.
How our remuneration policy will be implemented in 2019 Non-Executive Directors In order to ensure that no Director is involved in deciding his her own remuneration, the fees payable to Non-Executive Directors are set, after consultation with the Chairman, by a Committee of the Board consisting only of the Executive Directors.
The fees payable to the Chairman are set by the Remuneration Committee.
The fees for Non-Executive Directors increased by three per cent on 1 January 2019 in line with the base award for our whole workforce in 2019.
The Non-Executive Directors are paid an annual base fee which is currently 45,979 and additional responsibility fees of 6,836 for the role of Senior Independent Director SID or for chairing a Board Committee.
Where the SID role is combined with the role of chairing a Committee then only one fee of 6,836 will be paid.
