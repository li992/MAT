86 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2018 Governance Directors' Remuneration report Annual bonus for 2018 The Annual Incentive Plan AIP is the Companys annual bonus scheme.
The bonus awards are based on performance conditions that were approved by the Committee at the start of the financial year.
The AIP bonus is split 70% for performance against financial measures and 30% for performance against personal objectives.
The Committee also considers every year the overall AIP outcome as determined by achievement against the financial and personal targets to check that the bonus level is appropriate given the Companys performance during the year and has the ability to override the indicative formulaic outturn if it considers that not to be appropriate in all the circumstances.
David Atkins and Timon Drakesmith requested not to be considered for a bonus this year.
Further details may be found in the Chairs letter on page 82.
The performance targets were not disclosed in advance of the year, as they were considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive information, but full details of the conditions and performance against them are now set out below.
A summary of the Remuneration Policy for the AIP and DBSS is on page 104.
The following tables Tables 52, 53 and 54 show the AIP outcomes and achievement against AIP performance targets for 2018.

Each of the AIP performance conditions is subject to a straight-line payment scale between entry, on-target and full vesting points.
Adjusted EPS is the Groups underlying adjusted profit divided by the average number of shares in issue.
The TPR performance is measured against a composite index comprising the IPD Annual Retail Property Indices for the UK and a bespoke Europe Index weighted on a 60:40 basis.
The annual data for these indices is not available at the date of this report.
Accordingly, the closing measurement for TPR for the year to 31 December 2018 is based on managements best estimate using available data see page 47 for property returns data.
The AIP is not paid until the confirmed data for these indices is available.
The actual outcome will be disclosed in the 2019 Annual Report.
Net Rental Income NRI is the percentage growth in the Group net rental income, calculated on a like-for-like basis.

The deferred share award is granted in two tranches: the DBSS A award relates to the bonus achieved against the EPS, NRI and personal objectives measures: and the DBSS B award relates to the TPR measure and so is only granted once the TPR result is known and at the same time as that cash element is paid.
Each award is granted with a face value equal to 40% of the bonus achieved against the relevant measures, over a number of shares calculated based on the average mid-market closing share price of a share over the five dealing days prior to the date of grant.
Details of the DBSS A and B awards granted in 2019 will be included in next years Annual Report.
88 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2018 Governance Directors' Remuneration report Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP is an award programme for Executive Directors designed to incentivise the creation of long-term returns for shareholders.
Performance under the LTIP is assessed over differing performance periods.
TSR is assessed over a period of four years from the date of grant, and TPR and EPS are assessed over a period of four financial years commencing with the financial year in which the award is granted.
The Single Figure Table for 2018 is required to report the value of the LTIP element for which the performance period ends during 2018.
Consequently, the LTIP values shown in the Single Figure Table comprise the value of the TSR element of the 2014 award where the performance period ended 31 March 2018 and the TPR and EPS elements of the 2015 award where the performance period ended 31 December 2018.
Achievement against targets The following table shows the level of performance achieved against the targets set for the three performance components that drive the 2018 LTIP vesting value as shown in the Single Figure Table.

Vesting value achieved Table 56 shows the level of vesting outcome for the three components that drive the 2018 LTIP vesting as shown in the Single Figure Table.
The element dependent on TPR is estimated as the IPD data regarding TPR performance is not available at the date of the Annual Report.
The number of shares includes any notional dividend shares awarded to date.
The actual number of shares that vest may increase by the amount of any notional dividend shares awarded up to the date of vesting of the award.
The value shown is based on the average of the mid-market closing price of a share for each dealing day in the three-month period to 31 December 2018 408.2p The actual value that vests, based on the closing share price on the vesting date, will be disclosed in next years Annual Report.
No amount of the total value disclosed is attributable to share price appreciation as the share price calculated per note 3 above is below the market value of shares used to calculate the number of options awarded under the 2015 LTIP 684.1p.
No discretion has been exercised by the Committee to the final result of the award as a result of share price appreciation or depreciation.
com 89 Directors Remuneration report continued Pension Executive Directors receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension benefits.
David Atkins and Peter Cole each received a salary supplement of 30% of base salary.
Timon Drakesmith received a salary supplement of 20% of base salary.
Jean-Philippe Mouton received a salary supplement of 80,000 2017: 80,000 and a legacy collective supplementary defined benefit scheme contribution of 12,810 2017: 12,648 which is included in his total shown below.
All salary supplements paid to Executive Directors in lieu of pension benefits are subject to deductions required for income tax and social security contributions in the UK and France.
Salary supplements and the pension benefit received by Jean-Philippe Mouton do not qualify for AIP purposes or entitlements under the LTIP.
Information on the accrued pension benefits for David Atkins and Peter Cole under the Companys closed defined benefit scheme is on page 100.

In the 2017 Annual Report, the TPR element of AIP was estimated at IPD 1.0%, resulting in an estimated payout level at 50% for that measure.
The final closing measurement for TPR during 2017 was just below the IPD Index figure, resulting in a final payout level of 0%.
The final AIP payout levels disclosed for 2017 are therefore less than the estimated levels reported last year.
The estimated TPR outcome for the 2017 LTIP figure was IPD 2.0% resulting in an estimated payout level of 100% for that measure.
The full vesting target was IPD 1.5% p. a..
The actual TPR outcome was IPD 1.7% p. a. and therefore the final payout levels were the same as the estimated level reported last year.
In addition, the 2017 LTIP figure contained a value for the TPR and EPS portions of the 2014 LTIP where the performance period ended on 31 December 2017 and was calculated based on the average share price over the three months to 31 December 2017.
The 2017 LTIP figure in the Single Figure Table on page 86 has therefore been adjusted to reflect the actual share price of 538.00p on the vesting date 23April 2018.

A copy of the full Remuneration Policy is available on the Companys website www.
In implementing the Remuneration Policy, the Committee will continue to take into account factors such as remuneration packages available within comparable companies, the Companys overall performance, internal relativities, achievement of corporate objectives, individual performance and experience, published views of institutional investors, general market and wider economic trends.

To recognise accountabilities, skills, The base salary for any existing Executive Director will not exceed experience and value 850,000 or the equivalent if denominated in a different currency with this limit increasing annually at the rate of UK CPI.
Implementation In February 2019, the Committee determined that an increase in base salaries of approximately 2.5% was appropriate for the Executive Directors.
Other senior executives received in the region of 2.75% and increases in salaries across the Group were generally in the region of 3%, reflecting the view that the Executive Directors and the senior management team should demonstrate personal leadership in a cost-conscious environment.
Factors influencing the increases included the effect of inflation and evidence of salaries within the real estate sector.

with shareholders and supports retention Implementation The AIP maximum for Executive Directors in 2019 will remain at 200% of base salary.
Performance measures for the AIP in 2019 remain weighted 70% towards Group financial targets and 30% towards personal objectives.
Group financial targets in 2019 comprise: 27.5% Adjusted earnings per share 27.5% Total Property Return relative to IPD 15% Net debt Adjusted earnings per share and Total Property Return are retained from prior year AIP performance measures.
Net debt has been added to replacenet rental income, the Committee having taken the view that a net debt measure better reflects the Companys strategic focus on disposals to deleverage and improve the strength of the balance sheet.
As is demonstrated in this report in respect of previous years, the Committee designs the financial targets and personal objectives to align closely to the Companys strategy as well as to the Business Plan and the priorities for the coming year.
It is therefore felt that the specific financial targets and important personal objectives are commercially sensitive such that, having considered this carefully, the Board is of the view that it is in the Companys interests not to disclose this information in advance.
However, personal objectives are centred on the delivery of strategic objectives and focus on the strength of the balance sheet, supporting returns through an optimised portfolio, operational excellence and cost savings.
Fulldetails of the specific targets and key personal objectives set will be disclosed in the 2019 Annual Report.
40% of the 2019 AIP vesting will be deferred by making an award of shares under the DBSS, with a deferral period of two years.
No change to currentarrangements is proposed for 2019.
