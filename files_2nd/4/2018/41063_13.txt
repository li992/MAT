2 Targets were set for 2017 18 taking into account it is a 53 week period, and are reported on that basis.
For 2018 19 like-for-like sales targets will be off the 2017 18 52 week excluding fuel sales base 13.3bn and for underlying profit before tax purposes the growth will be with reference to the 2017 18 base adjusted for the 5m benefit relating to the 53rd week 369m.
As shown in the table above, management have delivered another year of strong performance which is further explained on page 47.
46 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Investor information Underlying profit before tax Underlying profit before tax increased by 11%, delivering just above the 371m maximum.
At the time the target setting process started end of 2016, the grocery market was facing falling consumer confidence and growing inflationary cost pressures.
The growth target challenged management to balance competing demands of growing profit while investing in the offer to be more competitive for customers, and in customer service and colleague pay in line with our six priorities.
Competitor market performance in the year illustrates how stretching this target has been, and the strength of the performance against this measure.
Productivity improvement cost reduction At the start of the year, management identified significant procurementsavings, resulting in a high target for a second year running.
Management have performed well against this stretching target, resulting in 195m 97.5% of this element being achieved.
The maximum was set slightly lower than the previous year, given the performance in accelerating benefits in 2016 17 delivered 269m vs max of 190m.
The maximum of 200m was a very stretching target as a percentage of the cost base.
Group like-for-like sales growth excluding fuel Group like-for-like sales growth excluding fuel was 2.8%.
When the targets were set, the Group had achieved five quarters of like-for-like sales growth, following 16 quarters of decline.
Therefore, this year was the first time since 2011 that management were required to grow sales on top of prior year growth in order to achieve the target.
A target range of 0-2% therefore represented significant stretch given prior year performance and the ongoing intensely competitive market.
For context, the previous years range had been 2 % to 0%, so the 2017 18 target was 200 basis points more challenging.
Personal objectives Stretching and measurable objectives are set by the Committee at the start of the financial year, taking into account our six priorities, and the ambitions for our four stakeholders: customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders.

In determining the final level of bonus payable, the Committee took into account both the performance against objectives and the performance of the wider business.
As well as individual objectives being delivered in full, management continue to make significant progress against our six priorities, in particular being more competitive which is improving like-for-like sales and volumes, and thereby rebuilding profitability.
The Committee therefore decided to award them each the full 20%, and their total bonus achieved is 197.4%.
50% of any bonus payable is deferred in shares under the DSBP which vest three years after the date of award.
Dividend equivalents will accrue and be paid on the shares that vest.
Deferred shares are normally forfeited if the individual leaves the Group before they vest.
LTIP awards 2015-18 LTIP awards Awards granted under the LTIP in April 2015 are scheduled to vest in April 2018.
The performance period relating to these awards ended on 4 February 2018.

2 Vesting is on a straight-line basis for the cumulative free cash flow and total sales excluding VAT and fuel measures.
Intermediate vesting applies for the underlying earnings per share measure: 10p 25%, 11p 60%, 12p 80%, 15p 100% with straight-line vesting between each point.
fuel exceeded the 2015-18 target by 336m, of which 248m was due to the impact of the 53rd week.
The 2018-21 2bn sales growth target will be off a 52 week base for 2017 18 13.3bn.
4 The 2015-18 LTIP awards were subject to certain guardrails relating to the free cash flow measure.
The Committee has minimum and maximum guardrails for maintenance capital expenditure and cumulative net proceeds from property sales over the performance period.
When considering vesting against the free cash flow measure, the Committee can review and adjust as appropriate in the event of operation outside the agreed parameters.
The 2015-18 vesting for free cash flow was within the agreed parameters and as such no adjustment was required.

2 Vesting is on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum.
For the sales target, as set out in the Directors remuneration policy, the Committee will retain the discretion to adjust the targets in the event of material disposals or store closures during the performance period which were not taken into account in setting the target range.
The Committee has discretion to adjust these calculations for material exceptional events or actions which may include strategic changes to capital expenditure approved by the Board and material acquisitions or disposals which were not in the contemplation of the Committee at the time the targets were set and which might otherwise materially distort the outcome, in order to ensure that vesting of the LTIP is an accurate and fair reflection of performance.
If the Committee exercises its discretion to amend the calculation, a full disclosure of the reason for the amendment and an explanation of the impact will be given in the relevant Annual Report on remuneration.
There is a ROCE underpin which allows the Committee to adjust vesting options if ROCE is below weighted average cost of capital WACC.
