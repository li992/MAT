In determining 2018 bonus awards under this Plan, the Committee considered how goals had been met and took account of key risk factors.
71 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Financial Performance 40% weighting achieved 0% As shown in the following table, the achievement was less strong than the threshold targets set for the year and therefore no award is made.
Business Scorecard 30% weighting achieved 17% The Business Scorecard focuses on key areas of management activity essential to the success of the Company spanning underlying financial performance, risk and resilience including capital and business sustainability including customer franchise.
Achievement is measured against a range of objective measures, with the overall outcome being determined using judgement in the round.
Absent unusual results, the highest Scorecard weightings are accorded to the Underlying Performance financial measures and as a result the majority of annual bonus awards overall are driven by financial measures.
The Scorecard outcome will vary from the headline financial metrics outcome if these are over or under representative of the underlying actions of management and their results.
Achievement under the Scorecard was assessed to have been stronger than the headline financial metrics, though below that of 2017.
Within the Underlying Performance component, costs were reduced signi cantly, and more than targeted, while attritional loss ratios were slightly worse.
This combination produced an underlying financial performance above target.
Strategic Plan initiatives are discussed at length in the body of the Annual Report, and support the progress achieved on the underlying nancials.
By comparison, headline financial performance was reduced by adverse weather costs and Commercial Lines large losses, principally in exit portfolios.
In terms of Risk and Resilience, performance was again strong.
Capital ratios were strengthened despite higher dividends.
A successful UK pension agreement was also reached.
Reinsurance coverages produced valuable protection in a volatile loss climate.
On Business Sustainability, the Groups Personal Lines business 57% of total made good progress, growing total customer premiums and gaining new partners.
In Commercial Lines, management actions to exit portfolios and re-underwrite business impacted growth and retention, but deliberately so.
Re ecting on the Commercial Lines large loss volatility which impacted headline financial performance, the Committee felt that an element of this could have been better underwritten and therefore should impact the underlying assessment, while an element was market driven.
Accordingly, discretion was used to adjust downwards the Business Scorecard outcome by 5% from 22 30 to 17 30.

This was arithmetically less than the mid-point of the 11-16% range re ecting the nature of the turnaround where ROTE performance was targeted to improve substantially over the three year averaging period.
For context, in the year prior to this LTIP cycle, i. e. 2015, RSAs ROTE result was 9.7%.
RSAs continuing progress allowed the target range and the on-target value required for the 2017-19 LTIP cycle to be set higher to re ect progress of the turnaround and to continue to incorporate an appropriate degree of stretch.

73 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Business Review Scorecard 33.3% weighting achieved 25.0% The vesting outcome on this element was determined by the Committee assessing RSAs progress during the three years in the round, particularly relating to capital, strategy implementation and earnings improvement.
The 2016-18 Scorecard targets were strengthened compared to 2015-17, taking account of progress made including enhanced controllable expenses and attritional loss ratio targets.
The Scorecard which was devised in 2016 differs from that applied to the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan both in timescale three years vs one year and some of the performance measures which were updated for long-term incentive cycles commencing after this one, i. e. the 2017-19 cycle onwards.
The 2016-18 LTIP period captures important elements of the Companys turnaround activity, together with emergence into business as usual.
Within the Business Review Scorecard indicators, performance overall was assessed to have been above target though by a margin below that assessed for the 2015-17 LTIP.
This conclusion is supported by the share price outperformance and ROTE outperformance also delivered.
Capital and expense achievements were particularly strong.
Attritional loss ratios were also signi cantly better than prior years.

These Performance Share awards will vest in 2021, subject to the satisfaction of the plans performance conditions based on Group underlying ROTE, relative Total Shareholder Return and a Business Scorecard.
The Business Scorecard measures a range of indicators on an underlying basis, and includes: regulatory capital ratios, credit rating, capital actions, risk management, attritional loss ratio, total controllable costs cost ratios, key business improvement projects, customer franchise and other relevant actions related to the Companys long-term success.
Achievement will be evaluated using a performance framework whereby metrics will be reviewed against their targets, together with any other aspects connected to the business performance including material risk items.
Judgement in the round will be used by the Committee to determine the level of vesting.
The speci c targets cannot be disclosed prospectively for commercial reasons, including price sensitivity.

2 Group underlying ROTE will be calculated on a three-year average basis.
A straight-line calculation is applied to determine the portion of awards that vest for performance between threshold and on-target, and between on-target and maximum.
The average required for on-target vesting 62.5% vesting is positioned requiring demanding increases in underlying performance vs 2017 and is considered commercially sensitive because it is set in line with, and therefore signals, the Groups forward plan for the period.
Disclosure will be provided retrospectively following the end of the performance period.
The awards granted are set out in the table below: 1 Performance Shares 2 3 Director Basis of award Number of shares Face value Scott Egan 200% of salary 173,610 1,097,776 Stephen Hester 230% of salary 368,501 2,330,107 Notes: 1 The performance period is three years and ends on 31 December 2020.
Performance measures are Group underlying ROTE, Relative TSR and a Business Scorecard one-third weighting each.
2 If threshold performance is achieved, 25% of the number of shares shown will vest.
3 The face value of the award is calculated as the maximum number of shares that would vest if all performance measures and targets are met at maximum, multiplied by the mid-market closing price of an RSA ordinary share averaged over the five business days preceding the date of grant 2 March 2018, of 6.3232.
Malus and Clawback Policy The Group operates a Malus and Clawback Policy.
This is reviewed annually, as set out on page 87.
In summary, the Committee has the ability to reduce or forfeit awards that have yet to be paid or vest in the case of shares, to delay the payment or vesting date or to amend another form of award or bene t which has yet to be received malus adjustment.
The Committee may also recover sums already paid to Executive Committee members if it considers it appropriate to do so clawback.
This can be applied during a two-year period after receipt in the case of cash bonuses or vesting in the case of long-term incentives.
The circumstances in which malus and clawback may apply are outlined in the table below: Malus adjustment Clawback Material financial misstatement of results for any financial year Material financial loss of a business unit as a result of circumstances that or the material financial loss under-performance of a business should reasonably have been risk-managed by the individual unit that could have been reasonably risk-managed Material error or financial misstatement of results which has resulted in Error or material misstatement leading to an overpayment an overpayment Employee misconduct, including regulatory or other breaches Gross or serious employee misconduct.

In addition, Executive Directors hold unvested scheme interests in the Companys incentive plans, which are shown on the righthand side of the table.
Unvested scheme interests provide further exposure to the RSA share price ensuring Executive Directors have signi cant skin in the game.
These awards must be retained on vesting aside from any sold to satisfy statutory deductions until the required Shareholding level is reached.
Any awards which vest and are retained count towards the Shareholding level from that point.

Pay ratios The Group aims to treat all employees fairly in the markets in which we operate and provide competitive, performance-linked remuneration.
RSA is an accredited Living Wage Employer.
The following table compares the 2018 total remuneration single gure for the Group Chief Executive with the Groups UK-based employees at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile.
This is included in this years report ahead of formal reporting requirements coming into effect.
A range of factors are taken into account in setting pay across the organisation, such as market positioning, in ation, job scale and content, and individual experience.
The Group Chief Executives remuneration is weighted relatively more towards variable pay due to the responsibility of the role, and therefore the ratio for any given year will shift according to incentive plan outcomes for that year, including multi-year long-term incentive awards.
Further, since the majority of pro ts, revenues and employees of RSA lie outside the UK, the Group Chief Executive total remuneration will move in line with the total Group performance which may differ from UK employee averages that will primarily re ect UK performance.
Nevertheless, the Committee is mindful of the importance of monitoring and assessing pay relativities, and ratios will be kept under review.
25th percentile Median 75th percentile Year Method pay ratio pay ratio pay ratio 1 2 2018 Option B 184:1 124:1 70:1 Notes: 1 The company determined the remuneration gures for the employee at each quartile with reference to a date of 31 December of the year shown.
2 This calculation method was used as it is expected to give a fair representation of pay ratios given RSAs remuneration structures.
It is relatively time-ef cient to calculate while remaining appropriately speci c. Under this option, gender pay gap data as at April 2018 is used to identify the best equivalents for the three RSA UK employees paid at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile.
A 2018 total remuneration gure is then calculated for each of these employees, and for a sample of employees with hourly remuneration rates either side to ensure that a representative employee is selected.
Each of the three identi ed individuals was a full-time employee during the year.
3 The total pay and bene ts for the individuals identi ed at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile was 22,168, 32,783 and 57,771 respectively.

Implementation of Policy in 2019 This section outlines how the Committee intends to implement the Directors Remuneration Policy during 2019.
The following charts illustrate how Executive Directors remuneration potential changes according to varying levels of performance achievement.
The Committees aim is that superior levels of remuneration will only be paid in return for delivering superior levels of performance.
The variable element is fully exible such that no award is guaranteed.
Additionally, the charts show the balance between xed and variable remuneration.
The remuneration structure is intended to promote the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The assumptions used in preparing these charts are noted in the following table.
There are no changes to Scott Egans remuneration quantum as a result of his role change, announced in February 2019, from Group CFO to CEO UK & International.
Charlotte Jones has been appointed to succeed Scott Egan as Group CFO and details of the remuneration that will apply following commencement of her appointment are given on the following pages.

3 Assumes 100% vesting of the award in the 2019-21 grant.
4 There are no assumptions relating to share price growth or dividend equivalents included in the above scenarios.
In the event of 50% share price growth during the LTIP performance period, the maximum outcome from the 2019-21 LTIP would be 1.7m Scott Egan, 3.6m Stephen Hester and 1.5m Charlotte Jones.
This is based on 100% of the granted awards vesting multiplied by 1.5.
If this was coupled with a maximum bonus award as in the Maximum scenarios above, the total remuneration receivable would be 3.2m Scott Egan, 6.6m Stephen Hester and 2.9m Charlotte Jones.
Fixed remuneration The Policy will implemented consistently with the approach used in 2018.
The Committee reviewed the Executive Director salary levels, taking into account the average reviews applied elsewhere in the Group, including those for employees subject to collective bargaining agreements, and UK in ation gures.
It referenced a range of information including market data from two benchmarking peer groups of listed international insurers and FTSE companies of a broadly comparable market capitalisation to RSA, excluding banks and heavy industries.
The table below shows the salaries that will apply from 1 April 2019.
The level of increase is below the average increase levels for other UK-based employees this year: Annual base Annual base salary effective salary effective Director 1 April 2018 1 April 2019 % change Scott Egan 548,888 559,866 2% Stephen Hester 1,013,090 1,033,352 2% The Group Chief Executive voluntarily began a process of pension contribution reduction, with payments from April 2019 to reduce by 3% of salary, to 27% of salary, and a further 3% reduction to 24% of salary from April 2020.
From the effective date of her appointment, Charlotte Jones annual base salary will be 500,000.
Her overall pension contribution rate of 10% of salary is aligned to that for other new UK employees.
She will receive bene ts in line with the Remuneration Policy.

The Executive Directors will be expected to deliver against stretching targets, which are geared towards making continued performance improvement.
The Group Chief Executive and CFO are targeted against the performance of the entire Group, taking into account their contribution thereto.
From the time of his appointment as CEO UK & International, Scott Egan will be targeted against a combination of the performance of his region and the Group, taking into account his contribution thereto.
The Business Scorecard component focuses on key areas of management activity essential to the success of the Company including Underlying Performance, Risk and Resilience and Business Sustainability including Customer franchise.
For the CEO UK & International, divisional performance indicators are included.
The Personal Scorecard consists of SMART objectives bespoke to each Director, with a focus on both what is achieved and how goals are delivered.
Half of the total bonus will be awarded in cash where clawback can apply, the balance is deferred into shares for a three-year period where malus adjustment can apply.
The Committee will assess performance for 2019 once the financial year has ended, taking into account material risk factors.
All of the bonus targets are considered to be commercially sensitive because they signal the Groups forward plan for the year, and therefore they are not provided in this document.

For the 2019 grant, performance measures will be assessed against a performance period of 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2021, taking into account underlying business performance and material risk factors.
The Business Scorecard measures and assessment will be operated similarly to the 2018-20 LTIP cycle, as described on page 75.
In contrast to the Business Scorecard in the 2019 Annual Bonus, which will capture calendar year actions and outcomes relative to RSAs business plan, the long-term incentive Scorecard will capture progress over three years vs the Companys strategy and three-year Operating Plans.
Its speci c targets cannot be disclosed prospectively for commercial reasons, including price sensitivity.
A performance narrative will be given regarding the level of vesting on the Scorecard once the performance conditions have been tested.
The Committee has approved in principle that Stephen Hesters Performance Share opportunity in the 2019-21 LTIP grant will be 230% of salary at maximum vesting, which is the usual level of award for the Group Chief Executive: and the opportunity for other Executive Directors will be 200% of salary at maximum vesting.
Executive Directors must retain all vested shares arising from this incentive plan for two years post-vesting except those sold to cover statutory deductions, and they are subject to the Groups Clawback Policy.

Group CFO compensatory award On leaving her current employer, Charlotte Jones is due to forfeit a number of cash and share-based awards.
In line with the principles in the Policy, a compensatory package will be constructed to match the timing and nature of awards forfeited following commencement of her employment as CFO i. e. a mix of cash, restricted deferred share awards and inclusion in current RSA incentive cycles.
In addition to the rules governing RSA share awards, this will be subject to repayment terms in the event of resignation or termination for gross misconduct within two years of appointment.
Charlotte must build her RSA shareholding to the required 200% of salary level prior to the sale of any shares, excluding those sold to cover statutory deductions.
