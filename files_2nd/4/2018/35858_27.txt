Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 78 REMUNERATION REPORT 1 A Statement to Shareholders from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to introduce the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2018.
As in previous years, this report is split into two distinct sections.
The first sets out Ferrexpos remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM: and is reproduced in full for ease of reference and to provide context to the decisions taken by the Committee during the year.
The second reviews how the Companys remuneration policy was implemented in 2018 and will be implemented in 2019.
This section will be subject to an advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM.
The elements subject to audit are highlighted throughout.
In 2018, the iron ore market was notably less volatile and iron ore pellet demand remained strong with pellet premiums rising 30% above 2017 levels.
The Groups production volumes rose by 2% compared with 2017, and reflected planned pellet line refurbishment in 2Q and higher levels of required fixed plant maintenance.
Higher commodity input prices, local inflation and increased mining and maintenance activities beyond management control impacted the Groups C1 cash cost of production which increased by 34% to US$43.3 per tonne 2017: US$32.3 per tonne.
Sales volumes were also hampered by temporary logistics difficulties in respect of railage to the port and low water levels on the Danube River.
The Committee believes that this performance is fairly reflected in executive remuneration outcomes for the year, as set out in this report and taking into consideration the specific arrangements regarding Mr Zhevago the CEO outlined below.
It is the policy of the Board to align executive and shareholder interests by linking a high proportion of executive remuneration to performance, basing rewards on a balanced portfolio of performance measures, and assessing remuneration packages against the relevant market to ensure that Ferrexpo can attract, motivate and retain talented executives.
The CEOs incentive is derived entirely from his shareholding in the Company, and his remuneration is paid to him at a flat rate of US$240,000 per year.
The Board considers that his large shareholding in the business is sufficient to strongly align the CEOs interests with those of other shareholders.
In determining bonus outcomes under the Short Term Incentive Plan STIP for 2018, the Committee took account that some factors affecting the outcomes of the Business scorecard were beyond the direct control of executives but noted with deep regret that a fatality was experienced at Ferrexpo Poltava Mining FPM in 2018.
The overall outcome under the STIP ranged from 55.6% to 83.5% of maximum, including 75.2% of maximum for the Chief Financial Officer the CFO, Mr Mawe.
This outcome includes the application of a negative 5 per cent Modifier on the overall STIP outcome for all executives in consideration of the tragic fatality and the impact on business outcomes arising from higher production costs and lower than planned sales.
No significant changes were made to the implementation of the remuneration policy during the year, but in light of recent changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Committee will be considering the introduction of a post-employment shareholding guideline as part of its review of the Companys remuneration policy during 2019.
The Committee has already introduced a two-year holding period on vested LTIP shares with clawback provisions, for awards granted from 2018 onwards.
This extends incentive time horizons and provides further alignment with shareholder interests.
In total, this results in a five-year combined LTIP vesting and holding period.
From a disclosure perspective, we have included Schedule 8 revisions around enhancing the pay scenario chart disclosure see page 82 and quantifying the impact of share price appreciation on long-term incentive outcomes see page 86.
The Committee strives to align the interests of the executives with shareholders, and the Board keeps under review the structure and level of remuneration afforded through share-based incentives and ownership in relation to variable and fixed pay.
During the year the Remuneration Committee did not exercise any upwards or downwards discretion with respect to the vesting of any element of the remuneration package.
Bert Nacken Chairman Of The Remuneration Committee 1 This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee the Committee on behalf of the Board in accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 and the UK Corporate Governance Code.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 79 PART A: POLICY SECTION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT COMMITTEE The terms of reference for the Committee were updated during the year to comply with changes made to the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The revised terms of reference were approved by the Board, and its duties include the determination of the policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the members of the Executive Committee, and the Company Secretary as well as their specific remuneration packages, including pension rights and, where applicable, any compensation payments.
In determining such policy, the Committee is expected to take into account all factors which it deems necessary to ensure that members of the senior executive management of the Group are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage strong performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
The composition of the Committee and its terms of reference comply with the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code and are available for inspection on the Groups website at www.
Key Principles of the Remuneration Policy Ferrexpos remuneration policy is designed to help attract, motivate and retain talented executives to help drive the future growth and performance of the business.
The policy aims to: align executive and shareholder interests: link a high proportion of remuneration to performance: reward based on a balanced portfolio of performance measures e. g. Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to sector peers, annual business priorities, financial and operational targets and individual performance : and provide rewards that are competitive in the relevant markets to help attract, motivate and retain talented executives.
In determining the Companys remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account the particular business context of the Group, the industry segment, the geography of its operations, the relevant talent market for each executive, the location of the executive and remuneration in that local market and best practice guidelines set by institutional shareholder bodies.
The Committee will continue to give full consideration to the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to Directors remuneration and to the guidance of investor relations bodies.
Executive Director Policy Table This section of our report summarises the policy for each component of Executive Director remuneration which was effective from the date of the 2017 AGM for both current and future Executive Directors but see also Remuneration Policy for New Appointments on page 82.
The framework governing the LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2018 AGM.
The Chief Executives remuneration package includes an honorarium of US$240,000 per year net of applicable income taxes with no performance-related pay as described earlier in this report, and his incentive is derived entirely from his shareholding in the Company.
The Board considers this large shareholding in the business to be a significant factor in aligning the performance of the CEO with other shareholders interests, and is satisfied that this structure is appropriate.
At the current time, most of the policies set out below, other than those related to benefits and pensions, are therefore not applicable to the current CEO and apply exclusively to the CFO.
The principles below are, however, also considered as a framework for any future Executive Director appointments and apply where appropriate to the members of the Executive Committee.

Details of the performance targets for the LTIP are set out in Part B under LTIP granted in 2018.
The Committee reviews the LTIP performance conditions, in advance of granting each LTIP cycle.
Over the life of this policy relative TSR will be retained as the primary performance measure.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 81 Rationale for Performance Measures The STIP is based on performance categories that are key to delivering on our long-term strategy.
Performance measures are set at the beginning of the financial year to reflect business priorities and other corporate objectives, and can include financial, non-financial and personal achievement criteria.
Performance targets are set at such a level as to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular strategic priorities and economic environment in a given performance period.
The STIP target is based on the annual budget approved by the Board.
Where appropriate, the Committee sets a performance zone threshold to stretch around the target, which it considers provides an appropriate degree of stretch challenge and an incentive to outperform.
The Committee believes that using multiple targets for the purposes of the STIP provides for a balanced assessment of performance over the year.
For the LTIP, the Committee believes that relative TSR is the most objective external measure of the Companys success over the longer term.
Relative TSR helps align the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders by incentivising share price growth and, in the Committees view, provides an objective measure of long-term success.
The Committee has discretion to review the comparator index if any of the constituent companies is affected by corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions.
The Committee also reviews the constituents and their weightings prior to the start of each LTIP cycle in order to ensure that they remain appropriate.
Details of the comparator group will be set out in Part B of the Remuneration Report for the year immediately following the year in which the grant is made.
With effect from the grant of 2010 LTIP awards which vested in 2013, Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee are encouraged, in line with the practice among FTSE-listed companies, to build up a holding of shares of equivalent value to a years base salary in the case of Executive Directors or six months base salary for other members of the Executive Committee.
Executives are encouraged to retain their vested LTIP shares on an after-tax basis until the applicable guideline level is achieved.
This is in addition to a mandatory two-year holding period on vested LTIP shares for awards granted from 2018 onwards.
As indicated earlier in the introductory letter to this report, to align with the changes in the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Committee is considering the introduction of a post-termination shareholding policy when the remuneration policy is renewed in 2020.
Remuneration of Senior Executives below the Board The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of senior executives below the Board is consistent with that of the Executive Directors.
Senior executives participate in the LTIP with the same performance measures applied as for the CFO.
Long-term incentive awards may be granted to participants below the Board without performance conditions, for example, if it is considered necessary to attract executives of the appropriate calibre.
Payments Resulting from Existing Awards The Executive Director concerned is eligible to receive payment resulting from the vesting of any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report.

Fees are reviewed from time to time, taking into account the time commitment, responsibilities and fees paid by comparable companies, and also taking into consideration geography and risk profile.
Additional fees may be payable to Non-executive Directors in exceptional circumstances, e. g. if there is a material increase in time commitment.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any incentive plans, or receive benefits or any additional elements of remuneration to that stated above.
Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 82 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Pay-for-Performance: Scenario Analysis The CEO does not participate in any incentive plan, for the reasons stated in the introduction to this report.
Under all scenarios, therefore, his remuneration remains as set out in Section B of this report.
For the CFO, who is the remaining Executive Director, the graph below provides estimates of the potential future reward opportunity and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under four different performance scenarios: Below threshold, Target and Maximum and Maximum assuming 50% share price growth.
In illustrating potential reward opportunities, the following assumptions have been made: Scenario STIP LTIP Fixed pay Maximum assuming Maximum STIP 150% of salary Performance warrants full vesting 50% share price growth and share price increase of 50% versus the share price at grant Base salary, pension 1 Maximum Maximum STIP 150% of salary Performance warrants full vesting and benefits as at 1 January 2019 Target On-target STIP 100% of salary Performance warrants threshold 1 vesting 20% Below threshold No STIP payable Threshold not achieved nil 1 Excludes increase in value arising from share price growth.

For the STIP, the amounts illustrated for the CFO are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for 2019.
For the LTIP, awards do not normally vest until the end of three years following the beginning of the year in which they were granted.
The LTIP award opportunity for the CFO above is assumed to be of similar monetary value as the award made but which he declined in 2018.
It should also be noted that the Committee reviews the efficacy of the LTIP prior to grant each year, which could affect the LTIP awards made to the CFO in 2019.
Remuneration Policy for New Appointments The Committees approach to setting remuneration for new Executive Directors is to ensure that the Companys pay arrangements are in the best interests of Ferrexpo and its shareholders.
To do this, the Company takes into account internal pay levels, the external market, location of the executive and remuneration received at the previous employer.
The Committee reserves discretion to offer appropriate pension and benefit arrangements, which may include the continuation of benefits received in a previous role.
Variable pay awards excluding any potential buy-out awards, described below for a newly appointed Executive Director will be as described in the policy table, subject to the same maximum opportunities.
Different performance measures may be set initially for the STIP and LTIP awards, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial year at which he or she joined, and subject to the rules of the plan.
The rationale will be clearly explained in each case.
In addition, the Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out existing incentive awards forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In such cases, the compensatory award would typically be on a like-for-like basis with similar time to vesting, performance measures and likelihood of the targets being met.
The fair value of the buy-out award would not be greater than the awards being replaced.
To facilitate such a buy-out the Committee may grant a bespoke award under the Listing Rules exemption available for this purpose.
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Group will honour any contractual commitments made prior to his or her promotion to Executive Director.
In every case, the Board will pay both the appropriate, but also the necessary, rate of pay to attract an executive who in the view of the Board will contribute to shareholder value.
The approach to setting Non-executive Director fees on appointment is in line with the approach taken for the fee review set out in the Non-executive Director policy table earlier in this report, and will also take into account fee levels for existing Non-executive Directors.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 83 Details of Executive Directors Service Contracts The Executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment with Ferrexpo AG, a Group company the employer.
The Committee sets notice periods for the Executive Directors at 12 months or less, which reduces the likelihood of having to pay excessive compensation in the event of poor performance.
The principal terms of the Executive Directors service contracts which have no fixed term not otherwise set out in this report are as follows: save in circumstances justifying summary termination, Mr Zhevagos service contract with the employer is terminable on not less than six months notice to be given by the employer or by Mr Zhevago, and Mr Mawes service contract with the employer is terminable on not less than 12 months notice to be given by the employer or not less than six months notice to be given by Mr Mawe.
Notice period Executive Director Position Date of contract From employer From employee K Zhevago CEO 1 November 2008 6 months 6 months C Mawe CFO 7 January 2008 12 months 6 months Under the service contracts, the Executive Directors are entitled to 25 working days paid holiday per year.
The Executive Directors service contracts contain a provision exercisable at the option of the employer to pay an amount on early termination of employment equal to the respective notice period.
If the employer elects to make such a payment which in practice it will do if the speed and certainty afforded by this provision are thought to be in the best interests of shareholders, the Executive Director will be entitled under his contract to receive all components of his base salary, accrued but untaken holiday and expenses for the extent of the notice period, including for Mr Mawe a pro-rated performance-related payment under the STIP where the employer terminates employment, which reflects the practice in the Group at the time when Mr Mawe was appointed.
Mr Mawes entitlement to a pro-rated performance-related payment where the employer terminates his employment will not be replicated in the service contracts of future Executive Directors.
In addition to the contractual rights to a payment on loss of office, any employee, including the Executive Directors, may have additional statutory and or common law rights to certain additional payments, for example in a redundancy situation.
Policy for Loss of Office Payments The following principles apply when determining payments for loss of office for the Executive Directors and any new Executive Directors.
The employer will take account of all relevant circumstances on a case-by-case basis including but not limited to : the sums stipulated in the service contract including base salary during his or her notice period, accrued but untaken holiday, and allowances benefits but excluding STIP, save in the case of Mr Mawe : whether the Executive Director has presided over an orderly handover: the contribution of the Executive Director to the success of the Company during his or her tenure: and the need to compromise any claims that the Executive Director may have.
The Company may, for example, if the Committee considers it to be necessary: enter into agreements with Executive Directors which may include the provision of legal fees or the settlement of liabilities in return for a single one-off payment or subsequent payments subject to appropriate conditions: terminate employment other than in accordance with the terms of the contract bearing in mind the potential consequences of doing so : or enter into new arrangements with the departing Executive Director for example, consultancy arrangements.
If the individual is considered a good leaver e. g. for reasons of death, ill-health, injury or disability: his employing company ceasing to be a member of the Group: the business or part of the business in which he is employed being transferred to a transferee which is not a member of the Group: or any other reason which the Committee in its absolute discretion permits any outstanding LTIP awards will be pro-rated for time and performance conditions will be measured.
The Committee retains discretion to alter these provisions as permitted by the relevant plan rules on a case-by-case basis following a review of circumstances, in order to ensure fairness to both shareholders and participants.
In considering the exercise of discretion as set out above, the Committee will take into account all relevant circumstances which it considers are in the best interests of the Company: for example, ensuring an orderly handover, performance of the executive during his tenure as Director, performance of the Company as a whole and perception of the payment amongst the shareholders, general public and employee base.
In the event of a change of control, the vesting period under the LTIP ends and awards may be exercised or released to the extent to which the performance conditions have, in the Committees opinion, been achieved up to that time.
Pro-rating for time applies but the Committee has discretion to allow awards to be exercised or released to a greater or lesser extent if it considers it appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the transaction and the Companys performance up to the date of the transaction.
It is the Committees policy to review contractual arrangements prior to new appointments in light of developments in best practice.
The Executive Directors service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.
Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 84 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED External Appointments It is the Boards policy to allow the Executive Directors to accept directorships of other quoted companies, provided that they have obtained the consent of both the CEO and Chairman of the Board and which should be notified to the Board.
No external directorships of quoted companies are currently held by Executive Directors.
Details of Non-executive Directors Letters of Appointment The Chairman and Non-executive Directors have each entered into a letter of appointment with the Company.
The Non-executive Directors are each appointed for an initial period of three years, and their appointments may then be renewed on a three-yearly basis, subject to re-election when appropriate by the Company in a general meeting: in 2011 the Company adopted the practice of annual re-election of all Non-executive Directors.
The key terms of current letters of appointment are as follows: Non-executive Director Position Date of first appointment Date of re-election S Lucas Chairman 19 May 2016 Annual re-election B Nacken Non-executive Director 1 August 2014 Annual re-election V Lisovenko Non-executive Director 28 November 2016 Annual re-election M Reilly Non-executive Director 27 May 2015 Annual re-election 1 L Genovese Non-executive Director 12 February 2019 Election 1 Lucio Genovese was appointed to the Board on 12 February 2019 and will stand for election at the 2019 AGM.
Employee Context In making remuneration decisions, the Committee also considers the pay and employment conditions throughout the Group.
Prior to the annual pay review and throughout the year, the Committee receives reports from the CEO setting out the circumstances surrounding, and potential changes to, broader employee pay.
The CEO consults as appropriate with key employees and the relevant professionals throughout the Group.
This forms part of the basis for determining changes in Executive Director and senior executive remuneration which also takes into consideration factors detailed earlier in this report.
Consideration of Shareholder Views The Committee takes into consideration views expressed by shareholders regarding remuneration, either at the AGM, or by correspondence, or at one-to-one or Group meetings and shareholder events or otherwise by considering these views at the relevant Committee meetings which are subsequently reported to and considered by the Board as a whole.
The Committee takes shareholder feedback into careful consideration when reviewing remuneration and regularly reviews the Directors remuneration policy in the context of key institutional shareholder guidelines and best practice.
It is the Committees policy to consult with major shareholders prior to making any major changes to its executive remuneration structure.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 85 PART B: REMUNERATION IN 2018 SUBJECT TO AUDIT The following section provides details of how the remuneration policy was implemented during the year.
Throughout this report, the remuneration of Mr Zhevago and Mr Mawe the Executive Directors is disclosed in local currencies to facilitate year-on-year comparisons, uninfluenced by exchange rate fluctuations.
Committee Membership in 2018 The Committee comprises four independent Non-executive Directors.
Bert Nacken is the Chairman of the Committee.
The other members are Mary Reilly, Vitalii Lisovenko and Simon Lockett.
The Committee met four times during the year.
Attendance at meetings by individual members is detailed in the Corporate Governance Report on page 68.
A summary of the topics discussed at meetings in 2018 is detailed below: Review of remuneration of members of the Executive Committee, including salaries, STIP and LTIP policy.
Review of pension arrangements across the Group.
Review of the policy governing recovery provisions relating to incentive awards.
Review of feedback from the 2018 AGM voting season.
Review of general market considerations surrounding executive remuneration packages and structure.
Review of changes in the UK Corporate Governance Code and implications for the operation of the Committee.
Performance evaluation of the Committee.
The CEO and the Chief Human Resources Officer the CHRO usually attend meetings of the Committee at the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, and the Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
No Director is present when his own remuneration is being discussed.
Advisers The Committee currently retains Mercer | Kepler to provide advice on remuneration policy, with particular emphasis on the structure of long-term incentives for senior management and the provision of benchmark reports on executive and non-executive remuneration.
Mercer | Kepler is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its code of conduct.
To help ensure a consistent approach to remuneration across the Group, Mercer | Kepler also provided advice to the Company in respect of matters relating to the remuneration of other employees.
Other than remuneration advice, no other services were provided by Mercer | Kepler.
Keplers parent company, Mercer, advised the Group on international healthcare plans.
The fees paid to Mercer | Kepler in respect of work carried out for the Committee in 2018 totalled 18,925 based on time and materials.
The Committee evaluates the support provided by its advisers periodically and is satisfied that Mercer | Kepler provides independent and objective remuneration advice to the Committee and does not have any connections with Ferrexpo which may impair its independence.
The CEO and the CHRO provide guidance to the Committee on remuneration packages of senior executives employed by the Group but not in respect of their own remuneration.
Single Total Figure of Remuneration Audited The table below sets out in a single figure for each currency of payment the total remuneration received by each Executive Director for the year ending 31 December 2018 and the prior year.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 87 Implementation of Remuneration Policy Salary Base salaries are reviewed annually, with reference to the individuals role, experience and performance: business performance: salary levels at relevant comparators: and the range of salary increases applying across the Group.
During the year the Committee considered pay levels against international mining comparators and other FTSE-listed companies of similar size with executives based in similar geographic locations.
Following this review the Committee decided not to increase executive salaries in 2018.
Mr Zhevagos remuneration also remained unchanged at US$240,000.

Mr Mawe and Mr Zhevago are members of the Ferrexpo AG pension plan, which is a mandatory insurance scheme under Swiss law, provided for all employees of Ferrexpo AG, to which the Company contributes an average of 6% of their annual base salaries.
Contributions operate according to a sliding scale, increasing as the employee gets older to a maximum of 10%.

Pension and other benefits will operate as set out in the Executive Director remuneration policy earlier in the report.
2018 STIP Outcome Audited The Company, as a single product producer of iron ore pellets with a focused customer portfolio, sets its performance targets to ensure that the CFO and senior executives are motivated to enhance shareholder value both in the short-term and over the longer term.
Key performance targets for 2018 were set for the CFO and senior executives and were weighted to reflect the contribution of the individual to the achievement of that target.
Targets during the year related to financial performance, operational performance, and sales and product marketing performance, as well as personal targets relating to operational and financial management objectives.
Safety behavioural safety initiatives and improvements in risk management and lost time accident statistics was included as a modifier, decreasing the total result in the event of a fatality.
In last years report, detailed targets and objectives were not disclosed prospectively as they were considered to be commercially sensitive at that time.
We indicated that retrospective disclosure of these targets would be given in this years report where this is no longer the case, and this is included in the table below.
Financial and operational targets were normalised, as in previous years, to take account of market and raw material cost price developments and mining plans as appropriate, to the extent that these were not under the direct control of management.
Target STIP opportunity as a percentage of salary may be varied as appropriate to take account of changes in role, responsibility or scope.
No payment is made under the STIP if performance is below threshold.
For the CFO, threshold performance earns a bonus of 50% of salary, on-target performance 100% and stretch performance 150%.
The level of achievement against each of the targets for 2018, as determined by the Committee for the CFO, is summarised below.

The Committee noted that production volumes in 2018 were impacted by planned pellet line refurbishments and higher than expected required maintenance.
Temporary rail logistics problems and low water on the Danube River impeded sales which caused a drag on financial targets despite these targets being adjusted upwards to take account of actual market and raw material input cost price developments which were beyond the direct control of management.
The Committee also noted with deep regret that a fatal incident was experienced at FPM in the year when a contractor fell while working at height.
This loss has had an immense impact on all involved and the Board continues to work closely with executive management to build leadership capability and improve safety performance.
As a result of this incident the Committee applied a penalty of -5% to the overall scorecard outcome for the CFO.
Taking into consideration all these factors, the Committee determined an overall business scorecard result for the CFO of 59.4% of salary.

The Committee confirmed that the CFO had achieved all his personal targets relating to managing the Groups overall tax position, refinancing the Groups bond due in 2019, and management of the Groups cash position which enabled the payment of normal and special dividends to shareholders.
The Committee also considered that the CFO had continued to take actions to deleverage the Groups balance sheet, reducing working capital and had achieved various compliance-related targets in the normal course of his duties.
It was also noted that the CFO had, through various personal actions, contributed towards an increase in the Groups credit rating by the main rating agencies and had enhanced relationships with banking partners, thus enabling a new PXF facility and trade finance facilities to be arranged.
Taking into account his overall scorecard results and achievement of specific personal targets, the Committee awarded a total cash bonus of 112.9% of salary to the CFO.
Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 90 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED STIP Framework for 2019 The STIP framework for 2019 is in line with the principles of the remuneration policy and the 2018 framework.
Financial and operational targets, including cost reduction measures and personal KPIs, continue to be set as in previous years.
Mr Mawes 2019 STIP opportunity is 150% of salary for maximum performance, and 100% for target performance.
The measures and weightings for the STIP in 2019 are shown in the table below.
Due to commercial sensitivity, details of performance targets will be disclosed retrospectively and in certain instances may be aggregated.
The CEO does not participate in the STIP.

The 2016 LTIP rewarded TSR outperformance of a tailored comparator group, as set out below.
Under the 2016 LTIP, 20% of maximum vests for TSR performance in line with the index, with full vesting for TSR outperformance of 8% p. a. Ferrexpos TSR performance relative to the weighted index was assessed by Mercer | Kepler.
From 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018, Ferrexpos TSR outperformance was 11.9% p. a. resulting in 100% of the 2016 LTIP awards vesting.

As outlined in the Chairmans statement, the CFO declined receiving an LTIP award for the year.
The constituents of the index for the last three cycles are summarised in the table below: 1 2016 2017 2018 Focused iron ore miners Weighting 60% 60% 60% Assore 2 Atlas Iron Cliffs Fortescue Metals Kumba Iron Ore Mount Gibson Global diversified miners Weighting 40% 40% 40% 3 Anglo American BHP Billiton Rio Tinto Vale Glencore 1.
The Committee reviewed the constituents of the comparator index and their weightings prior to the grant of 2015 LTIP awards and decided to increase the weighting on the focused iron ore miners from 50% to 60% by dropping the single commodity emerging market miners component from the comparator group, increasing the weighting on our closest comparators to improve the relevance of the benchmark and aid simplicity.
Removed from the peer group for 2018 due to acquisition by Hancock Prospecting in 2018.
Removed from the peer group for 2018 because the company is the majority shareholder of Kumba Iron Ore already in the peer group which the Committee regarded as the more relevant of the two comparators.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 91 TSR is calculated on a common currency basis to ensure that comparisons with international comparators listed overseas are fair, with a TSR share price averaging period of six months to help improve the comparison of the management long-term incentive in relation to potential short-term movements in Ferrexpos share price or the share price of comparator companies.
No performance shares vest if Ferrexpos TSR underperforms the comparator index.
20% vest if Ferrexpos TSR is equal to index TSR: full vesting occurs only if Ferrexpos TSR exceeds the index by at least 8% p. a. : there is straight-line pro rata vesting in between these points.
In addition, for any shares to vest, the Committee must be satisfied that the recorded TSR is a fair reflection of Ferrexpos underlying business performance.
Dividends accrue on performance shares over the vesting period and are paid on shares that vest.
Dividends that ensue post vesting are paid to participants in shares.
LTIP Framework for 2018 This Directors Remuneration Report is published prior to the grant date of awards under the LTIP, which are normally made in April.

The awards will be subject to recovery provisions and a two-year holding period following the three-year performance period.
