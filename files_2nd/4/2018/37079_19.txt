Carolyn McCall was appointed to the Board on 8 January 2018 and remuneration is prorated from that date.
T he 2016 LTIP awards were subject to performance conditions measured to 31 December 2018.
As the performance conditions were not achieved, this award will lapse.

The gure shown in the table above represents the subsequent value received on the vesting date of 27 March 2018 using the share price on thatdate 145.18 pence.

Details of his remuneration arrangements are set out on page 100.
Further information in relation to each of the elements of remuneration for 2018 set out in the table above is detailed below.
An explanation for 2017 is set out in detail in our 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, which can be found on our website.
com investors Salary Carolyn McCalls annual salary for the year was 900,000.
She was appointed to the Board on 8 January 2018 and the prorated salary received in the year was 887,308.
As disclosed in last years report, Ian Grifths received a 2.75% salary increase from 1 January 2018 in line with the wider employee group.
Taxable benets and pension The benets provided to the Executive Directors include the cost of private medical insurance and car-related benets.
98 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information Remuneration Report The Executive Directors were not part of an ITV pension scheme but received a cash allowance in lieu of pension.
Carolyn McCall received 15% and Ian Grifths received 25% ofbasesalary respectively.
The cash allowance does not form part ofthe base salary for the purpose of determining incentives.
Bonus cash and shares Annual incentives are provided to Executive Directors through the bonus, with one-third of any award usually deferred into shares under the Deferred Share Award Plan DSA.
The performance conditions that apply to the bonus are set on an individual basis and are linked tothe Companys corporate, financial and strategic priorities.
This enables the Committee to reward both annual financial performance delivered for shareholders and performance against specic financial, operational or strategic objectives set for each Executive Director.
The majority of the bonus 75% was based upon the achievement of corporate and financial targets, with payout determined in accordance with pre-set target ranges subject only to the usual adjustments to exclude the impact of acquisitions and currency movements.
As indicated in the letter from the Chair, the financial targets were set to reflect expected trends in the advertising market and planned essential investments in core technologies and capabilities as well as the network programme budget agreed by the Board.
The targets were considered to be stretching in this context.
The corporate and financial targets used for 2018, together with performance against those targets and the resulting level of payout are set out below.
Performance required Performance Payout level Performance measure Weighting 20% 100% achieved % of maximum ITV adjusted EBITA 60% 754.3m 834.3m 810m 75.7% profit to cash conversion 15% 80% 88% 88% 100% The remainder of the bonus 25% was based upon the Committees assessment of the contribution each Executive Director made to the overall strategy through the delivery of specic targets.
The Committee applies suitable judgement when assessing performance in this regard.
The Executive Directors shared common objectives: completion of the strategy refresh, implementation of the organisational re-design, and ensuring communication and engagement with the new strategic priorities.
They delivered well against these objectives the More than TV strategy was announced in July 2018, a Direct to Consumer business was created, and the organisation redesign process commenced and will be completed in 2019.
The Committee therefore agreed that this element should deliver an outcome of 92.5% of maximum for both Directors.
In 2018, ITV demonstrated its resilience in what was a testing year for the UK economy.
During 2018, there was a further contraction in the spot advertising market due to continued economic and political uncertainty impacting business confidence.
Given this backdrop, the EBITA result for 2018 represents a robust outcome.
This outcome was underpinned by another year of strong cash conversion, a record outcome for share of viewing of 23.2% 2017: 21.7% and a 5% growth in total non-advertising revenue.
Overall ITV has delivered another year of strong operating performance as well as making a number of essential investments towards future success.
This underlying strength and confidence is reflected in the full year dividend for 2018 which is up 3%.
Notwithstanding the above, the Committee was mindful of how current macroeconomic uncertainty has recently impacted many UK exposed stocks, including ITV.
In this context, the Committee determined that while the executive team had performed well against the targets set at the start of the year, the Committee would exercise its discretion and trust.
The outcome from the corporate and financial elements of the bonus should therefore be scaled back by an amount equivalent to 10 percentage points of the overall award.
Payments and deferrals in respect of the financial year are set outbelow.
% of maximum % of bonus Value delivered bonus opportunity earned after in shares under Value paid earned Total value discretion applied Total value the DSA in cash Carolyn McCall 83.6% 1,334,423 73.6% 1,174,707 391,569 783,138 Ian Grifths 83.6% 988,002 73.6% 869,792 289,931 579,861 Of the total bonus shown for Ian Grifths, 779k relates to his ongoing bonus arrangements while 90k relates to the interim arrangements, see note 5 on page 98.
Themaximum bonus opportunity for Ian Grifths was increased from 165% to 180% for the period he was in receipt of a temporary salarysupplement.
99 Governance Remuneration Report continued Share awards We are required to show share awards in the single gure table on page 98 according to the year in which the performance period for each performance measure ended.
The awards made in 2016 under the LTIP were subject to performance measured to 31December 2018.
The performance conditions were not met and in accordance with the terms of the awards these will now lapse.
Further details on the awards and performance measures can be found on page 106 and in the 2016 Remuneration Report.
Transitional arrangements As a result of joining ITV, Carolyn McCall forfeited various interests under legacy incentive arrangements operated by her previous employer, easyJet plc.
As explained in last years Remuneration Report, the Committee agreed to buyout these arrangements on a comparable basis.
The single gure table for 2018 includes payments relating to: i 2015 easyJet deferred bonus 209k, ii 2016 easyJet deferred bonus 92k, iii 2016 17 easyJet bonus 910k : and iv 2014 easyJet long-term incentive awards 271k.
In all cases, the level of payout reflected the value of awards forfeited.
No buyout was made in respect of the 2015 easyJet long-term incentive awards, as the equivalent easyJet award lapsed in full.
Further details of the outstanding buyout arrangements are set out on page 103.
As noted in last years Remuneration Report, following Adam Croziers decision to step down from the Board, Ian Grifths was asked to lead the executive team on an interim basis and take on additional responsibilities until a new Chief Executive joined the business.
To reflect these additional responsibilities, it was agreed in May 2017 that he would receive a temporary salary supplement of 200,000 per annum and an increased maximum bonus opportunity of 180% of salary.
In order to facilitate a suitable transition, this supplement remained payable until 7 April 2018.
Chairman and Non-executive Directors The table below sets out in a single gure the total remuneration for Non-executive Directors for the financial year.
T he amounts disclosed in the table above relate to the reimbursement of taxable relevant travel and accommodation expenses and associated taxes for attending Board meetings and related business.

% salary Number of share Value at Performance awarded options nil-cost award date period ends Holding period Vesting date Release date Carolyn McCall 265 1,641,997 2,385,000 31 December 2020 2 years 28 March 2021 28 March 2023 Ian Grifths 225 995,134 1,445,432 31 December 2020 2 years 28 March 2021 28 March 2023 As noted in the letter from the Chair, the performance measures and targets for the 2018 awards were determined following consultation with our largest shareholders.
For the 2018-2020 performance cycle the performance measures selected are intended to be directly aligned to the three pillars of the More than TV strategy communicated to the market during 2018 and as set out on page 24.
The alignment between the strategy and the performance measures is summarised in the table on page 97.
When setting the performance measures and targets the Committee took into account the More than TV strategy, the planned essential investments over the period and current internal and external forecasts for future performance.
The targets are reflective of current legislative and regulatory frameworks.
The Committee views these targets as stretching given the uncertain economic environment.
Delivery of performance at the top of the range would represent significant outperformance.
The performance measures and targets for 2018 are: Threshold Maximum KPI Weightings 20% vesting 100% vesting Adjusted EPS see page 28 40% 13p 17p Total non-advertising revenues see page 28 40% 3% growth pa 6.5% growth pa Viewing health: - ITV Family SOV see page 29 10% 21.2% 23.1% - Online viewing see page 30 10% 200m hours growth 400m hours growth There will be scaled vesting between the threshold and maximum level.
The interim vesting points are closely linked to the strategy and are therefore currently commercially sensitive.
However, full disclosure of the scale will be provided following the end of the performance period.
The Remuneration Committee will retain the ability to adjust the targets and denitions for exceptional, one-off events or new business opportunities, which may arise over the course of the performance period, in order to ensure that the plan continues to operate in line with the Committees original intentions.
As a further safeguard, and in line with the 2018 Corporate Governance Code, the Remuneration Committee will continue to have discretion to amend the final vesting level should any formulaic assessment of performance not reflect a balanced view of the business performance during the performance period.
When making this judgement the Committee may consider any such factors it deems relevant.
The Committee believes that this discretion is an important feature of the plan and mitigates the risk of unwarranted vesting outcomes.
This provision will apply to all LTIP awards granted from 2018 onwards.
101 Governance Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Policy in 2019 Executive Directors The following section provides details of how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented in 2019.
The details below include Chris Kennedy who joined the Board in February 2019.
Salary Salaries are paid in line with the Remuneration Policy.
On 1 January 2019, Carolyn McCall received an increase of 2.5% in line with the wider employee group.
2019 Salary Carolyn McCall 922,500 Chris Kennedy 660,000 Taxable benets and pension These are provided in line with the Remuneration Policy.
Both Executive Directors receive private medical cover, car-related benets, and a cash allowance inlieuof participation in any ITV pension scheme.
Carolyn McCalls pension benets for 2019 will remain unchanged 15% of salary.
In accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code the Committee has determined that Directors who join from 1 January 2019 will receive pension contributions in line with the wider employee group, therefore Chris Kennedy will receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension of 9% of salary.
Bonus cash and shares The maximum bonus opportunity for 2019 remains unchanged: Carolyn McCall 180% of salary: Chris Kennedy 165% of salary.
Awards made to Executive Directors through the bonus will be paid two-thirds in cash and one-third deferred into shares under the DSA.
The performance measures and weightings for 2019 bonuses will be broadly similar to previous years.
The target ranges for financial measures have been set to reflect planned essential investments and current expectations regarding advertising market performance for 2019.
Overall the Committee is satisfied that the target ranges are realistic but highly stretching in this context.
The Board considers the actual targets for 2019 to be commercially sensitive at this time, however, we envisage providing retrospective disclosure of these targets in next years report.
Details of the financial performance measures are set out in the table on page 97.
The Committee may adjust bonus targets or outcomes to reflect significant one-off events e. g. major transactions, foreign exchange movements or material changes to assumed plan conditions to ensure that the plan continues to reward performance fairly.
The Committee may amend the bonus pay-out should any formulaic assessment of performance not reflect the overall business performance of the year.
Share awards The Committees intention is for 2019 LTIP awards to be subject to the same performance measures and weightings as those applicable to 2018 awards.
As noted above, these metrics have been discussed at length with our largest shareholders.
For 2019 LTIP awards we intend to maintain the same balance of performance measures as for 2018.
However, we will await nalisation of our strategic investment plans before publishing targets for 2019.
Once the targets are nalised, the Committee intends to publish them on the Companys website.
Malus and Clawback: malus and clawback provisions may be operated at the discretion of the Committee in respect of any cash and deferred share elements ofthe bonus and awards made under the LTIP.
Under malus, unvested share awards including any LTIP shares subject to a post-vesting holding period can be reduced down to zero if considered appropriate or be made subject to additional conditions.
Clawback allows forrepayment of bonuses previously paid and or shares previously received following vesting.
Malus clawback can be operated up to fouryears following the start of the relevant bonus year for bonuses, and up to six years from the relevant date of grant for LTIP awards.
The circumstances in which the operation of these provisions would be applied may be considered from time to time but currently include material misstatement of results, gross misconduct or fraud.
The plan rules have been reviewed and the Committee is happy that they provide sufficient scope to exercise discretion and judgement in line with the spirit of the 2018 Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee is also happy that there is no need to instigate either malus or clawback for any vested or outstanding awards at this time.

104 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information Remuneration Report Directors share interests Shareholding guidelines The Committee continues to recognise the importance of Directors being shareholders so as to align their interests with other shareholders.
Shareholding guidelines are in place, which encourage Executive Directors to build up a holding of ITV plc shares based on a percentage of base salary.
Normally, 50% of the requirement must be obtained within three years of appointment and the remainder withinve years.
Where the value of shares required to be held increases as a result of a salary increase or an increase in the relevant percentage, theExecutive Directors will have three years from such increase to achieve compliance.
The Committee may change the guidelines solongasthey are not, overall, in the view of the Committee, less onerous.
Interests in share awards following departure enable departing Directors to remain aligned with the interest of shareholders for an extended period after leaving the company.
Deferred Share Awards and LTIP awards subject to a holding period will normally vest and be released from their holding periods at the normal time.
This means that Directors may retain a significant interest in shares for up to five years following departure from the Company.
The Remuneration Committee intends to further review the Companys arrangements for alignment with shareholders post-cessation of employment as part of the review of the Remuneration Policy that will take place prior to the 2020 AGM.
Non-executive Directors are required to build and then maintain a holding of 100% of their base fee over the six years from the date ofappointment to the Board unless for some reason they are unable to retain their fees.
Interests in shares The gures set out below represent shareholdings in the ordinary share capital of ITV plc beneficially owned by Directors and their familyinterests at 31 December 2018.
Carolyn McCall was appointed to the Board on 8 January 2018.
Edward Bonham Carter was appointed to the Board on 11 October 2018.
Duncan Painter was appointed to the Board on 1 May 2018.
The value of shares has been calculated using the share price on 31 December 2018 of 125.7 pence.
At 31 December 2018 Ian Grifths had exceeded his shareholding requirement under the shareholding guidelines.
Carolyn McCall purchased a significant number of shares in the year, and is required to hold 50% of her requirement by 8 January 2021.
Peter Bazalgette and Roger Faxon would have met their requirements under the NED guidelines based on the average share price in 2018.
