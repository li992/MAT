Governance Remuneration Committee Report The information contained in this section of the Remuneration Committee Report is unaudited.
In light of a number of recent changes to the Executive Director team, we are proposing a new remuneration policy to strengthen the link between reward and performance and to align remuneration better to shareholders long term interests.
Since IPO, our Executive Director remuneration packages have Dear Shareholder been considerably below market, but this has been workable given On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the report of the the lower personal tax rates in Jersey where all of the original Remuneration Committee the Committee in respect of the yearExecutive Directors were based and their considerable personal ended 31 December 2018.

com Regulatory regime for disclosure and voting on Directors remuneration The UK remuneration reporting regulations contain provisions which make shareholder approval of the policy of UK-incorporated companies binding.
As the Company is not UK-incorporated those provisions have no legal effect.
However, the Company has taken steps to limit the power of the Remuneration Committee so that, with effect from the date on which the policy on remuneration was approved byshareholders, the Committee can only authorise payments to Directors that are consistent with the policy as approved by shareholders.
In that way the Company considers the vote of shareholders on the policy to be binding in its application.
The Remuneration Policy set out below will be put forward for shareholder approval at the AGM on 16 May 2019 and, if approved, will become effective from that date.
All remuneration and loss of office payments will only be made if they are consistent with the approved policy.
Specific details on how the Company will implement the policy in 2019 are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Directors Remuneration Policy The Committees objective is to ensure remuneration encourages, reinforces and rewards the growth of shareholder value and promotes the long-term success of the Company.
The Committee agreed that executive remuneration should have the following aims: be set with regard to pay levels and personal tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, whilst complying withUK plc structural norms and good practice: attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior management through a significant weighting on performance-related pay: be simple and understandable, both externally and to colleagues: achieve consistency of approach across the senior management population to the extent appropriate, informed by relevant local market benchmarks: encourage widespread share ownership across the executive team to ensure a long-term focus and alignment of interest with shareholders: be consistent with regulatory and corporate governance requirements: and not reward behaviour that inappropriately increases the Companys exposure to risks outside of the Companys risk appetite.
Remuneration for Executive Directors The remuneration policy for Executive Directors is summarised in the following table, explaining how each element operates and how each part links to the corporate strategy.
The changes to the policy, compared to the previous policy, are set out in the Chairmans Statement.

The Committee will operate the Annual Bonus Plan ABP and the PSP according to their respective plan rules and the policy set out above.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of these plans.
These include, but are not limited to, the following: who participates in the plan: the timing of grant and or payment: the size of an award and or a payment: the choice of performance measures and targets for each incentive plan in accordance with the policy set out above and the rules of each plan: the ability to vary any performance conditions if circumstances occur which cause the Remuneration Committee to determine that the original conditions have ceased to be appropriate provided that any change is fair and reasonable and in the Committees opinion, not materially less difficult to satisfy than the original condition: discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction: the ability to adjust where the formulaic outcome does not reflect underlying corporate performance, the investor experience or employee reward outcome: determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate treatment under the plan rules: and recovery and withholding of any award within a three year period of the later of the grant date or vesting date.

com Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee does not consult with employees directly on matters of Executive Director remuneration.
However, the Committee is aware of the disconnect which can be created if Executive Director remuneration is set in isolation and therefore is updated during the year with details of the pay and employment conditions in the wider workforce.
In particular, the Committee is made aware of general salary increases, general benefit provision and the proposed level of annual bonuses.
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing theproposed participants of the PSP.
During 2019 the Committee will consider the most appropriate approach to engage with employees to explain how executive remuneration aligns to broader workforce pay, in line with the new Code requirements.
Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for 2019 Basic annual salary As set out in last years report, as part of a previously disclosed programme of phased increases, Dean Godwins base salary was increased by 7.9%, reflecting strong individual and Company performance.
On appointment as CEO, Martin Schnaiers base salary will be 360,000, increasing from 300,000 payable as CEO Designate and, as mentioned in the Chairs Statement subject to satisfactory corporate and personal performance will increase to 390,000 with effect from 1 January 2020 as the last stage of the planned salary increases to achieve the desired positioning.
The CFOs salary will remain unchanged.
2018 2019 from AGM Chief Executive Officer N A 360,000 Chief Financial Officer 295,000 295,000 Pension An employer contribution of 3% of salary, rising to 4% from 1 April 2019, will be provided for the CEO and CFO, in line with the UK workforce.
Benefits Executive Directors will be provided benefits as outlined in the policy.
Annual bonus The annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors for 2019 shall be 125% of salary and bonuses will be based on a sliding scale of very challenging underlying profit before tax targets for 75% of the bonus and strategic targets for 25%.
The amount payable at threshold will be 20% of salary and the amount payable at a target level or performance will be 60% of base salary 48% of the maximum.
The profit component will be based on underlying profit before tax.
Underlying profit before tax is one of the key financial metrics at SANNE and the targets have been set by the Committee after taking account of the Companys business plan and external expectations, with full payment being made only in the case of exceptionally strong performance.
Non-financial objectives will be based on short-term operational and strategic priorities of the business.
It is expected that these will focus on areas similar to those for 2018, a summary of which is disclosed in the report.
The Committee considers that the profit and non-financial targets are commercially sensitive, which means that they cannot be disclosed in advance.
However, we will disclose the underlying profit targets, the non-financial objectives and performance against these targets in next years remuneration report, together with the use of any discretion.
Half of any bonus will be payable in cash and the other half will be deferred in shares for a period of three years.

75% of an award will be determined by an EPS performance condition.
A stretching range of underlying diluted EPS growth targets has been set, based on performance in the year ending 31 December 2021 as set out below: Compound annual growth from 2018 EPS1 Proportion of this part of the award vesting 75% Less than 7.5% Zero 7.5% 25% 18% 100% Awards vest on a straight line basis for performance between minimum and maximum payment thresholds.
The growth targets or the 2018 baseline for EPS measurement will be adjusted to neutralise the impact of IFRS16 and the change in method of calculation of diluted underlying EPS over the performance measurement period.
25% of an award will be determined by a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition, comparing SANNEs TSR share price and dividend performance over the performance period, against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts at the start of the performance period.
Vesting will be in line with the table below: SANNEs TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index constituents excluding Investment Trusts Proportion of this part of the award vesting 25% Below Median 0% Median 25% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile Between 25% and 100% A two-year post-vest holding period will apply, creating a five-year period between the grant of an award and the first opportunity to sell thenet of tax vested shares.
Non-executive Directors fees We are making some adjustments to the fee structure and levels for Non-executive Directors in light of the increased number of Non-executive Directors on the Board, changes to committee membership and the Non-executive Directors responsible for Employee Engagement split between three Non-executive Directors.
