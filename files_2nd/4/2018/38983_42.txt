Adjusted EBITDA was selected as an appropriate measure as it is the key financial performance metric of the Company, most closely representing the underlying trading performance of the business and is calculated after adding back certain non-cash charges, cash expenses relating to professional costs on acquisitions, gains on sale of investments and certain one-off charges as set out in the financial statements on pages 148 to 149.
The non-financial performance targets representing 30% of bonus opportunity, were selected to underpin key strategic objectives of the Group aligned with the business strategy.
Specific non-financial performance targets included the sale of our holdings in GVC and Plus500 subject to favourable market conditions, an improvement in our balance sheet efficiency, progress in regulated markets and the acquisition of Snaitech together with its integration into the Group.
When reviewing 2018 performance the Committee noted that the Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended 31 December 2018 was 343.0 million, which was below the minimum threshold set for this element of the bonus.
As a result, no element of the bonus was payable for financial performance.
The operational highlights set out in the Strategic Report on page 1 to 81 demonstrate that a number of the key strategic objectives set for executives were successfully achieved.
In particular, the Committee took account of the successful sale of the Groups holdings in GVC and Plus500, the successful bond issue, greater balance sheet efficiency, progress in regulated markets and the conclusion and continuing integration of the Snaitech acquisition.
