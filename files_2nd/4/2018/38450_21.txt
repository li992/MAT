For these purposes, UK employees who have been employed for over a year and therefore eligible for a salary increase have been used as a comparator group as they are the analogous population based on service and location.

The median ratio has fallen from 46:1 in 2017 to 39:1 in 2018.
This is as a result of a combination of factors including a decrease in the total paid to the CEO, positive changes to the Groups pay policy and changes in the employee population between 2017 and 2018.

HOW WE WILL IMPLEMENT THE REMUNERATION POLICY FOR DIRECTORS IN 2019 Base salary The CEO s and CFOs salaries will be increased by 3.03% and 3.5% respectively to 520,000 and 350,300 respectively.
Benefits and pension provision will remain unchanged.
Annual bonus The performance measures for the 2019 annual bonus have been set in line with the Business Balanced Scorecard.
Accordingly, the balance of the metrics are as follows: Financial Customer Quality Staff Personal objectives 50% of bonus opportunity 15% of bonus opportunity 15% of bonus opportunity 10% of bonus opportunity 10% of bonus opportunity Underlying PBT Customer satisfaction Overdue management Diversity Vary by executive All-in ROE Broker satisfaction actions Employee engagement Details of objectives Cost to income ratio Complaints Arrears andperformance against Net loan book growth High-severity incidents these will be disclosed retrospectively in next years report Performance targets are considered to be commercially sensitive so will not be published in advance.
However, there will be full disclosure of the targets set and the extent of their achievement in the 2019 Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Committee may apply discretion to adjust the resultant bonus from the Business Balanced Scorecard if the result fails to reflect broader performance and the wider shareholder experience.
Similar to 2018, the maximum opportunity will be 150% of salary with half of any bonus earned deferred in shares for three years.
Performance Share Plan PSP awards of 150% of salary will be made to the Executive Directors in 2019.
Similar to the 2018 awards, the performance conditions will be EPS 40% weighting, relative TSR 40% weighting and return on equity 20% weighting.
At the time of vesting, the Committee will assess whether the formulaic vesting outcome is aligned with the underlying performance, risk appetite and individual conduct over the period.
Following vesting, shares must be held for a further two years after selling sufficient shares to cover tax charges.
The performance targets are set out in the table below.
The financial targets have been set taking into account the external market, shareholder expectations and expected business growth.
Whilst the ROE targets remain the same as for the 2018 Awards, the EPS targets will require threshold EPS growth of 5% per annum, and full vesting at 10% per annum, over the period to 2021.
The Committee is cognisant that on a percentage growth basis, these are lower than the targets for the 2018 Award of 6% to 12% per annum.
However, they are measured from an EPS figure that is around 15% higher than last year so in absolute terms do represent significant growth above the EPS required to be achieved for the 2018 targets: the Committee is comfortable that they are appropriately stretching in light of the business plan and external consensus forecasts and no less challenging than the EPS range set for the 2018 awards.
Return on equity Percentage of EPS element TSR element 20% of total that part of the Performance level 40% of total award 40% of total award award award vesting Below threshold Less than 5% CAGR Below median Below 20% 0% Threshold 5% CAGR Median 20% 25% Stretch 10% CAGR Upper quartile 25% 100% Pro rata vesting in between the above points Share ownership guidelines The CEO and the CFO are required to accumulate and maintain a holding in ordinary shares in the Company equivalent to no less than 250% of salary and 200% of salary respectively.
This is calculated on the basis of the value of beneficially owned shares plus the net of tax value of deferred bonus shares.
Half of any vested share awards must be retained until the guideline is achieved.
Based on the current share price, the CEO and CFO hold shares in excess of these levels.
