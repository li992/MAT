: performance-related remuneration is an essential motivation to management and staff and should be structured to ensure that executives interests are aligned with those of shareholders:  balanced against risk considerations: the structure of packages should support meritocracy, an important part of Beazleys culture: reward potentials should be market-competitive: and executives pay should include an element of downside risk.
 before tax and return on equity, both of which are key performance indicators for the company.
In addition the long term incentive plan LTIP uses another key performance indicator, net asset value per share NAVps growth, since it is aligned to shareholders interest.
For the maximum awards to vest, NAVps growth of 15% above the risk-free return has to be sustained forfiveyears: Fiveyearperformance.
This aligns reward with the long term performance of the business including malus and clawback provisions taking reclaim provisions to seven years.
In addition, for executive directors, a further two year holding period on the three year award applies from 2019 and ensures alignment with longer term decision-taking.
Further strengthening alignment with longer term decision making is the companys policy to defer a portion of annual bonuses into shares and our shareholding guidelines: and Risk.

Long term incentive plan LTIP Under the LTIP executive directors, senior management and selected underwriters receive awards of shares subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions measured over three and five years.
The key features of the plan are as follows: 50% of the award is measured after three years and 50% after five years: awards are in the form of nil-cost options with a 10-year term: participants are expected to build a shareholding in Beazley equal to their annual award level.
For example the CEO has a shareholding requirement of 200% of salary.
Participants have three years to build this shareholding.
LTIP awards may be forfeited if shareholding requirements are not met: and three year awards to executive directors are subject to a further two year holding period from 2019.
In accordance with the updated UK Corporate Governance Code, from 2019, the first tranche of LTIP awards will be subject to a further two year holding period taking the total time frame for all awards to five years.
Vesting of awards is based on growth in net asset value per share NAVps, one of Beazleys key performance indicators.
The committee considers the LTIP NAVps growth targets to be very stretching, particularly taking into account that growth must be over a sustained three and five year period.
Growth in NAVps is calculated taking into account any payment of dividends by the company.
In line with our reporting to shareholders, NAVps is denominated in US dollars.
LTIP awards vesting in respect of the year The LTIP awards shown in the single total figure of remuneration for 2018 include: the second tranche of awards granted on 11 February 2014.
These are due to vest on 11 February 2019, subject to the achievement of a NAVps growth performance condition over the five years ended 31 December 2018: and the first tranche of awards granted on 9 February 2016.
These are due to vest on 11 February 2019, subject to the achievement of a NAVps growth performance condition over the three years ended 31 December 2018.

LTIP awards will be 200% of salary for the CEO and 150% for other executive directors.
In response to the updated UK Corporate Governance Code, for awards in 2019 an additional clause has been introduced that would enable the committee to adjust the vesting outcome if it is not considered to be a fair representation of the underlying financial or non-financial performance.
Dilution The share plans permit 10% of the companys issued share capital to be issued pursuant to awards under the LTIP, SAYE and option plan in a 10-year period.
The company adheres to a dilution limit of 5% in a 10 year period for executive schemes.
com Directors remuneration report continued Annual remuneration report continued Investment in underwriting Traditionally, Lloyds underwriters contributed their personal capital to syndicates in which they worked.
With the move to corporate provision of capital, individual membership of Lloyds has declined significantly.
The committee feels that having personal capital at risk in the syndicate is an important part of the remuneration policy and provides a healthy counterbalance to incentivisation through bonuses and long term incentive awards.
The company has operated the Beazley staff underwriting plan for this purpose since 2004 and executive directors and other selected staff are invited to participate through bonus deferral with an element of their cash incentives at risk as capital commitments.
These capital commitments can be lost in full if underwriting performance is poor.
The group funds the capital for the plan.
The individual capital commitment is then funded through individual bonus deferral.
The aim is for individuals to fund their capital within three years.
To date over 300 employees of the group have committed to put at risk 14.8m of bonuses to the underwriting results of syndicate 623.
Of the total at risk, 12.5m has already been deferred from the bonuses awarded.
The following executive directors participated in syndicate 623 through Beazley Staff Underwriting Limited: 2017 2018 2019 year of year of year of Total account account account bonuses underwriting underwriting underwriting deferred capacity capacity capacity 1 Martin L Bride 191,600 400,000 400,000 n a Adrian P Cox 191,600 400,000 400,000 400,000 D Andrew Horton 191,600 400,000 400,000 400,000 1 Neil P Maidment 191,600 400,000 400,000 n a 1 Neil Maidment and Martin Bride have not been invited to participate on the 2019 plan due to their respective retirements.
The executive directors are currently fully funded in the plan and no further bonus deferral was made in 2018.
Malus and clawback Clawback provisions have operated for incentives in respect of 2015 and onwards.
Under these provisions the committee has the discretion to require clawback in certain circumstances for a defined period following payment or vesting.
Annual bonus and LTIP awards may be subject to clawback in the event of: material misstatement of results: gross misconduct: factual error in calculating vesting or award: any reputational damage or: a material corporate failure in any group member or a relevant business unit.
Annual bonus awards may be subject to clawback for a period of three years following payment of the cash bonus.
These clawback provisions will also extend to any deferred shares delivered before the end of the three year period and to any bonus which is voluntarily deferred as notional capital into the staff underwriting plan excluding any returns on the investment, which will not be subject to clawback.
LTIP awards may be subject to clawback for a period of two years following vesting.
Malus provisions have applied to the LTIP and deferred share plan for a number of years.
The committee has the discretion to reduce or withhold an award in circumstances of: conduct which justifies summary dismissal: an exceptional development which has a material adverse impact on the company, including but not limited to reputational damage, material failure of risk management, a material misstatement or any significant sanction from a government agency or regulatory authority: or where the committee considers it is necessary in order to comply with a law or regulatory requirement.
com Annual report 2018 Beazley 113 Pensions The pension benefits for executive directors and staff are provided by way of a defined contribution scheme arranged through Fidelity, which is non-contributory.
The company contributes 15% of salary for directors.
Following changes to pension tax legislation that came into force from April 2011, an equivalent cash alternative may be offered if an individual exceeds the lifetime or annual allowance.
Prior to 31 March 2006 the company provided pension entitlements to directors that are defined benefit in nature, based on its legacy policy under the Beazley Furlonge Limited Final Salary Pension Scheme.
Future service accruals ceased on 31 March 2006.
Only base salary is pensionable, subject to an earnings cap.
The normal retirement age for pension calculation purposes is 60 years.
A spouses pension is the equivalent of two-thirds of the members pension before any commutation payable on the members death after retirement.
Details of the defined benefit entitlements of those who served as directors during the year are as follows: Transfer Increase Increase value Accrued in accrued in accrued Transfer value of accrued Transfer benefit at benefits benefits of A less benefits at value less 31 Dec excluding including directors 31 Dec directors 2018 inflation A inflation contributions 2018 contributions Normal retirement date Adrian P Cox 13,582 467 413,572 13,194 12 Mar 2031 Neil P Maidment 46,365 1,595 1,476,894 37,442 21 Oct 2022 Under the Beazley Furlonge Limited Final Salary Pension Scheme, on early retirement the director receives a pension which is reduced to reflect early payment in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
No other pension provisions are made.
Risk and reward at Beazley The committee regularly reviews developing remuneration governance in the context of Solvency II remuneration guidance, other corporate governance developments and institutional shareholders guidance.
The chief risk officer reports annually to the remuneration committee on risk and remuneration as part of the regular agenda.
The committee believes the group is adopting an approach which is consistent with, and takes account of, the risk profile of the group.
We believe reward at Beazley is appropriately balanced in light of risk considerations, particularly taking into account the following features: Features aligned with risk considerations Share deferral A portion of bonus is normally deferred into shares for three years.
These deferred shares, together with shares awarded under the LTIP, mean that a significant portion of total remuneration is delivered in the form of shares deferred for a period of years LTIP holding period From 2019 the first tranche of the LTIP will be subject to a further two-year holding period.
Extended performance periods A portion of the LTIP has performance measured over an extended five-year period.
Shareholding requirements Executive directors are expected to build up and maintain a shareholding of 150% of salary 200% for the CEO.
Investment in underwriting Management and underwriters may defer part of their bonuses into the Beazley staff underwriting plan, providing alignment with capital providers.
Capital commitments can be lost if underwriting performance is poor.
Underwriters remuneration Under the profit related bonus plan payments are aligned with the timing of profits achieved on the account.
aligned with profit achieved For long tail accounts this may be in excess of six years.
If the account deteriorates then payouts are clawed back through adjustments to future payments.
Since 2012 profit related pay plans may be at risk of forfeiture or reduction if, in the opinion of the remuneration committee, there has been a serious regulatory breach by the underwriter concerned, including in relation to the groups policy on conduct risk.
Clawback and malus For deferred share awards and LTIP awards from 2012 malus provisions were introduced.
For LTIP awards provisions for annual bonus from 2015 and annual bonus in respect of 2015 and onwards, clawback provisions also apply for executive and LTIP shares directors.

External appointments Andrew Horton has been a non-executive director of Man Group plc since 3 August 2013, and he retains the fees in respect of this appointment.
Neil Maidment was appointed to the Council of Lloyds on 1 February 2016, and he retains the fees in respect of this appointment.
Non-executive directors fees The fees of non-executive directors are determined by the board.
When setting fee levels consideration is given to levels in comparable companies for comparable services and also to the time commitment and responsibilities of the individual non-executive director.
No non-executive director is involved in the determination of their fees.
The board reviews fees annually.
During the year the chairman and non-executive director fees were reviewed and increased reflecting the responsibilities and time commitment of the roles.
Details of the non-executive directors fees payable for plc board responsibilities are set out below: 2018 fee 2019 fee Chairman fee 200,000 206,000 Basic fee 59,500 61,500 Senior independent director fee additional 10,500 11,000 Chairman of audit and risk committee fee additional 17,750 18,500 Chairman of remuneration committee fee additional 16,500 17,000 Beazley operates across Lloyds, Europe and the US markets through a variety of legal entities and structures.
Non-executive directors, in addition to the plc board, typically sit on either one of our key subsidiary boards, namely Beazley Furlonge Ltd, our managing agency at Lloyds, or Beazley Insurance dac, our Irish insurance company.
Non-executive directors may receive additional fees for sitting on subsidiary boards.
As a result of developments in regulation, the degree of autonomy in the operation of each board has increased in recent years, with a consequent increase in time commitment and scope of the role.
No non-executive director participates in the groups incentive arrangements or pension plan.
Non-executive directors are appointed for fixed terms, normally for three years, and may be reappointed for future terms.
Non-executive directors are typically appointed through a selection process that assesses whether the candidate brings the desired competencies and skills to the group.
The board has identified several key competencies for non-executive directors to complement the existing skill-set of the executive directors.
These competencies may include: insurance sector expertise: asset management skills: public company and corporate governance experience: risk management skills: finance skills: and IT and operations skills.
com Annual report 2018 Beazley 115 Non-executive directors service contracts Details of the non-executive directors terms of appointment are set out below: Commencement of appointment Expires George P Blunden 1 Jan 2010 AGM 2019 Angela D Crawford-Ingle 27 Mar 2013 AGM 2019 Christine LaSala 1 Jul 2016 AGM 2020 Sir J Andrew Likierman 25 Mar 2015 AGM 2021 David L Roberts 1 Nov 2017 AGM 2021 John P Sauerland 5 May 2016 AGM 2020 Robert A Stuchbery 11 Aug 2016 AGM 2020 Catherine M Woods 1 Jan 2016 AGM 2019 The standard approach for non-executive director appointments is that the appointment expires at the AGM following the end of a three year term, notwithstanding the fact that each non-executive director is subject to annual re-election at each AGM.
Approach to remuneration for employees other than directors The committee also has oversight of remuneration arrangements elsewhere in the group.
The following tables set out the additional incentive arrangements for other staff within the organisation.

Retention shares To retain key staff.
Full vesting dependent on continued employment over six years.
Underwriter bonus plan profit related pay plan Underwriters participate in a profit related pay plan based upon the profitability of their underwriting account.
Executive directors do not participate in this plan.
The objective of the plan is to align the interests of the group and the individual through aligning an underwriters reward to the long term profitability of their portfolio.
Underwriters who have significant influence over a portfolio may be offered awards under the plan.
There is no automatic eligibility.
Profit related pay is awarded irrespective of the results of the group.
This bonus is awarded as cash and is based upon a fixed proportion of profit achieved on the relevant underwriting account as measured at three years and later.
Any movements in prior years are reflected in future year payments as the account develops after three years.
For long-tail accounts the class is still relatively immature at the three-year stage and therefore payments will be modest.
Underwriters may receive further payouts in years four, five and six and even later as the account matures.
Therefore each year they could be receiving payouts in relation to multiple underwriting years.
If the account deteriorates as it develops any payouts are clawed back through reductions in future profit related pay bonuses.
From 2012 onwards any new profit related pay plans may be at risk of forfeiture or reduction if, in the opinion of the remuneration committee, there has been a serious regulatory breach by the underwriter concerned, including in relation to the groups policy on conduct risk.
The fixed proportion is calculated based upon profit targets which are set through the business planning process and reviewed by a committee formed of executive committee members and functional specialists including the group actuary.
Underwriting risk is taken into account when setting profit targets.
In addition to profit related pay, underwriters are also eligible to receive a discretionary bonus, based upon performance, from the enterprise bonus pool.
A proportion of this bonus may be paid in deferred shares, which vest after three years subject to continued employment.
com Directors remuneration report continued Annual remuneration report continued Support bonus plan Employees who are not members of the executive and who do not participate in the underwriters profit related pay plan participate in a discretionary bonus pool.
This pool provides employees with a discretionary award of an annual performance bonus that reflects overall individual performance including meeting annual objectives.
A proportion of this award may also be dependent on the groups ROE and therefore allocated from the enterprise bonus pool.
UK SAYE The company operates an HMRC-approved SAYE scheme for the benefit of UK-based employees.
The scheme offers a three-year savings contract period with options being offered at a 20% discount to the share price on grant.
Monthly contributions are made through a payroll deduction on behalf of participating employees.
The UK SAYE scheme has been extended to eligible employees in Singapore and Ireland.
The Irish SAYE scheme has been approved by the Irish Revenue.
US SAYE The Beazley plc savings-related share option plan for US employees permits all eligible US-based employees to purchase shares of Beazley plc at a discount of up to 15% to the shares fair market value.
Participants may exercise options after a two-year period.
The plan is compliant with the terms of section 423 of the US Internal Revenue Code and is similar to the SAYE scheme operated for UK-based Beazley employees.
Retention shares The retention plan may be used for recruitment or retention purposes.
Any awards vest at 25% per annum over years three to six.
Policy going forward is that existing executive directors do not participate in this plan and no executive directors have subsisting legacy awards outstanding.

Remuneration committee The committee consists of only non-executive directors and during the year the members were Sir Andrew Likierman chairman, George Blunden, John Sauerland and Catherine Woods.
The board views each of these directors as independent.
The committee considers the individual remuneration packages of the chief executive, executive directors and executive committee members.
It also has oversight of the salary and bonus awards of individuals outside the executive committee who either directly report to executive committee members or who have basic salaries over 200,000, as well as the overall bonus pool and total incentives paid by the group.
The terms of reference of the committee are available on the companys website.
The committee met six times during the year.
Further information on the key activities of the committee for 2018 can be found within the statement of corporate governance on page 97.
During the year the committee was advised by remuneration consultants from Deloitte LLP.
Total fees in relation to executive remuneration consulting were 103,100.
Deloitte LLP also provided advice in relation to share schemes, tax, internal audit and compliance support.
Deloitte LLP was appointed by the committee.
Deloitte LLP is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such voluntarily operates under a code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
The committee agrees each year the protocols under which Deloitte LLP provides advice, to support independence.
The committee is satisfied that the advice received from Deloitte LLP has been objective and independent.
Input was also received by the committee during the year from the chief executive, head of talent management, company secretary and chief risk officer.
However, no individual plays a part in the determination of their own remuneration.
