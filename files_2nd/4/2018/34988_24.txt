NOTES TO THE REMUNERATION POLICY TABLE The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy for example for tax, exchange control, regulatory or administrative purposes without obtaining shareholder approval.
The Remuneration Policy for executive directors differs from that of other members of the Executive Board solely in respect of quantum of the various components and remuneration.
Executive directors have a greater proportion of their total remuneration package at risk than other employees: however, the structure and principles of incentives are broadly consistent.
The wider employee population of the Group will receive remuneration that is considered to be appropriate in relation to their geographic location, level of responsibility and performance.

Details of the performance measures and weighting as well as the achieved results for the bonus and LTIP components are shown on pages 86 to 88.

Mr Thomson had an interest in 10,622 shares that were awarded conditionally in connection with a below board plan prior to his appointment as a director of the Company.

2015-2016 AWARD PERFORMANCE 84.9% of the ROCE, 100% of the AFCF and 100% of the TSR performance measures were achieved at the end of the three year performance period, such that 95% of the LTIP awards made during the 2015-2016 financial year vested.
Shares will be delivered to individuals following the release of the preliminary results for the year ended 30 September 2018.
The Committee applied the established framework to deal with items that were unforeseen at the time the targets were set in 2015-2016 and which were in the long term interests of shareholders.
AFCF was adjusted for restructuring in Europe to reflect trading conditions and adjusted to reflect the reduction in pension deficit contributions to the UK pension scheme to ensure management did not benefit from this reduction.
Both the ROCE and AFCF measures were adjusted to exclude a one-off capital investment in the North American business.

88 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2018 GOVERNANCE 2015-2016 AND 2016-2017 AWARDS FOR PERFORMANCE PERIODS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 In accordance with the LTIP 2010 Rules, the Performance Period for each of the extant LTIP awards for 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 for MrCousins was brought to an early conclusion and each ended on 31 December 2017.
Consequently, his awards vested to the extent the performance conditions had been met at the time of vesting as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Mr Cousins was originally awarded 234,804 shares for the 2015-2016 LTIP award and 196,980 shares for the 2016-2017 LTIP award, which were prorated for his time in office to 176,103 and 82,075 respectively.
The value of the shares on vesting has been calculated by reference to the average market price of Compass Group PLC shares over the three months from 1 October 2017 to 31December 2017 of 1,580.48 pence per share.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose the detail of performance relative to the targets set and measured over the foreshortened period in respect of the former Group CEO, as it is the opinion of the Committee that the information is commercially sensitive and to disclose it would not be in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders.
2018-2019 AWARD TARGETS FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN THE YEAR ENDING 30 SEPTEMBER 2019 The table below shows the targets against which performance will be measured to determine the vesting of the grant of awards to be made in the year ending 30 September 2019 and forms part of the Policy detailed in the Policy Report on pages 75 to 81.
ROCE AND AFCF TARGETS VESTING % OF EACH LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE COMPONENT ROCE AFCF Threshold 0% 18.21% 2,873m Par target 50% 18.71% 3,024m Maximum 100% 19.21% 3,175m TSR TARGET VESTING % OF EACH LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE COMPONENT Below Median 0% Median 25% Upper Quartile 100% The vesting of the shares under each performance condition is independent.
Therefore, the total vesting amount is based on the relevant percentage achievement for each performance measure.
Awards vest on a straight line basis between Threshold and Par and between Par and Maximum.
If performance under a component does not exceed the Threshold level, vesting for that component will be nil.
At the end of the performance period, the Committee will review the underlying financial performance of the Company and retains its discretion to adjust vesting if it considers that financial performance is unsatisfactory.
The Committee considers the measures and targets set in respect of 2018-2019 to be appropriate and challenging.
Calculations of the achievement of the targets will be independently performed and approved by the Committee.
The Committee retains discretion to adjust for performance and the nature of any such adjustments will be disclosed in the DRR, together with details of the achieved ROCE, AFCF and TSR performance, as determined by the above definitions, at the end of the performance period.

The award will also be subject to a twoyear holding period standard contractual benefits including pension payments cash allowance or contribution equal to 20% of base salary The Company has also agreed the following buyout arrangements to compensate for the forfeiture of incentive compensation from Ms Witts current employment.
The recruitment Policy approved by shareholders sets out how to determine the buyout of outstanding incentives from a previous employer, namely, that awards should minimise the cost to Compass and, where possible, should deliver any compensation in the form of Compass shares, delivered no earlier than the original awards.
In line with that policy, the buyout of current share-based incentives is a blend of restricted shares and performance shares to replicate the form of awards forfeit.
The timing of the payouts will be no earlier than the awards forfeited, and all awards will be made in Compass shares with forward-looking performance conditions applying where appropriate: an award of performance shares worth 500,000 which will vest subject to Compass performance over the three year period ending 30September 2021 as assessed by the Remuneration Committee, against ROCE, AFCF and relative TSR performance targets as applied under the LTIP 2018 an award of restricted shares with a value at the date of grant of 1,120,000 anticipated to vest in three approximately equal tranches over the three financial years ending 30 September 2019-2021.
The majority of the award will also be subject to two financial underpins relating to Compass performance, which are i the maintenance of net debt: underlying EBITDA adjusted for M&A activity and changes to accounting standards and ii dividend at least in line with constant currency earnings per share compensation, to be delivered in Compass shares, for the loss of any 2018-2019 annual bonus equal in value to the actual bonus that would have been paid by the previous employer All net shares vesting must be retained until the Companys share ownership guidelines for executive directors have been met.
