At our 2017 AGM, shareholders approved our revised remuneration policy with 98% of votes cast in favour of the resolution.

We are not proposing any changestothe policy at this years AGM.
A significant proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration is provided as variable pay that rewards the achievement of stretching annual and long-term performance targets, which in turn are designed to ensure delivery of Pennons strategy and create shareholder value.
The relationship between our strategy, performance and the remuneration of our Executive Directors is summarised opposite onpage87.
On pages 91 to 101 we set out our annual report on remuneration The Committee appreciated our whichcontains the remuneration of the Directors for the year 2017 18. shareholders strong endorsement of the We also provide details of how our policy will be applied for 2018 19.

Half of the bonus is deferred and held as shares.
PRIORITIES ON PAGES 16 AND 17 Strong earnings growth was maintained across the Group and Pennon continued to make good progress towards delivering its long-term strategic priorities.
Group underlying profit before tax was 259 million, an increase of 3.5% compared with 2016 17.
Adjusted earnings per share EPS before deferred tax and non-underlying items was up 8.3% at 50.9p reflecting strong earnings from both South West Water and Viridor, supported by sector leading efficiencies in the water business and a full year increase in Viridors ERF operational capacity.
South West Waters cumulative return on regulated equity RoRE at 11.8% continues to lead the sector and Viridor generated EBITDA of 150.2 million during the year.
Our operational metrics incentivise our Executives to focus on the issues that really matter to our customers and other stakeholders.
In our water business, the year-end outturn has been affected by the extreme cold weather in early March 2018, which caused an increase in supply interruptions, and while South West Water met its Outcome Delivery Incentive ODI leakage target of 84 megalitres per day, it did not achieve the additional stretch target of 82 megalitres a day.
In the waste business, although the ERF portfolio performed strongly throughout the year, various headwinds, particularly around commodity pricing of paper, meant that the recycling action plan was not delivered in full.
Viridor increased its customer base from 31,990 customers in 2016 17 to 32,292 in 2017 18.
While personal targets amount to only 20% of overall performance, theExecutive Directors performed extremely well in 2017 18.
Their leadership and drive has resulted in excellent progress towards deliveryof our strategic priorities.
There have been many challenges and successes during the year and the resolution of our negotiations 86 PENNON GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 ontheGreater Manchester waste contract, which resulted in a positive Key remuneration decisions financial outcome and the preservation of our relationship with the For 2018 19, salaries for Executive Directors were increased by 2%, Authority, was a highlight for the team.

Long-term incentive plan outturn We are disappointed that the overall estimated outturn for awards vesting in 2018 under the old Performance and Co-investment Plan is zero.
This reflects that the Companys total shareholder return TSR forthe three-year performance period is anticipated to be below the comparator index performance and the median of the FTSE250, with the Companys share price having been affected by external market andpolitical considerations.
Martin D Angle In 2017 we were pleased that shareholders voted in favour of a new Remuneration Committee chairman long-term incentive plan, which has allowed us to move away from TSRand introduce a set of new performance measures that are alignedwith our strategic objectives.

The extent to which the awards will vest is subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions that were in place at the time the awards weremade: 50% of the award vests subject to the Companys TSR performance measured against an index made up of the following six listed comparator companies: National Grid Plc Sch Environnement Severn Trent Shanks Group Suez Environnement United Utilities The remaining 50% of the award vests subject to the Companys ranked TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
The calculation of TSR performance from the start of the performance period on 1 April 2015 to 9 May 2018 was undertaken by Deloitte LLP for the Committee.

For below threshold performance for either performance condition, 0% vests in respect of that performance condition.
As the calculation requires averaging TSR performance over the first three months of the performance period and comparing it to the average over the three months following the end of the performance period 1 April 2018 to 30 June 2018 the achievement and the outturn is an estimate at the date of calculation 9 May 2018.
Vesting of an award is also subject to the underpin described in the remuneration policy tables on page 89, which the Committee has determined to the date ofthis report would be satisfied, if any award was to vest.
Vested awards are subject to a two-year holding period during which clawback may be applied where the Committee considers it appropriate in certain circumstances.
The circumstances in which clawback may be applied are material misstatement or serious misconduct.
The holding period ends on 30June 2020.

This may be built up over a period of no more than five years.
