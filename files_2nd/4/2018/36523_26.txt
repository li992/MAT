Our remuneration framework is now aligned with typical UK practice.
During 2018 the CEO and Chairman exercised the final tranches of their 2015 LTIP awards.
As a result their beneficial shareholdings increased to 2.73m shares and 1.19m shares, respectively after selling sufficient shares to cover the exercise price and applicable taxes.
For the CEO, this translates into a beneficial shareholding of 1,936% of salary, creating substantial and continued alignment with shareholders.

The Committee aims to set stretching 91.5% of maximum.
The Committee reected on this outcome and targets that require strong outperformance for maximum vesting, yet assessed whether it was appropriate given GVCs wider performance, remain realistic in the context of the significant regulatory headwinds taking into account relevant considerations including progress we face during 2019.
The Committee recognises that the 2019 LTIP against environmental, social and governance ESG criteria including EPS targets are in absolute terms slightly below those for the 2018 responsible gambling.
The Committee was satisfied that 2018 was LTIP, but considers that in the current environment, and particularly another strong year for the Company, and as such there was no with implementation of the UK Triennial Review and Remote Gaming needto apply any discretionary adjustment to this outcome.

Our current Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders in December 2017, and we therefore expect to seek approval for a new CEO salary increase: The Ladbrokes Coral acquisition marked a Policy at our AGM in 2020.
We anticipate that we will review the current very material change in the size and scope of GVC.

These changes have led to a substantial increase in the complexity and responsibilities of the CEOs role.
The Committee recognises that executive pay remains an area of intense focus in the UK, and therefore did not take the decision to consider a change to the CEOs salary as a result of these developments lightly.
We were conscious though of the critical need to do the right thing for the long-term success of GVC, and to ensure that we retained the services of an individual who is widely considered to be a leading gure in the sector: is best-placed to navigate the Group through regulatory changes in the UK and elsewhere: and is able to take advantage of new international opportunities including the United States.

When setting Executive Directors remuneration, the Committee considered the remuneration arrangements of other senior managers and colleagues in the Group more generally to ensure that executive remuneration arrangements were appropriate in this context.
GVC undertakes an annual salary review and uses this opportunity to review remuneration in line with the market.
When determining salary increases for GVC, the Committee considers the outcome of the wider pay review for the Group.
In addition, pension arrangements for the Executive Directors are fully aligned with those for our wider workforce.
The Committee does not consult colleagues directly regarding Executive Directors remuneration.
However, the Company periodically seeks views of colleagues through employee forums and surveys in respect of their experience of working at GVC, including the structure of remuneration.
In light of the new UK Corporate Governance Code requirements, we plan in 2019, to review how we ensure that colleagues views ow into Board and Committee discussions.

In December the Committee reviewed the Groups plans for the annual salary review including proposals to harmonise the effective dates andapproach across the legacy Ladbrokes Coral and GVC businesses.
For 2019 it has been agreed that a uniform at percentage increase willbe applied to eligible colleagues, effective 1 January 2019.
In terms of pensions, Legacy Ladbrokes and Gala Coral dened benefit plans in the UK are well funded and GVC does not currently need tomake deficit payments.
Legislation requires all UK employers to enrol automatically eligible employees into a qualifying pension scheme.
In 2019 there will be significant pension communications with UK colleagues relating to further changes in the minimum contribution rates and any re-enrolment of Ladbrokes Coral colleagues who have opted out.
Review of all employee incentives During 2018 the Committee reviewed the Groups all-employee incentive arrangements.
At the start of 2019, the Group has implemented changes to its discretionary annual bonus plan as part of the harmonisation of incentives following the Ladbrokes Coral acquisition.
The changes will simplify the arrangements, increase transparency and strengthen the link between financial performance and pay-out.
The design of plans has been aligned, as far as possible, with those for the Executive Directors to ensure consistency across the organisation and delivery of strategic goals.
In establishing a harmonised approach, GVC has sought to: Retain a focus on local performance, with pay-out in part linked to divisional profitability: Pivot to underlying EBITDA GVC previously used NGR as the all-employee bonus plan measure.
The Committee had considered whetherto include non-financial measures.
Although it will keep this under review over the coming years, at this stage the primary focus was to keep the plan structure simple: and Harmonise pay-out curves across the businesses, moving to 25% being payable for threshold performance and 100% for stretchperformance.
Gender pay gap reporting The UK Government introduced new reporting regulations under the Equality Act 2010 requiring companies with over 250 employees to disclose their gender pay gap annually from April 2017.
2018 is the first year that GVC has had a requirement to publish its results.
The report for the year ending 5 April 2018 together with contextual information and detail on the initiatives we have underway to close our gender pay gap, can be viewed on the Corporate website.
Our median hourly pay difference between male and female colleagues is 2.9%.
This compares favourably with the UK median pay gap of 17.9%across all sectors source: Ofce for National Statistics, October 2018.
However, we wanted to understand whats driving our pay gap andunderstand what we can do to improve it.
As a result of this work, it is clear that the gap is largely a function of lower female representation atour senior levels.
We recognise this and are challenging ourselves to change this over time.
Our median bonus pay gap is 25.0%, which is primarily due to a higher proportion of males at the higher grades and higher bonus levels.

The Committee has always sought to balance the views we have heard from shareholders with the clear need to appropriately reward and retain our successful management team.
Since the June 2018 vote, the Company Chairman and the Senior Independent Director have conducted a corporate governance roadshow witha number of our largest institutional shareholders, at which we had a frank and open discussion on remuneration at GVC.
These discussions highlighted that shareholders primary concern centred on legacy arrangements for the CEO and Chairman.
These arrangements are now fully vested and do not form part of our ongoing Remuneration Policy, which is aligned with UK best practice expectations.
Priorities for 2019 Specic priorities for the Committee in 2019, in addition to its usual scheduled activities, will be: Overseeing progress made under the harmonisation of remuneration across the Group following the acquisition of Ladbrokes Coral: and Considering any further steps which are required to respond to the new UK Corporate Governance Code, including our approach to post-employment shareholding requirements.
94 GOVERNANCE CONTINUED REMUNERATION: DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2018 Single gure remuneration table audited The remuneration of Directors showing the breakdown between components with comparative gures for the prior Financial Year is shown below.
Figures provided have been calculated in accordance with Regulations.
Further information on the component elements is provided in subsequent sections.
The Committee recognises that the single gures of total remuneration shown for the Chairman and CEO are substantial.
These primarily relate to legacy awards made under the 2015 LTIP at the time of the acquisition of bwin.
party, coupled with our strong share price performance over the vesting period.
Our new policy framework will result in signicantly lower levels of total remuneration from 2019 onwards.
2017 gures were previously reported in euros and have been converted into sterling using an average 2017 rate of 1.13452.
Norbert Teufelberger, Paul Miles, Will Whitehorn and Karl Diacono stepped down as Directors on 2 February, 29 March, 6 June and 21 December 2018 respectively.
Virginia McDowell and Pierre Bouchut were appointed Directors on 6 June and 13 September 2018 respectively.
Paul Bowtell was appointed a Director on 29 March 2018.
The above table shows his GVC Holdings PLC remuneration which became effective from 1 April 2018.
GVC Holdings PLC | Annual Report 2018 95 Notes to the single gure remuneration table 1.
Kenneth Alexanders salary was increased on 15 June 2018 from 750,000 to 950,000, of which 800,000 is eligible to be used for the purposes of calculating incentive opportunities.
As outlined in the 2017 Directors Remuneration Report, Paul Bowtells salary comprises a salary of 656,000, of which 535,500 is eligible to be used for the purposes of calculating incentive opportunities, with the additional 120,500 reecting the pension provision which he used to receive in the role at Ladbrokes Coral.
Lee Feldmans fee for 2017 included an additional one-off fee of 950,000 which post tax had to be invested in GVC shares which are subject to forfeiture.
The forfeiture risk on 50% of the shares falls away on the second anniversary of payment and on the balance on the third anniversary.
Executive Directors taxable benets include private medical and life insurance.
Paul Bowtell received a car allowance of 12,500 p. a. as provided under his previous Ladbrokes Coral contract and Kenneth Alexander received a housing allowance of 30,000 p. a. and reimbursement of certain travel expenses incurred in undertaking his duties as a Director.
The table above includes these expenses and the taxcontribution restated for 2017.
Executive Directors annual bonuses in respect of 2018 performance are delivered 50% in cash and 50% in deferred shares.
Moreinformation on the performance measure used to determine the bonus level is set out below.
The single gure table includes the value of any legacy 2015 LTIP share option arrangements which have vested while the individual was a Director of GVC Holdings PLC.
During the year ending 31 December 2018, share awards granted under legacy arrangements vested as shown below.

To compensate for the higher exercise price, the Company agreed to pay him a cash bonus equivalent to the difference between 4.67 and 4.22, payable over the vesting period.
In 2018 he received a cash bonus of 659,855 and this amount has been included in the single gure table above.
L Feldman is required to invest half of the cash bonus after taxes into GVC shares.
The rules of the option granted to P Miles provided for the strike price to be adjusted to take account of dividends paid in the vesting period, so the effective exercise price of this option was 3.67.
96 GOVERNANCE CONTINUED REMUNERATION: DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2018 2018 Annual bonus plan Target setting Consistent with the statement made in last years Directors Remuneration Report, the CEO and CFOs 2018 annual bonus plan targets were set as soon as practicable following the completion of the acquisition of Ladbrokes Coral.
The Committee considered that underlying EBITDA remained the most appropriate measure of financial performance for the Company, consistent with 2017 and with the intention expressed in the December 2017 General Meeting notice.
The targets set out below were calibrated by reference to a internal forecasts covering the enlarged group and b analyst consensus forecasts which were issued following the publication of GVCs trading update and historic proforma nancials on 25 May 2018.
Threshold Target Stretch Underlying EBITDA m 722.5 741 759.5 Variance from target 97.5% 102.5% Indicative bonus pay-out as a % of entitlement 25% 60% 100% Underlying EBITDA, and excluding joint ventures.
The target range was considered appropriate for 2018 given that the targets were formally set part way through the year following the completion of the Ladbrokes Coral acquisition, and as soon as a consensus view had formed following the transaction.
The range takes into account the acquisition of a significant business and ongoing market and regulatory headwinds.
Year-end assessment of performance At the end of 2018, the Committee reviewed the Groups financial performance and the achievement against strategic priorities.
The following table summarises the outcome of the Committees decision.
Kenneth Alexanders salary was increased from 750,000 to 950,000 on 15 June.
However, the salary which is applicable for incentive purposes was restricted to 800,000 2.
Paul Miles was eligible for a Directors annual bonus for the period he served as an Executive Director i. e. three months.
Paul Bowtell was eligible for a Directors annual bonus for the period he served as an Executive Director i. e. nine months.
2018 bonuses are delivered 50% in cash and 50% in shares deferred for three years.
Deferred share awards shall be granted in March 2019.
In accordance with the bonus plan rules, thenumber of shares under each deferred award shall be calculated based on the three-month average share price ending on 31 December 2018, which was 813.54p.
The Committee carefully considered the proposed outcome in the context of GVCs underlying financial, operational and strategic progress during 2018.
Taking all factors into account, including the individual performance of the Executive Directors, the Committee considered that the mechanical outcome under the annual bonus was reasonable and supportable within this context and decided that no upwards or downwards discretion was required.
GVC Holdings PLC | Annual Report 2018 97 2018 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Selection of measures and calibration of the targets The 2018 Committee determined that the 2018 LTIP should be based on the same measures as in 2017, being cumulative EPS and relative total shareholder return TSR.
The former represents a key financial indicator of performance for GVC, while the latter reects our returns to shareholders over the period.
Measure Weighting Target Vesting Cumulative earnings per share EPS 50% 191 pence 25% 224 pence 100% Straight line interpolation between the two points Relative Total Shareholder Return TSR vs FTSE 51-150 50% Equal to median 25% Upper quartile or 100% higher Straight line Median to Upper interpolation quartile between the two points In setting appropriately stretching EPS targets, the Committee reviews internal forecasts, consensus, and analyst guidance.
Ordinarily, the Committee would look to set targets in Q1 of the financial year.
However, given the size and impact of the Ladbrokes Coral acquisition on the business, it took time for financial forecasts for the enlarged group to be nalised and for market consensus to emerge in July 2018.
At that point, there still remained significant uncertainty around the timing and content of UK Government decisions regarding xed odds betting terminals FOBT and UK gaming tax RGD, which represented a step-change in regulation for the group.
The Committee anchored the targets against the summer 2018 internal and external forecasts but took the decision to wait until Q4 2018 to nalise the targets, when it was able to make a mechanical adjustment for the Governments final decision in November 2018 on the TR and RGD implementation date 1 April 2019 and tax rate 21% versus prior consensus assumptions of January 2020 and 20% respectively.
The adjustment resulted in a final target range for the cumulative EPS element of the 2018 award of 191 pence to 224 pence.
These targets are designed to be challenging but realistic, within the context of the Groups financial plan, strategic priorities and the outlook for our markets.
The EPS targets were materially higher than those set for the 2017 LTIP 180 cents to 214 cents, demonstrating continued growth expectations despite a number of regulatory challenges.
Relative TSR is measured against the FTSE 51150 previously FTSE 250 for the 2017 LTIP.
Inevitably there are several factors which cannot be known at the time targets are originally set and could impact the 2018 LTIP.
These factors might include the impact of corporate activity, material regulatory or tax changes, joint ventures and accounting changes.
In each case the Committee retains discretion whether and, if so, how a to adjust targets post grant and or b to take impact into account when determining performance outcome.

GVC Holdings PLC | Annual Report 2018 99 CEO pay versus Group performance Summary of performance The graph below shows the value of 100 invested in GVC Holdings PLC since obtaining main market listing on 1 February 2016 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE 250 index and the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Index.
The FTSE 250 index has been chosen on the basis that GVC was still part of the index at the start of 2018 and only became a constituent of the FTSE 100 in September 2018. significant regulatory headwinds in the second half of 2018 impacted the UK gaming sector and led to a fall in our share price.
Despite the challenges, it is reassuring that our shares continued to out-perform our gaming sector peer group over this time.

The percentage changes for the CEO have been determined as follows: a salary: the percentage change in salary paid in sterling in 2017 and 2018: b benets: taxable benets as set outinthe single gure table: and c bonus: the difference in the payout as a percentage of the maximum 100%.
The CEOs annual salary increased to 950,000 on 15 June 2018 reecting his increased responsibilities and scope of role following the Ladbrokes Coral acquisition.
There has beennochange in eligibility for the CEOs core benets such as life, medical and housing between 2017 and 2018, with the above percentage change relating to premium increases.

The awards vest after three years subject to the following performance conditions and are subject to two year holding period post vest.
GVC Holdings PLC | Annual Report 2018 101 The Committee reviewed the appropriate performance metrics for the 2019 bonus plan.
Underlying EBITDA was considered to remain the most appropriate profit metric, with the benefit of simplicity during a period of reward harmonisation across the enlarged group.
However, the Committee determined that, given the level of debt post the Ladbrokes Coral acquisition and investor focus on leverage ratios net debt underlying EBITDA, net debt should also be included as a second financial performance measure.
As a result, the annual bonus will be based onunderlying EBITDA 70% and net debt 30%.
The annual bonus target range takes into account the Groups annual financial plan and its priorities, in the context of the economic and regulatory environment, together with analyst consensus forecasts.
The Committee considers such targets to be commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Group to disclose them before the end of the year.
The Committee considered that underlying cumulative EPS and relative TSR remain the most appropriate measures for the 2019 LTIP.
There are no changes proposed to the relative TSR measure.
The Committee carefully considered the positioning of the underlying cumulative EPS targets for the 2019 award.
It is recognised that the range of 184 pence to 214 pence is about 4% lower than the range set for the 2018 LTIP.
The Committee is of the view that in the current environment, and particularly with implementation of the UK TR and RGD in April 2019, these targets represent at least an equivalent stretch to those set in prior years.
The targets will require management to deliver strong underlying growth and achieve ambitious published targets for TR mitigation and Ladbrokes Coral acquisition synergies.
As for the 2018 award, the 2019 targets do not include earnings from the Groups US joint venture as it is too early for the Committee to sensibly judge the way in which US markets will open up for the Group, and how soon.
If necessary the Committee may apply discretion at the end of the LTIP period to take into account the Groups performance in this important new market.
Measure Weighting Target Vesting Cumulative earnings per share EPS 50% 184 pence 25% 214 pence 100% Straight line interpolation between the two pts Relative Total Shareholder Return vs FTSE 51-150 50% Equal to median 25% Upper quartile 100% orhigher Straight line Median to Upper interpolation between quartile the two pts Shareholdings and share interests audited Executive Directors are required to maintain a shareholding as determined by the Committee.
Executive Directors are expected to build up theirshareholding over a period of five years from the date of appointment as an Executive Director or, if later, from the date of any change to theterms of the shareholding requirement.
Shares that count towards the requirement are beneficially owned shares and any vested share awards subject to a holding period.
The current shareholding requirements are: Group Chief Executive: 4x base salary.
Chief Financial officer: 2x base salary.
The Committee plans to adopt a formal post-termination Executive Directors shareholding policy during 2019.
Executive Directors already have some interest after a departure by virtue of: a the requirement to defer 50% of the annual bonus in shares, and b the application of a two-year LTIP holding period post vesting.
A Director afforded eligible leaver status would continue to have alignment with shareholders for an extended period post-departure through their existing awards.
During 2018 the CEO and Chairman exercised their 2015 LTIP awards, selling only sufficient shares to cover the award exercise price and applicable taxes.
As a result, their beneficial shareholdings increased by 0.83 million shares and 0.45 million shares, to 2.73 million shares and1.19m million shares respectively.
As at 31 December 2018 the value of the CEOs and Chairmans shareholdings were 18.4m and 8.0m respectively, representing 1,936% of the CEOs annual salary and 2,286% of the Chairmans annual fee.
These shareholdings demonstrate thatthe CEO and Chairmans interests are closely aligned with those of GVCs shareholders.
