A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 51 Directors Remuneration Report continued Annual report on remuneration continued Annual bonus The maximum annual bonus award opportunity for each executive director in respect of the year ended 27 January 2018 was 100% of salary, with 80% of the bonus assessed against the achievement of profit before tax, excluding exceptional items, compared against a set of profit targets including a threshold and maximum level, and 20% based on non-financial strategic measures.
The executive directors earned a total of 903,000 as annual bonus for the year, representing 78% of R. A.
Whites, S. Lorimers and J. D. Kemps salary and 74% of A. L. Memmotts salary.
The target for the proportion of the annual bonus based on profit before tax and performance against that target is set out in the table below.
50% of this element of the bonus could be earned for on-target performance with zero paid for threshold performance and a broadly linear scale through to full payment of this element of the bonus for performance at or above the maximum target.
Maximum Threshold Maximum Actual percentage Actual percentage target On target target performance of bonus of bonus Profit before tax excluding exceptional items 42.0m 43.0m 45.0m 44.1m 80% 62% Non-financial strategic measures account for 20% of the bonus and targets were set around the Companys key areas of strategic focus.
White, these targets focused on the implementation of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy, brand development and innovation, the corporate structure, internal communication and engagement, and corporate development.
Following strong progress across these targets, the Remuneration Committee considered it appropriate to pay a bonus equal to 16% of salary to R. A.
For the other executive directors, their non-financial strategic measure targets focused on areas including brand innovation, enhanced operational effectiveness, improved supply chain efficiency and further development of the Groups strategic, planning and budgeting processes.
The Remuneration Committee assessed progress against the strategic targets for each of the other executive directors and considered it appropriate to pay a bonus of 16% of salary to S. Lorimer and J. D. Kemp and 12% of salary to A. L. Memmott.
Annual bonus for 2018 19 For the 2018 19 financial year, an element of the annual bonus 20% of basic salary will continue to be assessed against strategic measures to align the reward structure with key strategic priorities and to encourage behaviours which facilitate profitable growth and the future development of the business.
The remainder of the annual bonus will continue to be assessed against growth in Group profit before tax excluding exceptional items.
Performance targets will be set at challenging levels in a similar manner to those of previous years, with 50% of this element of the annual bonus being earned for on-target performance.
The actual performance targets are not disclosed as they are considered to be commercially sensitive at this time and should therefore remain confidential to the Company.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to disclose how the bonus earned relates to performance against the targets on a retrospective basis.
No changes are proposed to the maximum annual bonus opportunity which will remain at 100% of salary.

With the exception of S. Lorimer, executive directors were granted ESOS awards in the form of market value options under the HMRC tax-efficient section of the ESOS.
These ESOS awards were subject to the same performance measures as the LTIP awards and therefore 1,914 of the 4,784 ESOS awards granted vested for each of the executive directors.
The LTIP awards were scaled back by the amount equal to the gain on exercise of the ESOS awards and therefore the total pre-tax value delivered to the executive directors remained unchanged.

The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that all advice received was objective and independent.
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
Deloitte was appointed as external auditor in May 2017.
This prompted the Remuneration Committee to review the services provided by Deloitte as advisers to the Remuneration Committee.
Following consultation with the Board, and consideration of the self-review, self-interest and management threats to independence, the Remuneration Committee concluded that Deloitte should be retained as advisers to the Remuneration Committee.
As Deloitte are external auditor to the Company, Deloittes advice to the Remuneration Committee is governed by certain guidelines and safeguards.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to review the objectivity and independence of this engagement, having regard to the non-audit services policy of the Group.

set at a level that reflects market conditions and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration knowledge and expertise.
Fees are set at a level which reflects the skill, knowledge and experience of the individual, whilst taking into account appropriate market data.
The Board is responsible for setting the fees of the other non-executive directors.
Fees may include a basic fee and additional fees for further responsibilities for example, chairmanship of Board committees and senior independent directorship.
Fees are set taking into account several factors, including the size and complexity of the business, appropriate market data and the expected time commitment and contribution for the role.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Companys share schemes or bonus schemes nor do they receive any pension contributions.
Non-executive directors may be eligible to receive benefits such as the use of secretarial support, travel costs or other benefits that may be appropriate.
Actual fee levels are disclosed in the Directors annual remuneration report for the relevant financial year.
Explanation of performance metrics chosen and the target setting process Performance measures are selected that are aligned to the Companys strategy.
Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual bonus and LTIP awards.
When setting these performance targets, the Remuneration Committee will take into account a number of different reference points, which may include the Companys business plans and strategy and the market environment.
Full payment or vesting will only occur for what the Remuneration Committee considers to be stretching performance.
The annual bonus performance targets have been selected to provide an appropriate balance between incentivising directors to meet financial targets for the year and achieving strategic and or personal objectives.
The LTIP performance targets reflect the Companys strategic objectives and therefore the financial and strategic decisions which ultimately determine the success of the Company.
The LTIP performance measures may be based on key financial and or strategic and or total shareholder return related measures.
LTIP performance is currently based solely on Earnings Per Share, which is a key measure of the Companys profitability.
The Remuneration Committee retains the ability to adjust or set different performance measures if events occur such as a change in strategy, a material acquisition and or a divestment of a Group business or a change in prevailing market conditions which cause the Remuneration Committee to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that they achieve their original purpose.
Awards and options may be adjusted in the event of a variation of share capital in accordance with the scheme rules.
Policy for the remuneration of employees generally Remuneration arrangements are determined throughout the Group based on the same principle that reward should be achieved for delivery of the business strategy and should be sufficient to attract and retain high calibre talent.
Under the rules of the ESOS and the LTIP, certain managers are eligible to participate in the ESOS and the LTIP: however there has been no such participation to date and there is no current intention to invite managers to do so.
The annual bonus arrangements for the senior management team are similar to those for the executive directors in that targets are set annually dependent on financial and or non-financial performance metrics.
The key principles of the remuneration philosophy are applied consistently across the Group below this level, taking account of the seniority of employees.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 67 Directors Remuneration Report continued Directors Remuneration Policy continued Approach to recruitment remuneration The policy aims to facilitate the appointment of individuals of sufficient calibre to lead the business and execute the strategy effectively for the benefit of shareholders.
When appointing a new director, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of the Company and in line with market practice.
The Remuneration Committee will take into consideration a number of relevant factors, which may include the calibre of the individual, the candidates existing remuneration package, and the specific circumstances of the individual including the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited.
The Remuneration Committee will typically seek to align the remuneration package with the Companys Remuneration Policy as set out in the policy table.
The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted excluding buy-out awards referred to below is 300% of salary in line with this policy.
Subject to this overall maximum variable remuneration, incentive awards will only be granted above the normal maximum annual award opportunities where the Remuneration Committee considers there to be a commercial rationale, which may include but is not limited to circumstances where an executive director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus and or LTIP award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance.
The quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may be transferred to the subsequent year so that reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis.
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that any such awards are linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance targets and will be forfeited if performance or continued employment conditions are not achieved.
The Remuneration Committee may also alter the performance measures, performance period and vesting period of the bonus and or LTIP award, if the Remuneration Committee determines that the circumstances of the recruitment merit such alteration.
The rationale would be clearly explained in the Directors Remuneration Report following grant.
The individual will move over time onto a remuneration package that is consistent with the normal maximum annual bonus and LTIP award opportunities set out in the policy table.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to include other remuneration components or awards which are outside the specific terms of the policy but subject to the limit on variable remuneration to facilitate the hiring of candidates of an appropriate calibre, where the Remuneration Committee believes there is a need to do so in the best interests of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee would ensure that awards within the 300% of salary variable remuneration limit are linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee will not use this discretion to make a non-performance related incentive payment for example a golden hello.
In some circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may make payments or awards to recognise or buy-out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
The Remuneration Committee will normally aim to do so broadly on a like-for-like basis, taking into account a number of relevant factors regarding the forfeited arrangements which may include the form of award, any performance conditions attached to the awards and the time at which they would have vested.
These payments or awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above, however the Remuneration Committees intention is that the value awarded would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements.
Where considered appropriate, such payments or awards will be liable to malus and or clawback on early departure.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under the Companys existing share plans.
If necessary, and subject to the limits referred to above, recruitment awards may be granted outside of these plans as currently permitted under the Listing Rules which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, the recruitment of an executive director.
Where a position is fulfilled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue according to the original terms.
Where necessary, the Company will pay appropriate relocation, travel and subsistence costs.
The Remuneration Committee will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary.
Fees payable to a newly-appointed Chairman or non-executive director will be in line with the fee policy in place at the time of appointment.

A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 69 Directors Remuneration Report continued Directors Remuneration Policy continued Service contracts Executive directors contracts are on a rolling basis and may be terminated on 12 months notice by the Company or on 6 months notice by the executive.
Service contracts for new directors will generally be limited to 12 months notice by the Company.
In line with the Remuneration Policy approved at the 2014 AGM, service contracts entered into prior to this date provide for a notice period of 12 months except during the six months following either a takeover of or by the Company or a Company reconstruction.
Under these conditions and certain circumstances the executive directors are entitled to a liquidated damages payment equal to the executive directors basic salary at termination plus the value of all contractual benefits for a two year period.
In the event this liquidated damages payment is triggered, the executive director will also be deemed to be a good leaver for the purposes of the Companys share schemes.
Given the size of the Company and the sector dynamics at the time the directors were recruited, the Remuneration Committee considered this provision appropriate in order to attract and retain high calibre executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee is cognisant of the fact that these provisions do not reflect best practice.
It has therefore previously considered the alternatives available to exit these contractual arrangements, including contractual buy-out.
However, the Remuneration Committee concluded that it was not feasible to place a value on these rights, in order to remove them from the contracts, which would be acceptable to both parties.
It therefore determined that the most appropriate approach would be to maintain the legacy provisions, however for all future appointments after the approval of the 2014 Remuneration Policy these provisions have not and will not apply.
S. Lorimers service contract does not therefore include the legacy provisions.
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders in accordance with the Code.
Their appointments are terminable by either the Company or the directors themselves upon three months notice without compensation.
Payments for loss of office The principles on which the determination of payments for loss of office will be approached are set out below: Policy Payment in Payments to executive directors upon termination of their service contracts will be equal to 12 months base salary or the lieu of notice highest annual rate earned by the executive during the preceding three years, whichever is higher plus benefits in kind and pension contributions at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Annual Bonus This will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an individual basis and the decision as to whether or not to award a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon a number of factors, including the circumstances of the individuals departure and their contribution to the business during the bonus period in question.
Any bonus amounts paid will typically be pro-rated for time in service to termination and will, subject to performance, be paid at the usual time.
LTIP The extent to which any award under the LTIP will vest would be determined based on the leaver provisions contained within the LTIP rules.
The Remuneration Committee shall determine when awards vest in accordance with those provisions.
Awards will normally lapse if the participant leaves employment before vesting.
However, awards may vest in good leaver circumstances, including death, disability, ill-health, injury, sale of the participants employer, or any other reason determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Any good leaver awards will vest at the date of cessation of employment unless the Remuneration Committee decides they should vest at the normal vesting date.
In either case, the extent to which an award vests will be determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, the period of time that has elapsed from the date of grant to the date of cessation of employment.
The Remuneration Committee may vest the award on any other basis if it believes there are exceptional circumstances which warrant that.
Options are exercisable for six months from leaving employment or six months from the normal vesting date as appropriate.
Change of control Awards under the LTIP will generally vest early on a takeover, merger or other corporate reorganisation.
The Remuneration Committee will determine the level of vesting taking account of performance conditions and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, pro-rating for time, where applicable.
Alternatively, participants may be allowed or required to exchange their awards for awards over shares in the acquiring company.
Awards under all employee share schemes will be expected to vest on a change of control and those which have to meet specific requirements to benefit from permitted tax benefits will vest in accordance with those requirements.
Mitigation The executive directors service contracts do not provide for any reduction in payments for mitigation or for early payment.
Other payments Payments may be made under the Companys all employee share plans which are governed by HMRC tax-advantaged plan rules and which cover certain leaver provisions.
There is no discretionary treatment of leavers under these plans.
In appropriate circumstances, payments may also be made in respect of accrued holiday, outplacement and legal fees.
Where a buy-out award is made under the Listing Rules then the leaver provisions would be determined at the time of the award.
70 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a directors office or employment.
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will recognise and balance the interests of shareholders and the departing executive director, as well as the interests of the remaining directors.
Where the Remuneration Committee retains discretion it will be used to provide flexibility in certain situations, taking into account the particular circumstances of the directors departure and performance.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company The Remuneration Committee generally considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company when considering the executive directors remuneration.
When considering base salary increases, the Remuneration Committee reviews overall levels of base pay increases offered to other employees.
Employees are not actively consulted on directors remuneration.
The Company has regular contact with union bodies on matters of pay and remuneration for employees covered by collective bargaining or consultation arrangements.
Existing contractual arrangements The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office outside the policy in this report: where the terms of the payment were agreed before the policy came into effect: where the terms of the payment were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the payment was not in consideration of the individual becoming a director of the Company: or to satisfy contractual commitments under legacy remuneration arrangements.
For these purposes, the term payments includes the satisfaction of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
The Remuneration Committee may make minor changes to this policy which do not have a material advantage to directors, to aid in its operation or implementation, taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek shareholder approval.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views The Remuneration Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with shareholders and welcomes feedback on executive and non-executive directors remuneration.
Shareholder guidelines In order to further align the executive directors long term interests with those of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has updated its share ownership guidelines applicable from 2017 18.
The guidelines require that, with effect from 2017 18, executive directors retain all shares acquired under Company sponsored share plans and retain half of any bonus pay-out after tax to purchase shares in the Company until the value of their shareholding is equal to 125% of gross basic salary.
