Similarly, no increase is proposed for Heath Drewett.
The Committee intends to next review the salaries of both these Executive Directors in December 2019, to take effect from January 2020.
Pensions and bene ts Pensions and bene ts will continue in line with policy.

Consistent with the new Corporate Governance Code, the Committee has amended the plan rules to ensure that it has appropriate discretion to reduce any formulaic result if it concludes that it is not appropriate in all the circumstances.
We have not disclosed full details of the single personal strategic objective for the Executive Directors or the financial targets in this report, as we consider them to be commercially sensitive.
It is, however, our intention to disclose retrospectively these financial targets in next years annual report on remuneration.
Long-term Incentive Plan The Committee approved the grant of 2019 LTIP awards to Executive Directors with a face value of 250% of salary with the same performance targets as the 2018 awards - 50% EPS of 5-12% per annum aggregate measurement basis and 50% ROCE of 15-22% final year measurement.
Awards are expected to be granted in April 2019.
As with the annual bonus, consistent with the new Corporate Governance Code, the Committee has amended the plan rules to ensure that it has appropriate discretion to reduce any formulaic result if it concludes that it is not appropriate in all the circumstances.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 65 REMUNERATION CONTINUED Annual remuneration statement continued Our Remuneration Committee Determining the remuneration for the Executive Directors and Executive Committee members is a key focus of the Committee.
The Committee oversees Aggrekos overall remuneration policy, strategy and implementation to ensure that the policy is aligned with the key objectives of growing earnings and delivering a strong return on capital employed.
Environmental, social and governance ESG factors are considered when assessing the personal element of the Executive Directors performance and the Committee is satis ed that the design of the incentive plans does not pose undue ESG risks.
The Remuneration Committee is currently made up of four Independent Non-executive Directors, including Barbara Jeremiah as Chair of the Committee.
Peter Kennerley is Secretary to the Committee.
We also invite the Chief Executive Of cer, Group HR Director and Group Director of Reward to attend our meetings.
The Chairman and the Executives are not present when their personal remuneration is discussed.
In 2018, we held four meetings of the Committee.
Ian Marchant was unable to attend one meeting owing to a pre-existing arrangement but was able to share his views with the Committee Chair.
We also took a number of decisions based on papers circulated outside the context of a formal meeting.
Our role is as follows: Determine and agree with the Board the policy for remuneration for the Chairman, Executive Directors and Executive Committee.
Within the terms of the remuneration policy, determine the total individual remuneration package for the Chairman, each Executive Director and each member of the Executive Committee including the Secretary, including base salary, pension, bene ts, annual bonus and long-term incentives.
Determine, having taken appropriate advice, the level of any payment made to the Chairman who is not present at such discussions, Executive Directors or members of the Executive Committee by way of compensation for, or otherwise in connection with, loss of of ce or employment.
Approve the design of, and determine targets for, performance-related pay schemes operated by the Company and approve the total annual payments made under such schemes.
Review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders.
For any plan, determine each year the overall amount of awards, along with the individual awards to Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee.
In the case of any retention or new joiner awards to employees below the Executive Committee, retrospectively approve awards.
Review the pay and other main terms of employment of employees more generally.
Determine the policy for and scope of pension arrangements for each Executive Director and members of the Executive Committee.
Oversee any major changes in employee bene ts structures throughout the Group.
Agree the policy for authorising claims for expenses from the Directors.
In the following section of our report, we explain how we have implemented Aggrekos remuneration policy during 2018.
The policy in place for the year was the one which was approved by shareholders at Aggrekos 2018 Annual General Meeting, a summary of which is set out on pages 77 to 79.
The full policy is available on the Companys website: www.
com Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 66 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Annual report on remuneration Single total gure of remuneration Executive Directors audited The table below sets out a single gure for the total remuneration received by each Executive Director for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017.
2 As set out on page 80 of our Annual Report 2017, Heath Drewett received an amount of 320,000 to partially compensate him for his annual bonus from his previous employer he forfeited as a result of his resignation.
Heath Drewett also received an amount of 429,681 to compensate him for the repayment of a retention award all of the after-tax amount was repaid to his former employer.
The amount was subject to clawback in full on resignation in the first 12 months of employment.
Also, Heath Drewett was granted an award of shares on 3 May 2018 to compensate him for the forfeiture of unvested non-performance shares from his previous employer subject to his continued employment only and due to vest in August 2020.
The face value is based on the average share price over the last quarter of 2018 of 788.5 pence.
The gures have been calculated as follows: Base salary: amount earned for the year.
Bene ts: the taxable value of bene ts received in the year.
Annual bonus: the total bonus earned on performance during the year.
See Annual bonus scheme on pages 68 and 69.
No LTIPs vested in relation to the 2018 final performance.
Sharesave: the value is based on the market price of an Aggreko share on the date of grant, less the option price, multiplied by the number of options.
Pension: the amount of any Company pension contributions and cash in lieu.
Chris Weston and Heath Drewett both received payment entirely in cash.
Total aggregate emoluments for Executive and Non-executive Directors were 4.34 million in 2018.
Additional disclosures in respect of the single total gure of remuneration table Base salary The base salaries for Executive Directors as at 1 January 2019 and 1 January 2018 were as follows: 1 1 January 2019 Increase 1 January 2018 Executive Director Position % Chris Weston Chief Executive Of cer 750,000 0 750,000 2 Heath Drewett Chief Financial Of cer 460,000 0 460,000 1 The average increase across the Group for 2018 was 4.9%.

Bonus payments are payable as to 75% in cash, and as to 25% deferred into shares for three years.
The Committee has discretion to reduce the number of shares that can vest in the event of gross misconduct, material misstatement of the accounts or any other circumstances or events which arise which the Committee considers to be suf ciently exceptional to justify the operation of malus clawback.
The targets under the 2018 annual bonus scheme were based as to 80% on financial performance measures set against the annual budget at the start of the year and as to 20% against personal strategic objectives.
Financial performance measures The financial objectives for the Chief Executive Of cer Chris Weston and Chief Financial Of cer Heath Drewett were measured against D-EPS.
For the financial measure, they start to earn a bonus at threshold performance, calculated as a percentage below budget, increasing to half of the maximum that could be earned under that element at budget on a straight-line basis.
The bonus would then increase on a straight-line basis to the maximum, calculated as a percentage above budget.

No performance shares will be awarded against this element if performance is below an equivalent of RPI 3% per annum growth.
Awards will then start to vest above that level and will increase straight-line to a maximum at an equivalent of RPI 15% per annum growth: and 25% of the award is based on average ROCE over the performance period in a range of 20% to 25%.
No performance shares will be awarded against this element if performance is less than 20% and awards will increase on a straight-line basis to the maximum at 25% ROCE.
The performance period for the 2016 LTIP awards ended on 31 December 2018.
Over the period: Aggrekos aggregate D-EPS was 165.1 pence.
Since the threshold of growth of RPI 3% was not achieved, no shares will vest under this performance measure: and Aggrekos actual average ROCE for the period was 11.3%.
Since this was less than the threshold of 20%, no shares will vest under this performance measure.
As a result, all 2016 LTIP awards lapsed in full.

Whether the award ultimately delivers value will depend on the extent to which the performance targets are met over the following three years and to which a further two year holding period is met.
In May 2018, Chris Weston and Heath Drewett were granted awards of shares under the 2015 Long-term Incentive Plan the LTIP, with a value equivalent to 250% of salary.
The three-year performance period over which D-EPS will be measured began on 1 January 2018 and will end on 31 December 2020.
ROCE will be measured on a final year basis in 2020.
None of the awards granted under the LTIP are eligible to vest until 3 May 2021.
The performance criteria for the LTIP awards granted in 2018 are as follows: 50% of the award is based on three-year cumulative EPS.
No performance shares will be awarded against this element if performance is below an equivalent of 5% per annum growth.
If performance is equivalent to 5% per annum growth, 25% of the award will vest.
Vesting will increase straight-line to a maximum at an equivalent of 12% per annum growth: and 50% of the award is based on final year ROCE 2020 in a range of 15% to 22%.
No performance shares will be awarded against this element if performance is less than 15%.
If performance is equivalent to 15% ROCE, 25% of the award will vest and awards will increase on a straight-line basis to the maximum at 22% ROCE.
Shares which vest will be subject to a further holding period of two years in accordance with the rules of the LTIP.
In addition, 25% of the 2017 bonus payment for Chris Weston was deferred into shares under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
These shares will be released three years from date of grant.
Also, as explained on page 80 of our Annual Report 2017, the Committee made awards to Heath Drewett on 3 May 2018 under restricted stock agreements to compensate him for the forfeiture of variable awards from his previous employment.
The two awards were determined as follows: an award of 89,311 shares with a face value of 701,986 subject to the same conditions as the 2018 LTIP detailed above and due to vest on 1 April 2021: and an award of 29,770 shares with a face value of 233,995, subject to his continuing employment on vesting or otherwise if he leaves as a good leaver, and due to vest on 10 August 2020.

Dividends are the interim and final dividends paid in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2017 and the interim dividend paid and the final dividend recommended in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2018.
The total employee pay increase is mainly due to the higher bonus payments, due to bonus targets being achieved in some parts of the business.
