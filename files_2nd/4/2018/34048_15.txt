BCA Marketplace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 59 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION continued Long-term incentive scheme the H. I. J. scheme The H. I. J. scheme was exercised in full on 18 December 2017, when all participants exercised their rights under that scheme having satisfied its performance conditions.
In accordance with the schemes terms the Company issued 24,009,071 1 pence Ordinary shares in the Company in aggregate to those participants in exchange for their interests in H. I. J. shares.
The H. I. J. scheme was created prior to the acquisition of the BCA Group to reward Directors for the creation of value for shareholders.
In order to make these arrangements most efficient, they were based around a subscription for shares in H. I. J.
Limited the H. I. J. shares, a wholly owned subsidiary of BCA.
The Directors subscribed for H. I. J. shares, which were subject to a number of conditions, as detailed below.
Once these conditions were met, the holders of H. I. J. shares were entitled to serve a redemption notice on the Company.
The Company had the option to purchase the H. I. J. shares either for cash or for the issue of new Ordinary shares at its discretion, at a value as described below.
The Company elected to redeem the H. I. J. shares in exchange for the issue of 24,009,071 1 pence Ordinary shares in the Company.
Growth condition The growth condition required that the compound annual growth rate of the invested capital in the Company was equal to or greater than 10% per annum.
The growth condition took into account the date and price at which shares in the Company have been issued and the date and amount of dividends paid by the Company to its shareholders.
Vesting condition The H. I. J. shares were subject to certain vesting conditions, at least one of which had to be, and continued to be, satisfied in order for a holder of H. I. J. shares to exercise their redemption rights.
The vesting conditions were as follows: i a sale of all or a material part of the business of H. I. J.
Limited: ii a sale of all of the issued Ordinary shares of H. I. J.
Limited occurring: iii a winding up of H. I. J.
Limited occurring: iv a sale or change of control of the Company: or v it was later than the third anniversary of AIM Admission which was 10 November 2014.
The Directors agreed that had they ceased to be involved with the Company in the first three years following AIM Admission then in certain circumstances a proportion of their H. I. J. shares may have been forfeited.
Compulsory redemption If the growth condition had not been satisfied on or before the fifth anniversary of AIM Admission or such later date as the Company and holders of 66% of all the H. I. J. shares agreed, the H. I. J. shares would have been sold to the Company or, at its election, redeemed, in both cases at a price equal to the subscription price per H. I. J. share.
Subsequently, upon a sale of the business within a period of one year of the fifth anniversary, which would otherwise have satisfied the conditions, the holders of the H. I. J. shares would have been entitled to receive an amount calculated in accordance with the award.
Redemption value Subject to the provisions detailed above, the H. I. J. shares may be sold to the Company for a proportion of an aggregate value up to the incentive scheme cap.
Under the incentive scheme cap, the value of awards under all of the Companys share incentive arrangements could not, at the point of vesting or over a ten year period, exceed 10% of the excess of the market value of the Company based on a 30 day volume-weighted average mid-market price and taking dividends and any prior return of capital into account over and above the aggregate placing price paid by shareholders for its share capital the 10% growth.
Other share incentive schemes were in issue at the time that the H. I. J. shares vested.
Their value was deducted from the aggregate value of the H. I. J. shares, such that the aggregate value of those arrangements together with the H. I. J. shares did not exceed the 10% growth at the point of vesting.

These awards were subsequently exercised on 18 April 2018 and details of these incentive arrangements are disclosed in note 25 to the financial statements 2 Marwyn Long Term Incentive LP is a partnership in which James Corsellis and Mark Brangstrup Watts have a beneficial interest 3 The terms of the H. I. J. scheme prescribed a definition for the valuation of shares in the event that the Company elected to settle the redemption value in shares rather than cash.
This measure converted the redemption value using a price per share equal to the 30 day volume weighted average mid-market price of shares traded up to the business day prior to redemption, which resulted in an average price of 2.095 per share.
The closing price of a Company share on 18 December 2017, the date of exercise, was 2.08 Long-term incentive schemes There are no current long-term incentive schemes in place for Executive Directors.

Other than with the previous exception in relation to the H. I. J. share scheme, the Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the Companys incentive schemes, and nor do they receive any benefits or pension contributions.
The Non-Executive Directors fees for year ending 31 March 2019 are: Senior Independent Non-Executive Director fees: 100,000 Basic annual fees: 54,125 Additional annual fees for the responsibility to chair a sub-Committee: 10,000 Maximum opportunity Not applicable Performance assessment Not applicable Share ownership guidelines There is no minimum shareholding requirement.
Other payments The Committee reserves the right to make payments outside the Remuneration policy in exceptional circumstances.
The Committee would only use this right where it believes that this is in the best interests of the Company and when it would be disproportionate to seek the specific approval of the shareholders in a general meeting.
Policy for payment on loss of office The service agreements for the Executive Directors allow for lawful termination of employment by making a payment in lieu of notice or by making phased payments over any remaining unexpired period of notice.
At the discretion of the Committee, the rationale for which would be fully disclosed in the Annual report on remuneration, a pro-rata annual incentive may become payable at the normal payment date for the period of employment and based on full year performance.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional liquidated damages payments outside the terms of the Directors service contracts.
Recruitment When hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee will use the Remuneration policy to determine the Executive Directors remuneration package.
To facilitate the hiring of candidates of the appropriate calibre to implement the Groups strategy, the Committee may include any other remuneration component or award not explicitly referred to in this Remuneration policy sufficient to attract the right candidate.
Outside appointments The Company recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive Directors of other companies and that this can help broaden the skills and experience of a Director.
Executive Directors are permitted to take on other Non-Executive positions with other companies and to retain their fees in respect of such a position.
Upon appointment as the Executive Chairman of the Company Avril Palmer-Baunack was permitted to retain her existing Non-Executive Chairmanship of Redde plc and the associated annual remuneration of 200,000.
On 20 February 2018, Avril Palmer-Baunack was appointed Non-Executive Chairman of Safe Harbour Holdings plc, which is an investment vehicle with an acquisitive growth strategy within the B2B distribution and business services sectors.
Safe Harbour Holdings plc has not yet made any acquisitions.
The Board is satisfied that the time commitments will have no significant effect on her role at BCA.
Avril currently receives fees of 200,000 for her role at Safe Harbour Holdings plc which she is permitted to retain.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Group applies the same key principles to setting remuneration for its employees as those applied to the Directors remuneration.
In setting salaries and benefits each business considers the need to retain and incentivise key employees to ensure the continued success of the Group.
Employees of the Group were not consulted in setting the Remuneration policy.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee considers it extremely important to maintain open and transparent communication with the Companys shareholders.
The views of shareholders received through various avenues, such as at the AGM, during meetings with investors and through other contact during the year, are considered by the Committee and will help to inform the development of the overall Remuneration policy.
