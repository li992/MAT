CEO Single Figure 70 Directors Report BBA Aviation Annual Report 2018 Long-term performance over the past 10 years The Remuneration Committee believes it is important to consider the longer-term performance of the Company when assessing how performance is reflected in reward.
The graph below shows the historical cumulative total shareholder return since 2008.
The Company believes that the FTSE 250 Index is a suitable broad based equity index of which the Company is a constituent member.
The Companys total shareholder return performance since the end of 2008 has significantly outperformed the FTSE 250, as shown below bythe value of a hypothetical 100 holding over 10 years, however in 2018 BBA Aviation has underperformed the index during the year.
Overthelast ten years Company has outperformed the FTSE 250 with the hypothetical return on 100 investment being nearly 70% higher.
Thisisillustrated in the graph below.
This year for the first time we have also plotted the CEOs figure from the single figure table and that demonstrates, particularly in the more recent years, a high correlation between pay and the performance of the Company.
Further detail ontheCEO pay is shown in the tables on the next page.
The total single figure used in the graph above is the annualised figure for Mark Johnstone which has been used to provide a valid comparison.

Relevant employees are employees of BBA Aviation plc and its subsidiaries who are in banded grades 14 about 80 of the Groups senior leaders as the Board believes this is a suitable comparator group.
TheCEOs reward is made up of a larger proportion of variable pay than employees within this comparator group.
Percentage change in remuneration of CEO and a relative comparator group of employees 000 Year ended Year ended Percentage 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 change CEO base salary 685.8 680.6 0.8 % Relevant average comparator employees base salary 160.6 157.4 2.0 % CEO taxable benefits 40 21.0 90.5 % Relevant average comparator employees taxable benefits 9.7 9.0 7.7 % CEO annual bonus 222.9 286.5 22.0 % Relevant average comparator employees annual bonus 62.3 51.4 21.2% The comparator figures for 2017 relate to Simon Pryce who was the CEO for the first part of 2017.
For illustrative purposes and to make the comparisons valid, the CEOs bonus in both 2017 and 2018 has been annualised and shows what the bonus would have been had Mark and Simon been in the CEO role for the full year.
The increase in the CEOs taxable benefits reflects a private healthcare arrangement organised at short notice that will not be recurring in 2019.
This related to US private healthcare and was put in place because of the Companys request for Mark Johnstone to relocate to the US to carry out his new role as Group CEO.
The changes in the bonus figures reflect a change in the composition ofthe reward package for the employees below executive director level although the overall target remuneration for these employees was unchanged.
CEO pay ratio disclosures Global Data UK Workforce Data Year Method for UK Workforce Data 25th Percentile Median 75th Percentile 25th Percentile Median 75th Percentile 2018 Non-Statutory 58.1 43.1 30:1 53:1 44:1 35:1 Notes: 1 The methodology used to calculate the CEO pay ratio in this first year of disclosure does not exactly follow one of the statutory methods although it is based on Option A, the primary methodology in the Regulations and preferred by the majority of investors.
The payments to Mark Johnstone have been annualised to provide an appropriate comparator.
The payment at the 75th percentile is based on an estimation of bonus because the exact amounts had not been calculated at the time of finalising this report.
The structure of the remuneration packages throughout the Group means that more senior members of the workforce have a greater proportion of variable pay.
Accordingly, in a year when the Company performs well the ratios are expected to be higher than in a year where Company performance is less strong.
In summary we expect there to be significant volatility in this ratio year on year, and we believe that this willbe caused by the following: Our CEO pay is made up of a higher proportion of incentive pay than that of our employees, in line with the expectations of our shareholders.
This introduces a higher degree of variability in his pay each year which affects the ratio.
The value of long-term incentives which measure performance over three years is disclosed in pay in the year when the performance conditions are satisfied, which increases the CEO pay in that year, again impacting the ratio for that year: Long-term incentives are provided in shares, and therefore an increase in share price over the three years magnifies the impact of a long-term incentive award vesting in a year.
We recognise that the ratio is driven by the different structure of the pay of our CEO versus that of our employees, as well as the make-up ofour workforce.
This ratio varies between businesses even in the same sector.
What is important from our perspective is that this ratio isinfluenced only by the differences in structure, and not by divergence in fixed pay between the CEO and wider workforce.

In 2018 the equivalent LTIP figure was pro-rated for David Crook and this figure has not been restated above.
2 The benefits shown above include private medical cover and insurances.
David Crooks benefits include a car allowance that is paid in cash.
Mark Johnstone does not receive a car allowance.
3 The value of LTIPs vesting in respect of 2017 for David Crook have been restated to reflect the share price on the vesting date of 7 August 2018 was 300.40 pence rather than 325.66 pence which was the average share price in the last quarter of 2017.
The same adjustment applies to Simon Pryces 2015 LTIP award.
The figure disclosed was 784k in the 2017 report and if restated would be 811k Simon Pryces shares vested on 13 March 2018 when the price was 336.6 pence.
Further information on payments to Simon Pryce are shown under payments to past directors on page 79.
4 The LTIP awards granted in 2016 are expected to vest at 46.87% in March 2019.
The value attributed to these awards is 240.9 pence per share which is the average share price in the last quarter of 2018.
These figures will be restated in the 2019 Annual Report to reflect the actual value.
The LTIP awards granted in 2016 are not pro-rated as to time served as a director during the performance period for Mark Johnstone or David Crook.
5 The Deferred Stock Plan awards that are expected to be granted in 2019 are disclosed in the table above because the operating profit used to calculate the pool was over the three financial years ending 31 December 2016, 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018 and the strategic objectives were measured at the end of 2018.
The details of these awards are set out on pages 76 and 77.

Components of 2018 single figure The commentary below reviews each element included in the single figure table in turn and provides additional information about that element of the reward package and in the case of variable elements provides full details on the targets that were set and evaluation of the performance.
Base salary for executive directors Mark Johnstones annual salary was set at US$ 912,060 675,000 on the date it was set.
The Companys Remuneration Report will continue tobe presented in sterling and accordingly some variation in Marks reported reward will be as a result of exchange rate changes.
When David Crook was appointed finance director on 1 June 2017 his annual salary was set at 375,000.
The base salary was set to be competitive looking at our US peers and the general UK FTSE 250 level.
David did not receive an increase in his base salary for 2018.
Wayne Edmunds continued as Interim Group Chief Executive for the first part of 2018.
When he was appointed, given the interim nature of the role it was felt to be appropriate to pay a base salary only with no bonus or equity awards.
The salary was based on the average single figure paid by the Company over previous periods to the former Group Chief Executive and this rationale and basis of payment has been fully disclosed inprevious Remuneration Committee Reports.
Benefits Mark Johnstones benefits included medical insurance, dental insurance, disability insurance and life insurance.
Other benefits for the year for David Crook included a company car allowance, private medical insurance, death in service benefit, annual holiday, sick pay, an annual health check and gym membership and were unchanged compared to 2017.
74 Directors Report BBA Aviation Annual Report 2018 Bonus The maximum bonus opportunity for 2018 is 65% of salary for the executive directors split 55% of salary for financial performance two thirds ofthis is for operating profit and one third for free cash flow and 10% of salary for personal objectives.
The whole bonus is paid in cash and there are no deferral obligations.
The choice of performance conditions and their respective weightings reflected the Committees belief that they would drive action to deliver exceptional sustainable value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.
In determining the bonus payment for 2018, the Committee was comfortable that the outcome reflected performance and accordingly no discretion was exercised by the Remuneration Committee in determining the outcomes.
Following an assessment against the performance targets, the Committee concluded that Mark Johnstone will receive a bonus of 167,154.
Thebonus takes into account the fact that Mark took up the role of Group Chief Executive on 1 April 2018 and the bonus for the first three months of the year was based on his prior role and salary.
The element for the first three months of the year is not included in the single figure table as it was not paid for services as a director of the Company.
The bonus paid for the time Mark was Group Chief Executive is 50% of the pro-rated maximum.
David Crook will receive a bonus of 121,875 and this is 49.8% of the maximum.
Both Mark Johnstone for the period of time he was an executive director and David Crook receive 22.5% of their eligible salaries in respect offinancial performance 11.7% was for achievement against the operating profit target and 10.8% for free cash flow targets.
Mark will receive 10% of his eligible salary and David will receive 9.9% of his salary for achievement against their personal strategic objectives.
The detailed personal and financial targets and the achievement against these are shown below.
Targets and performance The Board is continuing with its approach to disclose the bonus targets for the year under review.
Financial measures account for nearly 85% ofthe maximum opportunity: operating profit represents just over 56% of the maximum opportunity and free cash flow represents just over 28% of the maximum opportunity split equally for the half-year position and full-year position.
Personal objectives represents just over 15% ofthe maximum opportunity.
Financial objectives The graph below shows the financial objectives performance: Threshold Target Maximum $347.3m $386.0m $405.2m Underlying operating profit Percentage of salary payable 6.97% 13.51% 36.69% Actual performance $375.2m equalling a payment of 11.7% of salary $222.7m $247.5m $259.8m Free cash flow full year Percentage of salary payable 1.74% 3.37% 9.16% Actual performance $223.6m equalling a payment of 1.8% of salary $89.2m $99.2m $104.1m Free cash flow half year Percentage of salary payable 1.74% 3.37% 9.16% Actual performance $103.6m equalling a payment of 9.0% of salary Notes: All metrics above use total Group figures i. e. continuing and discontinued operations.
The purpose of the half-year cash flow target is to focus attention on cash throughout the year rather than at a single point in time.
There is a trade creditor cap applied to the actual figures above, which ensures payments to creditors are not inappropriately delayed to deliver bonus targets.
The measures are assessed on a straight line basis between threshold and target.
Between target and maximum there is a half-way inflection point where 34.85% of salary would be awarded for operating profit and 8.70% of salary would be awarded for free cash flow at half and full-year.

Total 87% BBA Aviation Annual Report 2018 Directors Report 77 Under the DSP, a pool of shares is determined based on 3.5% of the Companys average underlying operating profit performance over the priorthree years and achievement against certain strategic objectives.
Participants are granted conditional shares which vest after the third anniversary but are not released to the executive directors until five years after the original grant.
The Groups underlying operating profit for 2016 was $330.1 million, for 2017 was $360.4 million and for 2018 was $375.2 giving an average of$355.2 million and 3.5% of this is $12.43 million.
The Remuneration Committee concluded that 87% of the strategic objectives had been delivered and agreed the overall pool is therefore $10.82 million.
The face value of the DSP award that will be granted to Mark Johnstone and David Crook in 2019 in respect of 2018 performance is equivalent to108.75% of their 2018 base salary.
This award equates to 87% of the maximum.
The Remuneration Committee anticipates that it will grant this award in March and assoon as awards are made to executive directors they will be announced via the Regulatory News Service RNS, aswellas in the 2019 Annual Report.

Performance was measured over three financial years ending 31 December 2018.
For the three years ended 31 December 2018 EPS growth per annum was 3.1% and the average annual ROIC was 10.83%.
This performance means that the EPS element does not vest and the ROIC element vests at 93.75% an overall vesting of 46.87%.
Asset out below and calculated in note 6 the earnings used in the LTIP calculation of EPS are adjusted to take account of the Companys exceptional and other items policy and also the underlying current tax charge.
These awards are expected to vest on or about the third anniversary and the valuefor executive directors is shown in the single figure table.
The LTIP awards to Mark Johnstone and David Crook were made before they were appointed as executive directors.
The share price at the timeof grant was 192 pence per share.
The number in the single figure table for these LTIP awards due to vest in March is 142,605 for Mark Johnstone and84,795 for David Crook and about 20% of these sums are attributable to share price appreciation over the last three years.

Mark Johnstones award granted in 2018 is not included in the single figure table as it does not relate to services as a director of the Company, itwas granted before he became an executive director but is included here to provide shareholders with full information.
The DSP awards were made on 13 March 2018.
The grant for David Crook represented 64.5% of his salary.
LTIPs granted in 2018 for 2018, 2019 and 2020 performance but not released until 2023 The performance conditions for the LTIPs granted in 2018 are shown in the table below.
The EPS targets for 2018 were lower than the 6% 12 % range for 2017 due to the impact of the US Tax Reform the US Tax Reform artificially increased the EPS in respect of 2017 based onthe approved calculation methodology.
The Committee decided that the EPS element of the 2015 award would not vest due to this artificial increase but with the higher base value in 2017 the growth targets should be reduced.
EPS growth is calculated from the actual EPS in 2017 rather than excluding the positive impact of US Tax Reform.
In the Committees opinion management should neither benefit nor suffer a detriment due to an external factor outside their control.
Therefore the Committee excluded the positive impact on the EPS when calculating potential vesting under the 2015 LTIP award: but adjusted the EPS growth targets for the 2018 LTIP grant to reflect the one-off increase in EPS in 2017 the base year for calculating performance which had nothing to do with underlying trading performance.
The average annual ROIC targets were increased by 0.5%at both the bottom and top of the range.
No changes were madeto the TSR targets.
The EPS and ROIC elements are calculated in the same way for these awards as for the 2016 awards shown on page 77.

Fees in 2018 for the Chairman and non-executive directors The fees for the Chairman and the non-executive directors are in the single figure table above.
On appointment it was agreed that the fee for the Chairman would not be reviewed for the first three years.
At the end of this period the Remuneration Committee determined to increase the Chairmans fee to 295,000, an increase of 18% with effect from 1 January 2018.
This was the first increase the Chairman has received since becoming Chairman in May 2014.
The basis of the Chairmans new fee was to position him broadly at the median compared to the FTSE 250 in line with the size of the Company and also to reflect the increase in scope and commitment required given the changes to the Company over the period, including the transformational acquisition of Landmark.
The fees for the nonexecutive directors including SID and Committee Chair roles were reviewed and it was agreed to increase all fees by 3%, in line with average employee rises during this cycle.

82 Directors Report BBA Aviation Annual Report 2018 Implementation of policy in 2019 The proposed implementation of the existing policy for each element of remuneration in 2019 is described below.
Base salary for executive directors The Remuneration Committee reviewed the base salary for Mark Johnstone and David Crook.
The Committee decided to increase the salary forboth Mark and David by 2.5% which was equal to the standard pay increase for employees of good standing across the Group.
Marks salary isdenominated in US dollars and accordingly this amount will appear to fluctuate when disclosed in the single figure tables in sterling.
The impact of exchange rate differences will be explained where necessary within the Remuneration Report.
Pension and benefits The Committee does not expect to change the pension or benefit arrangements for the executive directors in 2019.
Annual cash bonus For 2019, the Committee has determined that the annual bonus opportunity for executive directors is 65% of salary and will again be contingent on meeting both financial targets and personal objectives.
The Committee has reviewed targets for the year to ensure they remain appropriately stretching and relevant to the Companys business strategy.
In 2019, financial performance objectives will again represent about 85% of the bonus opportunity and personal objectives will represent about 15% of the bonus opportunity.
The financial targets will, as in 2018, be based onoperating profit and free cash flow at the half and full year with approximately the same weights as in 2018.
The Board has decided that bonus targets for 2019 are commercially sensitive as they could provide the market and competitors with confidential information on the Groups strategy and expectations.
The Board will disclose the targets once they are no longer commercially sensitive and anticipates they will be disclosed in the 2019 Annual Report.
This has been the Companys practice in recent years.
Deferred Stock Plan In respect of 2019, Mark Johnstone and David Crook are eligible to receive an award in early 2020 under the plan.
The award will be subject toamaximum of 125% of their 2019 salary following an assessment of Group operating profit performance at the end of the 2019 financial yearand performance against the strategic Group objectives.
These awards will be subject to a three-year cliff vest and a subsequent twoyearholding period.
The Committee considered the following points when setting the performance conditions and targets for the DSP: where strategic and operational objectives are used, the Committee will ensure that a significant component of the targets set are capable ofquantifiable assessment: and the objectives and the performance against those objectives will be fully disclosed in the Remuneration Report in the following year.
LTIP The LTIP award, due to be granted in 2019 for Mark Johnstone and David Crook, will be 150% of salary.
The award will be announced to the market when it is made and set out in full in the 2019 Directors Remuneration Report.
The three-year performance criteria will be average ROIC:EPS growth andtotal shareholder return.
The awards will be subject to a two-year holding period following the performance period.
The Committee has decided that the performance measures relating to the LTIP awards will be set and evaluated on pre-IFRS 16 GAAP.
Atthepresent time the detailed impact of IFRS 16 on full year results is not certain and, accordingly, it is not possible to be confident that any performance targets would be set at an appropriately stretching level.
The Committees preference is to set targets that, as far as possible, willnot require adjustments to be made either part way through or at the end of the performance period.
The Company has for a number of years set the LTIP targets on the GAAP operating at the time the targets were set and has measured performance onthe same basis.
Accordingly, this is no different to prior practice.
Additionally, the Groups banking covenants are expected to remain on pre-IFRS 16 GAAP for a number of years and the relevant alternative performance measure reconciliation will be disclosed in the Annual Reports from 2019 onwards.
At this time the Committee has also decided to simplify the earnings per share EPS measure used for the LTIP and will use underlying EPS this is adjusted EPS which is calculated on earnings before exceptional and other items see Note 6.
Following the Landmark acquisition in 2016 the Committee adopted an EPS measure with the exclusion of the underlying deferred tax charge to ensure the full benefits of the acquisition were achieved.
These benefits have now largely been delivered and therefore the Committee has concluded that for greater simplicity it is preferable to use the EPS calculation which is most commonly used in the market for the purposes of long-term incentives.
Calculation methodology The LTIP calculation methodology is set out below.
Adjusted earnings Adjusted operating profit 1 EPS ROIC Weighted average shares in issue Statutory invested capital Adjusted earnings: In line with the formal IFRS calculation of EPS with an Adjusted operating profit: In line with the formal IFRS calculation of operating profit adjustment that takes into account the Companys exceptional and other items policy.

Key remuneration element of the new Code Company position Five-year period between the date of grant and realisation of equity incentives.
Both the awards of shares to the executive directors under the DSP and the LTIP meet this requirement.
Phased release of equity awards.
Both the DSP and LTIP ensure the phased release of equity awards through the rolling annual grants.
Discretion to override formulaic outcomes.
The remuneration policy contains the ability to override formulaic outcomes for the bonus, DSP and LTIP.
The Committee did not include this in the policy approved in 2018.
The Committee will continue to monitor evolving market practice to determine whether to introduce this provision in future.
It is the Committees current intention to bring new executive directors in at a pension contribution equivalent to the average employee contribution.
The Committee does not intend to change the provision for the existing executive directors.
The current malus and clawback provisions already exceed the best practice suggested in the new Code.
Chairman and NED fees These fees will be increased by 2.5% which is in line with the fees for the wider workforce.

Crossreferences including page numbers have been updated for ease of reference to page numbers in the 2018 Annual Report.
The full policy isonthe Companys website in the 2017 Annual Report.
Introduction The following key principles govern the design of the Groups remuneration and reward structures: relevance to BBA Aviation, the cyclicality of our businesses and the international markets in which we compete and operate: pay for performance, notably the effective execution of the Group strategy and delivery of exceptional, long-term sustainable value for allourshareholders and stakeholders: top quartile for exceptional performance and mid-market for mid-level performance: reward actions that support our Vision, Mission and Values: remuneration should be commensurate with role and responsibilities and sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre individuals withrelevant experience: reward should be appropriate and easily understood, both internally and externally: for executive directors, a significant element of remuneration should be aligned to long-term business performance: and the reward structure is compatible with our risk policies and systems and must not create environmental, social or governance risks byinadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
All contractual commitments or awards made which are consistent with the remuneration policy in force at the time that the commitment oraward was made will be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled orawards vest.
Any contractual commitments entered into or awards made before the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 came into force or before a person became a director will also be honoured.
Thetablesbelow set out a clear and comprehensive summary of BBA Aviations remuneration policy for directors and how it operates.
Policy table: executive directors Base salary There are no performance or recovery provisions.
Strategic purpose Designed to attract individuals with the skills and capabilities to oversee the execution of the Groups strategy.
Set to reflect the role, the international nature of operations and the contribution, skills and experience of the individual.
Operation Reviewed annually taking into account market conditions, business performance, personal contribution and the level of pay awards and conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Market comparisons are carried out every three years and are made against organisations of comparable size, complexity, geographical spread, business focus and opportunity.
Individuals who are recruited or promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the targeted policy level until they become established in their role.
In such cases subsequent increases in salary may be higher than the general rises for employees until the target positioning is achieved.
Maximum opportunity Typically, the base salaries of executive directors in post at the start of the policy period and who remain in the same role throughout the policy period will be increased by a similar percentage to the average annual percentage increase in salaries of all other employees in the Group.
The exceptions tothis rule may be where there is an increase in scope, complexity or responsibilities of the role salary progression for a newly appointed director andmarket adjustment.
Salary increases are linked to individual contribution and performance, which is assessed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee ensures that salary levels are positioned in line with companies of comparable size, complexity, geographical spread, business focus and opportunity so that they are competitive against the market.
Link to performance Salary increases are linked to individual contribution and business performance, which is assessed annually by the Remuneration Committee.

Performance targets are set taking into account prior year performance, annual budgets, strategic imperatives and external factors.
Threshold performance is set taking into account the highly cyclical nature of our business and the variability of results from year to year and our dependence on flying hours.
The maximum standard ofperformance is intended to be exacting and to represent a level of performance that places the Group among the best performers.
2 The elements of remuneration for executive directors are similar to those that apply to the management-banded population in the Group.
Any differences that exist arise either because of market practice and or the Remuneration Committees assessment of business need and commercial necessity.
3 The Company also reimburses business expenses in accordance with the corporate business expenses policy which the Remuneration Committee has discretion to revise from time to time.
4 In addition to other benefits, the Remuneration Committee, where necessary, will provide support in accordance with BBA Aviations standard approach to relocation where a director is required to relocate to fulfil their responsibilities.
The primary purpose of the policy is to facilitate recruitment and relocation of key employees by protecting the individual and their family from costs arising directly from a move of residence required for business reasons.
The elements of the policy include, but are not limited to, travel reimbursement of the cost of movement of household goods, housing, schooling and other reasonable costs.
BBA Aviation Annual Report 2018 Directors Report 87 Intention and discretion In respect of the Annual Bonus Plan, the Deferred Stock Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company will set out in the section headed Implementation of remuneration policy, in the following financial year, the nature of the targets and their weighting for each year and in relation to the LTIP the targets themselves.
Details of the performance conditions, targets and their level of satisfaction for the year being reported onwill be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Should the Committee determine that one or more targets are commercially sensitive, these will be disclosed in subsequent years remuneration reports once commercial sensitivity ceases to apply.
When the Committee sets targets for any element of reward it should be assumed that these are on a consistent basis of accounting and, where accounting standards change during the performance period, the Committee will when it is fair and equitable to do so make adjustments to ensure that directors neither benefit nor suffer as a result of changes in accounting standards.
The Committee may make adjustments for exceptional items in the performance period if it is fair and equitable to do so.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee retains the discretion to: change the performance measures and targets and the weighting attached to the performance measures and targets part-way through aperformance period if there is a significant and material event which causes the Committee to believe the original measures, weightings andtargets are no longer appropriate: make downward or upward adjustments to the amount of bonus contribution earned or DSP or LTIP resulting from the application of theperformance measures, if the Committee believes that the outcomes are not a fair and accurate reflection of business performance.
Any adjustments or discretion applied by the Committee will be fully disclosed in the following years Remuneration Report.
The Committee will operate all plans in accordance with the relevant rules and in accordance with the principles of the policy set out in the introduction to the policy above.
Malus and clawback policy The table below sets out the scope and circumstances under which withholding malus and recovery of pay clawback will be applied to variable pay of the executive directors.
The same provisions also apply to the senior staff in Bands 14 circa 100 employees.
The definition of malus andclawback that will apply for the ABP, DSP and the LTIP are: Malus is the adjustment of the ABP payments or unvested DSP and LTIP awards because of the occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below.
The adjustment may result in the value being reduced to nil.
Clawback is the recovery of payments made under the ABP or vested DSP and LTIP awards as a result of the occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below.
Clawback may apply to all or part of a participants payment under the ABP or vested DSP or LTIP awards and may be effected, among other means, by requiring the transfer of shares, payment of cash or reduction of awards or bonuses.

ABP DSP LTIP Malus Up to the date of bonus determination.
To the end of the three-year vesting period.

88 Directors Report BBA Aviation Annual Report 2018 Shareholding requirement To ensure that executive directors interests are aligned with those of shareholders over a longer time horizon there is a formal shareholding guideline to encourage substantial long-term share ownership by executive directors.
The ownership guideline for executive directors is 300% of base salary, which should be achieved within five years.
This element of the policy ensures that the interests of the executive directors and those of shareholders are closely aligned.
The build-up and retention of shares bymanagement is a key objective of the policy.
The Committee retains the discretion to increase the shareholding requirements.
Legacy arrangements under incentive plans There are outstanding awards which apply to directors made under arrangements which will not be offered under the policy effective from theclose of the Companys 2018 AGM.
The awards already made under these plans will be honoured.
Recruitment and appointment policy On appointment the Committees approach to remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role.
The remuneration package for any new recruit would be determined in accordance with the principles set out on page 84.
The Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure the preferred candidate and is aware of guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or enhanced short or long-term incentive payments made on recruitment and the appropriateness of any performance conditions associated with the award.
If an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the policy set out above would apply from the date of promotion but there would be no retrospective application of the policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements.
Accordingly, prevailing elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured and form part of the ongoing remuneration.
These would be disclosed to shareholders in the following years Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Companys policy when setting fees for the appointment of new non-executive directors is to apply the policy which applies to current non-executive directors.
The Companys policy when setting remuneration for a new director is summarised in the following table: Remuneration element Policy Base salary and benefits The salary level will be set taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, experience and the salaries paid for similar roles in comparable companies.

Theexecutive director shall be eligible to receive benefits in line with the Companys benefits policy as set out in the remuneration policy table.

The maximum potential opportunity LTIP under this plan is 150% of salary.
Total incentive opportunity The maximum variable remuneration which may be granted in normal circumstances is 340% of salary under the ABP, DSP and LTIP excluding the value of any buy-out awards.
Buy-out of incentives The Committees policy is not to provide buy-outs as a matter of course.
However, should the Committee determine that the individual forfeited on cessation circumstances of recruitment justify the provision of a buy-out, the equivalent value of any incentives that will be forfeited on cessation ofemployment of an executive directors previous employment will be calculated taking into account the following: the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the executive directors cessation of employment: the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the likelihood of them being satisfied: and any other terms and conditions having a material effect on their value lapsed value.
The Committee may then grant up to the equivalent value as the lapsed value, where possible, under the Companys existing incentive plans.
To the extent that it was not possible or practical to provide the buy-out within the terms of the Companys existing incentive plans a bespoke arrangement would be used.
Relocation policies Where the new executive director is required to relocate from one work base to another, the Company may provide one-off ongoing support aspart of the directors relocation benefits compensation to reflect the cost of relocation for the executive director in cases where they are expected to spend significant time away from their country of domicile.
The level of relocation package will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, but will take into consideration any cost of living differences, housing allowance and schooling.
BBA Aviation Annual Report 2018 Directors Report 89 Policy on payment for loss of office leaving the Company When determining any loss of office payment for a departing director, the Committee will always seek to minimise the cost to the Company whilst complying with the contractual terms and seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time.
