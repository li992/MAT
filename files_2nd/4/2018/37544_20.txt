The Committee has determined to reduce the EPRA EPS growth target range from RPI plus 3% and RPI plus 8% to RPI plus 0% and RPI plus 4%.
The rationale for this change was as follows: The Company has now substantially completed its repositioning of the portfolio to logistics: therefore the opportunity to increase EPS over the next period, as a result of the yield arbitrage on disposals of non core assets, has been materially reduced The majority of the Groups leases contain xed or RPI linked rent review clauses which limit the ability of the Executive Directors to grow earnings materially ahead of the index The Company has had a long run of very strong EPS performance as it repositioned itself which has resulted inahigh base point from which to generate future growth inan increasingly challenging external market Shareholding requirement Executive Directors are encouraged to build up and hold a The shareholding requirement for 2019 is: shareholding equivalent to a percentage of basesalary.
