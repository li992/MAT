In addition, it is in accordance with the revised UK Corporate Governance Code which calls for remuneration committees to determine remuneration for senior management and to more closely align incentives with culture London Stock Exchange Group Annual Report December 2018 91 Directors Remuneration Report continued Annual Report on Remuneration Long Term Incentive Plan: Awards are intended to be made in 2019 under the 2014 LTIP, as described in our Remuneration Policy Report.
The 2019 LTIP awards will be granted under our enhanced Remuneration Policy as set out in our 2017 Directors Remuneration Report as part of our 2017 Annual Report and will therefore be subject to a 2 year holding period in addition to the 3 year performance period, resulting in a total 5 year period from the date of grant.
Malus and clawback provisions will apply to these awards, allowing the Committee to reduce subsisting awards or request the refund of already paid or vested awards in certain circumstances e. g. material misstatement or gross misconduct.

The Committee has given extensive consideration to the LTIP target ranges, in particular for AEPS growth and sought the views of shareholders and shareholder governance bodies during the year.
The decision was based on a number of factors, which are summarised below: The absolute increase in underlying AOP required to deliver 12% CAGR is extremely stretching over a 3-year cycle and achievement of such would continue to represent class-leading performance and significant value creation for shareholders This level of performance must also be delivered against an increasingly competitive and challenging market backdrop of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty The targets should be considered in the context of significant and sustained profit growth performance over several 3-year cycles to date, making each successive set of targets ever more difficult to achieve than the last During 2019 we will undertake a thorough review of our policy, including the performance measures and metrics of our LTIP.
This review will be undertaken in consultation with our shareholders and brought to the 2020 AGM for approval.
Awards to be made during 2019 Based on the context and an assessment of individual performance, the Remuneration Committee intends to make grants to each of the Executive Directors under the 2014 LTIP as set out below.

The Committee has decided The Code recommends that pension commitments for Executive Directors should not to publish the Groups ratio early in light of our atypical situation and be aligned with those available to the workforce.
This has also been called for in necessary hybrid calculation, whereby our CEO joined during the year and our recent shareholder and investor governance body guidelines.
