Overview of Remuneration Policy The Companys Remuneration Policy was reviewed fully prior to listing in 2016, in accordance withcurrent regulation and guidance.
This ensured theRemuneration Policy in place was appropriate for a listed company.
The Policy was effective from the 2017 AGM and full policy is shown on pages62 and63 for reference.
The information shown has been updated to take account of the factthat the policy is now approved and enacted ratherthanproposed.

Our Remuneration Policy aims to align the interests of the Executive Directors, senior executives and employees with the long-term interests ofshareholders.
It aims to support a high-performance culture with appropriate reward for superior performance without creating incentives thatwillencourage excessive risk taking or unsustainable Company performance.
Overall remuneration levels are set at a level that are considered by the Committee to be appropriate for the size and nature of the business.
Allvariablepay awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions in accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy The Board as a whole is responsible for setting the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors other than the Chairman, whose remuneration is determined by the Committee and recommended to the Board.

The Company will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors.
The Company may also provide limited hospitality and selected benefits, paying any tax thereon provided that this is in connection with the performance of their role with the Company.
64 Annual report 2018 Countryside Properties PLC Governance Approach to recruitment remuneration The Committees approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay the necessary amount to attract candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role.
The remuneration package for any new recruit would be assessed following the same principles as for the Executive Directors, asset out in the Remuneration Policy table.
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the Executive Director policy would apply.
Historical entitlements would continue to be honoured and allowed to pay out on their original terms.
We would fully disclose these in the Annual Report on Remuneration at the relevant time.
The table below summarises our key policies with respect to recruitment remuneration: Remuneration element Recruitment policy Base salary and benefits We will set the salary level taking into account a number of factors, including market practice, the individuals experience and responsibilities and other pay structures within Countryside.
It will also be consistent with the salary policy for existing Executive Directors.
Starting salaries may therefore be set below the market level and, subject to performance, increased by more than inflation as the employee gains experience over time.
The Executive Director will be eligible to receive benefits in line with Countrysides benefits policy as set out inthe Remuneration Policy table.
Pension An Executive Director will be able to participate in Countrysides defined contribution pension scheme, orreceive a cash allowance in lieu of pension benefits in line with the policy for existing Executive Directors upto a maximum of 10 per cent of salary, in line with other senior staff of the Group.
Annual bonus An Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme as set out in the Remuneration Policy table.
The maximum opportunity will be no more than 150 per cent of salary, of which up to one-third may be deferred in shares, as per the policy for existing Executive Directors.
Depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee may deem it appropriate to set different annual bonus performance conditions for Executive Directors during their first year of appointment.
Long-term incentives An Executive Director will be eligible to participate in Countrysides Long-Term Incentive Plan as set out in the Remuneration Policy table.
The maximum opportunity offered may be up to 200 per cent of salary, as per the policy for existing ExecutiveDirectors.
An LTIP award can be made shortly following an appointment assuming the Company is not in a closed period.
Share buy-outs The Committees policy is to not provide buy-outs as a matter of course.
However, should the Committee believe replacement awards it necessary to grant awards to replace those from a previous employer, the Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards so that overall they are no more favourable than the awards due to be forfeited.
In determining the quantum and structure of any buy-out, the Committee will take into account the fair value and, as far as practicable, the timing and performance requirements of foregone remuneration.
Where possible, existing arrangements will be used, although in unusual circumstances the Committee may also make use of the flexibility provided by the Listing Rules to make awards without prior shareholder approval.
Relocation policies Should a newly recruited Executive Director be required to relocate, the Company will meet reasonable associated costs.
Such relocation support could include but not be limited to: the payment of legal fees: removal costs: temporary accommodation hotel costs: a contribution to Stamp Duty: the replacement of non-transferable household items: and related taxes incurred.
In addition, and in appropriate circumstances, the Committee may grant additional support relating to the payment of school fees.
The Companys policy when setting fees for the appointment of new Non-Executive Directors is to apply the policy which applies to current Non-Executive Directors.
Countryside Properties PLC Annual report 2018 65 Remuneration policy report continued Service agreements and compensation for loss of office When setting notice periods, the Committee has regard to market practice and corporate governance best practice.
Our policy is that notice periods for Executive Directors should be no longer than 12 months.
The Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Operating Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer all have contracts with notice periods of 12 months on either side.
The notice period for Non-Executive Directors is three months, save in the case of the Chairman whose notice period is six months.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but are appointed under letters of appointment, which provide for a review after an initial three-year term with the possibility of annual renewal.
All service contracts and letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Companys registered office and at the AGM.
When approving any termination payments for a departing Director, the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the Company whilst complying with the contractual terms and seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments: where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation : or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an Executive Directors office or employment.
In the latter case, the Committee may provide assistance with outplacement costs.
The table below sets out, for each element of total remuneration, the Companys policy on payment for loss of office in respect of Executive Directors and any discretion available to the Committee.
Broadly, treatment will depend on the circumstances of departure, in particular whether a leaver is a good leaver.
For a good leaver the following will normally apply: Remuneration element Treatment on cessation Salary, benefits and pension Received for the notice period or payment in lieu of notice.
Statutory redundancy payments as appropriate.
Annual bonus No entitlement to a bonus: however, a pro-rata bonus may be paid following the end of the financial year in which they leave.
Deferred bonus Vesting of deferred bonus shares on cessation.
LTIP The rules of the LTIP set out the treatment of good leavers.
In summary, awards will normally vest on the normal vesting date and be subject to pro-rating.
However, the Committee has discretion to allow awards to vest on cessation and to waive pro-rating where it feels doing so is appropriate.
The Committee may pay any statutory entitlements or settle compromise claims in connection with a termination of employment, when considered inthe best interests of the Company.
Change of control On a change of control of the Group, the following provisions would apply to Executive Directors: Remuneration element Treatment on change of control Salary, benefits and pension Received for the notice period or payment in lieu of notice if notice is given.
Deferred bonus Vesting of deferred bonus shares.
LTIP The rules of the LTIP set out the treatment on a change of control.
In summary, awards will normally vest at the date of change of control and normally be subject to pro-rating.
However, the Committee has discretion to waive pro-rating where it feels it is appropriate to do so.
