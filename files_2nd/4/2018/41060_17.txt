The Committee reviewed Mr Bells performance against the performance criteria, described on page 50, over the preceding year at its meeting in February 2019 to determine the appropriate level of the discretionary bonus that is payable for that year.
Following that review, the Committee recommended, and the Board agreed, that Mr Bell should receive a discretionary bonus equal to 40% compared with the maximum of 40% of his basic salary, 117,420 in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2018 2017: 30%, 85,500. ii One-year Bonus For a description of the terms of the One-year Bonus including the performance measures, please see the policy report.
The Company underperformed its benchmark in 2018 net asset value debt at par, excluding the effect of share buybacks and therefore a bonus will not be paid to Mr Bell based on theCompanys financial performance for the year ended 31 December 2018 2017: outperformed by 3.6%, 114,000. iii Long-Term Bonus For a description of the terms of the Long-Term Bonus including the performance measures, please see the policy report.
In summary, Mr Bell is eligible to receive up to 90% of his basic annual salary by reference to the Companys performance over the previous three financial years.

The Company has outperformed its benchmark over the three financial years to 31 December 2018 by 12% net asset value debt at par, excluding the effect of share buybacks and therefore a Long-Term Bonus of 32,847 will be paid to Mr Bell 2017: 8.0%, 126,757.
