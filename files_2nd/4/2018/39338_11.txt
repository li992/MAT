Directors remuneration report Dear Shareholder, At last years AGM, shareholders approved the new remuneration policy Policy with 99.2% of votes in favour of the resolution.
We are grateful for this strong show of support.
I am pleased to provide the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 30 December 2018, which is the first application of that Policy.
As usual, the annual statement and annual report on remuneration, which provide details of the remuneration earned by Directors in the year and how the Policy will be implemented for the 2019 financial year, will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at this years AGM, on 17 May 2019.
Board changes Kirk Davis joined the Group as Chief Financial Officer on 5 February 2018 and his joining terms were fully reported last year and set out in the main body Mike Tye of this years report.
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Remuneration in 2018 The 2016 LTIP awards did not meet their performance conditions and have lapsed.
As announced in last years report, awards over shares worth 200% and 150% of salary were granted under the LTIP in 2018 to the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer respectively, subject to EPS and TSR targets.
Consistent with normal practice, the number of shares subject to these awards has been adjusted using the HMRC standard formula to neutralise the impact of the rights issue, we undertook last year to partly finance the acquisition of Wagamama.
The standard calculation of TSR also makes the same adjustment and the Committee adopted the same adjustment to base the EPS figure for outstanding LTIP awards.
The Committee will monitor the outturns to ensure that the EPS components continue to operate as intended and are not unintentionally impacted by the Wagamama acquisition and, consistent with best practice guidance, will not result in the targets being easier to achieve than would have been the case but for the acquisition.
In relation to bonus, the Remuneration Committee set challenging Adjusted PBT targets and like-for-like LFL sales targets which were not met and stretching employee engagement targets which were met in part.
However, for any bonus potential to be paid, the threshold of 57m Adjusted profit before tax had to be achieved.
As the threshold Adjusted PBT target was not achieved, no bonuses were awarded to the executive Directors.
During the year, the Committee also spent time reviewing, and agreeing actions to address the gender pay gap data which has been published in line with regulatory requirements.
40 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Remuneration for 2019 For 2019, in view of his resignation, the Chief Executive will not be awarded a bonus, or granted an LTIP award.
The Chief Financial Officer will again be eligible for a maximum annual bonus of up to 120% of salary.
50% of any bonus earned will be deferred in shares for three years.
The Committee intends to grant an LTIP award of 200% of salary for the CFO increased from 150% in 2018 to reflect the importance of his role during the transition to a new Chief Executive, based on stretching total shareholder return TSR and Adjusted earnings per share EPS targets for a definition of Adjusted EPS, see the glossary on page 121.
A c. 2% salary increase was awarded to each of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer for 2019 effective 1 January, which is in line with the rest of the head office team.
Non-managerial staff in restaurants and pubs are determined in line with changes to the National Minimum and National Living Wage and this was higher than 2%.
While higher increases may have been warranted to reflect the increased scale of the Group following the acquisition of the Wagamama business, this was not considered appropriate at this time.
Andy McCue On 14 February 2019, Andy McCue, CEO, informed the Board of his decision to leave the Company due to extenuating personal circumstances.
Andy will remain in position while his successor is being recruited.
Consistent with his contractual terms, he will continue to receive his normal base salary and benefits while working for the Company and may then receive his base salary and housing allowance for up to 2 months for any balance of his notice period.
His 2016 and 2017 deferred share bonus awards will remain until normal vesting.
He will not be eligible for a bonus for 2019 20 and all outstanding LTIP awards will lapse on his departure.
We are committed to ensuring that our remuneration practices promote the attraction, retention and incentivisation of high calibre executives to deliver the Groups strategy and align executives to the interests of shareholders.
We hope that you will be supportive of the resolution to approve the annual report on remuneration at this years AGM.

4 Andy McCue resigned from the Company on 14 February 2019 and therefore all his LTIPs will lapse on his leaving the Company.
5 C onsistent with normal practice, the shares subject to outstanding awards were adjusted in accordance with HMRCs standard TERPS formula.
This reflects the discount to the then prevailing price at which new shares were offered to existing shareholders and therefore results in the same economic result for a participant as that of a shareholder participating in the rights issue.
The base EPS figure for each award has been adjusted on a similar basis.
Long-term incentives granted during the year audited During the year, the following LTIPs were granted to executive Directors: Number % of face of shares value that Share price over which would vest Basis of at date award was Face value at threshold Date of Date of 1 Executive Type of award award granted of grant granted of award performance award vesting 2 Andy McCue Conditional Awards 200% of salary nil-cost option of 515,500 244.6p 399,241 1,031,000 25% 19.03.2018 19.03.2021 Kirk Davis Conditional Awards 150% of salary nil-cost option of 355,000 244.6p 206,203 532,499 25% 19.03.2018 19.03.2021 1 Based on an average share price of 258.24p during the five dealing days ending immediately before the date of grant.

Consistent with best practice guidance, the Committee will consider whether any adjustment to the 2017 and 2018 EPS targets is required in light of the Wagamama acquisition, to ensure that the performance conditions operate as intended.
This will not make the targets easier to achieve than would have been the case but for the acquisition of Wagamama.
