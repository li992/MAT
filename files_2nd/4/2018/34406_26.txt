COM STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Advisors PwC was appointed as advisor to the Committee in August 2014 following a competitive tender process.
The company is also advised by PwC on other remuneration-related items and provided consulting support on non-remuneration related issues.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group the professional body for executive remuneration consultants.
PwCs fees in respect of advice to the Committee in the year under review were 59,275 and were charged partly on a xed fee basis and partly on a time and expenses basis, in line with the rms standard terms of business for advice provided.
During the year, Addleshaw Goddard LLP was also engaged by the Committee to provide legal advice on contractual arrangements and share schemes.
Unless otherwise stated, these advisors have no other connection with the company.
The Committee, based on its experience, is satisfied that the advice it received from these organisations was objective and independent.
Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy in the following year As reported on page 68 there will be no increase in base salary for Mathew Dunn, the outgoing CFO, nor will he be eligible to receive an annual bonus or awards under the long-term incentive plans in 2018 19.
Any newly appointed CFO during 2018 19 will be remunerated in line with the approved Remuneration Policy and so may receive an annual bonus and or awards under the long-term incentive plans as appropriate.
The new Remuneration Policy approved at the January 2018 AGM will continue to be implemented from the commencement of the new financial year 2018 19 as follows: Base salary Implemented in line with Policy.
The CEO will receive a salary increase of 2.5%, effective 1 January 2019, in line with the wider UK employee population.

Annual bonus Implemented in line with Policy, Mathew Dunn will not be eligible to participate in the 2018 19 annual bonus.
The bonus measures and weightings for 2018 19 are: Adjusted profit before tax and amortisation 50% Total net revenue 20% Net revenue from innovation 10% Adjusted free cash ow 20%.
The target award amount for the CEO is 70% of base salary and the maximum award value is 140% of base salary.
The Committee is of the view that the performance targets under the bonus plan are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the company to disclose them before the start of the financial year.
Disclosure of targets in advance could lead the company to be at a disadvantage, as many competitors are not subject to the same levels of disclosure.
Targets and the performance against them will be disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report following the end of the financial year.
Performance measures dened as follows: Adjusted profit before tax and amortisation PBTA measured before adjusting items on a constant currency basis.
Total net revenue and Net revenue from innovation measured on a constant currency basis.
Adjusted free cash ow measured excluding movements in borrowings, dividend payments and adjusting items.
