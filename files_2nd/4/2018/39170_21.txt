The first DSP award will be made in June 2018 at 62.5% of Michael Harper the maximum available, reflecting performance against the Remuneration Committee Chairman, 24 May 2018 stretching annual underlying operating profit target.
However, this DSP award will not vest in full unless the FY18 profit performance 122.5m is achieved in FY21.
Even then the vested shares must be retained for a further two years.
The 2018 DSP award is, therefore, an initial contingent share award in a six-year programme providing a clear link to the shareholder experience.
No shares awarded under the legacy Performance Share Plan PSP in 2015 vested in 2018 as the challenging threshold targets were not met.

Stretching Targets are set by the Committee to ensure executives are incentivised to outperform, whilst delivering sustainable levels of performance.

70 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Deferred Share Plan DSP Scheme interests awarded during the financial year ended 31 March 2018 The Deferred Share Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
A maximum award of 125% of salary may be made to the CEO and CFO with the amount contingent on meeting a stretching annual performance target based on QinetiQs strategic growth plan.
Once the award has been made, it is deferred for three years and remains subject to a performance underpin: any vested shares are then subject to a further two-year holding period.
Setting performance targets FY18 The FY18 DSP performance measure was underlying operating profit but with more stretching performance targets than those set for the BBP.
Calibration was set with a maximum of 125% of salary available for achieving Stretch and 35% of the maximum payable at Target performance.
The performance targets were set by the Remuneration Committee so as to be stretching.
Audited information 2018 performance outcome The 2018 Deferred Share Plan award was measured against 2018 underlying operating profit with the following calibration.
% Max award % Salary Total Measure Weighting Threshold Target Stretch Actual achieved awarded 000 Underlying operating 100% 110.0m 117.0m 130.0m 122.5m 62.5% 78.1% profit CEO 454,818 CFO 346,029 Underlying operating profit achievement at 122.5m is therefore 62.5% of maximum resulting in an award of 78.1% of salary for the CEO and CFO.
The DSP award is also subject to a stretching performance underpin which must be achieved before shares vest to the benefit of the participant.
The profit outturn for 2018 122.5m must be maintained at the end of the year of vesting 2021 for the shares to vest.
If this is not maintained then, at a minimum, 50% of the award will lapse.
Any vested shares must be retained for a further two-year period.
The share value is based on the 30-day average share price ending on 31 March 2018: this is 2.06.
It is anticipated that 2018 Deferred Share Plan awards will be made on or around 1 June 2018.
The eventual number of contingent shares awarded will therefore be detailed in the 2019 Directors Remuneration Report.

The 2015 PSP award measurement period was to 31 March 2018 and the Committee reviewed performance against the EPS and TSR performance measures at the May 2018 meeting.

Executive Directors have five years to achieve the required level through, at a minimum, retaining 50% of the after-tax shares vesting from Company incentive plans.
The CEO does not currently meet the minimum shareholding requirement: with a current holding equivalent to 37% of base salary using a share price of 2.09 three-month average to 31 March 2018.
This reflects his appointment date as CEO and the lack of any opportunity for share-based awards to vest.
The CFO does not currently meet the minimum shareholding requirement: with a current holding equivalent to 30% of base salary using a share price of 2.09 three-month average to 31 March 2018.
This reflects his recent appointment as CFO and the lack of any opportunity for share-based awards to vest.

The Committee has chosen to demonstrate the Companys performance against this index as it is the index in which the Company is listed.
This comparator group is also used to measure TSR performance in the PSP under which no future awards will be made.
Until a common methodology is established the Committee will not publish a CEO pay ratio as this number is of little relevance on a stand-alone basis and external comparisons are invalid unless the disclosure is calculated on a consistent basis.
The Committee considers pay relativities throughout the business as part of its deliberations and will continue to do so.
The 2017 single figure has been restated in respect of benefits as explained above.
