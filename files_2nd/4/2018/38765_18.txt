The Committee intends to review remuneration policy for Executive Directors in its entirety in 2019 and this will be put to a shareholder vote at our 2020 AGM.
Gender pay gap for 2018 Pearsons Great Britain gender pay gap report for 2018 was published earlier this month based on data as at 5 April 2018.
Overall, we have seen a slight improvement in the overall median gender pay gap which has reduced from 15% to 14%.
While some progress has been made, it is clear there is still more to be done.
Since publishing our first report last year, a broader Diversity & Inclusion action plan has been put in place, which will keep us focused on tackling this issue in the coming year and beyond.
Further details of this are outlined within Pearsons published report.
Overview Our strategy in action Our performance Governance Financial statements Section 4 Governance Remuneration 113 The following summarises how current policies and implementation compare against the main provisions of the 2018 Code.
Pension alignment As part of our review of policy in 2017, we lowered the pension opportunity such that new appointments are eligible to receive pension contributions of up to 16% of pensionable salary or a cash allowance of up to 16% of salary.
During 2019 we will further review our approach to pension to ensure it remains appropriate in the context of the retirement provisions provided across the wider workforce.
Holding periods Our LTIP awards are subject to a two-year holding period following vesting and therefore already comply with this aspect of the 2018 Code.
Post-employment shareholding guidelines With effect from 2018, Pearson introduced a requirement whereby Executive Directors are required to retain half of the current guideline for a period of two years post-retirement in respect of shares vested from company incentive plans.
We will continue to monitor market practice and shareholder sentiment in this area to ensure our approach remains appropriate.
Apply judgement and discretion Policy already allows the exercise of discretion to adjust outcomes under incentive frameworks.
We have in place the Committees ability to do this and therefore already comply with the Code in this area.
Recovery provisions Incentive arrangements are already subject to malus and clawback provisions and therefore already comply with the Code in this area.
During 2019, we will review the circumstances in which malus and clawback may be applied to ensure that this continues to be appropriate.
Wider workforce remuneration The Committee already reviews remuneration arrangements for Pearson Executive Management and our terms of reference have now been amended to include these roles formally within the Committees remit.
During the year, the Committee took steps to strengthen further the information provided to the Committee regarding broader workforce remuneration and related policies to ensure that these are fully taken into account when determining Remuneration Policy and implementation for Executive Directors.

Additional cash allowances may apply in specific circumstances.
In October 2017, the CEO reached the maximum service accrual under the Pearson Pension Plan as he had over 20 years of service.
He therefore receives no further service-related benefits under this Plan but continues to receive a taxable cash supplement of 26% of base salary in lieu of the previous FURBS arrangement.
New appointments are eligible to join the Money Purchase section of The Pearson Pension Plan and receive contributions of up to 16% of pensionable salary or may receive a cash allowance of up to 16% of salary.
2019 implementation There will be no changes to the pension provision of the existing Executive Directors.
As noted above, during 2019 we will further review our approach to pension to ensure that it remains appropriate in the context of the retirement provisions provided across the wider workforce.
