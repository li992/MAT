He will be proposed for election as an Executive Director of the Boards of NV and PLC at the AGMs in May 2019.
The Committee approved the remuneration package for Alan Jope set out in the table below shown as for CEO, which came into effect from 1 January 2019, and will remain unchanged if he is appointed as an Executive Director at the May 2019 AGMs.
His remuneration package is in accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy.

52 Governance Report Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018 ELEMENTS OF REMUNERATION AT A GLANCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MCIP CONTINUED The target range for ROIC has been reduced by 50bps from the MCIP 2018- 21 cycle to reflect the dilutive impact of IFRS16 Lease Accounting.
The target range for UEPS was increased in previous MCIP cycles to reflect the benefit of the Share Buyback programmes in 2017 and 2018 and the significant step up in margin required to achieve an Underlying Operating Margin of 20% by 2020.
The target range has now been normalised to reflect the reduction in operational leverage following the earlier years of margin improvement and the reduction in benefit from the Share Buyback programmes over the 2019-2022 performance cycle.
Accordingly, the UEPS target range returns towards the levels originally set for MCIP 2017-2020 of 5% to 10%.
The range has been widened to reflect the impact of exchange rate volatility in delivering current currency UEPS over a four-year plan cycle.
The Committee views 6% compound annual growth in UEPS as a stretching but achievable target for 2019-2022.
It should also be noted that the Remuneration Policy provides the Committee with the ability to adjust the formulaic outcome of MCIP by - 10% to reflect the underlying performance of the business.
Performance update on Sustainability Progress Index for MCIP: With effect from 2017, one of the performance measures for MCIP is our progress on sustainability, measured by the sustainability progress index SPI.
The SPI is an assessment made jointly by the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Responsibility Committee CRC taking into account Unilevers wider progress on sustainability together with progress towards the targets in our reported USLP scorecard.
The Committees determine a numerical rating for the previous years SPI in the range of zero to 200%: annual ratings will then be tallied as an average SPI Index for each four-year MCIP performance period.
At the end of the year, the Committees will disclose a progress report on the years SPI performance assessment.
At the end of the MCIP performance period the Committee will disclose a narrative setting out the SPI performance achieved and the corresponding outcome that the Committee has determined for the SPI over the four-year cycle.
The SPI score for MCIP performance years 2017 and 2018 relating to the USLP reports of 2016 and 2017 respectively is set out below.
To avoid over-focus on a small number of elements, the 2017 SPI assessment was undertaken on a holistic basis.
USLP targets were assessed on progress towards the targets end date, rather than in the year.
Each target was rated as: on-plan for target date achievement: off-plan for target date: and percentage achieved by target date where the target date has already passed.
For the 2018 assessment, the SPI was reviewed in terms of: i progress towards the 10 USLP pillar targets: ii Unilevers transformational change agenda: iii our performance on sustainable living brands: and iv the impact of Unilevers activity on Sustainability.
Thereby, the SPI assessment included progress of important workstreams as well as towards wider ambitions which flow from the USLP about how we should lead industry and coalition groups to drive change.
This recognises major problems that are central to our business, such as for example the contribution of Palm Oil to deforestation and climate change, or the damage to the oceans, food chains and fresh water supplies from single use plastics.
MCIP performance year USLP SPI Report year score Summary of rationale for SPI score 2017 USLP 120 2016 saw good progress across the USLP with 80% of Report 2016 our detailed targets on track, and seven of the nine pillar targets on track.
We continued to pursue our transformational change agenda with impact, driving action on Water Sanitation and Hygiene WASH, climate change, sustainable agriculture and empowering women at the same time as driving business growth through more purpose-led brands.
Our Sustainable Living Brands grew 50% faster than the rest of the business.
We had the top position in the most important independent rankings and indices worldwide.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Governance Report 53 DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED ELEMENTS OF REMUNERATION AT A GLANCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MCIP CONTINUED MCIP performance year USLP SPI Report year score Summary of rationale for SPI score 2018 USLP 120 In 2017 we made significant progress on our Report 2017 transformational change agenda with impact, driving action on WASH, climate change, sustainable agriculture, empowering women and responsible digital marketing.
We also improved our progress on brands with purpose, with Sustainable Living Brands contributing 70% of turnover growth.
Unilevers activities remained highly influential with consistently high scores on independent rankings and indices worldwide.
Internally our employee engagement scores showed very strong affiliation with our USLP and sustainable growth.
We remained on track for seven of the nine pillar targets except Water and the Inclusive Business pillar and around 80% of our 50 USLP targets.
A number have been achieved well in advance of their target date.
For 2019, the CRC will again review which elements should be included in the SPI performance assessment.
Throughout 2019 the CRC will review progress on sustainability with a view to providing the Committee with their annual SPI assessment and recommendation.
ULTIMATE REMEDY MALUS AND CLAW-BACK Grants under the GSIP and MCIP are subject to ultimate remedy as explained in the Remuneration Policy.
Malus and claw-back apply to all performance-related payments as explained in the Remuneration Policy.
In 2018, the Committee did not reclaim or claw back any of the value of awards of performance-related payments to Executive Directors.

On 3 May 2018, the CEO invested 67% 1,353,400 and the CFO invested 67% 659,531 of their 2017 annual bonus in MCIP investment shares the CEO elected to invest fully in NV shares, and the CFO elected to receive an equal number of shares in each of PLC and NV, in line with the share choice provisions in operation at the time.
b F ace values are calculated by multiplying the number of shares granted on 3 May 2018 by the share price on that day of PLC 39.55 and NV 45.79 respectively, assuming maximum performance and therefore maximum vesting of 150% for MCIP and then translating into euros using an average exchange rate over 2018 of 1 0.8835. c F ace values are calculated by multiplying the number of shares granted on 16 February 2018 by the share price on that day of PLC 38.02 and NV 43.97 respectively, assuming maximum performance and therefore maximum vesting of 200% for GSIP and then translating into euros using an average exchange rate over 2018 of 1 0.8835.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Governance Report 57 MINIMUM SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENT AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHARE INTERESTS UNAUDITED The remuneration arrangements applicable to our Executive Directors require them to build and retain a personal shareholding in Unilever by the later of 2018 or five years from their date of appointment to align their interests with those of Unilevers shareholders.
Incoming Executive Directors will be required to retain all shares vesting from any share awards made since their appointment until their minimum shareholding requirements have been met in full.
The table below shows the Executive Directors share ownership against the minimum shareholding requirements as at 31 December 2018 and the interest in NV and PLC ordinary shares of Executive Directors and their connected persons as at 31 December 2018.
When calculating an Executive Directors personal shareholding the following methodology is used: Fixed Pay at the date of measurement, in line with the application of the new Reward Framework to our Executive Directors resulting in a fide facto increase in the share ownership requirement applicable to them from the previous multiple of base salary.
Shares in either Unilever PLC or Unilever N. V. or a combination of both will qualify provided they are personally owned by the Executive Director, by a member of his immediate family or by certain corporate bodies, trusts or partnerships as required by law from time to time each a connected person.
Shares purchased under the MCIP, whether from the annual bonus or otherwise, will qualify as from the moment of purchase as these are held in the individuals name and are not subject to further restrictions.
Shares or entitlements to shares that are subject only to the Director remaining in employment will qualify on a net of tax basis.
Shares awarded on a conditional basis by way of the GSIP or MCIP will not qualify until the moment of vesting ie once the precise number of shares is fixed after the three-year vesting period for the GSIP, or a four-year vesting period for the MCIP, has elapsed.
The shares will be valued on the date of measurement or, if that outcome fails the personal shareholding test, on the date of acquisition.
The share price for the relevant measurement date will be based on the average closing share prices and the euro sterling US dollar exchange rates from the 60 calendar days prior to the measurement date.
Executive Directors are required to hold shares to the value of 100% of their shareholding requirement for 12 months post cessation of employment at Unilever, and 50% of these shares for 24 months post cessation of employment with Unilever.
ULE members are required to build a shareholding of 400% of Fixed Pay 500% for the CEO.
This requirement is 150% of Fixed Pay for the Top 100 management layer below ULE.

Until his Retirement Date he will assist with an orderly transition and handover of responsibilities.
In accordance with his service agreement and our Remuneration Policy, Paul Polman: will continue to receive Fixed Pay and benefits up to the Retirement Date: remained eligible to receive a discretionary bonus in respect of 2018, determined by the Compensation Committee in the normal way and at the normal time dependent on the Companys performance, and paid to him wholly in Unilever N. V. shares after deduction for tax withholding which he will be required to hold until the second anniversary of the Retirement Date see pages 55 to 56 for details : will not participate in the MCIP 2019-2022 and will not receive any bonus in respect of the 2019 financial year: as he is retiring, will be treated as a good leaver and hence his outstanding awards under the MCIP and GSIP long term share incentive plans will remain capable of vesting in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan.
Consequently, it is anticipated that these awards will be pro-rated as follows reflecting Paul Polmans actual length of service within the vesting period: a GSIP and MCIP 2016 2018 vested on 11 February 2019: 100% see page 56 for details : b GSIP 2017 2019 vesting around 13 February 2020: 79%: c MCIP 2017 2020 vesting around 17 February 2021: 57%: d GSIP 2018 2020 vesting around 17 February 2021: 46%: and e MCIP 2018 2021 vesting around 16 February 2022: 31%: and will then vest, subject to Company performance, on the respective vesting dates: will remain subject to the Companys minimum shareholding requirements and needs to retain Unilever shares worth at least 5 times his annual Fixed Pay level until the first anniversary of the Retirement Date and 50% of that amount until the second anniversary of the Retirement Date.
Additionally, the Company will continue to pay Paul Polmans social security obligation in his country of residence on all Unilever source income arising to protect him against the difference between the employee social security obligations in his country of residence versus the UK.

PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CEO CFO The table below shows the percentage change from 2017 to 2018 for Fixed Pay, other benefits excluding pension and bonus for the CEO, CFO and all UK and Dutch management in Unilever.
The subset of UK and Dutch management has been used as a fair representation of our dual listing status.
Other benefits not including % change from 2017 to 2018 Fixed Pay Bonus pension a b CEO 11.3% -16.5% -19.2% a c CFO 8.2% -10.5% 8.3% d UK and Dutch management 8.0% 4.9% -0.2% a Calculated using the data from the Executive Directors single figure table on page 54 for information on exchange rates please see the footnotes in that table.
b The CEO Fix ed Pay and other benefits figures reflect the implementation of our new Reward Framework in 2018, including the consolidation of conditional supplemental pension accrual into Fixed Pay from the 2018 AGMs, and changes in the relevant sterling:euro exchange rates.
The reduction in benefits value is also due to variations in charges for social security and tax return preparation fees, both of which decreased in 2018. c The incr ease in Fixed Pay shown for the CFO reflects the implementation of our new Reward Framework in 2018, including a 5% increase in Fixed Pay with effect from the 2018 AGMs, and changes in the relevant sterling:euro exchange rates.
The increase in benefits value is due to an increase in private medical insurance costs.
d F or the UK and Dutch management population, Fixed Pay numbers have been restated to include cash-related benefits employees receive as part of their total compensation, to ensure we can accurately compare Fixed Pay for the management population against that of the CEO and CFO.
Figures are also affected by changes in the average sterling:euro exchange rates for 2017 and 2018, as well as a lower bonus performance ratio in 2018 compared to 2017.

Year 25th Percentile Median Percentile 75th Percentile Mean Pay Ratio Year ending 31 December 2018 Salary: 28,804 37,000 50,021 Pay and benefits excluding pension : 34,400 41,443 57,800 Pay ratio Option A : 301 250 179 147 Figures for the CEO are calculated using the data from the Executive Directors single figure table on page 54 where relevant, translated into pounds using the average exchange rate over 2018 1 0.8835.
Option A was used to calculate the pay and benefits excluding pension of the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile UK employees because the data was readily available for all UK employees of the group and Option A is the most accurate method as it is based on total full-time equivalent total reward for all UK employees for the relevant financial year.
Figures are calculated by reference to 31 December 2018, and the respective salary and pay and benefits excluding pension figures for each quartile are set out in the table above.
Full-time equivalent figures are calculated on a pro-rated basis.
Annual bonus and long-term incentives GSIP and MCIP were not calculated following the statutory method for single-figure pay.
Instead, variable pay figures were calculated using: target annual bonus values multiplied by the actual bonus performance ratio for the respective year so disregarding personal performance multipliers, which equal out across the population as a whole : target GSIP values multiplied by the actual GSIP performance ratio for the respective year, based on closing share prices on the vesting date : and MCIP values calculated at an appropriate average for the relevant Work Level of employees, ie an average 45% investment of bonus for WL3 employees: 60% for WL4-5 employees with vesting again at actual MCIP performance ratio, based on closing share prices on the vesting date : and for WL6, based on actual variable pay awards and corresponding vesting rates.
The reason for this is it would be unduly onerous to recalculate these figures when, based on a sample, the impact of such recalculation is expected to be limited.
We expect to report on trends in these figures and links to wider pay, reward and progression policies in future years in line with relevant reporting requirements.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Governance Report 63 DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The table below provides a more detailed breakdown of the fixed and variable pay elements for each of our UK and Dutch Work Levels, showing how each Work Level compares to the CEO and CFO in 2018 with equivalent figures from 2017 included for comparison purposes.
CEO CFO PAY RATIO COMPARISON split by xed variable pay WL1 CEO 264.8 x WL1 | CFO 113.8 x WL1 CEO 134.3 x WL2 | CFO 37.3 x WL2 WL2 CEO 142.0 x WL2 | CFO 61.0 x WL2 CEO 45.5 x WL3 | CFO 12.6 x WL3 WL3 CEO 48.5 x WL3 | CFO 20.8 x WL3 CEO 18.9 x WL4 | CFO 5.2 x WL4 WL4 CEO 22.8 x WL4 | CFO 9.8 x WL4 CEO 5.8 x WL5 | CFO 1.6 x WL5 WL5 CEO 7.5 x WL5 | CFO 3.2 x WL5 CEO 3.2 x WL6 | CFO 0.9 x WL6 WL6 CEO 3.8 x WL6 | CFO 1.6 x WL6 CEO 3.6 x CFO CFO CEO 2.3 x CFO CEO 0m 1m 2m 3m 4m 5m 6m 7m 8m 9m 10m 11m 12m 2018 Fixed 2018 Variable 2017 Fixed 2017 Variable Figures for the CEO and CFO are calculated using the data from the Executive Directors single figure table on page 54.
Accordingly, the year-onyear comparison reflects the implementation of our new Reward Framework for Executive Directors in May 2018, and so is impacted by both midyear structural change and ongoing fluctuation in the exchanges rates used to convert pay elements denominated in pounds sterling to euros for reporting purposes.
For our other Work Levels, variable pay figures are calculated on the basis set out in the preceding paragraphs.
Fixed Pay figures reflect all elements of pay including allowances and benefits paid in cash, but exclude pensions.
This year, we have also expanded the table to include data for our WL1 non-management staff in the UK and Netherlands.
Changes in pay ratios between 2017 and 2018 reflect a lower bonus performance ratio in 2018 90%, compared to 122% in 2017, and lower GSIP and MCIP vesting outcomes which play an increasing part in total reward from WL3 upwards, particularly with the introduction of the new Reward Framework for our WL4-6 employees in 2017 and our WL3 employees in 2018, with an invitation to participate in MCIP extended to WL2 employees in 2018 as well.
Year-on-year comparisons also reflect changes in the average sterling:euro exchange rates for 2017 and 2018: where relevant, amounts for 2018 have been translated using the average exchange rate over 2018 1 0.8835, and amounts for 2017 have been translated using the average exchange rate over 2017 1 0.8756.
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SPEND ON PAY The chart below shows the relative spend on pay compared with dividends paid to Unilever shareholders and underlying earnings.
Underlying earnings represent the underlying profit attributable to Unilever shareholders, adjusted to eliminate various items, and provides a good reference point to compare spend on pay.
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SPEND ON PAY 0.8% Underlying earnings 4.2% Dividends paid to Unilever shareholders -2.4% Total staff costs 0m 1,000m 2,000m 3,000m 4,000m 5,000m 6,000m 7,000m 2018 2017 In c alculating underlying profit attributable to shareholders equity, net profit attributable to shareholders' equity is adjusted to eliminate the post-tax impact of non-underlying items in operating profit and any other significant unusual terms within net profit but not operating profit see note 7 on page 96 for details.
64 Governance Report Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018 THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE The Committees membership was further refreshed in 2018.
Vittorio Colao, Marijn Dekkers and Mary Ma served throughout this period, with Vittorio Colao being appointed Chair on 3 May 2018, upon Ann Fudges retirement: Andrea Jung joined the Committee on the same date.
The Committee reviewed its terms of reference during the year.
The Committees revised terms of reference are contained within The Governance of Unilever, and are also set out on our website.
com investor-relations  As part of the Board evaluation carried out in 2018, the Boards evaluated the performance of the Committee.
The Committee also carried out an assessment of its own performance in 2018.
While overall the Committee members concluded that the Committee is performing effectively, the Committee has agreed to further enhance its effectiveness by monitoring the responsiveness of the Reward Framework to rapidly evolving market conditions and adding a finance briefing session on the continued appropriateness of performance measures for incentive plans.
ADVISERS While it is the Committees responsibility to exercise independent judgement, the Committee does request advice from management and professional advisers, as appropriate, to ensure that its decisions are fully informed given the internal and external environment.
Tom Gosling of  PwC provided the Committee with independent advice on various matters it considered.
During 2018, the wider PwC firm has also provided tax and consultancy services to Unilever including tax compliance, transfer pricing, other tax-related services, contract compliance reviews, internal audit advice and secondees, third-party risk and compliance advice, cyber security advice, sustainability assurance and consulting: PwC has also been assisting with financial due diligence on M&A transactions undertaken by the Unilever Group.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK, which is available online.
com Code of Conduct: Executive Remuneration Consulting The Committee is satisfied that the PwC engagement partner and team, which provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with Unilever N. V. or Unilever PLC that might impair their independence.
The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.
The fees paid to PwC in relation to advice provided to the Committee in the year to 31 December 2018 were 146,650.
This figure is calculated based on time spent and expenses incurred for the majority of advice provided, but on occasion for specific projects a fixed fee may be agreed.
During the year, the Committee also sought input from the CEO Paul Polman, the Chief Human Resources Officer Leena Nair and the EVP Global Head of Reward Peter Newhouse on various subjects including the remuneration of senior management.
No individual Executive Director was present when their own remuneration was being determined to ensure a conflict of interest did not arise, although the Committee has separately sought and obtained Executive Directors own views when determining the amount and structure of their remuneration before recommending individual packages to the Boards for approval.
The Committee also received legal and governance advice from the Chief Legal Officer and Group Secretary Ritva Sotamaa and the General Counsel Executive Remuneration & Employment Margot Fransen.
