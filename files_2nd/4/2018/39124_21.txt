2 Details of the performance targets for the 2015 award were included in the annual report on remuneration in 2017.
3 Half of the 2016 and 2017 award vests subject to EPS growth with 20% of this part of the award vesting for EPS growth of 5% per annum through to full vesting for EPS growth of 11% per annum.
The remaining half of the award is subject to absolute TSR with 20% of this part of the award vesting for 8% absolute TSR per annum and full vesting for absolute TSR of 15% per annum.
No vesting takes place below the threshold performance levels with straight-line vesting taking place between threshold and maximum performance levels.
In addition: 1 with regard to the absolute TSR performance targets, that part of the award will not vest unless the committee is satisfied that the TSR performance is a genuine reflection of the underlying performance of the Company: and 2 with regard to the absolute EPS performance targets, that part of the award will not vest unless the committee is satisfied that the vesting is consistent with the broader financial performance of the Company.
Full details of historic performance targets have been fully set out in previous directors remuneration reports.
2016 awards Vesting of the 2016 LTIS awards, which was due to take place on 1 March 2019, was split equally between the Companys annualised growth in adjusted EPS and its annualised absolute TSR over the three-year performance period.
The minimum performance requirements were not met, therefore the vesting outcome of the 2016 LTIS is zero and the awards lapsed.
For information, the performance metrics and targets were as follows: Percentage vesting of EPS Annualised growth in adjusted EPS part of award Outcome Below 5% 0% 5% 20% 0% vesting 11% 100% Percentage vesting of TSR Annualised absolute TSR part of award Outcome Below 8% 0% 8% 20% 0% vesting 15% 100% A sliding scale of vesting on a straight-line basis applied between the lower and upper EPS and TSR targets.
The Companys annualised growth in adjusted EPS over the performance period was minus 586% which did not exceed the minimum annualised growth in adjusted EPS target of 5%, resulting in no part of the EPS element of the award vesting.
Aon, the Committees remuneration advisors, also confirmed that the Companys annualised TSR over the three-year performance period was minus 37.5%, which fell below the minimum annualised TSR target of 8%, resulting in no part of the TSR element of the award vesting.

2 PSP bonus deferral and matching plan The PSP is a bonus deferral and matching plan.
Deferred bonuses vest after three years.
Under the DRP, Matching Awards can be made on the deferred bonus with a value of up to two matching shares for each deferred bonus share.
However, as reported last year and to align with best practice, the facility to grant Matching Awards was discontinued in 2018.
There is a mandatory deferral of bonus for Executive Directors which is a minimum of one third of any bonus awarded.
2018 awards In 2018, no bonuses were awarded to the Executive Directors in respect of 2017 performance.
As a result, there was no deferral of bonus andno PSP Awards were made in 2018.
No Matching Awards were granted as disclosed in the 2017 DRR.
