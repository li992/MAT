As in previous years, the specific targets will not be disclosed while still commercially sensitive The weighting of these metrics is as follows: eps 50% RAOC 15% operating cash flow 15%, and strategic non-financial goals 20% There will be an eps underpin, such that if eps is below threshold there is no bonus payout.
This combination of performance measures provides a balance relevant to the Groups business and market conditions as well as providing a common goal for the executive directors, senior management and shareholders.

In addition the Committee consults proactively with its major shareholders prior to making significant changes to its policy.
The Committee consulted with major shareholders and proxy voting groups on the remuneration policy that was approved at the 2017 AGM and the performance measures for the annual bonus plan for executive directors in 2018.
Discretions retained by the Committee in operating the incentive plans The Committee operates the Groups various incentive plans according to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC and IRS rules where relevant.
To ensure the efficient administration of these plans, the Committee may apply certain operational discretions.
These include the following: selecting the participants in the plans: determining the timing of grants and or payments: determining the quantum of grants and or payments within the limits set out in the policy table above : adjusting the constituents of the TSR comparator group: determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance: determining good leaver status and the extent of vesting in the case of the share based plans: determining the extent of vesting of awards under share based plans in the event of a change of control: making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events, variation of capital and special dividends : and under the annual review of weighting of performance measures, setting targets for the annual bonus plan and 2014 LTIP from year to year.
The Committee may vary the performance conditions applying to share based awards if an event occurs which causes the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance conditions, provided the Committee considers the varied conditions are fair and reasonable and not materially less challenging than the original conditions would have been but for the event in question.
94 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Legacy arrangements The directors remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM gave authority to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports or internally promoted future directors in each case, such as the payment of a pension or the unwind of legacy share plans.
Details of any payments toformer directors will be set out in the remuneration report as they arise.
Policy of executive directors external appointments With the specific approval of the Board in each case, executive directors may accept external appointments as non-executive directors ofother companies and retain any related fees paid to them.
Recruitment of executive directors approach to remuneration For the ongoing stability and growth of the Group, it is important to secure, as necessary, the appointment of high calibre executives to theBoard by either external recruitment or internal promotion.
The overarching principles applied by the Committee in developing the remuneration package will be to set an appropriate base salary together with benefits and short and long term incentives taking into consideration the skills and experience of the individual, the complexity and breadth of the role, the particular needs and situation of the Group, internal relativities, the marketplace in which the executive will operate and an individuals current remuneration package and location.
In addition, the Committee recognises that it may need to meet certain relocation expenses as appropriate.
To ensure consistency across the Board, any variable pay awards for new executive director appointments will not exceed the maximum limits set out in the policy table above.
However, in addition, for an external appointment the Committee may consider offering additional cash and or share based elements to replace deferred awards forfeited by the individual on leaving their existing employment when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Such elements, as appropriate, would be made under Section 9.4.
2 oftheListing Rules and would take account of the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to the awards forfeited.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element or benefit awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to remain in place according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the new appointment.
Executive directors service contracts Frank van Zantens service contract provides for an equal notice period from the Company and the executive of a maximum 12 months notice and any contracts for newly appointed executive directors will provide for equal notice in the future.

96 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Differences in remuneration policy for executive directors and employees in general The main difference in remuneration policy between the executive directors and employees in general is the split of fixed and performance related pay such as bonus and long term incentives.
Overall the percentage of performance related pay, in particular longer term incentive pay, is greater for the executive directors.
This reflects that executive directors have more freedom to act and the consequences of their decisions are likely to have a broader and more far reaching time span of effect than those decisions made by employees with more limited responsibility.
As a consequence only executive directors, Executive Committee members and other key employees currently 28 people are granted both executive share option and performance share awards.
Approximately 440 senior managers are granted executive share option awards on an annual basis, which helps to provide a common focus for management in the Companys decentralised organisation structure, whereas the annual bonuses are related to the performance of individual operating units.
Bonus arrangements vary throughout the Group and are related to the specific role and the country in which the employee operates.
The majority of bonus plans have quantitative targets, but the performance measures and targets vary according to each specific role.
Sales representatives often have high levels of annual bonus payments which may be commission based.
When there is a critical mass of employees within a country to make it cost-effective to do so, to encourage wider employee share ownership, an all employee share plan may be offered.
Currently plans are offered to all employees based in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, the US and the UK.
In France, employees take part in profit sharing arrangements in accordance with local regulations.
Retirement and other benefits offered to employees across the Group differ according to the country in which the job is based and the function and seniority of the relevant role.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee is provided annually with information on the salaries and proposed increases for the Executive Committee members and other senior direct reports of the Chief Executive, as well as data on the average salary increases within each geographical region within theGroup.
In addition the Committee reviews and agrees all grants of executive share options and performance share awards.
In 2019 the majority of employees across the Group have received average salary increases ranging from 2.5%5%, dependent on geographical location with the principal exception being those employees based in parts of Latin America, China and Turkey where current market salary increases are higher.
The actual increases received by employees have been based on each individuals contribution and performance as well as the market competitiveness of the salary.
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase within the geographical regions for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary increases for the executive directors and is cognisant of the Groups overall employment arrangements when reviewing and implementing the executive directors remuneration policy.
Although the Committee did not consult with employees with regard to the remuneration policy of the executive directors, the Company does monitor employees views through regular employee surveys.
