Unvested performance related options comprise the awards made under the 2011 PSP in 2016, 2017 and 2018.
Details of the performance conditions attaching to the: 2016 awards are set out on page 84: 2017 awards are set out below: all 2018 awards are set out on page 85.
Until this requirement is met no sales of shares that vest under long-term incentive plans are permitted other than to satisfy tax liabilities that arise on the exercise of share awards under such plans.
In addition, if the requirement is not met within three years of the date of appointment as a director, 50% of any annual bonus is normally deferred into shares.
The Committee considers that unfettered unexercised vested nil-cost awards are economically equivalent to shares and as such that they should count on a net of tax basis toward compliance with the share ownership guidelines.
As a result of the 2018 remuneration outcomes S G Bennett is expected to meet his share ownership requirement during 2019.
