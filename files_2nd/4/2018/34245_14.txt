Directors remuneration report On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2018.
It provides details on how directors were paid in 2018 and the link between remuneration and the Companys performance.
There are no changes to remuneration policy for 2019 and the report outlines how we intend to implement the policy in 2019.
The Report is subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2019 AGM.
The remuneration policy table, which was approved by shareholders Nigel Keen at the 2017 AGM, is annexed on pages 99 to 101.
The remuneration policy can be found on the Companys website in its entirety.

| Bovis Homes Group PLC 83 Remuneration report Introduction This annual remuneration report explains how the remuneration policy has been implemented in the year ended 31 December 2018 and how it will be implemented for 2019.
Details of remuneration in 2018 are set out first, followed by the approach for 2019.

| 84 Our governance Our governance The link between remuneration and strategy As set out in the Strategic Report, the Group has a clear set of strategic priorities designed to drive the business towards medium term targets and to enhance shareholder value.
These priorities include people satisfaction, customer satisfaction, a healthy and safe working environment, and enhanced shareholder returns through increased profitability, ROCE and total shareholder return.
Our medium term targets, to be achieved by 2020, include 4 Star customer satisfaction measured by the Home Builders Federation HBF survey score and achieved in the 2017 18 HBF year, 4,000 completions per annum, a 23.5% gross margin, administration expenses of no more than 5% of revenue, a three and a half to four year land bank, delivery of a minimum of 180 million net cash from balance sheet restructuring, and delivery of circa 25% ROCE via a focus on profitability and balance sheet optimisation.
Underlining its commitment to increasing the efficiency of the balance sheet, the Group is returning surplus capital to shareholders in the form of special dividends totalling 180 million in the three years to 2020 and the first payment of 60 million was made in November 2018.
The link between remuneration and the strategic priorities and medium term targets has been carefully considered by the Committee, including the importance of driving behaviours that underpin the culture of the business and support sustainable success.
Our medium term targets are monitored and progress measured by reference to the Groups reported KPIs of pre-tax profit, operating margin, net cash, ROCE, earnings per share, private and affordable completions, the HBF customer satisfaction score, plots added to the land bank, and involuntary staff turnover, many of which feature in the Groups incentive schemes.
Annual bonus arrangements link to the Groups near term strategic priorities and, for 2018, the Committee selected operating margin and legal completion profile measures to sit alongside the profit before tax and customer satisfaction performance measures.
Margin improvement is critical to the improvement of ROCE and the legal completion measure was designed to support a more controlled phasing of completions and assist in managing capital employed.
For 2019, focus is placed directly on average capital employed as a performance measure and customer satisfaction evolves into a threshold, reducing bonus earned if not achieved.
The LTIP takes a longer term perspective and 2018 awards saw the repeat of the HBF customer satisfaction survey score as a performance measure, albeit with a weight reduced from 33.3% to 25% of the LTIP, in addition to the financial and share price performance measures of relative total shareholder return, earnings per share and ROCE, which remained equally weighted, increased from 22.2% to 25%.
Having achieved the Groups medium term target of 4 Star customer satisfaction in the 2017 18 HBF year, the 2019 awards will return to the financial and share price based metrics.
High levels of customer satisfaction continue to be incentivised in 2019 via the near term annual bonus arrangements, as explained above.
Balance sheet optimisation and reduction in capital employed is permitting the return of capital to shareholders and is incentivised across all levels of senior management via the Project 200 Incentive Plan.
The CEO and GFD do not participate in the Plan, although the same measures and targets are being used to determine how much of the GFDs exceptional 2018 LTIP award representing an additional 75% of basic salary will vest, as explained in last years report.
The GFD has decided to waive his entitlement to the exceptional award and the Committee has accepted his decision, whilst noting individual contribution to the significant progress made on our balance sheet optimisation and cash generation, enabling the funding of return of cash to shareholders.
Key remuneration decisions during 2018 During 2018, the Committee determined the performance measures and set targets for the 2018 annual bonus shown on page 88, approved 2017 bonus payments and approved the vesting of the CEOs 2017 Bonus Award.
It also determined the performance measures and set targets for and approved LTIP awards made in 2018 and confirmed the total lapse of the 2015 LTIP awards.
Malus and clawback provisions for incentive awards and a two year post vesting holding period for LTIP awards continued to be applied in 2018.
Towards the end of 2018, the Committee completed an advisor review appointing Willis Towers Watson in place of Deloitte LLP with effect from 12 December 2018.
It also considered the structure for the 2019 annual bonus and completed the 2019 remuneration review, which included consideration of the link between executive remuneration and pay and employment conditions throughout the Group including oversight of the general proposals for staff for 2019.
The Chairmans fee was also reviewed.

Earl Sibley receives a non-bonusable and non-pensionable pension salary supplement representing the balance his pension allowance not contributed to a pension scheme.. 6 The recruitment award for Greg Fitzgerald was approved by shareholders at the General Meeting held on 2 May 2017.
The performance condition, which required the Companys total shareholder return over the period from 4 April 2017 to 31 December 2018 to be at least equal to the median of the TSR comparator group applicable to awards granted under the LTIP in 2017, has been met and the award vests in full.
The award will be paid entirely in shares, to be released in April 2020 and subject to continued employment until April 2019.
The value is calculated using the share price on the vesting date 1,025.0 pence on 21 February 2019.
Greg Fitzgerald is non-executive Chairman of Baker Estates Limited, for which he received no fee during the year, and non-executive Chairman of Ardent Hire Solutions Limited, for which his personal service company receives fees of 115,000 per annum.

A breakdown of the performance against the measurement criteria is shown overleaf.
Building on the progress made in 2017 and focusing senior management on the Groups medium term targets, the Committee adjusted the balance of financial and non-financial metrics from 50%:50% for 2017 to 60%:40% for 2018.
An operating margin measure was introduced in place of ROCE and a legal completion profile measure was adopted to place emphasis on a more controlled phasing of activity across the year and to deliver operating efficiencies, replacing the build programme delivery measure.
The operational gateway applied to the HBF survey score customer satisfaction measure continued in 2018, adjusted so that at least 70% customer satisfaction must be achieved before any of the bonus measures could pay out, as opposed to only the financial measures.
The measure related to individual performance was removed.
All targets were set in January 2018 and a maximum target was introduced for the profit before tax measure, in addition to threshold, on target and stretch.

Operating margin finished at 16.4%, exceeding the maximum target of 16.0% and a full pay-out of the 20% of allocated to this measure was delivered.
The customer satisfaction performance measure saw the Groups HBF survey score reach 86.5%, above the 80% score required for full pay-out of the 20% of allocated to this measure.

Each award is made subject to the achievement of performance criteria as set out below and will ordinarily vest after three years.
A two year holding period following vesting was introduced for the 2017 awards onwards, which extends to five years the time between awards being granted and when they can be exercised.
Provisions that enable the withholding of payment or the recovery of sums paid malus and clawback were strengthened for 2017 awards onwards.

| 88 Our governance Our governance Awards granted during 2018 audited For the 2018 awards, the Committee decided to retain customer satisfaction as a performance measure, using the independently assessed HBF customer satisfaction survey score rating, alongside the financial and share price performance measures.
The financial and share price measures and the customer satisfaction measure each comprise one quarter of awards.
An award of 123,037 shares was made to Greg Fitzgerald at 200% of basic salary in accordance with the circular to shareholders dated 7 April 2017 on 5 March 2018, calculated based on a share price of 10.83 on 2 March 2018.
The award is subject to a three year performance period ending on 31 December 2020 and exercisable in 2023, following a two year holding period, as follows: Number Face value % of face value of shares of award that would vest at Executive director Type of award awarded 000 threshold Greg Fitzgerald Performance share award 123,037 1,332 22.5 An award of 60,018 shares was made to Earl Sibley at 200% of basic salary on 5 March 2018, calculated based on a share price of 10.83 on 2 March 2018, subject to a three year performance period ending on 31 December 2020 and exercisable in 2023, following a two year holding period, as follows: Number Face value % of face value of shares of award that would vest at Executive director Type of award awarded 000 threshold Earl Sibley Performance share award 60,018 650 22.5 Consistent with prior years, threshold vesting for the proportion of the awards measured against each of the EPS, TSR and ROCE performance conditions was set at 30% of the maximum for each measure or 7.5% of the shares in the total award.
The customer satisfaction measure requires the achievement of at least 4 Star performance 80% to 89.9% and does not have a threshold.
The percentage of face value of the total award that would vest at threshold is, therefore, 22.5%.
This is 2.5% higher than the 2017 awards because the customer satisfaction measure was reduced from one third to one quarter of total awards.
The performance measures for all 2018 awards are Customer Satisfaction 25.0%, TSR 25.0%, EPS 25.0% and ROCE 25.0%.
Achieving threshold performance for the financial and share price performance measures would result in 22.5% of the total award vesting.
The proportion of the total award relating to the customer satisfaction measure lapses in its entirety should the performance target not be achieved it does not have a threshold.
The performance targets are: Customer satisfaction HBF customer satisfaction rating for the period October 2019 to September 2020 to be at least 4 Star 80% to 89.9%.
TSR threshold performance equal to the annualised median of the index and maximum performance equal to the annualised median of the index, plus 7.5% reduced from 10.0% in the prior year so that maximum performance is more closely aligned with upper quartile performance of sector peers.
EPS threshold performance at cumulative EPS of 300 pence and maximum performance at cumulative EPS of 343 pence.
ROCE threshold performance at 21.8% and maximum performance at 25.0%, both as measured in the third year of the performance period 2020.
The 2018 constituents of the TSR index, which may be subject to change, are as listed below: TSR comparator group Barratt Developments plc Bellway plc The Berkeley Group plc Countryside Properties PLC Crest Nicholson Holdings plc Persimmon plc Redrow plc Taylor Wimpey plc The award for the Group Finance Director includes a 75% exceptional element entirely measured against the same cash generation and capital employed metrics as adopted within the Project 200 Incentive Plan.
As highlighted earlier, the GFD has voluntarily decided to waive his entitlement to his exceptional LTIP award.
| Bovis Homes Group PLC 89 Remuneration report Awards vesting in respect of 2018 The LTIP awards made in 2016 were measured over the three year period to 31 December 2018 and will lapse in full.
One third of the award was measured against each of EPS performance, TSR performance against an index of the UKs leading housebuilders, and ROCE performance.
Vesting for threshold performance was set at 30% against each metric.
The threshold EPS target was 370p and the maximum target was 440p measured on a cumulative three year basis.
Absolute cumulative EPS over the three year performance period was 259.7p.
The threshold TSR target was performance equal to the annualised median of the index and the maximum target was performance equal to the annualised median of the index, plus 10%.
Actual TSR was 14.4% which was below the median of the index of 16.8%.
The threshold ROCE target was 20.5% and the maximum target was 25.3% measured in the third year of the performance period 2018.
Greg Fitzgerald - 2017 Recruitment Award audited Following approval at the General Meeting held on 2 May 2017, Greg Fitzgerald was granted a conditional right to acquire 76,786 ordinary shares of the Company the Recruitment Award to recompense him for relinquishing management of certain investments in order to take up the role as Chief Executive.
The award represented 100% of base salary and the number of ordinary shares was determined by the share price on 4 April 2017 of 8.465, being the dealing day before his appointment was announced.
Provisions that enable the withholding of payment or the recovery of sums paid malus and clawback apply to the award.
The award has the benefit of dividend equivalents.

TSR was calculated on 4 April 2017 at the start of the performance period and averaged over the three month period prior to the end of the performance period.
The Committee has determined that the performance condition has been met and that the recruitment award should vest with effect from 31 December 2018 and be payable on the third anniversary of appointment, being 18 April 2020, subject to Greg Fitzgerald remaining in employment until April 2019.
Vesting has been achieved against a backdrop of the significant progress made by the Group in both 2017 and 2018 and Greg Fitzgeralds key role in securing the Groups turnaround and establishing and progressing delivery of the Groups strategy and medium term targets.
Historical LTIP awards The table below summarises the historical long term incentive awards made to the executive directors.

The Board expects executive directors to retain 100% of the net value derived from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards as shares, after settling all costs and income tax due, until such time as executive directors hold shares with an historical cost equal to basic annual salary and, from 2017 onwards, the CEO holds shares with an historical cost equal to twice basic annual salary.

Profit before tax in 2017 was 114.0 million and in 2018 was 168.1 million, representing a increase of 47.5%.
Dividends paid to shareholders totalled 60.4 million in 2017 and 129.7 million in 2018, representing an increase of 114.7%.
Implementation of remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December 2019 Changes in the way that the remuneration policy will be implemented in 2019 versus 2018 are as follows: Base salary increases in line with or below increases awarded to the workforce.
In the annual bonus, average capital employed replaces the legal completion profile measure, to sit alongside the profit before tax and operating margin.
The customer satisfaction measure becomes a threshold, with total bonus earned starting to reduce if the threshold is not met, potentially down to zero.
The weighting given to the profit before tax measure has been increased.
For the LTIP, the financial measures and TSR will comprise 100% of awards, as opposed to three quarters, with the HBF Customer Satisfaction rating performance measure being removed it remains in the annual bonus operating as a threshold.
Executive directors base salaries and benefits The salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 2019 were as follows: % increase Executive directors Position 2019 base salary from 2018 Greg Fitzgerald appointed 18 04 17 CEO 679,575 2.0% Earl Sibley GFD 334,750 3.0% When determining the base salary increases, the Committee took account of increases awarded to the workforce as well as the individual performance of executive directors and the impact of the increase on their total compensation.
The salary of Greg Fitzgerald, the Chief Executive, was increased by 2.0%, below the award of 3.0% to the wider employee population.
The final stage of the phased approach increasing the salary of Earl Sibley was implemented in 2018 and for 2019 his salary was increased by 3.0%, in line with the wider employee population.
Whilst the base salary is competitive against the market, the Committee is mindful that Earl Sibley is remunerated at around the lower quartile pay of peers.
An allowance of just over 3% of salary was provided for general staff increases.
Benefits will continue on the same basis as for 2018.
| 94 Our governance 6% 4% 10% 7% 18% 13% m Our governance Approach to annual bonus Following the regular annual review and the success of the emphasis on operational delivery and customer satisfaction in 2018, the Committee determined that the annual bonus scheme for 2019 should be adjusted to focus on financial metrics supporting our medium term targets, whilst continuing to prioritise high levels of customer satisfaction.
The Committee has, therefore, increased the weighting for financial metrics to 100% from 60%, replaced the legal completion profile measure with average capital employed, and has redesigned the customer satisfaction measure so that it acts as a threshold, below which total bonus earned is reduced.
Threshold is set at 80% customer satisfaction in the Home Builders Federation HBF survey and at this level bonus earned on the financial metrics is triggered without reduction.
A customer satisfaction score of 79% leads to a reduction of 25% of bonus earned and scores of 77%, 74% and 70% lead to further 25% reductions, until no bonus is earned at a score of 70%.
Margin improvement is seen as critical to achieving our medium term targets and the operating margin and average capital employed measures are designed to deliver operating efficiencies and a more controlled profile of completions across the year from an appropriate level of work in progress across sites.
Lastly, the weighting for the profit before tax performance measure has been increased.
There is no change to quantum.
2018 Weighting 2019 Weighting Measure as a % of maximum as a % of maximum Profit before tax 40% 60% Operating margin 20% 20% Average capital employed n a 20% Financial measures 60% 100% Customer satisfaction HBF survey score 20% Acts as threshold Legal completion profile 20% n a Non-financial measures 40% 0% Provisions that enable the withholding of payment or the recovery of sums paid malus and clawback apply to the annual bonus in circumstances of i a serious misstatement of results: ii an error in assessing a performance condition or in the information on which the award was granted: iii serious misconduct: iv a material failure of risk management: v serious reputational damage: or vi any other circumstances that the Committee considers to be similar in nature or effect.
Malus can apply prior to the bonus payment date and clawback can apply for a two year period thereafter.
| Bovis Homes Group PLC 95 Remuneration report The Committee has decided not to disclose the detail of performance targets in advance as they are considered commercially sensitive, being closely indicative of the Groups strategy, but will disclose them retrospectively in the 2019 annual remuneration report.
The 2019 performance measures and weightings are described below.
Measure Rationale link to strategy % weighting Financial measures 100% Profit before tax Incentivise the achievement of profit targets, with the objective of 60% sustainably increasing shareholder value.
Operating margin Incentivise increase in operating margin and hence profitability.
20% Average capital employed Incentivise management of the level of capital employed within the 20% business, aligning with shareholder interests in progressively and sustainably increasing returns.
Non-financial measure Customer satisfaction Maintaining our focus on quality of service is seen as key to Acts as threshold reputation and future success, both in terms of customer demand and achieved selling prices.
Measured by the HBF survey score for legal completions between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019.
Should a customer satisfaction score of 80% not be achieved, total bonus earned from the financial measures starts to reduce.
Total opportunity 100% Approach for Long Term Incentive Plan awards The key features of the long term incentive arrangements as outlined on page 89 are expected to remain the same as those for 2018, with the exception that the TSR and financial measures will comprise 100% of awards, as opposed to three-quarters.
The HBF Customer Satisfaction rating has been removed as a performance measure, as the Group has made rapid progress in improving its performance and is expecting to return to being rated as a 4 Star housebuilder.
Provisions that enable the withholding of payment or the recovery of sums paid malus and clawback can apply to LTIP awards in certain circumstances, consistent with those that apply to the bonus, disclosed on the previous page.
Malus can apply prior to the award vesting date and clawback can apply for a two year period thereafter.
A two year holding period following vesting extends to five years the time between awards being granted and when they can be exercised.
Performance measures and targets for 2019 LTIP awards The performance measures for all 2019 awards will be TSR 33.3%, EPS 33.3% and ROCE 33.3%.
In previous years and in accordance with our policy, the vesting at threshold was set at 30% for each financial measure.
The introduction of customer satisfaction in 2017 with no threshold vesting led to a mechanical overall reduction of the level of vesting at threshold.
With the removal of customer satisfaction for 2019, the vesting at threshold would have normally reverted back to 30%.
However, the Committee has determined to set the threshold level at 25% for each measure, recognising that this is more in line with market practice.
The performance targets are: TSR threshold performance equal to the annualised median of the index and maximum performance equal to the annualised median of the index, plus 7.5%.
EPS threshold performance at cumulative EPS of 320 pence and maximum performance at cumulative EPS of 353 pence.
ROCE threshold performance at 22.0% and maximum performance at 25%, both as measured in the third year of the performance period 2021.
Pensions Pension arrangements as outlined on page 90 will continue on the same basis as in 2018.
The defined benefit scheme closed to future accrual on 28 February 2018.

The Chairmans fee had last been reviewed with effect from 29 November 2015 and, in assessing market competitiveness, was found to be below the lower quartile of comparators.
The Committee decided the increase equating to 3% per year over three years, taking account of the value delivered by the Chairman in post, that the fee level had fallen behind the market, and that it had not been reviewed for a number of years.
The non-executive director base fee was last reviewed with effect from 1 January 2017.
Remuneration of senior management and other below board employees In addition to responsibility for executive directors, the Committee is also involved in consideration of the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Leadership Team below the Board, in conjunction with the Chief Executive.
Alignment is delivered by ensuring that senior management and executive directors participate in the same bonus and incentive schemes as far as possible, with similar performance measures and targets.
The Committee has visibility of the remuneration of management teams below the Executive Leadership Team and has oversight of payment and employment conditions throughout the Group and takes these into account when setting executive pay.
The Committee is mindful of the new UK Corporate Governance Code provision regarding the alignment of pension provisions with the broader workforce.
This will form part of the review of the remuneration policy that will be conducted during 2019.

Targets for each performance measure are then set by the Committee in light of strategic objectives over the short term for the annual bonus scheme and over at least a three year performance period for the LTIP.
In setting targets the Committee takes into account a number of reference points including internal and analysts forecasts.
