Part I: Strategic Report Part II: Corporate Governance Part III: Financial Statements DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT SUPPORTING SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM VALUE CREATION ANNUAL STATEMENT DEAR SHAREHOLDERS As Chair of Cineworlds Remuneration Committee the Committee, I am pleased to present our Remuneration Report for the year to 31 December 2018.
2018 PERFORMANCE AND REMUNERATION The Group delivered a successful year of trading in 2018 with total revenue increasing to $4,119.1m and Adjusted EBITDA up to $925.4m.
The decisions in relation to executive remuneration outcomes made by the Committee were taken in the context of this performance and the successful acquisition of Regal towards the beginning of the year.
Annual bonuses for the Executive Directors which, in line with the new Directors Remuneration Policy, are based on a matrix of Group Adjusted EBITDA performance against budget, the achievement of stretching individual objectives, and the delivery of synergy benefits as a result of the Regal acquisition, paid out at the level of 91% of the maximum opportunity for each of the Executive Directors.
As earnings per share EPS performance The Group delivered a successful year targets for the Performance Share Plan PSP were reached in full over the three year period 20162018, 100% of the awards of trading in 2018 the Remuneration made in 2016 will vest.

acquisition of the Regal Entertainment Group in February 2018.
The review of our Policy also took into account developing market practice, and feedback received through a detailed round of consultation and engagement with shareholders.
The Committee has carefully noted and considered the viewpoints of shareholders in respect of the Policy.
Reflecting on this, the Committee remains confident, particularly in light of the strong business performance over the last year including delivering in respect of the synergy targets, that the amendments to the Policy were appropriate given the significant increase in size and complexity of the business, and the consequential increase in the responsibilities of the Executive Directors.
The Board believes that the Policy is fundamental to the delivery of the Companys ongoing strategic objectives, and that it provides key support for sustainable long-term value creation for the Group.
An At a Glance summary on page 57 sets out the key elements of the Policy, describes how it was implemented in 2018, and illustrates the linkage between strategy, payments to directors, and short and long-term business performance.
The full Policy can be viewed on the Companys website at www.
More information regarding application of the Policy in 2018, and the intended implementation in 2019, may be found on pages 57 to 66.

The Chair of the Committee is Dean Moore.
Alicja Kornasiewicz will join the Committee as Chair from the date of the AGM.
The Committees principal responsibilities are to: make recommendations to the Board for approval of the Groups broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary, and Senior Management: determine the specific remuneration packages of the Chairman, the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and Senior Management: approve the terms of the service agreements of the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and Senior Management: and approve the design of, and determine the targets for, any performance related pay schemes and LTIPs.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Companys website www.
The terms are reviewed annually.
The Committee met for four scheduled meetings during the period and details of the members attendance record is set out on page 42.
In addition to the four scheduled meetings, the Committee met for a number of ad hoc meetings.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE ADVISORS The Company continued to receive advice from PwC during the year in relation to the Remuneration Policy and its implementation in respect of the Chairman, Executive Directors, Company Secretary and Senior Management.
PwC was appointed by the Remuneration Committee in September 2017 following a competitive selection process.
The terms of engagement are available on request from the Company Secretary.
PwC attended four scheduled meetings during the year at the request of the Committee.
PwCs fees for advice to the Committee were 84,200.
As founder members of the Remuneration Consultants Group, PwC operates under the Voluntary Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
Additionally as a member firm of the ICAEW, PwC complies with the ICAEWs ethical guidelines.
As a result, PwC operates under rigorous rules on independence, compliance and quality assurance.
PwC has no other connections with Cineworld except in respect of internal audit support provided to the Companys Risk and Assurance Team.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by PwC is objective and independent, and is comfortable that the PwC engagement partner and team that provide remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with the Company that may impair their independence.
On appointment as advisors, the Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were no conflicts or potential conflicts arising.
The Committee also received assistance from the Chairman of the Company Anthony Bloom, the Chief Executive Officer Moshe Greidinger, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Israel Greidinger, the Chief Financial Officer Nisan Cohen, the Senior Vice President of Human Resources Tara Rooney and the Company Secretary Fiona Smith, although they did not participate in discussions relating to the setting of their own remuneration.
The Committee also consulted with the Chief Executive Officer and received recommendations from him in respect of changes to remuneration packages for Senior Management.
BOARD CHANGES IN 2018 Renana Teperberg and Camela Galano were appointed to the Board on 19 July 2018.
Renana Teperberg was appointed as an Executive Director and is the Chief Commercial Officer of the Company.

58 Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Part I: Strategic Report Part II: Corporate Governance Part III: Financial Statements REMUNERATION FOR 2018 This section covers the reporting period from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 and provides details of the implementation of the Companys Remuneration Policy during the period.
Single Total Figure Table audited information The table below gives a single figure for the total remuneration and breakdown for each Executive and Non-Executive Director in respect of the 2018 financial year.
Comparative figures for the 2017 financial year have also been provided.
2 The value of PSP shares vesting in respect of the period has been calculated using a share price of 2.824 being the average price for the last three months of the period as the PSP will not vest until 18 April 2019, and includes payment of a cash sum equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares in respect of dividend record dates occurring between grant and vesting.
Currently, the dividend equivalent payment to Moshe Greidinger would amount to 86,941, the dividend equivalent payment to Israel Greidinger would amount to 59,277, the dividend equivalent payment to Nisan Cohen would amount to 4,331, and the dividend equivalent payment to Renana Teperberg would amount to 4,552.
Further details of these awards are set out on page 65.
3 Nisan Cohen and Dean Moore were appointed to the Board on 11 January 2017.
4 Renana Teperberg and Camela Galano were appointed to the Board on 19 July 2018.
Figures for Renana Tepebergs remuneration in the table above in respect of salary, benefits, pension, and bonus have been pro-rated to reflect the portion of the year for which Renana was a Director.
The figure for the value of the PSP shares vesting has not been pro-rated.
5 Fees for Non-Executive Directors in 2017 were paid as outlined in last years Directors Remuneration Report.
However, the total fees paid to Non-Executive Directors for 2015 17 exceeded the limit in the Articles of Association at that time.
As a result, a portion of Non-Executive Director fees were waived in 2018 to offset this amount, and the figures in the table above reflect the actual fees paid during the year.
The Articles of Association have been amended to reflect a higher limit going forward.
6 Martina King left the Board on 11 January 2017.
7 Details of the actual gains made are set out on page 65.
The actual figures set out in the table above differ from those included in the 2017 Annual Report as last year an estimated value of 6.349 per share was used to calculate the theoretical gain, as the awards had not yet vested.
The figures above reflect the share price of 2.574 on the date of vesting, 23 April 2018, adjusted to reflect the February 2018 rights issue.
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 59 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Base Salary audited information The base salaries of the Executive Directors are usually reviewed on an annual basis.
As described in the Policy, the Committee compares the Groups remuneration packages for its Executive Directors and employees with those for Directors and employees of similar seniority in companies whose activities are broadly comparable with those of the Group.
It also takes into account the progress made by the Group, contractual considerations, and salary increases across the rest of the Group.
To reflect the substantial increase in the scale and complexity of the Group as a result of the Regal acquisition and the pursuant responsibilities of the Executive Directors, as well as the CFOs progression in role since his appointment, the Executive Directors base salaries were increased with effect from 28 February 2018 being the date of the acquisition of Regal as set out in the table below.
Average salaries across the Group were increased by 2.5%.
Salary levels as at the end of the financial period were: 1 Moshe Greidinger 630,000 p. a.
1 Israel Greidinger 505,000 p. a. Nisan Cohen 395,000 p. a. Renana Teperberg 395,000 p. a.
1 Part of Moshe Greidingers and Israel Greidingers salaries are paid in Israel to enable social security and government healthcare deductions to be made.
Pension audited information Executive Directors are invited to participate in a Group Personal Pension Plan, which is a money purchase plan, or alternatively may receive a pension allowance in cash.
The Executive Directors have elected not to participate in this scheme and instead receive a cash pension allowance.
For 2018 this was 20% of salary for the CEO and Deputy CEO, and 14.8% of salary for the CFO and CCO.
Company pension contributions allowances for the period were: 000 Moshe Greidinger 124 Israel Greidinger 97 Nisan Cohen 56 Renana Teperberg 26 Figures in respect of Renana Teperbergs pension reflect her entitlement for the portion of the year for which she was a Director.
Other Benefits audited information Benefits in kind for Executive Directors comprised the provision of a company car or car allowance, private mileage, life insurance, permanent health insurance and private medical cover.
Moshe Israel Nisan Renana Benefit Greidinger Greidinger Cohen Teperberg Car car allowance 14,000 14,000 Permanent health insurance private medical cover 2,602 1,676 2,602 1,176 Life assurance 1,164 22,180 2,873 1,299 Disturbance allowance 40,000 40,000 Israel Greidinger and Moshe Greidinger both received a disturbance allowance of 40,000 for the period as, under the terms of their employment contracts, they are required to spend a sufficient and proportionate amount of time at the Companys head office in Brentford, Greater London.
Figures in respect of Renana Teperbergs health and life insurance reflect her entitlement for the portion of the year for which she was a Director.
Annual Bonus audited information Annual bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors in the year was a maximum of 150% of base salary for the CEO and Deputy CEO and 100% of base salary for the CFO and CCO.
As described in the Policy, two thirds of the annual bonus for the year was determined by a matrix of Adjusted EBITDA compared to budget, and the achievement of specified individual objectives.
The choice of these measures reflects the Committees belief that incentive compensation should be tied both to the overall performance of the Group and to those areas of the business that the relevant individual can directly influence.
The weighting between the Groups financial performance and personal performance for this element of the annual bonus was circa 80%:20%.
The remaining third of the annual bonus for the year was determined based on the delivery of synergy benefits as a result of the Regal acquisition, measured through the Adjusted EBITDA synergies delivered during 2018.
The Committee retains the absolute discretion to apply malus and clawback by reducing or withholding annual bonus payments from the formulaic outcome based on Adjusted EBITDA performance for example, in the event of misconduct or misstatement of financial results.
PERSONAL OBJECTIVES The individual performance element for the CEO, Deputy CEO, CFO and CCO for 2018 focused on the strategic growth agenda of the Group.
For the CEO and Deputy CEO, emphasis was placed initially on the successful completion of the acquisition of Regal in February2018 and, thereafter, on the continued integration work in relation to the Regal business.
In addition, objectives focused on the successful opening of new cinemas on time and on budget, the efficient implementation of the Groups construction and renovation programme, with particular emphasis on the US estate, identifying potential new cinema sites 60 Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Part I: Strategic Report Part II: Corporate Governance Part III: Financial Statements and implementing technological advances appropriate to the industry.
Further, the CEO was tasked with maintaining strong staff morale and commitment.
In addition, the Deputy CEO also focused on the efficient functioning of the Group IT and cybersecurity systems and, together with the CFO, reduction of net debt.
For the CFO, objectives also included managing all aspects of investor relations, ensuring that robust and appropriate financial controls and systems are maintained across the Group, and ensuring timely reporting to key stakeholders.
Objectives also covered the monitoring of the newly enlarged Groups financial Key Performance Indicators, based on the Groups strategy.
Focus areas for the CCO included leading commercial activity across the Group, managing key relationships with major suppliers, and leading the Group Film and Marketing departments.
Performance Against Objectives The Committee judged the individual objectives to have been achieved at the top level out of five for the Executive Directors.
In making this assessment, the Committee considered a number of factors, including the successful completion of Regal, the positive progression of the integration plans, and the delivery of the integration benefits at a level greater than originally expected, at a faster pace.
The opening of 13 new sites 108 screens during the year, taking the Group to 9,518 screens at 31 December 2018, and the new agreements signed with IMAX 55 screens, 4DX 80 screens and ScreenX 100 screens were also taken into account.
Additional factors were the positive progression of the refurbishment programme across the estate, creating high quality, next generation cinemas with the latest audio and visual technology, the reduction of net debt, and the successful implementation of key IT systems Group-wide.
As part of the assessment process, the Committee took recommendations from the Chairman in respect of the CEO and Deputy CEO, and from the CEO and Deputy CEO in respect of the CCO and CFO respectively.
The table below shows the 2018 annual bonus targets and performance achieved against them.
Threshold Maximum Bonus paid Adjusted EBITDA bonus bonus EBITDA synergies Individual opportunity opportunity % of % of performance delivered performance 000 000 maximum salary 000 Above and Moshe Greidinger Beyond 192 945 91% 137% 861 100% of maximum 105% of Above and budgeted Adjusted Israel Greidinger Beyond 154 758 91% 137% 690 Adjusted EBITDA Above and EBITDA synergies Nisan Cohen Beyond 80 395 91% 91% 360 achieved target achieved Above and Renana Teperberg Beyond 80 395 91% 91% 360 The bonus figure of 163,000 for Renana Teperberg as reported in the Single Total Figure Table on page 59 has been pro-rated to reflect the portion of 2018 during which Renana served as a Director.
The table above shows the full amount of the bonus.
The Adjusted EBITDA synergy benefit target for FY18 of $40m was achieved in full.
As a result, the maximum bonus was payable under this element.

The Remuneration Committee believes these to be the most appropriate comparators as Cineworld is a member of both indices.
For 2014, it represents a combination of two months of Stephen Wiener and ten months of Moshe Greidinger who both held the office of CEO during 2014.
2 The increase in the CEO single figure between 2015 and 2016 primarily relates to the first vesting of a PSP award to the CEO since appointment.
The value of this award vesting increased due to the significant increase in the Companys share price over the vesting period.
3 Moshe Greidinger, CEO, did not have an LTIP which vested in this year.
For those who did, the proportion was 100%.
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 63 Total Shareholder Return rebased to 100 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Percentage Increase in CEO Remuneration The percentage changes in the value of salary, non-pension benefits and bonus between 2017 and 2018 for the CEO and employees generally are set out in the table below: 1 2 CEO Employees Salary 9.0% 2.5% Non-pension benefits 25.6% 2% Annual bonus 92% 8.3% 1 The increases in respect of salary and bonus are reflective of the revised payments and bonus opportunity under the new Policy, which was updated in 2018 to take account of the substantial increase in the scale and complexity of the Group as a result of the Regal acquisition, and the significant increase in Mr Greidingers responsibilities.
2 The figures reflect increases for UK-based monthly salaried employees excluding the Senior Management group.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 65 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY IN 2019 The Remuneration Committee intends to implement the Policy for 2019 as set out below.
For the 2019 financial year the salaries and other benefits of the Executive Directors will be reviewed in the usual manner, with any salary increases being effective from 1 July 2019.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity will be 150% of salary for the CEO and Deputy CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO and CCO.
In line with the Policy, two-thirds of the bonus will be based on performance against Adjusted EBITDA targets and individual strategic objectives, with the remaining third being based on strategic targets, which for the 2019 financial year will be based on the delivery of synergy benefits as a result of the Regal acquisition.
Bonus payments will be subject to Committee discretion to apply malus and, following payment, the Committee will retain the discretion to claw back bonuses in the case of misconduct or misstatement of financial results.
The face value of awards granted under the LTIP in 2019 will be 200% of salary for the CEO and Deputy CEO and 150% of salary for the CFO and CCO.
The calibration of targets for these awards is set out in the table below.
EPS growth performance Vesting level Less than 8% p. a. Nil 8% p. a.
100% Between 8% and 15% p. a. Straight-line basis In considering the appropriate calibration of targets, the Committee has taken into account both the internal business plan and external analyst estimates based on the enlarged Group following the acquisition of Regal.
The Committee believes that the growth targets are stretching and, if they are achieved, a significant amount of value will have been created for shareholders.
Given the international nature of the Group, the Committee continues to believe that UK retail price index inflation is a less directly relevant factor and will therefore express the targets as absolute growth levels.
As with the 2018 awards, in addition to the EPS performance condition, the Committee, in its absolute discretion, will need to be satisfied that an award holder has performed their duties at a satisfactory level over the three years from date of grant in order for awards to vest.
The Committee, therefore, will retain the absolute discretion to apply malus to unvested awards, by reducing or withholding vesting.
Following vesting, the Committee will also retain the discretion to claw back LTIP shares in the case of misconduct or misstatement of financial result.
In addition, a two year post-vesting holding period will apply to the 2019 awards for Executive Directors, bringing the total period from grant to release to five years, in line with the Code requirement.
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE The sections The Remuneration Committee and its Role and Remuneration Committee Advisors also form part of the Corporate Governance Statement, and are incorporated into that statement by reference.
