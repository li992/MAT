Minimum relates to the value of the package assuming that current salary, benefits and pension alone are paid.
The on-target annual bonus opportunity is assumed to be 50% of the maximum award for the purposes of these illustrations.
The actual on-target level may vary from year to year reflecting the performance scale applied.
The on-target vesting level under LTIP is assumed to be 50% of the maximum award.
The maximum scenario assumes full bonus pay-out and full vesting of LTIP awards.
No assumption as to share price growth is made in either the on-target or the maximum scenarios.
Approach to recruitment and promotions The remuneration package for a new executive director would be set in accordance with the terms of the companys prevailing approved remuneration policy at the time of recruitment.
In particular, the annual bonus potential will be limited to 150% of salary and awards under the LTIP will be limited to 150% of salary.
In the case of an external hire, if required to secure an individual, the committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements, when it considers them to be in the best interests of the company, to take account of deferred remuneration forfeited by the new hire when leaving their former employer.
Any such additional buy-out payments would be one-off in nature, would reflect where possible the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that forfeited remuneration and would be limited to the value of the forfeited remuneration.
For the avoidance of doubt, there is no formal limit on the value of any such buy-out awards.
For an internal promotion to executive director level, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out in accordance with its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For both external and internal appointments, the committee may agree that the company may meet certain relocation and or incidental expenses asappropriate.
Service agreements and exit payment policy Newly appointed executive directors are offered a service agreement with a notice period of one year.
In the event of the employment of an executive director being terminated, the committee would take into account the commercial interests of the company, pay due regard to best practice and apply usual common law and contractual principles, including the individuals duty to mitigate their loss.
The payment of any annual bonus in respect of the year of termination is subject to the discretion of the committee, which may determine that an annual bonus is payable with respect to the period of the financial year served, but pro-rated for time served, and not paid until the normal due date for the payment of bonuses.
The vesting of any LTIP awards will be governed by the rules of the LTIP.
Awards will normally lapse unless the individual is considered a good leaver.
An individual would generally be considered a good leaver if they left the groups employment by reason of death, injury, ill health, disability approved by the committee, or retirement, although the committee has the absolute discretion to treat any individual as a good leaver for any other reason.
In the case of a good leaver, payments would normally be scaled back to recognise the shorter period of service than the award was intended to cover and remain subject to outstanding performance conditions.
If the individual terminates employment during a holding period for an LTIP award, the holding period will normally continue to apply in respect of the performance-vested shares, unless the committee thinks it is appropriate to allow the earlier release of shares in the particular circumstances.

On succession planning, this year has seen the successful recruitment and induction of a number of operating board appointments.
Succession plans are in place for key direct reports and a range of other critical roles elsewhere in the business have been filled.
Theremuneration committee was satisfied that the objectives set at the start of the year had been met and thus awarded 4.4% against the 6.7% of bonus opportunity available onthis metric.
On embedding our values and ways of working the committee noted the launch of the groups Winning Ways values programme but felt that more work was needed to create a compelling culture across the group, and the committee therefore awarded 2.2% against the 6.7% of bonus opportunity on this metric.
No bonus was paid to Kirk Davis in relation to the free cash flow target given the position at his termination date.
The achievement on the year-end cash position was achieved through a programme of activity initiated by Richard Smothers on his arrival.
Notwithstanding the fact that cost savings were made overall during the year, the remuneration committee considered that a number of key elements of the original cost reduction planhad not been delivered satisfactorily, and used its discretion to determine that no amount would be payable in respect of the cost savings target for either Kirk Davis or Richard Smothers this year.
The financing target for Kirk Davis related to the progress made with regard to the refinancing of part of the Spirit debenture.
With the Ambac guarantee having been terminated and the A1, A6 and A7 bonds prepaid during the year, the remuneration committee awarded 8.3% of bonus opportunity against this target, as these were the objectives set for the year.
T he personal targets for Kirk Davis related to succession planning and values ways of working.
Whilst progress was made in relation to succession planning for certain of his key direct reports, insufficient progress was made with regard to employees below that level or other key finance roles and thus the remuneration committee determined that he should beawarded 2.2% against a bonus opportunity of 6.7% for this metric.
On values ways of working some progress was made and so the committee awarded a further 2.2% of bonus opportunity against this metric.
No bonus was paid to Richard Smothers in relation to the financing target as the target was met to the stretch level by Kirk Davis.
The personal targets for Richard Smothers related to succession planning and values ways of working.
The committee determined that an outcome of 6.7% out of 13.3% wasappropriate for the period during which he has been in the role, as he only joined the group in December 2017.
66 GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2018 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Audited information continued Annual bonus continued Performance against the combined financial and individual targets resulted in bonuses being paid at 419k 65% of salary and 43.3% of opportunity forRooney Anand, 131k 49% of pro-rated salary and 32.7% of bonus opportunity for Kirk Davis and 90k 52.5% of pro-rated salary and 35.0% ofbonus opportunity for Richard Smothers.
The CEOs bonus outcome at 43.3% of maximum opportunity represents an appropriate outcome for the year considering the companys overall performance in a challenging trading environment.
Although the PBTE target was not achieved albeit against very robustly set targets, the free cash flow outcome was important as an indicator of our ability to continue to pay a dividend and invest further in our estate togenerate future returns to benefit our shareholders.
In addition, progress was made regarding customer NPS in our Pub Company division and employee engagement, both of which are very important lead indicators of our future performance: we are ultimately a customer service and people-centred business.
The CEOs progress on personal measures succession planning, values and culture also covered matters designed to reinforceour resilience as a business and set us up for the future.

However, both Rooney Anand and Kirk Davis had a target relating to Spirit Pub Company synergies of 34.9m39.9m, and the outcome was not precisely disclosed last year due to its commercial sensitivity.
