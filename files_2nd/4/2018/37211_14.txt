The TSR condition for 2016 and 2017 PSP awards compares the TSR over the three months prior to the start of thefinancial year in which the grant is made with the three months prior to the end of the third financial year.
The comparator group is the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding IT as at the start of the relevant performance period.
The revised revenue growth and TSR conditions for 2018 were introduced after consultation with shareholders which explained the alignment of these metrics to the Companys strategy.

The FTSE 250 Index excluding IT was chosen as a comparator because it represents a broad equity market index of which the Company has been a constituent for the majority of the period since its listing in April 2014.

As the Company listed in April 2014, part of the 2014 remuneration relates to when Just Eat was a privately owned group.
Percentage change in remuneration of the Director undertaking the role of Chief Executive Officer unaudited The table below presents the year-on-year percentage change in remuneration received by the Chief Executive Officer, compared with the change in average remuneration received by all UK employees.
This was chosen as a suitable comparator group as it includes UK contact centre employees but excludes senior management and international employees, who are on different pay structures.

The data for the Chief Executive Officer in 2017 and 2018 is shown on the basis of a comparison between data for Peter Plumb in 2018 and a blended position for 2017, reflecting the amounts paid to each of David Buttress, John Hughes, Paul Harrison and Peter Plumb for the part of the year in which each held the role of Chief Executive Officer or Executive Chair.
The increase in short-term incentives is due to the comparison to the blended position used in 2017.
For the periods they were Chief Executive Officer in 2017 David Buttress and John Hughes received no bonus.
The decline in taxable benefits to employees in the UK is due to the reduced expenses related to relocation.

Remuneration policy table unaudited Element and purpose Base salary This is the core element of pay and reflects the individuals role and responsibilities within the Group with some adjustment to reflect their capability and contribution.
Policy and Base salaries will be reviewed each year by the Committee.
operation Salary levels are reviewed by reference to FTSE listed companies of a similar size and complexity.
The Committee generally views pan-sector data from companies 30 in market capitalisation of the Company as an appropriate reference point.
The Committee also has regard to other relevant factors including corporate and individual performance and any changes in an individuals role andresponsibilities.
Base salary is paid monthly in cash.
Changes to base salaries normally take effect from 1 January.
Maximum The Remuneration Committee will apply the factors set out in the section above in considering any salary adjustments during the duration of this policy.
Increases in base salaries for Executive Directors will be generally guided by any increases for the broader employee population, but on occasion may need to recognise, for example, an increase in the scale, scope or responsibility of the role.
No increase will be made if it would take an Executive Directors salary above 788,000 being the median level of salaries for Chief Executive Officers in the FTSE 31100, provided that this figure will be increased in line with UK retail price index inflation for the duration of this policy.
Performance N A measures Cap for base salaries is re-expressed, and relative positioning is confirmed with removal of the Changes from previous policy application of the previous 20% discount to market data.
Benefits To provide benefits valued by recipients.
Policy and The Group provides market-competitive benefits in kind.
Details of the benefits provided in each operation year will be set out in the Implementation Report.
The Executive Directors receive a car allowance, private medical cover and insurance benefits.
The Remuneration Committee reserves discretion to introduce new benefits where it concludes that it is in the interests of Just Eat to do so, having regard to the particular circumstances and market practice.
Where appropriate, the Company may meet certain costs relating to Executive Director relocations and if necessary expatriate benefits.
Maximum It is not possible to prescribe the likely change in the cost of insured benefits or the cost of some of the other reported benefits year to year, but the provision of benefits will operate within an annual limit of 100,000 plus a further 100% of base salary in the case of relocations and expatriate benefits provided that relocation benefits may be paid only in the year of appointment and for a further two financial years.
The Remuneration Committee will monitor such costs in practice and ensure that the overall costs do not increase by more than the Remuneration Committee considers to be appropriate in all the circumstances.
Performance N A measures Changes from Commuting cost allowances for Executive Directors have been removed.
previous policy 78 Just Eat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Corporate governance Element and purpose Pension To provide retirement benefits.
Policy and Executive Directors can receive pension contributions to personal pension arrangements or the operation equivalent amount can be paid as a cash supplement in lieu of pension contributions reduced for the impact of employers NICs.
Maximum The maximum employers contribution is limited to 10% of base salary per annum, although it is not currently anticipated that contributions will increase above the current 5% level for the duration of this policy.
Performance N A measures Changes from No material changes.
previous policy Annual Bonus Plan To motivate employees and incentivise delivery of performance over a one-year operating cycle, focusing on the short medium-term elements of our strategic aims.
Policy and Annual Bonus Plan levels and the appropriateness of measures are reviewed annually at the operation commencement of each financial year to ensure they continue to support our strategy.
Annual Bonus Plan outcomes will be calculated following the determination of achievement against performance measures and targets.
For the financial year 2018 onwards, the Annual Bonus Plan outcomes will be delivered partly in cash and partly as a deferred award of Just Eat shares.
Any Annual Bonus Plan outcomes achieved above 75% of base salary will be delivered as a deferred award of shares, and with the period of deferral being three years with one-third of the amounts deferred vesting and being capable of release at each annual anniversary of the making of the deferred award.
Deferred awards will be a right to receive shares for nil cost with the shares either being delivered automatically at vesting or being delivered at a time following vesting at the individuals choice.
If appropriate, dividend entitlements for deferred shares will accrue over the deferral period and be delivered as additional vesting shares.
Malus clawback provisions apply to the Annual Bonus Plan, and to amounts deferred in Just Eat shares, as explained in the notes to this table.
Maximum The maximum level of Annual Bonus Plan outcome for an Executive Director is 150% of base salary per annum for the duration of this policy.
Performance The performance measures applied may be financial or non-financial, corporate, divisional or measures individual and in such proportions as the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee would, however, expect to consult with its major shareholders if it proposed changing materially the current performance measures applied for the Annual Bonus Plan or the relative weightings between such measures in subsequent financial years.
Once set, performance measures and targets will generally remain unchanged for the year, except to reflect events such as corporate acquisitions or other major transactions where the Committee considers it necessary in its judgement to make appropriate adjustments.
Attaining the threshold level of performance for any measure will not produce a payout of more than 25% of the maximum portion of overall annual bonus attributable to that measure, with a sliding scale to full payout for maximum performance.
The Annual Bonus Plan remains a discretionary arrangement and the Remuneration Committee retains a standard power to apply its judgement to adjust the outcome of the Annual Bonus Plan for any performance measure from zero to any cap should it consider that to be appropriate.
Changes from Introduces a deferral of any Annual Bonus Plan outcome of over 75% of base salary into shares.
previous policy Increases the maximum annual bonus potential for the Chief Financial Officer to the same level as that of the Chief Executive Officer at 150% of base salary per annum from 120%.

Policy and Awards under the PSP may be granted as nil-cost options, conditional awards or forfeitable shares operation which vest to the extent that performance conditions are satisfied over a period of at least three years.
Under the PSP rules, vested awards may also be settled in cash although this will typically be the case only if required to comply with non-UK legal constraints.
Vested awards for Executive Directors will be subject to a further two-year holding period during which time awards may not normally be exercised or released but are no longer contingent on performance conditions nor future employment.
If appropriate, dividend entitlements will accrue until the end of the holding period in respect of performance-vested shares and be delivered as additional vesting shares.
Malus clawback provisions apply to the PSP as explained in the notes to this table.
Maximum The formal limit under the PSP allows awards over shares worth 200% of base salary in a financial year and 300% in exceptional circumstances.
This excludes any dividend equivalent accruals.
The Remuneration Committee expressly reserves discretion to make such awards as it considers appropriate within these limits.
Performance The Remuneration Committee may set such performance measures on PSP awards as it considers measures appropriate whether financial or non-financial, and whether corporate, divisional or individual.
The Remuneration Committee would, however, expect to consult with its major shareholders if itproposed changing materially the current performance measures applied for PSP awards madeto Executive Directors or the relative weightings between such measures in subsequent financial years.
Once set, performance measures and targets will generally remain unaltered unless events occur which, in the Remuneration Committees opinion, make it appropriate to alter the performance conditions in such manner as the Committee thinks fit.
Performance may be measured over such periods as the Remuneration Committee selects at grant, which will not be less than, but may be more than, three financial years.
No more than 20% of awards vest for attaining the threshold level of performance conditions.
Removes previously unused facility to grant market-priced share options to Executive Directors.
Changes from previous policy Confirms that no material changes will be made to the performance measures or the relative weightings for such measures for PSP without consulting major shareholders.

Policy and Executive Directors are able to participate in all employee share plans on the same terms as other operation Group employees as required by HMRC legislation.
"The Sharesave Plan and Share Incentive Plan ""SIP"" are all employee share plans established under HMRC tax-advantaged regimes and follow the usual form for such plans."
Maximum The maximum participation levels for all employee share plans will be the limits for such plans set by HMRC from time to time.
Performance Consistent with normal practice, such awards are not subject to performance conditions.

previous policy 80 Just Eat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Corporate governance Element and purpose Shareholding guidelines To further align the interest of Executive Directors with those of shareholders.
Policy and Executive Directors are expected to retain 50% of the shares vesting under all share plans after any operation disposals for the payment of applicable taxes until such time as they hold a minimum of 400% of their base salary in shares.
Only beneficially owned shares and performance-vested share awards discounted for anticipated tax liabilities may be counted for the purposes of the guidelines and this includes performance-vested shares subject to a continued holding period.
Share awards do not count prior to vesting.
Once shareholding guidelines have been met, individuals are expected to retain these levels as a minimum.
The Remuneration Committee will review shareholdings annually in the context of this policy.

previous policy Chair and Non-executive Director fees To enable the Company to recruit and retain a Chair and Non-executive Directors of the highest calibre, at the appropriate cost.
Policy and The fees paid to the Chair and the fees of the other Non-executive Directors aim to be competitive operation with other listed companies of equivalent size and complexity.
The fees payable to the Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board.
The fees payable tothe Chair are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
All fees will be subject to periodic review.
For Non-executive Directors, the fee structures may involve separate fees for chairing or for membership of Board Committees or for acting as Senior Independent Director.
No benefits are envisaged for the Non-executive Directors including the Chair but the Company reserves the right to provide benefits including travel and office support within the prescribed limits.
Fees are paid monthly in cash.
Maximum The aggregate fees and any benefits of the Chair and Non-executive Directors will not exceed the limit from time to time prescribed within the Companys Articles of Association for such fees currently 2 million per annum.
Any increases actually made will be appropriately disclosed.
The Companys reserves the right to vary the structure of fees within this limit including, for example, introducing time based fees or reflecting the establishment of new Board Committees.
previous policy Notes to the remuneration policy table 1.
Travel and hospitality Whilst the Committee does not consider travel and hospitality to form part of benefits, it has been advised that corporate hospitality whether paid by the Company or another and certain instances of business travel including any related tax liabilities settled by the Company or the Group for Executive Directors, Non-executive Directors and the Chair including their family members may technically be considered as benefits.
The Remuneration Committee expressly reserves the right to authorise such activities and reimbursement of associated expenses within its agreed policies.
Deemed benefits from JSOP participation Payments to any Director in respect of the deemed cost of interest on loans relating to participation in the JSOP and, if relevant, the writing off of any such loans are benefits within the scope of the Directors remuneration policy.
The value of any such amounts is in addition to the maximum amounts stated in the table above for benefits for Executive Directors and for Chair and Non-executive Directors fees.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Just Eat plc 81 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Annual report on remuneration continued Notes to the remuneration policy table continued 3.
Stating maximum amounts for the remuneration policy table The DRR regulations and related investor guidance encourage companies to disclose a cap within which each element of remuneration policy will operate.
Where maximum amounts for elements of remuneration have been setwithin the remuneration policy table, these will operate simply as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration.
Malus and clawback Malus being the forfeiture of unvested awards and clawback being the ability of the Company to claim repayment of paid amounts as a debt provisions apply to the PSP and Annual Bonus Plan including any future deferred amounts.
These provisions may be applied where the Remuneration Committee considers it appropriate to do so following: a misstatement of accounts: a miscalculation of vesting payouts: an act omission that justifies summary dismissal for misconduct which has no time limit : and in respect of malus only, circumstances where the Committee believes there is a risk of serious reputational damage to the Group.
Discretions reserved in operating incentive plans The Remuneration Committee will operate the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP according to their respective rules and the above remuneration policy table.
The Remuneration Committee retains certain discretions, consistent with market practice, in relation to the operation and administration of these plans including: as described in the remuneration policy table the determination of performance measures and targets and resultant vesting and payout levels: as described in the remuneration policy table the ability to adjust performance measures and targets to reflect events and or to ensure the performance measures and targets operate as originally intended: as described in the termination policy section below the determination of the treatment of individuals who leave employment, based on the rules of the incentive plans, and the treatment of the incentive plans on exceptional events, such as a change of control of the Company: and the ability to make adjustments to existing awards made under the incentive plans in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructurings or special dividends.
Differences between the policy on remuneration for Directors and the policy on remuneration of other employees When determining Executive Directors remuneration, the Committee takes into account pay throughout the Group to ensure that the arrangements in place remain appropriate.
This is more fully discussed on page 85.
Commitments under previous policies Subject to the achievement of any applicable performance conditions, Directors are eligible to receive payment from any commitments or awards made prior to the approval and implementation of the Directors remuneration policy detailed in this report.
Service contracts unaudited Executive Directors The Committees policy is that each Executive Directors service agreement should be of indefinite duration, subject to termination by the Company or the individual on 12 months notice.
The service agreements of all Executive Directors comply with that policy.
The service agreements reserve the right for the Company to make a payment in lieu of notice to an Executive Director for the base salary for the duration of the notice period and for the Chief Executive Officer only, car allowance and pension contributions.
Contracts do not contain change of control provisions but do contain provisions allowing for summary termination.
The date of each Executive Directors contract is: Name Date of service contract Paul Harrison 14 November 2017 Peter Duffy 21 January 2019 The service agreements of the Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours and at the Companys AGM, including the 15 minutes preceding the meeting.
82 Just Eat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Corporate governance Service contracts unaudited continued Chair and Non-executive Directors Each Non-executive Director and the Chair is engaged for an initial period, subject to annual renewal at the AGM.
For Non-executive Directors, other than the Chair, these engagements can be terminated by either party on three months notice.
The Non-executive Directors are not entitled to any pension benefits and are not entitled to any payment in compensation for early termination of their appointment beyond the three months notice referred to above.
For each Non-executive Director the effective date of their latest letter of appointment is: Name Date of appointment Term Mike Evans 6 March 2018 Annual reappointment Frederic Coorevits 10 July 2009 Annual reappointment Andrew Griffith 12 March 2014 Annual reappointment Gwyn Burr 12 March 2014 Annual reappointment Diego Oliva 24 September 2015 Annual reappointment Roisin Donnelly 17 October 2016 Annual reappointment Alistair Cox 2 May 2017 Annual reappointment Helen Weir 1 December 2018 Initial engagement first annual reappointment at 2019 AGM 1 David Buttress 9 August 2017 Retired from the Board effective 26 April 2018 1.
David Buttress was an Executive Director from 8 April 2014 to 8 August 2017.
The letters of appointment of the Non-executive Directors are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours and at the Companys AGM, including the 15 minutes preceding the meeting.
Recruitment remuneration policy unaudited The Companys recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and promotion of high calibre executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets necessary to deliver the Groups strategic aims.
In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new Executive Director, the starting point for the Committee will be to apply the general policy for Executive Directors as set out on the previous pages and structure a package in accordance with that policy.
Consistent with the DRR regulations, the caps contained within the policy for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, although the Committee would not envisage exceeding these caps in practice.
The Annual Bonus Plan and PSP will operate including the maximum award levels as detailed in the remuneration policy table in relation to any newly appointed Executive Director.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses as it considers appropriate in the year of appointment and for a further two financial years.
For external candidates, it may be necessary to make additional awards in connection with the recruitment to buy out awards forfeited by the individual on leaving a previous employer.
For the avoidance of doubt, buy-out awards are not subject to a formal cap.
For any buy-outs, the Company will not pay more than is, in the view of the Committee, necessary and will in all cases seek, in the first instance, to deliver any such awards under the terms of the existing Annual Bonus Plan and PSP.
It may, however, be necessary in some cases to make buy-out awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing Annual Bonus Plan and PSP for example, specific arrangements under Listing Rule 9.4.
All buy-outs, whether under the Annual Bonus Plan, PSP or otherwise, will take account of the service obligations and performance requirements for any remuneration relinquished by the individual when leaving a previous employer.
The Committee will seek to make buy-outs subject to what are, in its opinion, comparable requirements in respect of service and performance.
However, the Committee may choose to relax this requirement in certain cases such as where the service and or performance requirements are materially completed, or where such factors are, in the view of the Committee, reflected in some other way, such as a significant discount to the face value of the awards forfeited and where the Committee considers it to be in the interests of shareholders.
Exceptionally, where necessary, such buy-outs may include a guaranteed or non-pro rated annual bonus in the year of joining.
A new Non-executive Director would be recruited on the terms explained above in respect of the main policy for such Directors.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Just Eat plc 83 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Annual report on remuneration continued Termination policy summary unaudited It is appropriate for the Committee to consider treatment on a termination having regard for all of the relevant facts and circumstances available at that time.
"This policy applies both to any negotiations linked to notice periods on a termination see ""Service contracts"" above and any treatments that the Committee may choose to apply under the discretions available to it under the terms of the Annual Bonus Plan, the proposed new Deferred Share Bonus Plan and the PSP."
Thepotential treatments on termination under these plans are summarised in the table below.

84 Just Eat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Corporate governance Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group Pay and employment conditions generally in the Group are taken into account when setting Executive Directors remuneration.
The Committee receives regular updates on overall pay and conditions in the Group.
The same reward principles guide reward decisions for all Group employees, including Executive Directors, although remuneration packages differ to take into account appropriate factors in different areas of the business: Annual bonus the majority of Group employees participate in an Annual Bonus Plan, although the quantum and balance of corporate to individual objectives vary by level.
This scheme was rolled out further in 2018 and for some of the levels the variable pay they receive has increased as well.
Just Eat will continue to adapt and evaluate this scheme to ensure that it is incentivising the right behaviours, encouraging an ambitious culture that delivers success.
PSP key Group employees participate in the PSP currently based on the same performance conditions as those for Executive Directors, although the Committee reserves the discretion to vary the performance conditions for awards made to employees below Board level.
All employee share plans the Committee considers it is important for all employees to have the opportunity to become shareholders in the Company.
The Company offers a Sharesave Plan across eight countries.
This plan has seen very high participation rates from employees and it is something the Board remains behind offering on an annual basis.
Thefirst grant made in 2015 vested in 2018 and many employees doubled the value of their savings when they exercised the related Sharesave option.
Reflecting standard practice, the Company did not consult with employees in preparing this Remuneration Report.
The Remuneration Committee is cognisant of requests from, amongst others, the Investment Association for companies to publish ratios comparing Chief Executive Officer to employee pay ahead of the requirement to do so for FY2019.
TheRemuneration Committee has not, however, published the equivalent data for 2018 in the Directors Remuneration Report as Peter Plumb has stepped down as Chief Executive Officer after the end of the 2018 financial year, although Peter was Chief Executive Officer in 2018.
Consideration of shareholders views Each year the Remuneration Committee takes into account the approval levels of remuneration-related matters at our AGM in determining that the current Directors remuneration policy remains appropriate for the Company, and considers any specific representations made by our shareholders on pay matters.
The Remuneration Committee also seeks to build an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments on the remuneration aspects of corporate governance generally and any changes to the Companys Executive pay arrangements in particular.
