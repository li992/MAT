The Remuneration Committee believes that the Company has complied with the provisions regarding remuneration matters contained within the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Part 1: Annual Statement As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and on behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our report on directors remuneration for 2017 18.
At the 2017 AGM, shareholders endorsed a revised Remuneration Policy for the period to the 2020 AGM with 98.6% of votes cast in favour.
This year, rather than reproduce in full the approved Policy, we have instead provided extracts from it.
A copy of the complete Remuneration Policy can be found in our January 2017 Annual Report and Accounts which is available on our website.
Pay and performance outcome for 2017 18 Total remuneration As outlined in our Strategic Report, the uncertain economic environment and changing consumer behaviour have meant that 2017 18 has been a year of change and challenge for NEXT.
Given the stretching performance targets set by the Committee, total remuneration earned by the executive through the year was significantly lower versus the previous year.
The Committees overarching goal is to ensure that the remuneration paid to senior executives is appropriate in both amount and structure, is directly linked to the Companys annual and long term performance and is aligned with the interests of shareholders.
The current Remuneration Policy is designed to support this objective and the incentive pay outcomes for the executive directors for the year reflect NEXTs performance accordingly, with no annual bonus awards and no Long Term Incentive Plans vesting.
Total annual remuneration earned for 2017 18 by Lord Wolfson was 37% lower than his total remuneration in 2016 17 which itself was lower than that earned in 2015 16, and between 16% and 23% lower for the other executives.
The Committee considers that the current structure of the remuneration arrangements promote the long term success of the Company within an appropriate risk framework and are suitably aligned to enhancing shareholder value and the Companys objective of delivery of long term sustainable growth in total shareholder returns TSR.
Moreover, we believe our rigorous approach to target setting and linking pay to performance means that the actual remuneration earned by the executive directors continues to be a good reflection of their and NEXTs overall performance.
Annual bonus As has been the case for many years at NEXT, annual bonus is calculated with reference to pre-tax EPS, including the impact of share buybacks.
In the 2014 Remuneration Report we first set out the basis on which we would ensure that executive directors are not incentivised to recommend share buybacks to the Board in preference to special dividends, or vice versa.
This is achieved by making a notional adjustment to EPS growth for special dividends, on the basis that the cash distributed had instead been used to purchase shares at the prevailing share price on the day of the special dividend payment.
The growth in pre-tax EPS in the year, as adjusted for special dividends, was below the target threshold and no bonus was earned for 2017 18, as was also the case in 2016 17.
Details of the targets set for 2017 18 are on page 75.
71 Remuneration Report Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP LTIP awards are granted twice a year each at 100% of base salary for executive directors and during the year the Committee approved two grants.
Two LTIP awards reached the end of their three year performance period and for both awards NEXTs TSR ranked below median i. e. threshold out of 21 companies in the comparator group, so these awards did not will not pay out.
Details of the comparator group are set out on page 83.
Awards granted to executive directors which vest must be taken in shares and the net shares after payment of tax and NIC must be held for a minimum period of two further years.
Matters addressed during the year The Committee has addressed the following matters this year: Remuneration policy The Committee gave full consideration to the operation of the Policy prior to proposing it to shareholders at the 2017 AGM and considers the level of support obtained to be a strong endorsement.
During the year the Committee also reviewed the latest best practice guidance and considered the current remuneration landscape to identify if any potential amendments to the Policy may be required.
The Committee concluded that the current Remuneration Policy continues to be the right one for the Company and its shareholders as it is aligned with the Companys annual and long term performance, with shareholder experience and with the Companys strategy, objectives and business model.
The Committee will keep under review the Financial Reporting Council consultation on a new UK Corporate Governance Code.
As detailed on page 48 of the Strategic Report, NEXT has an employee forum made up of elected representatives from throughout the business who attend meetings at least twice a year with directors and senior managers.
This forum enables and encourages open discussion on key business policies and practices.
Annual base salary review for 2018 19 The base salaries for the executive directors were increased in February 2018 by 2%, in line with the wider Company award.
Lord Wolfsons annual base salary increases have been in line with the wider Company awards since 2009.
The Committees typical approach to salary progression for those executive directors who are appointed to the Board from an internal senior managerial position is to award salary increases which are timed to reflect performance and contribution at Board level, rather than automatically applied immediately on promotion.
Salary progression is therefore usually phased over a period of approximately 1 to 4 years after promotion to the Board, subject to proven performance and development during that period.
As noted in my Statement last year, in light of the lower than expected 2016 17 profit and EPS outcome, the Committee decided to defer the planned increases in the base salaries of Michael Law and Jane Shields which would have represented the final stage in setting their pay levels at an appropriate level, reflecting excellent progression in their respective roles since their promotion to the Board in July 2013.
The Committee also decided to moderate a further interim increase in the base salary of Amanda James, notwithstanding her strong performance in the role of Group Finance Director since her promotion to the Board in April 2015.
With regard to the salary review for 2018 19, given the continuing challenges in the fashion retailing sector, the Committee considered that it was appropriate to again defer any significant phased salary increases.
However, during the year ahead the Committee will further review the salaries of the executive directors.
In February 2018, the Company announced that Michael Law will step down from the Board at the close of the 2018 AGM, prior to retiring from the business in July 2018.
The Company also announced in the same statement that Richard Papp will be promoted from within the business and appointed as an executive director with effect from 14 May 2018.
Richard will stand for election by shareholders at the 2018 AGM and, subject to the outcome of that process, will become Group Merchandise and Operations Director with effect from the end of the AGM.
It is intended that Richards salary is aligned with those of Jane Shields and Amanda James.
For information, the current executive directors and CEOs salaries continue to be positioned below the median of comparable roles in other FTSE 100 companies in general and other FTSE 100 retailers more specifically.
We believe this demonstrates our overall conservative approach to pay.
72 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information EPS and performance measurement The Committee reviews each year the basis and performance measures used for the annual bonus and LTIP.
The performance measure for the annual bonus continues to be based on pre-tax EPS.
The principal reasons for using EPS are: it is consistent and transparent to participants and shareholders: NEXT is predominantly a single business selling products through a number of channels under the NEXT and third-party brands.
No significant earnings are derived from unrelated businesses and, therefore, a group metric such as EPS is logical and consistent with strategy: the primary financial objective of the Group is to deliver long term, sustainable returns to shareholders through a combination of growth in EPS and payment of cash dividends: and the use of EPS is complemented by the application of TSR and consideration of the general economic underpin condition for the LTIP.
As set out in previous years, we consider it right that the impact of share buybacks on EPS or adjustments for special dividends should be included in performance measurement as share buybacks, and more recently special dividends, have been one of NEXTs primary strategies in returning value to shareholders.
Share buybacks or special dividends are regularly considered by the Board.
Share buybacks are subject to prior approval as to timing, price and volume.
Shares are only bought when the Board is satisfied that the ability to invest in the business and to grow the ordinary dividend will not be impaired.
Other activity during 2017 18 Further information about the work of the Committee can be found on page 86.
Context to the Committees decisions The Remuneration Committee members are keenly aware of the importance and sensitivity of remuneration issues among investors, employees and the wider public and the responsibilities which that places on us.
The Committees objective is to ensure that the remuneration paid to senior executives is appropriate in both amount and structure, is directly linked to the Companys annual and long term performance and is aligned with the interests of shareholders.
We believe that stable and transparent remuneration structures are key elements in a fair system for rewarding personal and collective contribution across the business.
There are bonus structures throughout the Company, including Head Office, stores, call centres and warehouses.
We also focus on maintaining an appropriate balance between annual and long term incentive elements and also between cash and share-based elements, with the aim of ensuring that remuneration drives the right behaviours and rewards the right outcomes.
We believe that weighting rewards towards the long term ensures proper shareholder alignment.
Executive directors receive a mix of annual and long term incentives which reward strong business and financial performance in line with the Companys strategy and which are measured against robust benchmarks.
We place special importance on rewarding consistently strong performance over longer periods and, therefore, the balance of incentives is tilted towards the LTIP, with its 3 year performance period and 2 year holding period following vesting.
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group are considered to ensure that differences for executive directors are justified.
Remuneration Policy does not conflict with the Companys approach to environmental, social and corporate governance matters and we believe the current arrangements do not encourage directors to take undue business risks.
73 Remuneration Report Wider employee considerations The Remuneration Committee is very mindful about remuneration arrangements across the Group, including performance-related pay which ensures that all employees have the potential to benefit from the success of NEXT.
There are bonus structures throughout the Company and employee share ownership is strongly encouraged.
Market value options over NEXT shares are granted each year to middle management in Head Office as well as senior store staff and participation in our Sharesave scheme is open to all of our UK and Eire employees.
Around 10,000 employees circa 25% of our total UK and Eire employees held options or awards in respect of 6.1 million shares in NEXT at the financial year end.
2018 AGM The Committee considers that the simplicity and transparency of our remuneration arrangements and their consistent application have contributed positively to NEXTs strong management team continuing to deliver resilient performance in both benign and more challenging trading environments.
I very much hope that shareholders will support the Committees overall approach and, on behalf of the Committee, I commend our 2017 18 Directors Annual Remuneration Report to you.
I look forward to receiving your support at the AGM where I will be pleased to respond to any questions shareholders may have on this report or in relation to any of the Committees activities.

74 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Implementation of Remuneration Policy The Committee has implemented the Remuneration Policy in accordance with the policy approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2017.
The table below sets out the way that the policy was implemented in 2017 18 and any significant changes in the way the policy will be implemented in 2018 19.
Element of remuneration Policy implemented during 2017 18 and changes in 2018 19 Base salary The base salary of the executive directors was increased by 2% in February 2018, in line with the wider Company award.
It is intended that Richard Papps salary is aligned with those of Jane Shields and Amanda James.
As the salaries of Jane, Amanda and Richard remain below the planned level for someone of their experience and the benchmark median, the Company will further review their salaries during the year ahead with a view to implementing the planned final instalments of their increases.
The base salaries for the executive directors from February 2018 are: 000 2018 19 2017 18 Lord Wolfson 789 773 Amanda James 425 416 Michael Law 425 416 Jane Shields 425 416 Annual bonus No changes to the bonus structure were made.
For the year to January 2018, performance targets were set requiring pre-tax EPS growth of at least -1.5% on the prior year, adjusted for special dividends and excluding exceptional gains, before any bonus became payable being pre-tax EPS of 540.7p.
Maximum bonus of 100% and 150% of salary for the executive directors and Chief Executive respectively was payable if pre-tax EPS exceeded growth of 18.5% being pre-tax EPS of 650.4p.
Pre-tax EPS growth achieved in the year, adjusted for special dividends, was -2.9%.
In accordance with the bonus formula, no bonus was earned.
Bonus performance targets for the year ahead have been set but are not disclosed in advance for reasons of commercial sensitivity.
The targets and performance will be disclosed in next years Remuneration Report.
See single total figure of remuneration table, Note 5 for details of LTIP vestings in the year.
In accordance with the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the May 2017 AGM, for any LTIP grants made after that date participants will be entitled to receive ordinary and special dividend accruals on any awards vesting under the LTIP.
Grants in 2018 19 will be otherwise made on the same basis to the 2017 18 grants with any changes to the TSR comparator group confirmed immediately prior to each grant.
Recovery and withholding No change.
The Committee previously introduced recovery and withholding provisions in the service provisions contracts of all executive directors to cover the bonus and LTIP, and a 5 year from grant holding period comprising a 3 year vesting period and a 2 year holding period under the LTIP for executive directors.
The Committee reconsidered these requirements during the year and concluded that these provisions remain appropriate.
Chairman and nonThe fees of the Chairman and non-executive directors were increased by 2% in February 2018, in line executive director with the wider Company award.
The Chairman, Michael Roney, will be paid an annual fee of 331,500 fees 2017 18 annual fee as Chairman: 325,000.

For the remainder of the year, as Amanda had reached the annual pension allowance limit i. e. the total amount of contributions that can be paid to defined contribution pension schemes and the total amount of benefits that can build up in defined benefit pension schemes each year, for UK income tax relief purposes, she opted to receive an equivalent cash supplement in lieu of this Company contribution.
This is consistent with the Remuneration Policy and with the pension provision and alternatives available to employees generally.
Remuneration Report Total remuneration opportunity The Committees objective is to ensure that the remuneration paid to senior executives is appropriate in both amount and structure, is directly linked to the Companys annual and longer term performance and is aligned with the interests of shareholders.
Careful consideration is given to ensuring there is an appropriate balance in the remuneration structure between annual and long term rewards, as well as between cash and share-based payments.
Variable pay is linked to measures which are aligned with the Companys long term strategy and objectives.
The overall level of executive director pay remains modest compared with that available at other FTSE 100 companies and the chosen maximum remuneration indicated in the charts below reflects the Committees conservative approach to executive pay which it considers is appropriate.
The charts below show the 2017 18 actual remuneration achieved, as disclosed in the single total figure of remuneration on page 76, compared with the 2017 18 opportunity at mid-point, maximum and maximum including assumed share price appreciation and dividend roll-up of 10% per annum combined.
As noted on page 72, Michael Law will step down from the Board at the close of the 2018 AGM and Richard Papp will be promoted from within the business and appointed as an executive director with effect from 14 May 2018.

Pension entitlements audited information In 2013 all active members of the NEXT Group Pension Plan the Original Plan, were transferred to the new 2013 NEXT Group Pension Plan the 2013 Plan so that pensioners of the Original Plan could be issued individual policies with Aviva.
Most deferred pensioners and pensioners who had not previously been subject to a buy-in through Aviva were also transferred to the 2013 Plan.
Benefits within the 2013 Plan mirror those in the previous Original Plan.
Executive directors are members of the 2013 Plan which has been approved by HMRC and consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The trustee of both Plans is a limited company, NEXT Pension Trustees Limited the Trustee.
The Board of the Trustee currently comprises six directors.
Four of these are members of the 2013 Plan, and two directors including the Chairman are independent and have no other connection to NEXT.
Two of these directors are member nominated directors and cannot be removed by NEXT.
The other four directors, including the two independent directors, are appointed by and can be removed by NEXT.
All directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of NEXT.
No director of the Company is a director of the Trustee.
The Plans investments are kept separate from the business of the NEXT Group and the Trustee holds them in separate trusts.
Responsibility for investment of the Plans funds has been delegated to professional investment managers.
The Group operates a salary sacrifice scheme whereby members from either section can elect to receive a reduced gross salary in exchange for enhanced employer pension contributions.
The participation of members in the salary sacrifice scheme does not result in any overall increase in costs to the Group.
Defined contribution section Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the 2013 Plan.
Members elect to pay either 3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.
For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of three times the members base salary at the previous April is payable along with the current value of the members fund.
Defined benefit section The defined benefit section was closed to new members in 2000.
Since 2012, the accrual of pension benefits has been based on pensionable salary frozen at October 2012, rather than final earnings.
Those employees can also elect to receive up to a 15% salary supplement or additional contributions to the defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section now provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth depending on the members chosen contribution rate of pensionable earnings at October 2012 for each year of pensionable service.
Lord Wolfson and a small number of senior employees, on completion of at least 20 years pensionable service at age 65, receive a retirement benefit of two thirds of pensionable earnings as at October 2012, which accrues uniformly throughout their pensionable service.
The deferred pensions for Jane Shields and Michael Law are based on their pensionable earnings at the time they became deferred pensioners and accrued uniformly throughout their pensionable service.
The defined benefit section provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependants pensions on death in service or following retirement.
In the case of ill-health retirement, only the accrued pension is payable.
All benefits are subject to 2013 Plan limits.
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post 1997 is subject to limited price indexation.
From 2006, sales and profit related bonuses were excluded from pensionable earnings and the normal retirement age under the Original Plan was increased from 60 to 65.
There are no additional benefits payable to directors in the event of early retirement.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company makes contributions at the rate of 31.3%.
The last full triennial actuarial valuation of the 2013 Plan was carried out as at 30 September 2016.
As calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, the net pension surplus at January 2018 was 106.2m.
Further details are provided in Note 18 of the financial statements.
Certain members including Lord Wolfson whose accrued or projected pension fund value exceeds their personal lifetime allowance are provided with benefits through an unfunded, unapproved supplementary pension arrangement.
The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by a payment of 5% on all pensionable earnings to the 2013 Plan.
Since April 2011, where existing members have reached either the annual or lifetime pension contributions limits, the Company has offered those members the choice of leaving the defined benefit section and either joining the defined contribution section with an enhanced Company contribution or taking a salary supplement, in both cases equal to 10% or 15% of their salary depending on their existing contributions and benefits.

Full details of directors interests in the shares and share options of the Company are contained in the Register of Directors Interests which is open to inspection at the Companys registered office.
Minimum shareholding The minimum shareholding required of executive directors is 200% of base salary and each director has 5 years from the date of their appointment to the Board to acquire the minimum shareholding.
As at the 2017 18 financial year end, the value of shareholdings of all of the executives exceeded the share ownership guidelines.
For LTIP awards, the date in this column is the end of the three year performance period.
Actual vesting will be the date on which the Committee determines whether any performance conditions have been satisfied, or shortly thereafter.
See page 77 for details of the performance conditions and vesting levels applicable to the LTIP schemes with performance periods ending in the financial year 2017 18.
The LTIP price at award date is NEXTs average share price over the three months prior to the start of the performance period.
Within the above table, all awards are subject to performance conditions except for Sharesave options and Deferred Bonus Shares.

83 Remuneration Report The comparator group for the performance periods commencing in August 2014, February 2015, August 2015 and February 2016 is the same as above with the exception of Home Retail Group and Poundland who were included, and Pets at Home and B&M European Value Retail who were not included.
Following the acquisition by J Sainsbury of Home Retail Group in September 2016, Home Retail Group was delisted from the London Stock Exchange.
For the LTIP grants prior to that time, J Sainsbury and Home Retail Group will continue as two separate entries with their relative TSRs being measured on pre independent and post identical takeover performance over each performance period.
Poundland was also delisted following its acquisition in September 2016.
For the LTIP grants prior to that time which included Poundland in the comparator group, from September 2016, the relative TSR of B&M European Value Retail replaces that of Poundland.
SMP legacy only The Committee decided in 2014 that executive directors should no longer participate in the SMP.
Amanda James was promoted to the Board in 2015 and Amandas SMPs awarded prior to her promotion continued to run their course, with the last one vesting in May 2017.
No executive director held any outstanding SMP awards as at the 2017 18 financial year end.
The SMP remains open to a small number of senior executives below Board level.
Vesting of awards is dependent solely on achieving the underlying fully diluted post-tax EPS targets detailed below.
Under the formulae, a notional adjustment is made to actual EPS achieved for special dividends, on the basis that the cash distributed had instead been used to purchase shares at the prevailing share price on the day of the special dividend payment.
Payments to past directors audited information There were no payments made to past directors during the 2017 18 financial year.
Payments for loss of office audited information There were no payments made to any director in respect of loss of office during the 2017 18 financial year.
