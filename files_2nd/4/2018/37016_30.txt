This is included in Mr Gordons single total figure.
Raymond Fine retired on 31 December 2018. intu properties plc Annual report 2018 81 Governance Directors remuneration report continued Performance outturns and incentives Annual bonus The maximum award for both the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer in 2018 was 120 per cent of salary, of which 50 per cent is deferred for two and three years.
This will remain unchanged for 2019.
Annual bonus payments are based on pre-determined performance measures.
Given the commercial sensitivity, the Remuneration Committee provides retrospective disclosure of targets.
Two-thirds is based on adjusted EPS performance in the year, split evenly between performance versus budget and prior year figures.
The overall structure ensures that the maximum EPS related bonus is only achievable if management outperform against both the Boards expectations for the year and if there is an increase in EPS on the prior year.
The remaining third is based on achievement of strategic and operational objectives against a scorecard of measures.
The Remuneration Committee considers the objectives carefully each year to align with intus strategic objectives, and the objectives include quantitatively assessed financial and operational measures and milestones.
For 2019, the objectives of the incumbent Executive Directors will focus on ensuring that key strategic initiatives relating to asset performance, operational excellence, optimising intus winning destinations and smart use of capital are kept on track delivered during what is likely to be a year of transition.
Annual bonus 2018 outturn The targets for the 2018 bonus are set out below.
As in previous years, full retrospective disclosure of the targets is given: EPS element Targets Provisional Weighting outturn % of total 2018 % of max Performance element opportunity Threshold Target Maximum performance element Adjusted EPS vs budget 33.3% 13.0p 13.7p 14.4p 14.4p 100% Adjusted EPS vs prior year 33.3% 100% 102.5% 105% 96% 0% David Matthew Fischel Roberts Total provisional out-turn % of max bonus 33.33% 33.33% Therefore, no bonus was payable under the EPS vs prior year element.
However, reflecting intus resilient operating performance, a bonus equalling 33.3 per cent of the maximum bonus opportunity i. e. 40 per cent of salary was provisionally payable based on a formulaic assessment of performance against the EPS vs budget element.
However, mindful of shareholders experience during the year, the Committee exercised discretion to reduce the payout under this element of the bonus by 50 per cent, thereby resulting in the payment of a bonus equalling 20 per cent of salary.
Strategic operational element The strategic objectives in the annual bonus are a key part of the remuneration framework for incentivising and rewarding achievements and milestones which are the foundation for value creation in the future.
The Committee follows a rigorous process in the setting and monitoring of scorecard objectives and then exercises judgement in assessing performance in the key areas selected.
This includes determination of objectives by reference to the approved Board strategy, quarterly reviews of quantitative and qualitative data, and an end-of-year full review with supporting evidence, to ensure a robust assessment of performance against the objectives.
For 2018, the scorecard and weightings were as follows: Element Performance indicators Weighting KPIs considered included net rental income Underlying performance of assets growth of 0.6% LFL 25% NPS, brand awareness, performance of intu Digital and the customer experience Experiences 25% Transaction not concluded nor was consortium Implementation of strategic priorities, including offer, albeit both requiring significant the Hammerson transaction management time 50% Despite intus resilient operating performance during the year, the Committee determined that no bonus was payable in relation to this element.
Therefore, in total, a bonus equal to 20 per cent of salary i. e. 16.66 per cent of the maximum bonus was payable to the two Executive Directors for 2018 compared to 72 per cent of salary 60 per cent of the maximum in 2017.

The precise performance targets for the 2019 awards have yet to be agreed.
Full details of the targets will be set out in the Stock Exchange announcement that is issued in relation to these awards.
Under the plan, awards will vest as to one-third each based on performance measured over three, four and five years.
Following the publication of the revised UK Corporate Governance Code the Committee determined that for future awards under the PSP, a two-year holding period would apply to the portion vesting after three years, and a one-year holding period would apply for the portion vesting after four years.
This extends the time horizon for the entire award to five years, aligning Executive Directors to the long-term success of the business.
The holding period will apply for awards granted in 2019 and onwards.
Departure of Chief Executive As announced in July 2018, David Fischel will be standing down as Chief Executive once a suitable successor has been appointed.
David agreed to remain in post for a longer period than he had envisaged, giving the Board sufficient time to search for a suitable successor.
To ensure an orderly succession process and to take account of the unusual circumstances that have prevailed, formal notice was given on 31 December 2018 though it is expected that a successor will be appointed significantly before the expiry of his 12-month notice period.
Details of his remuneration on leaving will be announced in accordance with S430 2B of the Companies Act 2006 and reported in next years Directors remuneration report.
His remuneration on leaving will be in line with our approved policy as well as good practice principles: David will continue to receive salary, pension and benefits throughout his notice period David will continue to participate in the annual bonus plan for 2019, with pro-rating dependent on the timing of his departure he will not receive a PSP award during 2019 having taken account of the circumstances, it is anticipated that David will be treated as a good leaver pursuant to the rules of the PSP, with awards subject to pro-rating and assessment of performance at the normal time.
David will also be treated as a good leaver for the purposes of his deferred share awards which will vest on cessation, pursuant to the rules of that plan Malus and clawback Shares awarded under the deferred bonus plan and PSP are subject to malus provisions.
The Committee may apply malus at its discretion in circumstances including but not limited to : a material misstatement of the Companys audited financial results a material failure of risk management by the Company, any Group company or business unit a material breach of any applicable health and safety or environmental regulations by the Company, any Group company or business unit serious reputational damage to the Company, any Group company or business unit serious misconduct of the individual The annual bonus and PSP awards are also subject to clawback provisions.
The Committee may at its discretion seek to apply clawback in circumstances of: a material misstatement of the Companys audited financial results where the individual is responsible or accountable and where Executive Directors would always be deemed to have management responsibility serious misconduct of the individual Clawback provisions may be applied up to two years following the determination of the annual incentive and up to one further year following vesting for awards under the PSP.
Taking into account the three, four and five year-vesting timescales, this means that PSP awards may be reclaimed for up to four, five and six years, respectively, from the date of award.
Other share scheme information The Company operates a share incentive plan SIP for all eligible employees, including Executive Directors, who may receive up to 3,600 worth of shares as part of their annual bonus arrangements.
As part of the SIP arrangements, the Company offers eligible employees the opportunity to participate in a partnership share scheme, the terms of which are governed by HM Revenue & Customs HMRC regulations.
In 2016, intu implemented an HMRC-approved Sharesave Plan the intu Retail Services Sharesave Plan, offering a potential savings contract of up to 500 a month for a period of three to five years.

The Company operates an employee share ownership plan ESOP which has in the past used funds provided to purchase shares required under the annual bonus scheme.
Season ticket loan All employees of the Group are entitled to an interest-free travel season ticket loan which is repaid over the year via deductions from salary.
Neither David Fischel nor Matthew Roberts received a season ticket or other loan from the Group during 2018.
Chief Executive pay increase in relation to all employees The table below sets out details of the percentage change in salary, benefits and annual bonus for the Chief Executive and the average for all of intus staff: Percentage change in remuneration from 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2018 Percentage change Percentage change Percentage change in base salary in benefits in annual bonus Chief Executive 2% 15% 72% All employees 3% 24% 2% Shareholding and share interests Executive directors must build up over time a holding of intu shares with a value equivalent to 200 per cent of salary.
The Remuneration Committee reviews shareholdings against the requirement on an annual basis to ensure they are met within an appropriate timeframe.
The graph below illustrates the shareholdings of the Executive Directors as a percentage of salary.
Note that only actual holdings count towards the shareholding requirements.

As shown above David Fischel fulfils his shareholding requirement.
Matthew Roberts almost meets his requirement which was increased to 200 per cent of salary two years ago and expects to reach a value of 200 per cent of salary in the next year or so.
In line with the new UK Corporate Governance Code requirement, the Committee formalised its policy for post-employment unvested and vested share interests.
For the PSP, any awards which vest will generally continue post-cessation, with performance measured at the normal time.
Since the PSP has time horizons of three, four and five years, this means that good leavers would generally have a substantive interest in shares for a period post-leaving.
Any holding period applying to PSP awards from 2019 onwards would continue to apply post-cessation of employment.
The Committee will review its policy in connection with postcessation shareholdings in light of developing market and good governance practice as part of its review of the overall policy during 2019. intu properties plc Annual report 2018 85 Governance Directors remuneration report continued The table below sets out the Executive Directors interests in shares as at 31 December 2018: Unvested awards Vested awards Number of shares owned Conditional shares not subject including connected persons to performance conditions PSP Options Held in SIP Held in SIP subject to subject to Unexercised Unexercised Options Held in trust for Deferred trust for performance performance unapproved approved exercised in 1 own name 5 years shares 5 years conditions conditions options options the year Executive David Fischel 1,272,433 12,374 273,918 11,302 2,132,221 1,382,972 12,906 Matthew Roberts 433,387 4,564 216,616 10,009 1,679,227 481,387 11,203 1 Held as jointly owned shares.

TSR is defined as share price growth plus reinvested dividends: Ten-year Total Shareholder Return TSR performance 250 250 200 200 150 150 100 100 50 50 0 0 31 Dec 2008 31 Dec 2009 31 Dec 2010 31 Dec 2011 31 Dec 2012 31 Dec 2013 31 Dec 2014 31 Dec 2015 31 Dec 2016 31 Dec 2017 31 Dec 2018 intu properties plc FTSE 350 Real Estate UK real estate is a cyclical sector.
Since 2009, a key driver for growth in value within the UK real estate market has been exposure to central London properties.
As a result of the demerger of Capital & Counties from Liberty International now intu properties plc in 2010, intus portfolio does not include properties in central London and intu has therefore not benefited from the uplift experienced by those property companies with exposure to London.
However, given the cyclical nature of the property sector, we would not expect this trend to endure over the long-term cycle.
For additional context, the following two charts have been provided to show intus total financial return NAV growth plus dividends and prime property assets capital value growth adjusted for capex and net income expressed as a percentage of capital employed over the same period.
intus prime property return is shown relative to the MSCI monthly retail index.
These two charts have been provided as growth in these metrics supports the delivery of long-term returns to our shareholders and are included in our key performance indicators see pages 36 and 37.
