Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 85 Directors Remuneration Report The Directors Remuneration Report the Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee the Committee in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the UK Listing Rules and the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 the UK Regulations.
The Report was approved by the Board.
Introduction from the Remuneration Committee Chairman The attached Report reflects the 2018 annual incentives earned and the vesting outcomes for multi-year incentives granted under the remuneration policy applicable to the 20162018 cycle of the multi-year plans.
As you will have read in the Annual Report, the Companys strategic priority is the organic development of increasingly sophisticated information-based analytics and decision tools that deliver enhanced value to professional and business customers across industries.
During 2018, RELX continued to successfully execute this strategy, which is aimed at achieving more predictable revenues, a higher growth profile and improving returns.
As a result, underlying revenue growth was 4%, underlying operating profits grew 6% and adjusted earnings per share EPS at constant currencies grew 7%.
The performance measures in the incentive plans align with and support the strategy by focussing on sustained earnings growth, return on invested capital and shareholder returns.
The performance measures are based on adjusted figures as they provide relevant information in assessing the Companys performance, position and cash flows and we believe they track the core operational performance of RELX and how it contributes to shareholder value creation.
The Committee has confirmed that the adoption of new accounting standards in 2018 has had no impact on payouts under the annual or multi-year incentives.
The Annual Report includes a reconciliation of adjusted measures to IFRS measures.
2018 Outcomes The strong financial performance of the business is reflected in the 2018 annual incentive achievement for Executive Directors of marginally above the target level.
Two-thirds of the amount earned will be paid in cash to the Executive Directors in March 2019 and the remaining one-third is deferred into RELX shares which will be released in Q1 2022.
The 201618 cycle of the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP vested at 68.6%, with similar vesting levels achieved under both the EPS and total shareholder return TSR measures and return on invested capital ROIC in 2018 of 13.2%.
With respect to the 2016-18 cycle of the discontinued Bonus Investment Plan BIP and the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, ROIC and EPS performance resulted in vesting percentages of 87.5% and 90.0% respectively.
These outcomes reflect strong returns and earnings growth achieved by the business and how the challenging targets set by the Committee have been perceived by the market.
In determining the level of payout under the annual incentive and the multi-year incentives, the Committee took into account RELXs overall business performance and value created for shareholders over the period in review and other relevant factors.
2018 Implementation of simplified Remuneration Policy The simplified remuneration policy for Executive Directors, which was approved by shareholders in April 2017 by a vote of 95% of the shares voted, was fully implemented in 2018.
For the 2018 annual incentive, it was decided that the KPOs for the Executive Directors would reflect solely non-financial targets.
As a result, the Committee increased the overall weighting of financial measures from 70% to 85% at target achievement and reduced the weighting of the individual KPOs from 30% to 15%.
This was in accordance with our approved remuneration policy which contains flexibility to change the weightings, provided the financial targets have a weighting of at least 70%.
Recognising the desire on the part of some shareholders for additional disclosures, you will see that we have provided expanded disclosures this year in connection with the KPOs.
A description of the Remuneration Policy, as approved by shareholders at the April 2017 Annual General Meetings, is included on pages 99 to 105 of this Report.
Corporate simplification As a result of the corporate simplification to merge RELX NV into RELX PLC, which took effect on 8 September 2018, all awards and options over shares in RELX NV were exchanged for awards and options over shares in RELX PLC on a one-for-one basis.
In respect of the euro TSR comparator group for LTIP awards including the 201618 cycle, RELX NV shares were, subsequent to the merger, replaced with RELX PLC shares priced in euros and listed on Euronext Amsterdam.
In respect of the US dollar TSR comparator group, RELX NV ADRs were, subsequent to the merger, replaced with RELX PLC ADRs.
No other adjustments were made to the performance conditions attached to outstanding awards and options.
86 RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Governance 2018 Corporate Governance Code Following the publication by the FRC of the new Corporate Governance Code in July 2018, the Committee has reviewed the updated provisions relating to remuneration matters.
The Committee will report on how these have been implemented in next years Report.
You will see that with respect to workforce engagement, we have decided to designate a non-executive director to take on responsibility for this and have introduced a fee for this activity.
2019 Implementation of Remuneration Policy In line with increases for the wider employee population, and consistent with the 2019 salary increase guidelines for UK based employees, the Committee has approved 2019 salary increases for the Executive Directors of 2.5%.
As the CEO pays pension contributions and a participation fee which increase each year, after taking into account these increasing fees, his 2019 salary after these increasing deductions will decrease again in 2019 compared to 2018.
Following a review in 2019, we will propose a directors remuneration policy for approval by shareholders at the AGM in April 2020.
The audited sections of the Report are clearly marked.

2 Deferred shares earned under the Annual Incentive Plan are deferred for three years and not released to the Executive Directors until Q1 2022.
They carry the right to payment of dividend equivalents when released.
3 The figures for share based awards are calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in the UK Regulations.
The figure for performance-related share based awards includes share price appreciation since the date the award was granted.
In the case of Erik Engstroms figures, the amount included that directly reflects share price appreciation is 1.7m for 2017 and 1.5m for 2018 of which 0.6m relates to the LTIP, 0.3m relates to the BIP and 0.6m relates to the ESOS.
For Nick Luff, the amount included that relates to share price appreciation is 0.8m for 2017 and 0.7m for 2018 of which 0.3m relates to the LTIP, 0.2m relates to the BIP and 0.3m relates to the ESOS.
Please note that these figures add up to 0.8m instead of 0.7m solely due to rounding.
The shared based awards figures for 2017 disclosed in last years Report were, as required by the UK Regulations, based on an estimate using prescribed average share prices and exchange rates and have been restated in this Report to reflect the actual amount vested and the actual share prices and exchange rates on the vesting dates of the 201517 cycle of BIP, LTIP and ESOS.
The vesting percentages under these plans were determined on 16 February 2018 and were in line with those disclosed on page 86 in the 2017 Remuneration Report.
Using the share prices and exchange rates on the vesting dates and the actual dividend equivalents paid in respect of this cycle decreased the 2017 disclosed figure by 1,172k for Erik Engstrom and by 578k for Nick Luff.
The 2018 figures reflect the vesting of the 201618 cycle of BIP, LTIP and ESOS.
As the BIP, LTIP and ESOS vest after the approval date of this Report, the average share prices and exchange rates for the last quarter of 2018 have been used to arrive at an estimated figure in respect of these awards.
The exchange rates used to convert share based awards to pounds sterling are i those that applied at the vesting dates or, if vesting has not occurred at the time of sign off of this Report, the average exchange rates for the last quarter of 2018: ii for dividend equivalents, the actual gross pounds sterling payment: and iii for estimated dividend equivalents in respect of awards for which vesting has not occurred at the time of sign off of this Report and which are yet to be paid, the average exchange rates for the last quarter of 2018.
4 Erik Engstrom participates in the UK legacy defined benefit pension plan on the same basis as other UK executives who are participants in this legacy plan and accrues 1 30th of final year pensionable earnings for every year of service up to his 60th birthday, at which time benefits cease accruing.
His annual increase in pensionable earnings is capped at 2%.
The pension figure disclosed in the table has been calculated in accordance with the prescribed methodology set out in the UK Regulations.
This figure does not represent a contribution by the Company to Mr Engstroms pension.
In 2018, the Company contributed 42,338 to the funded portion of Mr Engstroms defined benefit pension plan.
The remainder of his accrued pension is an unfunded liability of the Company.
In 2018, Mr Engstrom contributed a total of 151,306 by way of contributions and a participation fee as part of his ongoing membership of this plan.
In line with all participants, his contributions and participation fee are increasing each year.
The pension figure in the table is reduced by these contributions 11% of pensionable base salary up to the scheme earnings cap until 28 February 2018 and 13% from 1 March 2018 and the participation fee 10% of pensionable base salary in excess of the scheme earnings cap until 28 February 2018 and 13% from 1 March 2018.
For details of Mr Engstroms accrued pension as at 31 December 2018, see page 92.
Nick Luff receives a cash allowance in lieu of pension which reduced from 29% of salary to 27% of salary effective 1 March 2018.
The total remuneration for Directors is set out in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements on page 162.

3 Threshold payout levels for each measure under LTIP have been included as it is possible to achieve threshold, and hence payout, in respect of just one of the measures or, for TSR, in respect of one of the three TSR comparator groups.
The LTIP awards granted in 2018 are based on ROIC, EPS and TSR weighted 40%:40%:20% respectively and assessed independently.

ANNUAL BASE SALARY Purpose and link to strategy To recruit and retain the best executive talent globally to execute our strategic objectives at appropriate cost.
Operation Salaries for Executive Directors are set and reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee the Committee with changes typically taking effect on 1 January.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee may review salaries more frequently.
When reviewing salaries, the Committee considers the executives role and sustained value to the company in terms of skill, experience and overall contribution and the Companys guidelines for salaries for all employees for the year.
Periodically, competitiveness with companies which are comparable in respect of industry, size, international scope and complexity is also considered in order to ensure the Companys ability to attract and retain executives.
For the last seven years, Executive Directors salary increases have been 2.5% per annum.
Performance framework N A Maximum value Salary increases to Executive Directors will remain within the range of increases for the wider employee population.
However, the Committee has discretion to exceed this to take account of individual circumstances such as change in responsibility, increases in scale or complexity of the business, inflation or alignment to market level.
Recovery of sums paid No provision.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS Purpose and link to strategy Retirement plans are part of remuneration packages designed to recruit and retain the best executive talent at appropriate cost.
Operation Our policy is to offer competitive long-term sustainable defined contribution plans.
Any amount above applicable limits, for example HMRCs annual allowance in the UK, will be paid in cash and will be subject to tax and social security deductions.
In certain circumstances, executives can take cash instead of pension contributions.
The UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new hires.
Continued membership of legacy defined benefit schemes requires annual increases to contributions and participation fees from all members, who have a choice to switch to the defined contribution plan at any time.
The CEO is a member of a UK legacy defined benefit pension arrangement, accruing 1 30th of final year pensionable earnings for each year pro-rated for part years of service, with a normal retirement age of 60.
In line with all UK defined benefit scheme members, the CEOs contributions have been increasing annually since 2011 and were 13% of pensionable earnings up to the base schemes earnings cap as of 1 March 2018.
The contribution rate increases by two percentage points each year during the policy period to 15% as of 1 March 2019 and 17% as of 1 March 2020.
The CEO also pays a participation fee which, from 1 March 2018, was 13% of the amount of his pensionable earnings in excess of the base schemes earnings cap.
The participation fee increases by three percentage points each year during the policy period to 16% as of 1 March 2019 and 19% as of 1 March 2020.
In addition, since March 2017, a cap applies of 2% per annum on the increase in the CEOs pensionable earnings.
Performance framework N A Maximum value Defined contribution plan maximum company contribution of 25% of salary per annum or equivalent cash in lieu.
The CFO received 30% of salary under an arrangement which was made pursuant to the previous remuneration policy, which contained a 30% of salary maximum.
During the policy period, the CFOs company contribution decreased by one percentage point to 29% from March 2017, by two percentage points to 27% from March 2018 and will decrease by a further two percentage points to 25% from March 2019.
Defined benefit scheme accrual of 1 30th of final year pensionable earnings for every year of service up to a maximum of 2 3rds of pensionable earnings.
As noted above under Operation, the CEO is subject to increases in his contributions and in the participation fee, as well as a cap on annual increases in pensionable earnings, as part of his ongoing membership of this scheme.
100 RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Governance OTHER BENEFITS Purpose and link to strategy To provide competitive benefits at appropriate cost.
Operation Other benefits, subject to periodic review, may include private medical and dental cover, life assurance, tax return preparation costs, car benefits, directors and officers liability insurance, relocation benefits and expatriate allowances and other benefits available to employees generally, including, where appropriate, the tax on such benefits.
Performance framework N A Maximum value The maximum for ongoing benefits for Executive Directors will not normally exceed 10% of salary excluding relocation benefits and any tax related charge on benefits which is met by the Company.
However, the Committee may provide reasonable benefits beyond this amount in exceptional situations, such as a change in the individuals circumstances caused by the Company, or if there is a significant 1 increase in the cost of providing the agreed benefit.
AIP ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN Purpose and link to strategy The annual incentive provides focus on the delivery of annual financial targets and the achievement of annual objectives and milestones which are chosen to align with the companys strategy and create a platform for sustainable future performance.
The compulsory deferral of one-third of any annual incentive earned into RELX shares for three years promotes longer-term alignment of Executive Directors interests with shareholders interests, including an element of post-termination shareholding.
Why performance measures are chosen and how targets are set Performance measures include a balanced set of financial targets and Key Performance Objectives KPOs, which are appropriately weighted and which support current strategy and incentivise the Executive Directors to achieve the desired outcomes without undue risk of focusing on any one financial measure.
The targets are designed to be challenging.
They are set with reference to the previous years performance and internal and external forecasts for the following year.
Operation The Committee reviews and sets the financial targets and KPOs annually, taking into account internal forecasts and strategic plans.
It approves four to six KPOs for each Executive Director, reflecting critical business priorities for which each is accountable.
At least one KPO will relate to the achievement of sustainability targets.
Following year end, the Committee compares actual performance with the financial targets and assesses the achievement of individual KPOs.
Two-thirds of any annual incentive earned is paid in cash to the Executive Director and the remaining one-third is deferred into RELX shares, which are not released to the Executive Director for three years.
Dividend equivalents accrued during the deferral period are payable in respect of the shares that vest.
On a change in control, the default position is that deferred shares vest.
Alternatively, the Committee may determine that deferred shares will not vest and will instead be exchanged for equivalent awards in the acquiring company.
Performance framework The measures include financial targets, which have a weighting of at least 70%, and individual KPOs, with each element assessed separately.
The minimum payout is zero.
If threshold is reached for each of the financial measures, the overall payout for the financial measures is 10.5% of salary.
If the financial measure with the lowest weighting pays out at threshold and the others do not pay out at all, the overall payout for financial measures is 1.5% of salary.
There is no threshold level for KPOs.
Payout for target performance is 150% of salary.
Following an assessment of achievement and scoring of KPOs, the Committee agrees the overall level of earned incentive for each Executive Director.
Maximum value The maximum potential annual incentive is 200% of annual base salary.
This includes the deferred share element but excludes dividend equivalents payable in respect of the deferred shares.
Recovery of sums paid 5 Claw-back applies.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Directors Remuneration Report 101 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN Purpose and link to strategy The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP is designed to provide a long-term incentive for Executive Directors to achieve the key performance measures that support the companys strategy, and to align their interests with shareholders.
Why performance measures are chosen and how targets are set Our strategic focus is on continuing to transform the core business through organic investment and the build out of new products into adjacent markets and geographies, supplemented by selective portfolio acquisitions and divestments.
The performance measures in the LTIP are chosen to support this strategy by focusing on sustained earnings growth, return on invested capital and shareholder return.
Targets are set with regard to previous results and internal and external forecasts for the performance period and the strategic plan for the business.
They are designed to provide exceptional reward for exceptional performance, whilst allowing a reasonable expectation that reward at the lower end of the scale is attainable, subject to robust performance.
Operation Annual awards of performance shares, with vesting subject to: performance measured over three financial years continued employment subject to the provisions set out in the Policy on payments for loss of office section meeting shareholding requirements 400% of salary for the CEO and 300% of salary for the CFO Executive Directors are to retain their net after tax vested shares for a holding period of two years after vesting.
Dividend equivalents accrued during the performance period are payable in respect of the performance shares that vest.
On a change of control, the default position is that awards vest on a pro-rated basis, subject to an assessment of performance against targets at that time.
Alternatively, the Committee may determine that the awards will not vest and will instead be exchanged for equivalent awards in the acquiring company.
Performance framework The performance measures are EPS, ROIC and relative TSR, weighted 40%:40%:20% respectively and assessed independently, such that a payout can be received under any one of the measures or, for TSR, in respect of one of the three comparator groups.
If each of the measures vests at threshold, the overall payout is 25% of the award.
If the measure with the lowest weighting vests at threshold and the others do not vest at all, the overall payout is 2% of the award.
Payout in line with expectations is 50% of the maximum award.
Dividend equivalents are not taken into account in the above payout levels.
Maximum value The maximum grant in any year is up to 450% of base salary for the CEO and up to 375% of base salary for other Executive Directors not including dividend equivalents.
1 Other benefits: Maximum value was increased from 5% under the previous policy to 10% under the current policy to reflect increases in the cost of providing the agreed benefits.
The level of benefits provided to Executive Directors was not changed.
2 Discretion in respect of AIP and LTIP payout levels: In determining the level of payout under the AIP and vesting under the LTIP, the Committee takes into account RELXs overall business performance and value created for shareholders over the period in review and other relevant factors.
It has discretion to adjust the vesting and payout levels subject always to the maximum individual limits if it believes this would result in a fairer outcome.
This discretion will only be used in exceptional circumstances and the Committee will explain in the next Remuneration Report the extent to which it has been exercised and the reasons for doing so.
3 Discretion to vary performance measures under the AIP and the LTIP: The Committee may vary the financial measures applying to a current annual incentive year and performance measures for LTIP awards already granted if a change in circumstances leads it to believe that the arrangement is no longer a fair measure of performance.
Any new measures will not be materially less, or more, challenging than the original ones.
4 Discretion on termination of employment under the AIP and the LTIP: The Committees discretion on termination of employment is described under the Policy on payments for loss of office section on page 104.
5 Malus and claw-back under the AIP and the LTIP: Under the AIP and the LTIP, the Committee has discretion to apply malus and claw-back i if the payout including the AIP deferred shares element was calculated on the basis of materially misstated financial or other data, in which case it can withhold a payout and can seek to recover the difference in value between the incorrect payout and the amount that would have been paid had the correct data been used or ii if there has been serious misconduct on the part of the individual, in which case the Committee may withhold an AIP payout, lapse unvested LTIP awards and may require repayment of AIP and LTIP gains arising during a specified period.
Under the LTIP, the Committee also has discretion to apply malus and claw-back if a participant breaches post-termination restrictive covenants, in which case unvested awards would lapse and the Committee may require repayment of gains arising during the period beginning six months before termination and ending on the date the post-termination restrictive covenants are stated to expire.
Serious misconduct has been added as a trigger event under the AIP and the LTIP since the previous policy to increase the circumstances in which we can apply malus and claw-back.
102 RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Governance 6 Explanation of differences between the companys policy on Executive Directors remuneration and the policy for other employees: Incentives: A larger percentage of Executive Directors remuneration is performance related than that of other employees.
All managers participate in an annual incentive plan, but participation levels, measures and targets vary according to their role, seniority and local business priorities.
Approximately 100 senior executives currently participate in the LTIP and about 1,000 participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
Grant levels under the plans vary according to role and seniority.
In considering the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, under which the Executive Directors only participate in the AIP and the LTIP, the Committee considered the incentive plan participation for the wider senior management population.
Other benefits: The range and level of retirement and other benefits provided to employees vary according to role, seniority and local market practice.
This is to ensure that we provide competitive packages which are appropriate to specific roles.
In reducing the maximum company contribution for Executive Directors under the defined contribution pension plan, the Committee took into account the contribution rates for Executive Directors and for the wider employee population.
7 Changes to pay components: The changes which were made since the previous remuneration policy, together with the rationale for the changes, are described in the Committee Chairmans introduction on pages 81 to 83 of the Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2016 and in notes 1 and 5 above.
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios The Committee considers the level of remuneration that may be paid in the context of the performance delivered and value added for shareholders.
The charts below are an illustration of how the CEOs and CFOs regular annual remuneration could vary under different performance scenarios.
The salary, benefits and pension levels are the same in all three scenarios in each chart.
Salary is based on 2017 salary.
Benefits is based on the 2016 Single Total Figure table.
Pension, annual incentive and LTIP are all based on the policy tables award levels and percentages applied to the 2017 salary.
Annual incentive amounts include the one-third portion which is subject to compulsory deferral into RELX shares for three years, although the deferral portion is separately identified within the annual incentive amount in the charts.
The performance assumptions which have been used are as follows: Minimum means no AIP payout and no LTIP vesting.
In line with expectations means AIP payout at 150% of salary of which one-third is deferred into shares and LTIP vesting at half of the award.
Maximum means AIP payout at 200% of salary of which one-third is deferred into shares and LTIP vesting at 100% of the award.
No share price movement is assumed and any dividend equivalents payable in respect of the AIP deferred shares and the LTIP are not included.

However, on an internal promotion to the Board, any existing contractual obligations and commitments may continue to be honoured, even if not consistent with the prevailing policy.
For example, if the individual is a member of the legacy defined benefit pension scheme, the Committee will consider the pension arrangements in the context of the package as a whole and may allow continued participation.
The Committees general principle on recruitment is to offer a competitive remuneration package to attract high-calibre candidates from a global talent pool.
Basic salary would be set at an appropriate level for the candidate, taking into account all relevant factors.
As a data analytics and technology-driven business, with half of its revenue in the US, the Company primarily competes for talent with US-based information and technology companies.
The various components and the Companys approach are as follows: Standard package on recruitment To offer remuneration in line with the policy table including the limits, taking into account the principles set out above.
Compensation for forfeited entitlements The Committee may make awards and payments on hiring an external candidate to compensate him or her for entitlements forfeited on leaving the previous employer.
If such a decision is made, the Committee will attempt to reflect previous entitlements as closely as possible using a variety of tools, including cash and share based awards.
Malus and claw-back provisions will apply where appropriate.
If necessary to facilitate the grant of awards, the Committee may rely on the one person exemption from shareholder approval in the UK Listing Rules.
Relocation allowances and expenses The type and size of relocation allowances and expenses will be determined by the specific circumstances of the new recruit.
The standard package comprises annual base salary, retirement benefits, other benefits, AIP and LTIP.
Shareholding requirement The Executive Directors are subject to shareholding requirements.
These are a minimum of 400% of annual base salary for the CEO and 300% of annual base salary for other Executive Directors.
On joining or promotion to the Board, Executive Directors are given a period of time, typically up to five years, to build up to their requirement.
Policy on payments for loss of office In line with the companys policy, the service contracts of the existing Executive Directors contain 12-month notice periods.
The circumstances in which an Executive Directors employment is terminated will affect the Committees determination of any payment for loss of office, but it expects to apply the principles outlined in the table on the next page.
The Committee reserves the right to depart from these principles where appropriate in light of any taxation requirements to which the Company or the Executive Director is subject including, without limitation, section 409A of the US Internal Revenue Code, or other legal obligations.
Treatment of legacy awards granted under multi-year incentive plans in which the Executive Directors no longer participate will be in accordance with those plans and the policy on payments for loss of office summarised in the Remuneration Policy Report in the 2013 Annual Reports and Financial Statements.
