In addition to the above elements of remuneration, the Committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a different structure, but within the limits sets out in the Policy Table, in order to facilitate the recruitment of an individual, exercising the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.
The Committee also retains discretion to make non-significant changes to the Policy without going back to shareholders.
The Committee is satisfied that the Remuneration Policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-taking.
80 Hochschild Mining PLC DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Notes to the Policy Table Payments from existing awards Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the Remuneration Policy summarised in this report such as the vesting of Enhanced Long-Term Incentive Plan or Restricted Share Plan awards made under a previous Policy, or awards made prior to appointment to the Board.
Details of any such payments will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Performance measurement selection and approach to target-setting The measures used under the annual bonus are selected annually to reflect the Groups main strategic objectives for the year and reflect both financial and non-financial priorities.
Performance targets are set to be stretching and achievable, taking into account the Companys strategic priorities and the economic environment in which the Company operates.
Targets are set taking into account a range of reference points including the Groups strategic and operating plan.
The Committee considers relative TSR to be the most appropriate measure of long-term performance for the Company and, together with the annual bonus measures, provide a balance between absolute and relative performance, between short-term and long-term performance measures, and between external and internal measures of performance.
TSR aligns with the Companys focus on shareholder value creation and rewards management for outperformance of sector peers, and is transparent, visible and motivational to executives.
The Committee has discretion to vary the performance condition for in-flight awards in certain circumstances to ensure they continue to be fair, reasonable and no more or less difficult to satisfy than originally intended.
For example, in the event of M&A activity amongst the TSR comparator group during a performance period, the Committee may make adjustments to the comparator group for example, replacing that company with the acquiring company, including a substitute for that company, or tracking the future performance of that company by reference to the median of the remaining comparators.
Other examples of special circumstances include but are not limited to rights issues, corporate restructuring, and special dividends.
The Committee will also review the appropriateness of the performance conditions prior to each LTIP grant and reserves the discretion to set different targets for future awards without consulting with shareholders.
Remuneration Policy for other employees The Committee takes into consideration the remuneration arrangements for the wider employee population in making its decisions on remuneration for senior executives.
The Companys approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, level of experience, responsibility, individual performance and pay levels in comparable companies.
In general, the Remuneration Policy and principles which apply to other senior executives are broadly consistent with those set out in this report for the CEO.
Generally, remuneration is linked to Company and individual performance in a way that is ultimately aimed at reinforcing the delivery of shareholder value.
Senior employees above a specific grade are eligible to participate in an annual bonus scheme with a similar design to that for the CEO.
Opportunities and specific performance conditions vary by organisational level with business area-specific metrics incorporated where appropriate.
All Peruvian employees participate in the statutory profit share scheme whereby an amount equal to 8% of the relevant Peruvian companys taxable income for the year is distributable to its employees.
The amount receivable by each employee is determined with reference to their annual base salary and the number of days worked in the calendar year.
Selected senior employees participate in the LTIP and are required to invest 50% of the vested cash award on a tax net basis in the Companys shares and hold these shares for a further two years.
These shares will count towards their target shareholding expressed as a percentage of salary, which will be set depending on seniority.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Annual Report & Accounts 2018 81 Pay scenario charts The charts below provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the CEO, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under four different performance scenarios: minimum, on-target, maximum and maximum 50%.
Potential reward opportunities are based on the proposed Remuneration Policy, applied to the CEOs base salary as at 1 March 2019 of $700,000.
Performance scenario Maximum % 3,331 23% 33% 44% Maximum 3,331 23% 33% 44% On-target 1,964 40% 42% 19% Minimum 100% 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 CEO total remuneration Fixed pay Single-year variable Multi-year variable The chart above excludes the effect of any Company share price appreciation except in the Maximum 50% scenario.
The minimum scenario shows base salary and benefits that is, fixed remuneration, and associated CTS.
These are the only elements of the CEOs remuneration package which are not at risk.
The on-target scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus a target payout of 75% of the annual bonus and threshold vesting of 25% of the maximum award under the LTIP, and associated CTS.
The maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus full payout of all incentives, and associated CTS.
The maximum 50% scenario reflects the new requirement for a scenario where 50% share price appreciation is included.
As the LTI is not paid in shares, this scenario is the same as the maximum scenario.
Service contracts Executive Director Date of service contract Ignacio Bustamante 1 April 2007 Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee.
Ignacio Bustamante was appointed a Director of the Company with effect from 1 April 2010 and is employed under a contract of employment with Compaia Minera Ares S. A. C. Ares dated 1 April 2007.
The contract is subject to Peruvian law and, as such, has no fixed term and may be terminated i by the executive on 30 days notice and ii by Ares without notice.
Under Peruvian law, termination by Ares other than termination for certain prescribed reasons such as gross negligence gives rise to an entitlement to compensation of no less than 1.5 times the monthly base salary for each year of service completed, up to a maximum of 12 months base salary.
In addition to these provisions and to reflect Peruvian market practice, the Committee has discretion to award Ignacio Bustamante up to an additional 12 months base salary on termination other than for the prescribed reasons outlined above.
The prevailing circumstances will be taken into consideration at the time of termination.
Non-Executive Directors The Groups Non-Executive Directors serve under Letters of Appointment as detailed in the table below.
In accordance with their terms, the Non-Executive Directors serve for an initial period of three years which is automatically extended for further three-year terms.
Notwithstanding this, all Directors are subject to annual re-election by the Company in general meeting in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, and the appointments of Non-Executive Directors may be determined by the Board or the Director giving not less than three months notice.
Details of the terms of appointment of the Companys Non-Executive Directors serving during the year are shown in the table below.
The appointment and reappointment and the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors are matters reserved for the full Board.

The Non-Executive Directors fees have been set at a level to reflect the amount of time and level of involvement required in order to carry out their duties as members of the Board and its Committees.

However, the Company seeks to promote and maintain good relationships with employee representative bodies as part of its employee engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
Although the Committee does not consult directly with employees on Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee takes into consideration the remuneration arrangements for the wider employee population in making its decisions on remuneration for senior executives.

3 Payment for performance during the year under the Annual Bonus Plan.
See following sections for further details.
4 2018 value comprises: a the 2016 LTIP award of $1.4m which will fully vest based on performance to 31 December 2018 and subject to continued employment on the vesting date, and b the five-year tranche of the 2014 ELTIP vesting at 43% $234k using the three-month average share price for the period ending 31 December 2018 of 161.37p based on performance to 31 December 2018 and subject to continued employment on the vesting date.
2017 value comprises: a the 2015 LTIP award of $1m vesting fully based on performance to 31 December 2017 and b a restatement, as required by reporting regulations, of the value of the four-year tranche of the 2014 ELTIP vesting at 86.3% $635k using the share price on the date of vesting of 195.05p, rather than the three-month average share price for the period ending 31 December 2017 which gave a value of $737k.
The 2016 LTIP is paid entirely in cash, therefore none of the vested value of this award can be attributed to an increase in share price over the vesting period.
The five-year tranche of the 2014 ELTIP is paid in shares.
Even though thebased share price increased over the vesting period by 4%, the $-value of the ELTIP award fell by $63k due to the GBP:USD exchange rate declining by 22% over the same period.

Details of the bonus paid to the CEO for 2018, including the specific performance metrics, weightings and performance against each of the metrics, are provided in the table below: Targets 2018 Assessment Target Bonus Objective KPI weighting Threshold Target Maximum 2018 Result score 37.5m Oz 38m Oz 38.4m Oz 38.97m Oz Profitable Production 25% 25% Ag Eq Ag Eq Ag Eq Ag Eq production and financial results 1 EBITDA 15% US$220m US$240m US$250m US$255.7m 15% 2 All-in sustaining cost AISC 15% US$13.6 Oz US$13.2 Oz US$12.9 Oz US$12.5 Oz 15% Brownfields 40m Oz 50m Oz 70m Oz 130m Oz inferred resources 10% 10% Ag Eq Ag Eq Ag Eq Ag Eq subject to permitting Safety & Accident frequency rate 15% 3.00 2.50 2.00 1.74 15% Environmental LTIFR awareness Accident Severity Index 10% 540 450 300 930 NIL 3 ECO score 10% 3.0 3.49 3.3 3.99 4 5.37 10% Bonus Payable as a percentage of maximum opportunity 90% 1 Adjusted EBITDA is used for the annual bonus and is determined based on EBITDA adjusted to neutralise price effects, export taxes in Argentina and is before the LTIP provision.
2 All-in sustaining cost is adjusted to ensure comparability with the objective set at the beginning of the year and therefore disregards the impact of unbudgeted expenditure such as exploration costs, export taxes in Argentina and the LTIP provision.
3 P lease refer to the Sustainability Report on page 40 for further details on the methodology of calculating the Groups ECO score the internally designed measurement of the Companys environmental performance.
The determination of the bonus payout is at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account performance during the year against the above scorecard.
Each objective in the scorecard has a threshold, target and maximum performance target, achievement of which translates into a score for each objective.
The bonus scores for each objective are summed which translates into a percentage which is applied to the maximum bonus opportunity.
The Committee assessed performance against the scorecard and the CEOs performance in 2018.
A number of adjustments were made in line with the Companys usual practice to maintain the quality of earnings by primarily disregarding the impact of factors outside of managements control such as the price of silver and gold as compared to the budgeted prices, the higher provision for vesting of LTIP awards based on relative Total Shareholder Return, and any budgetary additions approved by the Board.
Hochschild has had a successful year in terms of profitable production, cost control and the brownfield exploration programme and, accordingly, the production and financial targets have been met in full.
The ECO target has also been exceeded, therefore this element of the bonus also pays in full.
Safety considerations The Committee has considered, in depth, the Groups safety performance during the year.
In 2017, Hochschild implemented a three-year multi-faceted programme known as The Safety Culture Transformation Plan.
This plan comprises of short-term and longer-term actions focusing on a enhancing Hochschilds risk management systems, b establishing a leadership programme comprising workshops and initiatives to promote safe working, c the redesign of the annual training programmes for our workers and d a comprehensive programme to enhance internal communications on safety.
The Board are encouraged that the Plan appears to be having a positive impact as there have been significant reductions in the number of high potential events and lost time safety events in 2018 compared to 2017 of 46% and 35% respectively.
The Plan has without doubt played a crucial role in reducing the accident frequency rate to a level which exceeds the most stretching target set for the year.
This has meant that the frequency rate target for the CEO has been met in full.
However, despite these positive developments, it is with regret that there were three fatalities during the year.
This has meant that the objective set with reference to the accident severity rate was not met.
The Committee, taking into account the significant improvements in safety over the year, has concluded that the reduction in bonus from the failure to meet this objective represented an appropriate reduction in remuneration and therefore no further reduction was required.
The Committees assessment of performance resulted in the award of a bonus to the CEO of 90% of the maximum opportunity, which equates to 135% of salary.
