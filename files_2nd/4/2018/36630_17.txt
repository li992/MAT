effective operational management, delivered strong operating profit leverage with profits up 15%.
This was especially the case in our international business which delivered a record level of profits.
Importantly, it was also clear that management made significant investments for the long-term future of the business, rather than being solely focused on the short-term.
In addition to a strong profit performance, Hays also delivered a strong cash performance and this, allied to earnings growth with EPS up 18%, has meant that the Group is proposing a record level of dividends for the year, which is to the clear benefit of our shareholders.
This is the fifth year in a row that Hays has delivered a strong profit and cash performance and the results again beat market expectations.
These results, both over the year and over the last three years, have directly contributed to the reward outcomes for the executive directors, both in the annual and long-term incentives, as is covered below.

Nevertheless, the Company is subject to the volatility and vagaries of the economic markets which can create sudden changes within the recruitment market and industry.
In this environment, where it is extremely difficult to give an accurate, robust, long-term prediction of the economy, the Committee believes it is important that the executives reward is consistent with the need to be agile in managing the business.
Cash Conversion The Committee feels this is best addressed by having a short-term focus on profit and 50% a long-term focus on cash generation.
The following factors are taken into account when setting EPS targets: Budget the setting of which is a robust and transparent process: TSR Strategic direction of the business over the period covered 20% by the PSP: Market conditions and visibility of future trading: and Analysts forecasts.
The cash element focuses on the long-term business efficiency and return to shareholders through dividend payments.
Performance Period The TSR element directly measures shareholder returns relative 3 years 2 year to industry peers.
Holding Period The five year term of the plan together with shareholding requirements ensure that the CEO and CFO have a material, personal stake in the business and align to shareholders.

Due to timing, the FY18 Single Figure includes elements from both the 2014 and 2017 Remuneration Policies.
The FY18 Annual Bonus potential falls under the new Policy approved at the November 2017 AGM.
However the PSP that was granted in FY15 and vests in FY18 was made under the legacy Policy approved at the November 2014 AGM.
The overall total potential face value of the Annual Bonus and PSP under both the 2014 and 2017 Policies is the same at a combined maximum of 300% of base salary.
However, due to rebalancing the split between the short and long-term incentives in the 2017 Policy and the overlap of policies in relation to the trailing PSP, it means that for FY18 there is an anomaly in the potential total quantum.
This will also occur in FY19.

Our Management Board has an annual bonus scheme that is measured against Group and Regional financial targets and personal and strategic objectives.
Of any award, 50% is deferred into shares for three years and subject to Malus provisions.
Members of the Management Board also participate in the Performance Share Plan PSP with the same performance conditions as the executive directors.
Employees below the Management Board receive salary and benefits which are benchmarked to the local markets and countries in which they work.
There is a strong tie of reward to performance which is recognised through annual bonuses, commission or other non-financial recognition.
Employees who hold key strategic positions or are deemed critical to the business through their performance are also offered the opportunity to participate in the Performance Share Plan with performance conditions based on Group EPS results measured over one year.
Any shares that crystallise at the end of the performance period have a further two year holding period prior to vesting.
During this time there is also a personal performance underpin.
In addition, nine countries offer a Sharesave plan to employees.
AResolutionwas passed at the 2016 AGM to enable the future introduction of a US Stock Purchase Plan for employees in the USA.
As stated in our Remuneration Policy, each year, prior to reviewing the remuneration of the executive directors and the members of the Management Board, the Committee considers a report prepared by the Group Head of Reward detailing remuneration practice across the Group.
The report provides a regional overview of how employee pay compares to the market, any material changes during the year and includes detailed analysis of basic pay and variable pay changes within the UK where all of the executive directors and most of the Management Board are based.
While the Company does not currently directly consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay and formulating the Remuneration Policy, the Company takes account of feedback from the broader employee population on an annual basis using the engagement survey which includes a number of questions relating to remuneration.
Over the course of FY19, the Board and Committee will give further consideration to its approach to complying with the new Corporate Governance Code, which comes into effect for Hays from 1 July 2019.
Further detail will be provided in next years report.

The Chief Executives remuneration disclosed in the table below has been calculated to take into account base salary, taxable benefits, excluding his allowance in lieu of pension, and annual bonus including any amount deferred.
The UK employee pay on which the average percentage change is based is calculated using the increase in the earnings of UK-based, full-time employees who are eligible for increases in salary benefits and who participate in the standard discretionary i. e. not commission based annual bonus plans employees who receive bonuses on a monthly or other time-scale basis are excluded.
It uses P11d data from tax years 2017 and 2018.
Part-time employees have been excluded from the analysis as many will have experienced material changes in pay during the period due to their change of hours.
The comparison figures are based on relevant UK employees as described above as both executive directors and most of the Management Board are UK based and this is considered to be an appropriate comparison.

3.3 External appointments The Company considers that certain external appointments can help to broaden the experience and contribution to the Board of the executive directors.
Any such appointments are subject to prior agreement by the Company and must not be with competing companies.
Subject to the Companys agreement, any fees may be retained by the individual.
For the 12 months ended 30 June 2018, the fees earned and retained by the executive directors were as follows: Alistair Cox: Alistair was appointed as a non-executive director at Just Eat plc on 2 May 2017.
His current fee for the twelve months ending 31 December 2018 is 62,500.
Paul Venables: Paul holds no external appointments.

During FY18 Deloitte has advised the Committee on all aspects of the current Remuneration Policy for executive directors and members of the Management Board.
Deloitte also provided advice to the Company in relation to taxation compliance work and tax advice including transfer pricing work.

The Committee is satisfied that the advice received was objective and independent.
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants group and the voluntary code of conduct of that body is designed to ensure objective and independent advice is given to Remuneration Committees.
Deloittes total fee for FY18 in relation to Committee work was 96k excluding VAT.

The Committee takes into consideration whether the achievement of objectives and any payment from plans have taken into account the overall risk profile of the Company when it evaluates the executives performance.
