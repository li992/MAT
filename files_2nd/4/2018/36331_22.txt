Malus and clawback provisions apply.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 63 Governance REMUNERATION POLICY SUMMARY CONTINUED Shareholding guidelines The Executive Directors are expected to build up a shareholding of equivalent value to 200% of their base salary.
As a minimum, half the after-tax number of vested LTIP shares granted from 2018 must be retained towards satisfaction of this guideline, which is expected to be met within five years of its introduction subject to personal circumstances.
How the Executive Directors Remuneration Policy relates to the wider Group As the Executive Directors have the greater potential to influence overall Group performance, their Remuneration Policy is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than that for other employees.
The Committee considers any general basic salary increase for the broader Company when determining the annual salary review for the Executive Directors.
How the views of employees and shareholders are taken into account The HR Director attends and reports to the Remuneration Committee regularly and in doing so takes into consideration and reports on the employees views collected via staff-wide surveys and other cascade feedback sessions.
This process will be reviewed once the current FRC consultation into remuneration committee engagement with the wider workforce is complete.
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received from the AGM, along with guidance from shareholder representative bodies and any feedback received during meetings with shareholders, as part of its ongoing review of remuneration policy.
Approach to recruitment remuneration When setting the remuneration package for a new Executive Director, the Committee will apply the principles in the Remuneration Policy.
For appointments from outside the Company, the Remuneration Committee may offer compensation that it considers appropriate and reasonable for awards and benefits forfeited from a previous position.
This would reflect the performance requirements, timing and other specific matters the Committee considers relevant, and could be in cash or share awards.
The policy is that the maximum payment under any such arrangements which may be in addition to the normal variable remuneration should be no more than the Committee considers is required to provide reasonable compensation to the incoming Executive Director.
In the case of an employee who is promoted to the position of Executive Director, it is the Companys policy to honour the terms of existing award commitments.
Directors service contracts and provision on payment for loss of office The Company can terminate Executive Directors service contracts with up to one years notice, and the Director can terminate it with at least six months notice.
If an Executive Directors employment is to be terminated, and in the absence of a breach of the service agreement by the Executive Director, the Committees policy is to agree a termination payment based on the base salary and contractual pension amounts and benefits that would have accrued during the notice period.
The departing Executive Director may work, or be placed on leave, for all or part of their notice period, or receive a payment in lieu of notice in accordance with the service agreement.
Depending on the circumstances, the Committee may also apply the principle of mitigation, to reduce any termination payment.
In addition, the Committee may also make payments in relation to any statutory entitlements, to settle any claim against the Company e. g. in relation to breach of statutory employment rights or wrongful dismissal or make a modest provision in respect of legal costs or outplacement fees.
The Company has an enhanced redundancy policy allowing redundancy amounts to be calculated by reference to actual basic weekly salary, and the policy may be extended to Executive Directors where relevant.
With regard to annual bonus for a departing Executive Director, if employment ends due to redundancy, retirement with the agreement of the Company, ill health, disability or death, or any other reason as determined by the Committee i. e. the individual is a good leaver, the Executive Director may be considered for a bonus payment.
If the termination is for any other reason, any entitlement to bonus would normally lapse.
Under any circumstance, it is the Committees policy to ensure any bonus payment reflects the departing Executive Directors performance and behaviour towards the Company.
64 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Other information Any bonus payment will normally be delayed until the performance conditions have been determined for the relevant period and be subject to a pro-rata reduction for the portion of the relevant bonus year the individual was employed.
Share-based incentives granted to an Executive Director will be based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment will be for outstanding awards to lapse on cessation of employment.
For awards granted under the Companys LTIPs, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as injury or disability, redundancy, transfer or sale of the employing company, retirement with the Companys agreement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee reflecting the circumstances that prevail at the time, good leaver status may be applied.
If treated as a good leaver, awards will be eligible to vest subject to performance conditions, which will be measured over the original performance period unless the Committee elects to test performance to the date of cessation of employment and be subject to a pro-rata reduction unless the Committee considered it inappropriate to reflect the proportion of the vesting period actually served.
With regard to the deferral of annual bonus, deferred share bonus awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment other than where an Executive Director is a good leaver, with awards then vesting on the normal vesting date.
It is the Companys policy to honour pre-existing award commitments.
Where the Executive Director participates in one or more of the Companys HMRC-approved share plans, awards may vest or be exercisable on, or following, termination of employment in certain good leaver circumstances, where permissible, in accordance with the rules of the plan and relevant legislation.
External appointments Executive Directors are permitted to accept external non-executive appointments with the prior approval of the Board.
It is normal practice for Executive Directors to retain fees provided for non-executive appointments.
Non-Executive Directors fees The policy on Non-Executive Directors fees is set out below: Non-Executive Directors Purpose and To provide a competitive fee which will attract high-calibre individuals who, through their experience, can further the link to strategy interests of the Group.
Operation The fees for Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman are typically reviewed every second year, or more frequently if required.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive an annual fee paid in cash.
They do not participate in any of the Companys incentive arrangements or receive any pension provision.
The Non-Executive Directors receive a basic Board fee, with additional fees for chairing the Companys key committees or for performing the Senior Independent Director role.
Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for travel and related business expenses reasonably incurred in performing their duties.
The Committee without the Chairman determines the Chairmans fee and recommends it to the Board.
The Chairman and Executive Directors determine the Non-Executive Directors fees.
Opportunity Fee levels can be increased to ensure they continue to recognise the time commitment of the role, fee levels for Non-Executive Directors in general, and fee levels in companies of a similar size and complexity.
Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial fixed term of three years, subject to earlier termination by either party on written notice.
In each case, this term can be extended by mutual agreement.
Non-Executive Directors have no entitlement to contractual termination payments.
The dates of the initial appointments of the Non-Executive Directors are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

Helen Gordons base salary is 470,120 and Vanessa Simms base salary is 327,040, both with effect from 1 January 2018.
2 Taxable benefits include a car allowance and private medical insurance.
3 In line with the 2017 Remuneration Policy, 25% of the bonus is deferred into shares for three years.
4 In line with the requirements of the Remuneration Reporting Regulations, the 2018 LTIP vesting values are based on the forecast value of the awards due to vest on 11 January 2019 50% of the award is based on EPRA NNNAV performance measured over the three years to 30 September 2018, and 50% of the award is based on absolute TSR measured over the three-year period to 11 January 2019.
The growth in Graingers EPRA NNNAV over the three-year period to 30 September 2018 was 1.7 times the increase in the Halifax and Nationwide House Price indices over the same period.
For this part of the award, this results in 15.8% being eligible to vest.
Absolute TSR performance based on an assessment period measured to 22 October 2018 results in an annualised TSR of 10.03%.
This in turn results in a projected vesting level of 50.3%, for this part of the award.
In aggregate, this results in current estimated vesting being 33.1% of the total award.
The applicable performance period is due to end on 11 January 2019.
The share price for valuing the award is the three-month average share price to 28 September 2018 303.6p for the TSR element.
This value will be trued up in next years report to reflect the actual level of vesting and share price at the vesting date.
In addition, the total LTIP value of the award vesting in January 2019 in respect of Nick Jopling is 172,607, Nick, being a former Director of Grainger.
The 2017 LTIP value has been restated and reflects the actual value of the awards that vested in December 2017.
5 The pension benefits are based on 15% of base salary.
6 Please see Note 6 on page 71 in relation to the vesting of the Tranche 3 buy-out award made to Helen Gordon.
7 With regard to the single total figure of remuneration for each Director in relation to the year under review, the Committee was comfortable with the amounts payable given the performance achieved.
In forming this view the Committee noted the achievement of a ROSE of 6.1% and adjusted earnings of 94m in a challenging market context.
In addition, substantial strategic progress was also made with the PRS strategy being delivered and embedded in the business.
8 The salaries for Non-Executive Directors reflect payments in relation to any chairmanship roles as applicable during the year under review or the preceding year and in some cases pro-rata adjustments are made to reflect the changes in respect of such roles being taken part way through the relevant year.
9 On 7 February 2018 Belinda Richards retired from the Board.

LTIP awards performance assessment for 2018 The awards made to Executive Directors in January 2016, and which are due to vest in January 2019, are based on EPRA NNNAV and absolute TSR targets measured over a three-year period.
Performance against the vesting schedule can be summarised as follows: LTIP awards vesting in January 2019 Out-turn Actual forecast % of max Measure Weighting Threshold Maximum performance element LTIP 1 Three-year growth in TSR annual compound 50% 5% 15% 10.03% 50.3% EPRA NNNAV increase over three years relative to HPI, 2 as measured by Halifax and Nationwide 50% 1.5% 3.0% 1.7% 15.8% 1 The applicable performance measurement period is the three years to 11 January 2019.
The performance reported above, therefore, is a forecast based on performance measured to 22 October 2018 using the three month average share price to this date for the purposes of calculating the annualised TSR.
The 22 October 2018 was chosen as the performance measurement date since it is the latest practicable date for running the analysis for 2018 reporting purposes.
Actual performance for the TSR element of the award will be determined once the performance period concludes and the actual vesting result will be included in a restated 2018 single figure total in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
2 Performance measurement period three years to 30 September 2018.
EPRA NNNAV increased by 20% between September 2015 and September 2018 while the average increase in the Halifax and Nationwide House Price indices over the same period was 11%.
The forecast vesting value of the awards made in January 2016, subject to the above performance targets, is included in the 2018 single figure table above.
The awards made to Executive Directors in December 2014, and which vested in December 2017, were based on EPRA NNNAV and absolute TSR targets measured over a three-year period.

Actual performance over the performance period, at 15.3%, was higher than the forecast included in last years Directors Remuneration report which had been estimated at 14%.
This in turn resulted in an increase in the vesting result from 90% to 100% which has been included in a restated 2017 single figure table on page 73.

The TPR performance condition requires three-year growth in TPR to be above 5% for 25% of this part of the award to vest, with vesting then increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% for 9% growth or better.
Following vesting, a two-year holding period is applied on vested shares.

2 As previously disclosed, Helen Gordon received a buy-out award on joining the Company.
The award was structured in three tranches.
Tranche 1 included 33,122 shares, of which 5,520 shares vested in May 2016 and 27,602 lapsed at the same time.
Tranche 2 included 69,328 shares, of which 21,353 vested in March 2017 and 47,975 shares lapsed at the same time.
Tranche 3, included 50,045 shares, of which 26,524 shares vested in March 2018 and 23,521 lapsed at the same time.
The number of shares vesting in relation to Tranches 1 to 3 related to the Committees assessment of the value forfeited having had regard where relevant to the performance targets applying to the awards originally granted i. e. the adjustments reflected the Committees assessment of the number of shares that would have vested in her previous employment, following application of the performance conditions attached to the relevant awards, with the assessment made based on publicly disclosed information by her previous employer.
The total number of shares included in the table above is the opening number of shares at the start of the year under review that remained eligible to vest i. e. relating to Tranche 3, and the movement during the year related to the vesting and lapsing of Tranche 3 shares.
There is now a nil balance for this award.

Accordingly, there is an element of double counting in her single figure of total remuneration for 2016.
2 Andrew Cunningham was acting Chief Executive for most of 2009 due to the absence through illness of Rupert Dickinson.
Percentage change in remuneration of Chief Executive and employees The percentage change in remuneration between 2017 and 2018, excluding LTIP and pension contributions, for the Chief Executive and for the average of all other employees in the Group was as follows: Percentage change 201718 Taxable Base salary Benefits Annual bonus 1 Chief Executive 2% 0% 22% 2 Employee population 0% 5% 0% 1 The base salary for the Chief Executive has increased with effect from 1 January 2018 by 2.2% in line with the wider population.
The bonus opportunity and other benefits for the Chief Executive have remained unchanged in 2018.
2 The 2017 figures for the employee population included the amounts paid to an executive director who has since left the business.
If these payments were excluded from the 2017 figures, the year on year changes to 2018 would be 2% for the base salary, 8% for the taxable benefits and 12% for the annual bonus.
Relative importance of spend on pay The difference in actual expenditure between 2017 and 2018 on remuneration for all employees, in comparison to profit before tax continuing operations and distributions to shareholders by way of dividend, is set out in the charts below.
Profit before tax is considered to be an appropriate financial metric as it is not impacted by changes in tax rates which are outside of the direct control of the Company.

Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2019 Base salary In line with the typical increase given to the wider employee population, the Remuneration Committee determined that the base salaries for the two Executive Directors should be increased by 2.5% with effect from 1 January 2019.
Annual bonus As detailed in the Annual Statement and Summary Remuneration Policy, the structure and metrics to operate for the 2019 annual bonus are as follows: Chief Executive: 140% of salary Chief Financial Officer: 120% of salary With regard to the level of bonus earned, 25% will be deferred into Grainger shares for three years.
The range of targets to apply to the 2019 annual bonus are to remain the same as in 2018 for both the adjusted earnings element i. e. the same performance range around budget is being retained and level of returns targeted under the ROSE element.
However, reflecting that the 2019 budget includes lower levels of forecast asset sales which is consistent with our increased focus on delivering greater certainty of income returns, the absolute level of adjusted earnings required at the target performance level has not been set at a premium to the 2019 actual result.
Full retrospective disclosure of the actual targets will be included in next years Directors Remuneration report subject to considering any perceived areas of commercial sensitivity.
The Committee is comfortable that the targets set for 2019 and summarised below are at least as challenging as the targets set in 2018 in light of our forward planning and the wider economic context.
The table below sets out the performance targets and their respective weightings for 2019: Metric Weighting Rationale and description Adjusted earnings 40% Incentivises operational success in achieving rental growth, income from sales and reduction in operational and finance costs relative to a challenging budget.

These are consistent with the strategy and targeted objectives for the year agreed by the Board.
Due to matters of commercial sensitivity it would not be in the interests of the Company to disclose the precise personal targets for the annual bonus at the date of production of this report.
Details of the objectives and the performance achieved will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2019 Annual Report.

As detailed in the Remuneration Policy, strict recovery and withholding provisions apply to both LTIP and annual bonus awards, which will enable the Committee to reclaim or adjust future variable pay awards if there is a misstatement of the Companys results, any errors in calculation of actual performance against a target set, or in the event of misconduct.
Furthermore, the Committee will retain the right to reduce overall pay outcomes if it considers the variable pay result does not reflect broader Company performance over the relevant performance periods.
