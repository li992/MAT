Actual performance is also measured at this constant exchange rate.
In October 2017 the Board upgraded expected profits by circa 30% over budget consensus.
The profit element of the plan still comfortably met maximum pay-out at Renewi Group level due to the delivery of a strong financial performance, despite challenges in both Municipal and Hazardous Waste Divisions and recent market headwinds from recyclate pricing.
This was driven by excellent trading in the Commercial and Monostreams businesses, coupled with synergies being delivered ahead of plan.
The cash position was also materially better than budget expectations throughout the year with cash having been managed tightly during the first year of post-merger integration, resulting in the achievement of each quarterly underlying free cash flow target at an overall Renewi level.
