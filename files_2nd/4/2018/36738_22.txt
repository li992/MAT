As a result, year-on-year comparisons between 2017 and 2018 for the CEO are not reflective of real change.
Hikmas pay review, which took effect from 1 January 2018, awarded average percentage increases in wages and salaries of 3.0% for existing employees with certain exceptions for jurisdictions experiencing very high inflation.
The nature and level of benefits to employees in the year ended 31 December 2018 were broadly similar to those in the previous year.
The benefits received by the CEO relate to the different circumstances of the new incumbent.
Gender diversity Hikma has less than 250 employees in the UK and, as a result, is exempt from certain disclosure requirements.
The small number of employees and significant diversity of roles in the UK results in significant challenges in obtaining comparable data.

86 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2018 Fixed elements Corporate governance | Committees | Remuneration EIP rationale The Remuneration Committee considers that the EIP remains appropriate because: Global focus: Approximately 32% of Hikmas business is located in the MENA and 62% in the US, which requires Hikma to compete with local practices, particularly: US: to offer sufficient leverage in the incentives to be reasonably competitive compared to US generic pharmaceutical companies, where the key talent pool is based MENA: the strong short-term remuneration focus in the MENA which is partly reflective of the skills required to successfully navigate the political and economic environment US and MENA: equity based incentives are generally subject to time based vesting following grant, not multi-year performance conditions Business Dynamics: Political and economic change in key markets may cause a short-term lack of visibility of revenues and profits that could discourage longer-term investment and development.

Annualised salary Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC | Annual Report 2018 87 Remuneration Committee continued Executive Incentive Plan EIP The 2018 performance conditions and their weighting are detailed on this page.
The Committee considers that the EIP has been very successful in aligning Executive Directors compensation outcomes with the performance of Hikma.
Performance criteria For 2019, the Committee has determined that the performance criteria will be: Area Description Weight Rationale Financial Revenue 30% In general, the pricing of generic pharmaceutical products decreases with time.
The Committee is cognisant that this could lead to declining revenue over the longer term, which could ultimately result in a declining business overall.
By ensuring that a significant proportion of performance remuneration is based on revenue, the Committee is able to ensure that the Executive Directors are focused on mitigating pricing declines by maximising the potential of the in-market portfolio, launching new products, and developing the pipeline.
Please see page 18 of the Strategic report for the detail on this target.
Core Operating Profit 30% Ultimately, Core Operating Profit is the value of Hikma to shareholders.
Given the highly competitive before R&D business environment in which Hikma operates, the Executive Directors must focus continuously on optimising Hikmas cost base.
The Committee wants the Executive Directors to deliver an optimised cost base without putting at risk the longer-term prospects of the business by underinvesting in R&D.
Therefore, R&D costs have been excluded from this criterion.
Strategic Strategic Deliverables 40% The targets are designed to ensure that the Executive Directors deliver the strategic plan that was approved by the Board during 2018.
Further details will be disclosed on measurement.
Disclosed on measurement The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the disclosure of high-level forward-looking targets provides shareholders with an awareness of direction and outcomes but, given the commercial sensitivity arising in relation to the detailed financial and strategic targets used for the EIP, disclosing precise targets for the EIP in advance would not be in shareholders interests.
This avoids the risk of Hikma inadvertently providing a profit forecast or giving our international competitors access to sensitive information or an unfair advantage.
Actual targets, performance achieved and awards made are published at the end of the performance period so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs under the EIP.

Elements A and C of the EIP comprise the bonus and: Element B comprises the share award.
Elements A, B and C of the EIP are made in the year after the performance is achieved eg for the 2019 illustration, the bonus would be paid and the share awards be made in 2020.
The share awards would vest two to three years later.
Please note that the Remuneration and performance summary on page 85 uses share awards vesting ie actual shares received, not those granted during the period in order to make clear the difference between potential remuneration and what the executive receives in practice.

The Regulations require Element C to be treated in a similar way to the annual bonus, although it is an award of shares that will vest three years after grant.
