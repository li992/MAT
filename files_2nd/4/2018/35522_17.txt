Cost or valuation A change in either of these assumptions could have a significant effect on the overall valuation of the estate.

Following the reassessment of the growth rate the recoverable 2.5% 89 89 46 46 amount of the Unique sub-group has been determined as 1,687 million 2017: 1,828 million, resulting in an impairment of 29 million - 2.5% 89 89 46 46 2017: headroom of 112 million which has been recorded in the period.

Similarly an increase of 0.25% in the long-term growth rate used would result in headroom of 109 million 2017: 267 - 0.25 91 91 46 46 million or a decrease of 0.25% in the long-term growth rate used would result in a further impairment of 126 million 2017: an impairment The properties used as security for the corporate bonds in Ei Group plc have been valued by GVA Grimley Limited 1,948 properties and of 28 million.

The Groups objective is to minimise this risk by carrying out credit checks Current where appropriate.
The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of a bad debt provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the Other loans receivable 3 3 balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt 3 3 provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.

The fair value of the corporate bonds and securitised bonds is measured at market price and are therefore evaluated to be level 1 in the fair value 207 197 231 228 hierarchy described in note 3.
At 30 September 2018 the value of deposits held by the Group in other payables is 32 million 2017: 32 million and by the Parent Company is 19 million 2017: 19 million.
Management assessed that cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks and other financial liabilities, obligations under finance leases, as well as other non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
The fair value of the Groups bank borrowings, evaluated to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 3, is not deemed to be materially different to the nominal value if it had been determined by using the discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that reflects the issuers borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period.
The own non-performance risk as at 30 September 2018 was also assessed to be insignificant.
