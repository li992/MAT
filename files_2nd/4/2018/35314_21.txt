The Customer measures were assessed considered the impact of the Ogden-related reserve releases as being on target.
The Committee is pleased to report this made since February 2017 in terms of the impact on the 2016 year that management have made significant progress on AIP out-turn.
Had they been attributed to the 2016 financial thetechnology transformation agenda on which the Personal year, this would have resulted in a maximum pay-out for the objective was measured, and awarded an out-turn of 70% financial element of the AIP and a potential increase to 2016 forthis element.
Full details on the outcomes for the year are bonuses of up to 45% of maximum.
The Committee reviewed included on pages 96 99. this result in the context of balancing the desire to ensure the outcome was fair to participants while being appropriately We therefore awarded bonuses of 68% of the maximum to aligned with the shareholder experience.

To align the 2016 AIP out-turn Finally, the Committee noted that the Ogden rate change in withshareholders, the Committee significantly reduced the AIP February 2017 was exceptional in that there had not been out-turn from an anticipated maximum pay-out for the financial achange for over 10 years.
Now that the new rate setting element based on the indicative range used by the Committee mechanism has been implemented, the Committee considers for its assessment to 10% out of the 55% of total bonus that the impact of future Ogden discount rate changes to be opportunity attributable, an approach more conservative than part of the normal management of reserves and so it is unlikely many of the Groups competitors.
The government, at the same in the normal course of events that special allowance will be time, announced that a review of the rate setting mechanism made in the AIP out-turn for a change in Ogden discount rate.
Given these exceptional circumstances, the Committee agreed to keep its assessment of the 2016 AIP outcome under review to enable the Committee to recalculate the out-turn for the 2016 financial year if the Ogden discount rate was raised or the mechanism for setting it was changed.

2015 LTIP awards RoTE the expected vesting outcome figures for the RoTE portion of the awards granted under the LTIP in 2015 and reported in 2017 have been updated.
These updates are based on the actual vesting of the RoTE portion of the awards and a share price of 3.75300 and 3.34400 on 25 March 2018 and 26 August 2018 respectively, compared to the three-month average share price of 3.65557 used in reporting this figure in the 2017 report.
Therevised figures include the actual number of dividends accrued on this portion of the award at vesting.
This results in an adjusted reportable decrease of approximately 292,700 for Paul Geddes, 177,160 for John Reizenstein, and 149,439 for Mike Holliday-Williams with a corresponding decrease of thesingle figure for 2017 reflected in the table above.
Further information on LTIP awards can be found on pages 107 to 108.
SIP includes the value of matching shares under the SIP.
The 2017 annual bonus figure for Penny James includes a payment of 840,841 made in lieu of the bonus forfeited at her previous employer and is pro rated forthe period 1 January to 31 October 2017 before Penny joined the Group.
This is in line with the estimated payment shown in last years report and therefore this figure has not been updated.
The 2017 estimated long-term incentive figure for Penny James in respect of the first tranche of her buy-out awards, which vested in May 2018 and which was reported in 2017, has been updated.
This value is based on an actual level of vesting of 95.835% and the share price on 2 May 2018 of 3.658.

2016 single figure table restated Audited As set out in the Chairs letter, the Committee concluded that an adjustment to the 2016 profit out-turn as a result of the impact ofreserve releases that are due to the Ogden rate changes is appropriate.
This led to additional payments in March 2019, inrelation to the 2016 AIP, representing 20% of maximum opportunity of the original awards.
The 2016 single figure table is therefore restated below to reflect this.
All additional payments in relation to the 2016 AIP have been made in accordance with the normal policy with 40% deferred into the Groups shares which will vest on the third anniversary of award March 2022.
The revised 2016 annual bonus figure for Paul Geddes relates to an adjustment of 20% of maximum opportunity of the original award of 594,287, resulting in an increase of 276,413.

Although Mike Holliday-Williams was not an Executive Director during 2016, his restated annual bonus has been included above for completeness.
This represents an adjustment of 20% of maximum opportunity of the original award of 385,074, resulting in an increase of 160,448.
The original out-turn and explanation of the 2016 AIP can be found on page 88 of the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
The 2016 figures are as disclosed on page 79 of the 2017 Annual Report other than in relation to the restated bonus.

40% of any AIP award is deferred into shares under the DAIP, vesting three years after grant.
Financial element 55% weighting The financial performance measure is profit before tax.
The Committee established a target performance level at the start of theyear.
The only adjustment from the reported accounting position, as explained in the letter from the Committee Chair, was to exclude the assumed benefit as a result of the Ogden discount rate change.
In the table below, we have disclosed the target set for profit before tax performance.
The actual profit before tax performance includes the adjustment to reported profit before tax asdescribed above.
The approach taken to assessing financial performance against this measure was based on a straight-line outcome between 10% for threshold performance and 60% for on target performance, and a straight-line outcome between on target performance and 100% for achievement of maximum performance.
The formulaic outcome from 2018 performance against the financial measure was 64%, giving a total of 35% out of 55% attributable to this element.
A summary of the assessment is provided in the following table.

Each grant is subject to the following performance conditions: RoTE 60% weighting performance is measured over three financial years starting from the 1 January preceding the Marchgrant: and Relative TSR 40% weighting performance is measured over a three-year period from the date of grant.
2015 LTIP awards vested in 2018 Awards under the LTIP granted in March and August 2015 vested during 2018.
They were subject to relative TSR performance over the three-year vesting period, and RoTE performance in 2015, 2016 and 2017.
Consistent with the regulations, the expected RoTE vesting outcomes for the year ended 31 December 2017 together with theTSR elements from the 2014 awards, were included in the 2017 single remuneration figure in the 2017 report.
The 2017 single remuneration figure has been updated in the 2018 report to reflect the known share price at the actual vesting date for the RoTE portion of the awards.
You can find details of this on page 95.
The performance outcomes of these elements are included in the table below.
The 2018 single remuneration figure includes the value of the 2015 TSR elements which vested in March and August 2018.

The RoTE performance period for these awards ended on 31 December 2018 and performance in respect of this element is set out in the table below.
Performance under the relative TSR measure will be assessed at the end of the vesting periods in March 2019 and August 2019 respectively and will be disclosed in the 2019 Directors Remuneration Report.
This is subject to the Committees satisfaction that the financial and risk underpins have been met at the end of the vesting period.

His 2016 LTIP awards are pro rated accordingly and will be disclosed as a payment to past directors in the 2019 annual report on remuneration.
John Reizensteins 2018 single figure disclosure will therefore only include the amount vesting in relation to the March 2015 TSR component of the LTIP.
Buy-out award The second tranche of Penny James buy-out award is due to vest on 1 April 2019, based on the achievement of performance targets that relate partly to the performance of the Company and partly to the performance of her previous employer.
The performance conditions for this award are relative TSR 50% and IFRS profit over 2016, 2017 and 2018 50%.
Relative TSRperformance is measured against a peer group based on the prior employers TSR performance from 1 January 2016 to 31October 2017 and Direct Line Groups TSR performance from 1 November 2017 to 31 December 2018 with a threshold vesting of median 25% vests and a maximum vesting of upper quartile 100% vests.
The peer group is consistent with that used by the prior employer.
Relative TSR performance over the period was just below the upper quartile of the comparator group.
As such, 94.7% of this element will vest.
The prior employer does not disclose the IFRS profit targets in advance of vesting.
The outcome for this element is estimated to be 100% based on the prior employers previous years LTIP out-turn and the 2018 mid-year results.
The overall estimated vesting outcome is therefore 97% of maximum.
The final vesting outcome will be disclosed in the 2019 Directors Remuneration Report once the prior employers targets and actual performance have been published.
The number of shares expected to vest is 705,871, calculated as 97% of 725,199.
The estimated value is 2,259,087 based on a three-month average share price to 31 December 2018 of 3.20042.

CEO pay ratio The Committee has chosen to adopt early the CEO pay ratio disclosure requirements which would otherwise come into effectfrom next years Directors Remuneration Report.
Over the coming year, the Committee will determine the appropriate methodology Option A, B or C to be used in future years, considering the robustness of the calculation methodology, the consistency of the method going forward as well as operational time constraints.
For the purposes of this years disclosure, the April 2018 gender pay gap data has been used to identify the three appropriate employees for comparison with the CEO Option B.
Further detail on this methodology is set out below.
The table below compares the 2018 single total figure of remuneration for the CEO with that of the Group employees who are paid at the 25th percentile lower quartile, 50th percentile median and 75th percentile upper quartile of its employee population.
Year Method 25th percentile pay ratio Median pay ratio 75th percentile pay ratio 2018 Option B 127:1 116:1 81:1 The remuneration figures for the employee at each quartile were determined with reference to 31 December 2018.
Under Option B, the latest available gender pay gap data is used to identify the best equivalent for three Group employees whose hourly rates of pay are at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles for the Group and their total pay and benefits figure for 2018 is then calculated.
A sample of employees with hourly pay rates either side of the initially identified individuals are also reviewed to ensure that the appropriate representative employees are selected.
The table below sets out the salary and total pay and benefits for the three identified quartile point employees: 25th percentile P25 Median P50 75th percentile P75 Salary 20,072 24,810 34,452 Total pay and benefits 25,072 27,538 39,555 Each employees pay and benefits were calculated using each element of employee remuneration, consistent with the CEO, on a full-time equivalent basis.
No adjustments other than to achieve full-time equivalent rates were made and no components of pay have been omitted.
Base salaries of all employees, including our Executive Directors, are set with reference to a range of factors including market practice, experience and performance in role.
For reference, the CEO base salary median pay ratio is 33:1.
In reviewing the ratios the Committee also noted that the CEOs remuneration package is weighted more heavily towards variable pay including the AIP and LTIP than the wider workforce due to the nature of the role, and this means the ratio is likely to fluctuate depending on the performance of the business and associated outcomes of incentive plans in each year.
The Groups employees are fundamental to the Groups strategy and to ensuring a high level of service to our customers.
We are proud that the high number of consultants in our customer service centres are employed by the Group rather than being outsourced, and note that the impact of these lower paid roles is reflected in the ratios above.
Further details on our approach to fairly paying and motivating our employees are set out on page 58.

Bonus including deferred 1 2 3 Salary Benefits amount Chief Executive Officer 2.5% 7.1% 20.9% All employees average 4.46% 16.9% 12.1% Notes: 1.
Based on the change in average pay for employees employed in the year ended 31 December 2018 and the year ended 31 December 2017.
There were no changes in benefits provision between 2017 and 2018.
There has been a change in the assumptions used to calculate the all-employee average benefits figure, making the year on year change appear high to last year.
If the treatment was the same as previous years, this would result in a 5% benefits increase from 2017 for all employees.
For employees other than the Chief Executive Officer, this includes average amounts earned under the AIP, and other variable incentive schemes, including monthly and quarterly incentive schemes operated in certain parts of the Group.
Chief Executive Officers pay between 2012 and 2018 and historical performance of TSR The table below shows historical levels of the Chief Executive Officers pay between 2012 and 2018.
It also shows vesting of annual and long-term incentive pay awards as a percentage of the maximum available opportunity.
This is presented against the Companys TSR since its shares began trading on the London Stock Exchange in October 2012, against the FTSE 350 Index excluding investment trusts over the same period.
This peer group is the same used for measuring relative TSR under the LTIP.
Based on actual vesting under the 2010, 2011 and 2012 RBS Group LTIP.
The value included in the single figures in respect of these awards is 205,000 in 2012, 728,000 in 2013 and 2,437,428 in 2014.
The 2016 single figure and annual bonus payment have been updated to reflect an adjustment to the original award of 20% of maximum opportunity related to the Ogden discount rate change.
The 2017 single figure has been revised to reflect the actual vesting of the 2015 awards under the LTIP, an increase of 292,700.
The 2018 single figure reflects the estimated vesting of the RoTE portion of the LTIP granted in March and August 2016.
Any shares under the LTIP granted in 2015 will not be delivered until the end of the applicable vesting periods in March and August 2019.
However, they have been included in the single figure, asthe performance period in respect of the RoTE portion has now been completed.

There have been no share buy-backs since the IPO.
The dividends paid information has been taken from note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
Theoverall expenditure on pay has been taken from note 10 and therefore, consistent with market practice, it has not been calculated in a manner consistent withthe single figure in this report.

This means the total combined face value of awards per year to each of the Executive Directors equates to 200% of base salary.

To do this, the Committee must be satisfied that it is appropriate to permit a bonus award at all, or at a given level.
The gateway involves some subjectivity about performance.
This may result in positive or negative moderation of each AIP performance measure or the overall bonus outcome.
The targets are commercially sensitive and will be disclosed in next years report.
The list on the following page sets out the gateway criteria for the AIP for 2019.
110 DIRECT LINE GROUP 2018 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Gateway criteria for the AIP for 2019 outcomes for ExecutiveDirectors Year on year changes in profit before tax Quality and sustainability of earnings, referring to reserving, gross written premium, costs and loss ratio, and relevant leadindicators Additional customer context, for example, conduct, experience, brand and franchise health Capital strength and affordability Risk management within risk appetite The Groups relative performance to that of its peers The wider economic environment Exceptional events, such as abnormal weather Any regulatory breaches and or reputational damage to the Group Committee satisfaction that paying the bonus does not cause major reputational concerns The Committee may also use its discretion to account for additional factors.
These include the quality of financial results, thedirection of travel of all measures, and, more widely, reputation, risk and audit.
In considering such factors, and whether to adjust the overall pay-outs and or operate malus and clawback, the Committee receives appropriate input from the Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee.
LTIP 2019 Annual LTIP Director Position award for 2019 Paul Geddes Chief Executive Officer Penny James CEO-designate 200% Mike Holliday-Williams MD Personal Lines 200% Performance conditions for LTIP awards LTIP awards to be granted in 2019 will continue to be subject to performance against these performance conditions: 60% based on RoTE over a three-year performance period 2019, 2020 and 2021 40% based on relative TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts over a three-year performance period, starting on the date of grant.
The starting and closing TSR will be averaged over a three-month period.
For these purposes, we use the Groups standard definition for RoTE, subject to such other adjustments as the Committee may consider appropriate.
To find out more about how we calculate RoTE, see page 192.
The Committee reviewed the performance targets and decided to maintain the RoTE target range at the same level as in 2018 asfollows: Performance required for threshold vesting Performance required for maximum vesting Vesting for threshold Performance measure performance Awards in 2019 Awards in 2018 Awards in 2017 Awards in 2019 Awards in 2018 Awards in 2017 Average Average Average Average Average Average 20% of this annual RoTE annual RoTE annual RoTE annual RoTE annual RoTE annual RoTE element of the performance performance performance performance performance performance RoTE award of 17.5% of 17.5% of 15.0% of 20.5% of 20.5% of 18.0% 20% of this Median Upper quintile element of the Relative TSR award For the TSR element, there is a straight-line interpolation between threshold and maximum performance on a ranked basis.
For the RoTE element, 20% of the award will vest for threshold RoTE and 40% for a RoTE of 18.5% for awards to be made in2019.
Otherwise, vesting is similar to TSR: a straight-line interpolation occurs from threshold to target, then from target to maximum performance.
The LTIP awards will also vest only to the extent that the Committee is satisfied that the outcome of the TSR and RoTE performance conditions reflects the Groups underlying financial performance from the date of grant until vesting.
When considering these matters, the Committee will also consider whether there have been any material risk failings.
The LTIP will continue to be subject to the application of malus and clawback and an additional two-year holding period postvesting which facilitates post-employment shareholding requirements.
The Committee will be considering the application of a post-employment shareholding requirement in more detail as part of the Remuneration Policy review during 2019.
CO. UK 111 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Pension and benefits A pension contribution of 25% of base salary will be paid to the CEO in 2019 until date of leaving.
The pension contribution for the CEO-designate will be reduced from the current level of 25% of salary to 9% of salary from date of appointment in line with the wider workforce.
A pension contribution of 15% of salary will be paid to the MD Personal Lines in2019: this level of contribution remained unchanged following his promotion to the Board in 2017.
Pension contribution rates will be in line with those of the wider workforce for all new Executive appointments.
The reduction in pension contributions for the current Executive Directors, in line with those of the wider workforce, will be considered as part of the policy review during 2019.
No Directors participate in any defined benefit pension arrangements operated by the Company.
Appointment of new Chief Executive Officer On 26 February 2019, Penny James, the current CFO, was appointed CEO-designate to succeed Paul Geddes.
Penny will become CEO from the conclusion of the AGM on 9 May 2019.
Pennys annual salary will be 800,000.
This salary is in line with the FTSE 51-100 CEO benchmark and below the current CEOs salary level.
At the same time, Pennys pension contribution will be reduced from her current contribution rate of 25% of salary to 9% of salary, in line with that of the wider workforce.
