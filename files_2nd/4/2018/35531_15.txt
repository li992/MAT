The Transformation Multiplier described below is a temporary feature applying to awards made in the financial years ending in 2017, 2018 and 2019.
It is designed to drive and reward the delivery of the PIP, in order to achieve genuinely transformational performance and value for shareholders.
Operation A conditional award of shares Award may be made annually under the Companys LTIP, approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2016.
The LTIP Award is composed of two elements: The Base LTIP Award is the primary element and represents an award of shares which vests based on performance over the performance period The Transformation Multiplier provides an ability to earn an additional reward by multiplying the outcome under the Base LTIP by up to 1.5 times for the delivery of an exceptional EPS performance target set in excess of target ranges under the Base LTIP The Transformation Multiplier is a temporary feature to supplement the Base LTIP.
LTIP Awards made in May 2018 will be the last Awards to contain this feature.
Awards vest after a performance period of at least three years subject to the satisfaction of the performance measures and to continued employment with the Group.
Dividend equivalents may be payable on any shares vesting.
There will be a further holding period of two years following vesting.
Malus and clawback provisions apply see notes to this table.
Opportunity The maximum annual Award size under the Base LTIP is 150% of base salary, which can increase to up to 225% of base salary for achievement of the maximum Award under the Transformation Multiplier of 1.5 times the Base LTIP.
Performance measures Vesting is determined by reference to performance assessed over a period of at least three years, based on performance measures which the Committee considers to be aligned with the delivery of strategy and long-term shareholder value.
The performance measures are: Base LTIP: 1 Headline Earnings Per Share EPS 50% 1 Headline Return on capital employed ROCE 25% Comparative total shareholder return TSR 25% Transformation Multiplier: EPS 100% These measures and their weightings will be fixed for the life of this policy.
Targets for the 2018 Awards are set out on page 70.
The following binding commitments and safeguards are made around the performance targets for future awards during the life of this policy: The EPS and ROCE targets will be set to maintain the same level of stretch as for the 2016 Award The TSR target is fixed The EPS performance target for the Transformation Multiplier will always be set to maintain a clear distance above the top end of the Base LTIP range Prior to any target being decreased, the Committee would consult with major shareholders to provide the rationale and seek feedback Additionally, for the Award to vest, the Committee must be satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance.
The Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic LTIP outcomes to ensure the outcome is aligned with value creation for shareholders and that it is a fair reflection of the Companys performance.

Notes to the policy table Malus and clawback provisions All elements of the annual bonus and the LTIP are subject to malus and clawback provisions.
In the event of misconduct of the participant or their team or materially adverse misstatement of the Companys financial statements, the Committee has discretion to apply the following malus and clawback provisions in respect of the annual bonus including DSBP and the LTIP.
The Committee may: Require a participant to return a cash bonus at any time up to the second anniversary of payment Reduce including down to zero a DSBP award prior to vesting Reduce including down to zero an LTIP award prior to vesting and or require, at any time prior to the end of the holding period, a participant to return part or all of the value of the LTIP award received Performance measure selection and approach to target setting The annual bonus performance measures are selected each year to reflect the financial and strategic performance measures which the Committee considers to be aligned with the delivery of the strategic priorities and which directly reinforce the medium-term performance framework.
The LTIP performance measures were selected to provide a balance between external and internal measures of performance, reflect the Groups long-term strategic KPIs, as well as measure absolute and relative performance.
TSR aligns performance with shareholders interests.
EPS is a measure of the growth and profitability of the Group that also reflects management performance and is a measure used by investors in deciding whether to invest in the Company.
ROCE reflects the efficiency of profit generation and balance sheet management.
Targets applying to the bonus and LTIP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points.
Bonus targets are set by reference to the annual budget agreed by the Board.
LTIP targets reflect industry context, expectations of what will constitute appropriately challenging performance levels, and factors specific to the Company.
Targets for the Transformation Multiplier element of the LTIP reflect exceptional levels of performance from the delivery of strategic objectives which transform long-term financial performance, and must be set in excess of the upper end of equivalent performance ranges under the Base LTIP.
In accordance with the rules of the LTIP, performance conditions applicable to Awards may be adjusted if an event occurs or circumstances arise which cause the Committee to determine that the performance conditions have ceased to be appropriate.
In such circumstances, the Committee may make such adjustments to the calculations as it deems necessary in order to ensure that the performance conditions suitably measure performance in a manner which is consistent with the objectives of the targets.

Percentage change in remuneration for the CEO The table below shows the percentage change in the annual cash remuneration of the CEO comprising base salary, the value of taxable benefits and earned annual bonus, as disclosed in the single figure for total remuneration table on page 71 from the prior year compared with the average percentage change for the members of our Management Team.
This group is considered most representative as similarity of remuneration structures facilitates a more meaningful comparison than considering all employees as a whole.
To ensure a consistent like-for-like comparison, only those employed and eligible over both periods 267 managers have been included in this calculation.
A salary increase averaging 3.05% across the Group was awarded at the annual pay review effective 1 June 2017.
The reduction in the taxable benefits for Lindsley Ruth is as a result of moving from a company car to a car cash allowance.
The increase for the Management Team is driven by medical plan inflation.
Whilst the annual bonus outcomes are similar between 2017 and 2018, the large increase for the Management Team is caused by a high number of recently hired members receiving their first full-year bonus, rather than a pro rata bonus in the prior year.
