Long term incentive awards Performance conditions Set out below is a summary of the performance conditions that apply to the PSP awards that vest in 2018 and the outstanding PSP awards, including those granted in December 2016 and December 2017.
PSP awards since 1 October 2014 have been granted at 175% of base salary.
The performance conditions applying to these awards made under the PSP are set out below.
In determining the 2019 long term incentive award for the Executive Director, the Committee considered the exceptional circumstances that will prevail whilst the Company works through the recruitment, appointment and on-boarding of a new CEO.
During this period, a significant additional load and responsibility will fall to the Group Finance Director, Nigel Lingwood.
The Committee believes that it is in shareholders interests in these exceptional circumstances to provide him with additional incentivisation.
Accordingly and as allowed under the Policy, a grant of 225% of salary for the 2019 long term incentive was approved.
The performance condition for the first half of the PSP awards is that the average annual compound growth in the Companys adjusted EPS, over the three consecutive financial years following the financial year immediately prior to the grant, must exceed the specified absolute figures.
The performance conditions are as follows: % of awards vesting Adjusted EPS growth over three years PSP 14% p. a.
25 Below 5% p. a. Nil Where the Companys adjusted EPS performance is between these percentage bands, vesting of the award is on a straight-line basis.
For the purposes of this condition, EPS is adjusted EPS as defined in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and this definition remains consistent with the definition of adjusted EPS approved by the Committee in previous years.
The performance condition for the second half of the PSP awards compares the growth of the Companys TSR over a three-year period to that of the companies in the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts.
The performance conditions are as follows: % of awards vesting PSP Upper quartile 100 Median 25 Below median Nil Where the Companys TSR performance is between these percentage bands, vesting of the award is on a straight-line basis.
The FTSE 250 Index was chosen because this is a recognised broad equity market index of which the Company is a member.

The remuneration of the Executive Director is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to exercise the options to acquire the shares and the total value of the shares on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil cost options on the vesting date he may exercise the options at any time up to the day preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the underlying share price between the initial vesting date and the date of exercise of the option.
This increase or decrease in value reflects an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
The nil cost options outstanding at 30 September 2018 and the movements during the year are as follows: Options Options Vested unexercised Year of as at 1 Oct Exercised during the as at 30 Sep Exercise Earliest normal 5 vesting 2017 in year year 2018 price exercise date Expiry date Bruce Thompson 2017 94,565 94,565 1 Nov 2017 Dec 2024 2018 193,212 193,212 1 Nov 2018 Dec 2025 Nigel Lingwood 2017 61,056 61,056 1 Nov 2017 Dec 2024 2018 73,063 73,063 1 Nov 2018 Dec 2025 1 Bruce Thompson exercised 94,565 options on 24 November 2017, at a market price of 1,196p per share and the total proceeds before tax were 1,130,997.
