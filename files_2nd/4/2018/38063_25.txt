Corporate Governance 80 Directors Remuneration Report continued Summary of the Directors Remuneration Policy The Directors Remuneration Policy Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 16 May 2018 and came into effect from that date.
It is intended to apply for three years until the AGM in 2021.
The full Policy can be found on pages 74 84 of the Companys 2017 Annual Report and on its website at www.
A summary of the main features of the Policy, as it applies to Executive Directors remuneration, is provided in the table below.
Details of the remuneration arrangements for the Non-Executive Directors are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 91 92.
Considerations when setting and determining the Directors Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for determining the remuneration of the Executive Directors and other senior executives, and the fees of the Company Chairman.
Its primary objective when setting Policy is to align remuneration to the long-term success of the business and shareholders, while at the same time enabling the Company to effectively recruit, motivate and retain Executives of the calibre required to lead the business and successfully implement the strategy, but without paying more than is necessary to do so.
To achieve this, the Committee takes into account the responsibilities, experience, performance and contribution of the individual, as well as levels of remuneration for individuals in comparable roles elsewhere.
The Policy places significant emphasis on the need to achieve stretching and rigorously applied performance targets, with a significant proportion of remuneration weighted towards performancerelated variable pay.
The Committee values investors views in the process of formulating remuneration policy decisions and also monitors best practice and developments in remuneration trends.
It is therefore committed to maintaining strong relationships and an open dialogue with shareholders and shareholder advisory bodies and encourages them to share their thoughts with us.
While the Company does not formally consult with employees on executive remuneration, it does receive regular updates from the Group HR Director and, when setting remuneration for the Executive Directors, the Committee takes note of the overall approach to pay and employment conditions existing elsewhere with the wider workforce in the Group.

the Directors Remuneration Policy Policy was implemented in the financial year to 31 December 2018 and how it will be implemented in the financial year commenced 1 January 2019.
The relevant sections of this report have been audited, as required by the Regulations.
Remuneration information relevant from 2017 as previously reported a Chris Davies: appointment as Group Finance Director on 1 June 2017 Chris Davies joined the Company on 2 May, was appointed an Executive Director on 10 May and became Group Finance Director on 1 June 2017.
On appointment, he was granted two Recruitment Incentive Awards RIA under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP in recognition of certain incentives he forfeited on leaving his previous employer.
The first RIA, which had a one-year term but subject to the same performance conditions as applied to the three-year LTIP awards granted to Executives in 2015, vested on the first anniversary of grant i. e. on 10 May 2018.
The second RIA, which has a two-year term but is subject to the same performance conditions as apply to the three-year LTIP awards granted to Executives in 2016, is scheduled to vest on the second anniversary of grant i. e. on 10 May 2019. b Matt Ashley: appointment as President and CEO, North America on 1 September 2017 As part of a career development opportunity for him and a strengthening of the executive team for the Company, Matt Ashley relinquished his role as Group Finance Director, but retained his executive directorship, on 31 May 2017 to take up a two-year term assignment as President and CEO, North America, based in Chicago from 1 September 2017.
In order to support him in this role, the Company has provided him and his family with a relocation assistance package for the duration of the assignment in line with normal practice for an international relocation at executive level.
The following residual elements of the package, which include tax equalisation and exchange rate protection, continue to be available: a 10% of salary compensation allowance to part recognise the loss of household income arising from his spouses loss of UK employment, occasional return flights to the UK, school fees, rented unfurnished accommodation, company car, medical and travel insurance and tax return preparation assistance: and return costs associated with shipping and flights to the UK.
As Matt Ashley is liable to tax on these deemed relocation benefits, the amount paid to him in the year substantially in the USA, as set out in this report under Relocation benefits, is the total grossed-up cost of tax amount except in relation to the compensation allowance estimated to be paid by the Company on his behalf.
In 2018, this amounted to 434,311 2017: 337,885, part year only, as adjusted for the actual tax paid by the Company.
Matt Ashleys relocation package will be subject to review and reduction in line with best practice by the Remuneration Committee in the event his original term assignment is extended beyond 31 August 2019.

Single total figure of remuneration for Executive Directors The table below sets out the single total figure of remuneration and breakdown for each Executive Director in relation to the financial year ended 31 December 2018 with comparative figures provided for 2017.
The subsequent tables and information give more detail on how the performance outcomes have been measured with respect to the annual bonus and LTIPs in the context of value created for shareholders.

As explained on page 85, part of the bonus will immediately be paid in cash and part will be deferred for one year in the form of forfeitable shares in the Company, subject only to continued employment 3 The LTIP values shown represent the estimated value of shares that are scheduled to vest in April and or May 2019 arising from a five-year legacy award made to Dean Finch in 2014, a three-year award made to Messrs Finch and Ashley in 2016 and, as referred to in 1 a above, a two-year RIA made to Chris Davies in 2017.
All such awards were based on a 31 December 2018 performance period end and their values have been calculated using a share price of 392.0p, being the three-month average to 31 December 2018.
The values also include, in relation to the 2016 awards to Messrs Finch and Ashley and the 2017 award to Chris Davies, the dividend equivalent of 38.125p and 26.61p per share respectively earned during the vesting period on the shares due to vest.
These translate to a total dividend equivalent entitlement, to be paid in cash on vesting as determined on grant, to Dean Finch of 125,777, to Matt Ashley of 52,051 and to Chris Davies of 16,329.
The actual value of shares on vesting will be confirmed in next years report 4 As explained in 1 b above, Matt Ashley continues to receive an international relocation assistance package to support him and his family in his role as President and CEO, North America, based in Chicago, within the terms of his two-year assignment which commenced on 1 September 2017.
As he is liable to tax on these deemed relocation benefits, the amount shown as paid to him in the year is the total grossed-up cost of tax amount except in relation to the compensation allowance estimated to be paid by the Company on his behalf.
Additionally, in respect of the relocation benefits paid to him in the USA during the year, the total amount shown includes the converted value of such benefits based on an exchange rate of $1.3:1, being the average rate for 2018.
The actual grossed-up cost of tax amount paid by the Company in 2018 will be confirmed in next years report 5 Since last years LTIP values of vested shares which included dividend equivalent payments to be made on vesting were estimated, the figures shown for 2017 in this years report have been adjusted to reflect the actual vesting date values on 5 March 2018 for Messrs Finch and Ashley for the three-year LTIP share price of 378.4p, 10 May 2018 for Chris Davies one-year RIA share price of 397.6p and 23 May 2018 for Dean Finchs five-year LTIP share price of 421.0p.
The difference in value is an increase for each Director as follows: 158,005 for Dean Finch, 14,289 for Chris Davies and 20,036 for Matt Ashley 6 The 2017 remuneration for Chris Davies is shown in respect of his period of service during that year i. e. from 10 May 7 Since last years total grossed-up cost of tax amount paid by the Company in relation to Matt Ashleys relocation assistance package was estimated, the 2017 amount and total comparative figure shown have been adjusted by 42,031 to reflect the actual amount paid by the Company for the year a Base salary As explained in last years report, the Committee determined that for 2018 the base salaries for each of the Executive Directors would be increased by 2.5%, which was broadly in line with the increase for the UK general workforce.
This reflected the excellent financial and operating performance delivered by Dean Finch and supported by his Executives.
Accordingly, the base salaries set by the Committee for 2018 were 630,375 for Dean Finch and 358,750 for both Chris Davies and Matt Ashley.
b Pensions In lieu of a pension provision, the Executive Directors receive a pension allowance gross which does not qualify as salary or for any other benefit or entitlement.
Until 31 December 2018, the Group Chief Executive received an annual allowance of 35% of salary and each of the other two Executive Directors an allowance of 25% of salary.
Under the new Policy approved at the 2018 AGM, and as volunteered by him, Dean Finchs pension allowance will be reduced from 35% to 30% of salary in three equal annual instalments commencing in 2019.
Benefits under his previous unfunded pension arrangement ceased to accrue with effect from 5 June 2016.

National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2018 Corporate Governance 86 Directors Remuneration Report continued Annual Report on Remuneration continued Summary of non-financial bonus targets and corresponding performance outturns for 2018 As set out in the table below, Dean Finch and Chris Davies have been judged against a common set of Group finance and safety objectives, and individual business development objectives.
Matt Ashley has been judged against a mixed set of Group and North America based finance and safety objectives, and individual business development objectives.
In total, these represent a 25% target weighting of the annual bonus opportunity for each Director.
Further information on the Groups safety performance can be found in the Safety & Environment Committee Report on pages 70 73.
Based on the below assessment against the objectives set some of which were shared, the Committee determined that in respect of the non-financial elements of their respective bonuses, the performance of Dean Finch DF warranted a 30% payout of a 50% of salary maximum opportunity, and Chris Davies CD and Matt Ashley MA warranted a 21% and 30% payout respectively of their 37.5% of salary maximum opportunity.
Objectives Performance Safety: Not achieved: DF CD Improvement in normalised FWI Achieved in full: MA per million miles operated DF CD The Groups FWI per million miles operated was flat year-on-year at 0.013 and is therefore still the lowest on record, representing a 74% improvement since Driving Out Harm was launched in 2011.
Despite this equal best achievement, which also needs to be seen in the context of a 3% increase in million miles operated in the year, the absence of a year-on-year improvement means that this 10% weighted bonus objective was not met.
Nonetheless, the Groups relentless focus and efforts in driving FWI improvement across the business continues unabated, as reflected in the CEO-led Target Zero safety campaign for no responsible fatalities launched during the year and achieved in North America for the first time in five years see below.
MA North America achieved an excellent safety performance year, including no responsible fatalities for the first time in five years.
As a result, their FWI per million miles operated improved year-on-year by an impressive 37.5% 2017: 0.012 vs. 2018: 0.007.
No responsible lost time injuries, a 30% reduction in major injuries and a 6% reduction in minor injuries were also achieved in North America.
Safety: Achieved in full: DF CD MA Improvement in safety systems and processes Further improve safety culture The CEO-led Target Zero campaign has provided fresh impetus and safety messaging to build on the Driving through improved safety Out Harm platform.
The simplicity of message has really been effective in underscoring individual responsibility.
awareness campaigns The campaign has been rolled out across all divisions and features prominently in our internal communications and in all new employee induction training.
Complete implementation of a Each of our businesses now has in place a single system for collating driver-related complaints and comments.

The UK centralised its customer complaints management into the Customer complaints and comments Contact Centre mid-2018 with a single team now responsible for analysis and reporting.
The UK will move to iCaseworks, as will ALSA, during the first half of 2019.
Continued roll-out of Lytx Over 10,000 more vehicles have been fitted with Lytx DriveCam during the year.
In total, over 2,400 vehicles have now DriveCam the incident alert been fitted in the UK, 15,000 in North America and some 1,000 in Spain.
In the UK where coaching effectiveness has and driver monitoring system improved by 16% and poor driver behaviour has reduced by 23%, the fit-out will be completed in 2019.

In North America, work on the Master Driver programme is being linked to enhanced driver evaluation and will be further developed in 2019.
Progress implementation Significant progress has been made in each division with the implementation of standard operating procedures of standard operating in line with our World Class Maintenance concept.
Seven Global Maintenance Standards have now been procedures in maintenance introduced in all territories.
Improve management Continuous speed monitoring technology is in place in all divisions and, whilst the technology is still being refined, of speeding and distracted significant reductions in speeding events have been achieved.
Monitoring of speeding and managing events is driving behaviours now a matter of day-to-day routine for our local General Managers.
GPS has been fitted to 97% 2,388 of the vehicles in Spain where automated speed monitoring of 92% of ALSA drivers is now possible.
In North America, speed monitored occurrences are 25.4% lower than in December 2017.
In UK bus and North America school bus we are currently trialling systems which control the speed of the vehicle to see whether this has the potential to prevent speeding.
In North America and the UK, we launched an awareness campaign to reduce violations of our mobile device policy and enforced a zero-tolerance approach to all such violations.
Matt Ashley has shown very strong safety leadership in the business in 2018, which has supported the Groups performance improvements as explained above.
As well as personally championing the Target Zero campaign in North America, he has promoted targeted safety incentives, initiatives and investments in additional resources and enhanced safety systems and processes across the business in the region.
This has included the roll-out and introduction of digital technology, such as Lytx DriveCam, speed reporting and management, driver oversight and risk profiling tools, all of which will help improve safety and drive down costs.
The financial benefits, as well as the human ones, are already beginning to come through in North America.

Comparison of overall performance 2018 was another standout year of achievement for the Group with revenue, profits and free cash flow up significantly on 2017, beating the budgeted normalised PBT by 7%.
This excellent result, underpinned by a strong and sustainable free cash flow, has merited the Boards recommended 10% increase in the full year dividend for the third year in a row.
In 2018, across the Group, we carried 15 million more commercial passengers than 2017.
We also saw significant development in our digital capabilities throughout the Group with our retailing, pricing and operational content all improving.
Group revenue increased by 6.9% in constant currency to 2.45bn with growth contributions coming from North America 8.0%, ALSA 11.2% and UK coach 5.4%.
Our organic performance was boosted by strong delivery from recently acquired businesses.
The Group completed 11 acquisitions in the year: seven in North America, three in ALSA and one in the UK.
ALSA enjoyed its best ever financial performance with EBIT growth of 11% on a reported basis and UK coach also delivered strong organic growth of 7%.
Group operating profit grew 7.7% in constant currency with growth in all divisions and the operating margin increasing from 10.4% to 10.5%.
Group EBITDA exceeded 400m for the first time, meaning that the loss of the entire UK rail business at its peak has now been more than offset.
Altogether, 2018 was another year of record-breaking results and sector-leading performance.

The FTSE 250 Index has been selected as the Company is a constituent of that Index and it is therefore considered to be the most appropriate benchmark for comparative purposes.

The context of pay in National Express Group The following table sets out the change in certain elements of remuneration paid to the Group Chief Executive from 2017 to 2018 compared with the average percentage change of the UK employee population.
The Group Chief Executives remuneration, disclosed in the table below, has been calculated to take into account base salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus including any amount deferred on the basis used for determining the single figure.
The UK employee remuneration is based on the base salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus of those UK employees who received taxable benefits and bonuses.
The Group uses the UK workforce as an appropriate comparator group for the average employee as this avoids complicated exchange rate adjustments that would otherwise have to be used if we included employees from the Groups overseas operations in the calculation.

Statement of implementation of current Directors Remuneration Policy in 2019 a Executive Directors base salaries The Committee determined that the base salary for the Group Chief Executive and each of the Executive Directors would be increased by 2.8% with effect from 1 January 2019, broadly in line with the UK workforce increase of 2 3% over the past 12 months and projected for 2019.
In doing so, the Committee recognised the strong financial and operational performance delivered by Dean Finch, supported by his executive team, in 2018 and their strong individual performance.
Accordingly, the annual base salaries of the Executive Directors in 2019 are: Base salary Executive Director gross Dean Finch, Group Chief Executive 648,000 Chris Davies, Group Finance Director 368,800 Matt Ashley, President and CEO, North America 368,800 b Pensions In accordance with the Policy, and as volunteered by Dean Finch, his pension allowance will be reduced from 35% to 30% of salary in three equal annual tranches commencing in 2019.
Therefore, he will receive a 33.3% of salary pension allowance in 2019.
Each of the other Executive Directors will receive a 25% of salary allowance.
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2018 Corporate Governance 96 Directors Remuneration Report continued Annual Report on Remuneration continued c Annual bonus The annual bonus for the 2019 financial year will be structured and operate for all Executive Directors on the same basis as the arrangements in place during 2018 as set out on page 84, save that: in respect of normalised FWI, which represents a 10% non-financial bonus opportunity, the present year-on-year improvement requirement per million miles operated, will move to a no-worse than previous year requirement.
Given the continuing growth in the business and the increased miles operated, and the FWI improvements already made, it is felt that maintaining the current record low level of FWI next year will be a sufficiently demanding challenge: and for Matt Ashley, in respect of his 50% profit-related bonus opportunity, the present metric split of 25% Group normalised PBT and 75% North America normalised EBIT will move to be a 100% North America normalised EBIT metric in order to fully align this bonus element with his day-to-day executive responsibilities.
When setting the bonus targets for 2019, the Committee has taken into account: the Boards challenging three-year strategy to 2021 and the first-year expectations within that strategy: the Groups approved budget and operating plan for 2019: stock market consensus for 2019: the non-recurring items included in the 2018 results which will need replacing in 2019: increased pricing pressures and competition in the UK, Spain and North America: and the focus of responsibilities of the Executive Directors.
Targets will be set on a basis consistent with accounting measures i. e. without reference to exceptional items.
The Committee will set calibrated targets for the bonus measures and intends to disclose actual performance against these in next years Annual Remuneration Report.
As a matter of commercial sensitivity, the Committee has decided not to disclose bonus performance targets in advance although, given its strategic importance to the Group, 18% 2018: 18% of the 25% non-financial bonus opportunity will continue to be based on safety objectives: 10% on normalised FWI as above and 8% on improving safety systems and processes as current.
d Long-Term Incentive Plan awards LTIP awards in 2019 are proposed to be granted in line with the normal annual award levels contained in the Policy.
Accordingly, awards with attaching performance conditions will be made to the value of 200% of salary to the Group Chief Executive and 150% of salary to the other Executive Directors.
The performance condition metrics, weightings and vesting levels for the 2019 awards will be as set out in the table below.
The EPS and ROCE targets have been set with reference to their 2018 outturns, as restated for IFRS 16, and remain stretching taking into consideration the principal operating and external risks facing the business over the next three years as highlighted on page 40.

Dilution The Company has permitted new share dilution authorities reserved to it under the rules of its 2015 LTIP as previously approved by shareholders, which are in line with the Investment Associations guidelines.
However, given that the Companys funding strategy has been and continues to be to satisfy all outstanding share incentive awards granted under that plan and its other incentive plans through the delivery of market purchased shares held in the Companys Employee Benefit Trust, as opposed to the issue and allotment of new shares, the Company has not to date used up any of its permitted dilution authority under the 2015 LTIP.
LTIP approved CSOP awards are aligned with the requirements of Schedule 4 to the Income Tax Earnings and Pensions Act 2003 and can be exercised by way of set-off against any shares vesting under the corresponding LTIP award By Order of the Board Jane Kingston Remuneration Committee Chair 28 February 2019 National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2018
