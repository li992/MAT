Investment benefited from a targeted approach around our key sectors and themes, with our focus on targets that were not being sold in more broadly-based processes resulting in a good hit rate.
There was also a significant increase in strategic acquisitions and bolt-ons for existing portfolio companies in both PE and Infrastructure.

Designing and obtaining regulatory approval for a new corporate structure in Europe to manage potential regulatory risks posed by Brexit.
Closure of the Madrid office and continued consolidation of the Infrastructure and Private Equity teams, including through key hires, internal development and promotions.
Consistent shareholder support for the Groups performance and strategy and a further broadening of the shareholder base.
Development, retention and succession plans for the Groups key talent and leadership team progressing according to plan.
1 The threshold and maximum return targets are set in line with 3iNs public return objectives.
T Target E Expectation Consistent with last year, the Board did not set a threshold to maximum range for all metrics and set expectations rather than targets for some metrics.
This is because the timing of investments and realisations is highly sensitive to market conditions, and a more prescriptive approach would run the risk of creating perverse incentives for executives.
For example, setting a target level of realisations may result in the earlier sale of assets than would otherwise be appropriate, andsetting a target level of investments may result in investing at inflated prices.
In relation to Operating performance, the continued tight focus on managing operating costs is emphasised by specifying a narrow range of acceptable outcomes rather than a single numerical target.
Operating costs as a percentage of assets under management compares favourably with other investment groups.
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director annual bonus outcomes In light of the achievements detailed above, and the exceptional performance of the Group in the year, the Committee awarded Mr Borrows a bonus in respect of FY2018 of 2,290,411 being 92.5% of his maximum bonus opportunity, and awarded Mrs Wilson a bonus in respect ofFY2018 of 1,041,095 being 92.5% of her maximum bonus opportunity.
In each case, 20% of the award will be paid in cash immediately, 20% will be delivered as shares with a retention period of six months and the remaining 60% will be deferred into the Companys shares vesting in equal instalments over four years.
Annual bonus awards are subject to the malus clawback policy.
