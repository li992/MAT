Spotlight Area: Levels of Shareholding Both Executive Directors have a shareholding requirement of 200% of salary.
They are required to hold onto deferred shares once vested under the ESIP for additional time if this holding requirement is not met at the point of vesting.
The introduction of the ESIP drove far higher levels of deferral of awards into shareholding by the participants.
This, coupled with strong performance since introduction, has increased the level of shareholding by the CFO significantly to 113% of salary.
The core calculation excludes shares which have not vested but have no further Company performance conditions i. e. deferred awards under the ESIP.
These deferred shares further increase the level of shareholding of the CFO to 194% of salary.
We expect this to increase and be more than the 200% level when the share awards for the 2018 ESIP are made in March 2019.
The CEO has held significantly more shares in the business for many years.
His ordinary shareholding is currently over 550% of his base salary.

Signed on behalf of the Board of Directors Angela Seymour-Jackson Chair of the Remuneration Committee 5 March 2019 Corporate Governance | 74 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Directors Remuneration Report SECTION D: DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION POLICY PageGroup is a global business that operates in a cyclical industry in which the retention and ongoing motivation of Executives and management continuity is critical to the success of the Company.
As a result, the Directors Remuneration Policy has been designed to encourage long-term decision making, to avoid undue volatility in remuneration outcomes, and to act as an effective retention tool during market downturns.
The Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 8 June 2017 and became effective from that date.
The full policy, including approach to recruitment, payments for loss of office and illustrations of the policy can be found in our 2017 Annual Report which is available on our corporate website: www.
There are no proposed changes to the current policy for 2019 and therefore we do not propose to table a resolution seeking approval of the Policy at the next Annual General Meeting.
We will present the annual resolution seeking shareholder approval in respect of how the Policy has been implemented.
We also will continue to review the effectiveness of the Policy and engage with shareholders in advance of presenting an updated Policy for shareholder approval in 2020.
Key aims of the Policy when it was introduced included incorporating deferral into the majority of the award, introducing post-vesting holding periods for Executives who have not met the 200% shareholding requirement and ensuring annual and long-term measurement.
