114 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Annual Report on Remuneration This section of the Report provides details of how Informas existing Remuneration Policy was implemented during the financial year ended 31 December 2018.
Any information contained in this section of the Report that is subject to audit is highlighted.
The Executive Directors base salaries increased halfway through the year as detailed in the notes below.
STIP awards in excess of 100% of base salary are deferred in shares for a further three years in line with the Companys Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
T he LTIP award granted in 2016, which becomes exercisable on 17 March 2019, is expected to vest at 93.90%.
The estimated value of the LTIP award has been calculated using the average share price over a three-month period from 1 October 2018 to 31 December 2018, being 698.9p.
The value of the 2015 LTIP awards included in the single total figure of remuneration for 2017 have been updated to reflect the actual share price on vesting being 668.6p on 12 February 2018 rather than the average for the three months to 31 December 2017 which was used in the 2017 Annual Report.
Notes to the single total figure of remuneration table audited Fixed pay Salary Executive Directors salaries were reviewed in May 2018.
In the spirit of previous years and in line with our overall remuneration philosophy to put the emphasis on performance-related pay ahead of fixed pay, the Committee kept base salary increases to 1.0% for both Stephen A. Carter and Gareth Wright, effective from 1 July 2018.
Salary from Salary to 1 July 2018 30June 2018 Stephen A. Carter 833,524 825,271 Gareth Wright 475,265 470,559 Taxable benefits Benefits include private health and dental insurance, expenses incurred for accompanied attendance at certain corporate events, company car allowance or chauffer costs in lieu of company car allowance, travel insurance, health screening and professional advice.
Pension The Group makes a cash payment of 25% of basic salary to the Executive Directors in lieu of pension contributions.
Neither Executive Director is a member of the defined benefit schemes provided by the Group or any of its subsidiaries, and accordingly they have not accrued entitlements under these schemes.
Variable pay Short-Term Incentive Plan STIP For 2018, the STIP was linked to the achievement of budgeted adjusted diluted EPS weighted 80% of total and URG weighted 20%.
Under the EPS element, if threshold performance is achieved, 30% of bonus will vest.
This increases on a straight line basis to on-target performance where 90% of bonus will vest.
Under the URG element, if threshold performance is achieved, 0.1% of bonus will vest.
This also increases on a straight line basis to on-target performance where 10% of bonus will vest.
The maximum STIP opportunity was 150% of salary for both Executive Directors.
COM INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 115 Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued The EPS measure is based on budgeted exchange rates, in line with market practice, and therefore the targets and outturn shown below have been adjusted for the impact of exchange rates to enable constant currency comparison.

This led to an EPS outcome for 2018 above the maximum, resulting in a payout of 80.0%, being the maximum.
URG for the year was 3.70%, resulting in a payout between target and maximum of 13.33%.
The Committee approved the overall STIP outcome for 2018 being 93.33% of maximum, equal to 140% of salary for each Executive Director, having determined that the general financial underpin had been satisfied.
In line with the Directors Remuneration Policy, the equivalent of 100% of base salary will be paid in cash, with the remainder 40% of base salary being deferred into shares for a further three years under the rules of the DSBP, and subject to malus and clawback provisions.
Long-Term Incentive Plan On 17 March 2016, Stephen A. Carter and Gareth Wright received LTIP awards as set out in the table below and which will become exercisable on 17 March 2019: Number of Value as a shares Price at date percentage of Value at date 1 Date of award awarded of award base salary of award Stephen A.

Carter and 109,218 options for Gareth Wright.
Vesting of the awards is based on two equally weighted performance conditions over the three years to 31 December 2018.
The first measured relative total shareholder return TSR vs. the FTSE 51150 peer group excluding financial services and commodities companies while the second measured the compound annual growth rate CAGR in adjusted EPS.

This increases on a straight line basis to full vesting for ranking at or above the 80th percentile.
A ranking below median will result in the lapsing of the TSR element.
Willis Towers Watson has confirmed that Informas TSR over the period was ranked at the 75th percentile vs. the peer group, resulting in a vesting outcome of 43.90% for that element.
Under the EPS element, 2% p. a. growth will result in 20% of the award subject to this measure vesting, 4% p. a. growth will result in 50% vesting, and 6% p. a. growth or higher will result in full vesting: vesting occurs on a straight line basis between these points.
Growth below 2% p. a. will result in the lapsing of the EPS element.
Informas compound annualised growth rate over the period was 7.59%, resulting in a vesting outcome of 50% for that element.
The total amount expected to become exercisable is therefore 93.90% of the total award.

Executive Directors shareholdings and share interests audited Shareholding requirements The Committee believes that equity ownership by the Executive Directors and wider management team and colleague base is an important and effective way of connecting them to the progress and performance of the Group, closely aligning them with Shareholders.
For this reason, under the terms of the 2018 Remuneration Policy, Executive Directors are required to hold a percentage of their salary in shares or in exercisable options over shares equivalent to their largest outstanding LTIP award, which is currently 300% of salary for Stephen A. Carter and 225% of salary for Gareth Wright.
Executive Directors are expected to meet the guideline within five years of appointment, or 25 May 2018 being the date of the 2018 AGM, whichever is the later, and maintain this holding throughout their term of office.
Both Stephen A. Carter and Gareth Wright comfortably exceed the Groups current share ownership guidelines.

For comparison, the typical rate of salary increase for UK colleagues is 03%.
The fees payable to the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors will similarly increase by 1% effective from 1 April 2019.
Pension The Group will continue to make a cash payment of 25% of basic salary to the Executive Directors in lieu of pension contributions.
STIP The maximum bonus opportunity is 175% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 150% of base salary for the Group Finance Director.
The performance measures and weightings for 2019 will be as follows: As a percentage of maximum bonus opportunity Group Group Chief Finance Measure Executive Director Adjusted diluted EPS 69% 80% Underlying revenue growth 17% 20% Engagement and culture 14% Performance below threshold will not result in a payout for any element of the STIP.
For the EPS-related measure, threshold and on-target performance will result in payouts of 25% and 75% of the maximum respectively.
For the URG-related measure, threshold and on-target performance will result in payouts of 20% and 33.3% of that element respectively.
In respect of the Group Chief Executives engagement and culture measure, performance will be judged in the round against a range of non-financial KPIs.
The targets themselves, as they relate to the 2019 financial year, are commercially sensitive.
However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next years Directors Remuneration Report unless they remain commercially sensitive at that time.
LTIP We intend to make LTIP awards of 300% of base salary to the Group Chief Executive and 225% of base salary to the Group Finance Director in respect of the 2019 financial year.
The performance measures and weightings for each element will mirror those of the 2018 awards set out on page 117 with the exception of the EPS element.
Under the EPS element, 3.5% p. a. growth will result in 25% of the award subject to this measure vesting and 8.5% p. a. growth or higher will result in full vesting.
Vesting will occur on a straight line basis between these points.
Growth below 3.5% p. a. will result in the EPS element lapsing.
