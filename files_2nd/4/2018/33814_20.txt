All the Executive Directors received payments in lieu of pension contributions equivalent to 13.5% of salary respectively for 2017 18.
Vesting of long-term incentive awards audited Value Creation Plan As reported previously, to take account of three significant capital raising events, certain adjustments were made to the VCP pay-outalgorithm to ensure the potential VCP benefit created at each Measurement Date was: Attributable to managements performance achievement of the VCP performance conditions i. e. an 8% p. a. return to shareholders must be achieved before any value is created for participants : and Aligned with the value created for shareholders during the relevant measurement period.
More particularly, the Committee amended the Threshold Price applicable to the first Measurement Date i. e. 20 August 2015 whereby, for each capital raising event to be known as Tranches, a Threshold Price was set which must be exceeded before any value could be earned by participants.
The paragraphs below summarise the alterations.
The Threshold Price applicable to each Tranche of shares at the first Measurement Date was set as follows: Original New Shares Threshold Threshold Tranche m Price pence Price pence Share capital at the start of the VCP 1 529.5 39.37 39.37 Capital issued for MP Realty Holdings Ltd acquisition 2 44.3 39.37 44.95 Capital issued following placing offer to shareholders 3 414.3 39.37 45.06 Capital issued for Metro MRI Ltd acquisition 4 18.8 39.37 51.29 Each Tranche under the VCP was tested on the first Measurement Date and on 20 August 2015 was subject to the original terms andconditions of the VCP, except that, as shown above, each Tranche had its own Threshold Price.
At subsequent Measurement Dates i. e. one and two years after the first Measurement Date, it was determined that the methodology for determining the Threshold Price for each Tranche will be the same whereby the Threshold Price for each Tranche will be the higher of: The highest return achieved at any previous Measurement Date treated as separate Tranches : and 8% p. a. TSR from the Base Price for Tranche 1 or the capital raising price price on the day of issue for Tranches 2, 3 and 4 and others if further capital raising events occur.
Each Tranche has its own minimum return threshold which must be achieved before any awards earned and deferred at previous Measurement Dates vest at the second or third Measurement Dates.
This means that awards rolled over i. e. accrued but not vested from previous Measurement Dates must sustain an 8% p. a. TSR from the Base Price for Tranche 1 or the capital raising price price on the day of issue for Tranches 2, 3 and 4.
The maximum aggregate number of shares that can be issued to satisfy awards under the VCP to all participants remained limited to 25 million.
Therefore, no adjustments were made to the cap on the number of shares that could be earned under the VCP as a result of the changes to the share capital.
As previously reported, the first Measurement Date occurred on 20 August 2015.
The table below sets out the actual value creation under the VCP as calculated at the first Measurement Date, using as prescribed in the plan rules the average share price over three months following the announcement of the Companys financial results for the 2014 15 financial year plus dividends paid on shares inissue: Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Tranche 3 Tranche 4 pence per share pence per share pence per share pence per share Average share price at first Measurement Date A 56.27 56.27 56.27 56.27 Dividends paid per share in issue B 5.0625 2.40 1.95 1.50 Measurement Price C A B 61.3325 58.67 58.22 57.77 Threshold Price T 39.37 44.95 45.06 51.29 Value created C-T 21.9625 13.72 13.16 6.48 64 Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Remuneration Report continued As per the VCP performance condition, the total participant benefit available was 10% of the above value created for each Tranche multiplied by the number of shares in each Tranche, which amounts in total to 17.8 million.
As a consequence of the Companys strong performance up to the first Measurement Date, the VCP units converted virtually in full into nil-cost options over 24,999,950 shares out of the total 25 million pool.
This resulted in Jonathan Murphys units converting into 5,153,423 options and Andrew Darkes into 5,889,627 options.
Under the rules, 50% of any shares that accrued at the first Measurement Date in the form of nil-cost options became exercisable at the first Measurement Date, 50% of the remainder become exercisable at the second and 100% at the third, provided the minimum return thresholds for each Tranche are achieved at each Measurement Date.
On 25 September 2015 Jonathan Murphy exercised the first 50% of his nil-cost options resulting in him receiving after the payment of income tax and NICs 1,365,657 shares.
The share price on 25 September 2015 was 54.25 pence.
On 30 August 2016 Messrs Murphy and Darke exercised the next 25% of their nil-cost options resulting in them receiving after the payment of income tax and NICs 682,829 and 780,376 shares respectively.
The share price on 30 August 2016 was 58.5 pence.
On 31 August 2017 Messrs Murphy and Darke exercised the final 25% of their nil-cost options resulting in them receiving after the payment of income tax and NICs 682,828 and 780,375 shares respectively.
The share price on 31 August 2017 was 65.25 pence.

In accordance with guidelines set out by the Investment Association the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling 10-year period to employees under all its share plans, with an inner 5% limit applying to discretionary plans.
There has been no movement in Directors shareholdings since the year end.
Performance graph and table The Committee believes that the Executive Directors Remuneration Policy and the supporting reward structure provide clear alignment with the Companys performance.
The Committee believes it is appropriate to monitor the Companys performance against the FTSE All Share Real Estate Investment Trusts index for these purposes.
The graph below sets out the TSR performance of the Company compared to the FTSE All Share Real Estate Investment Trusts index and, for comparison, the FTSE All Share index over a nine-year period as required by the Regulations: 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 Mar Mar Mar Mar Mar Mar Mar Mar Mar Mar 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Assura FTSE Real Estate Investment Trusts FTSE All Share Rebased TSR Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information www.

Both Graham Roberts and Jonathan Murphys remuneration details have been included as they both served as CEO during the year.
Includes base salary, taxable benefits, bonus payments for the relevant financial year, long-term incentive awards that vested for performance related to the financial year and cash in lieu of pension.
Nigel Rawlings ceased to be a Director with effect from 30 April 2012.
The bonus of 100,000 was a one-off award reflecting his contribution to selling the Pharmacy business.
Richard Burrell ceased to be a Director on 15 March 2010.
During the financial year 2009 10 Richard Burrell was CEO from 1 April 2009 until 15 March 2010 when Nigel Rawlings assumed the position.
The amounts above are therefore reflective of the relative lengths of service.
Percentage change in the CEOs remuneration The table below compares the percentage increase in the CEOs pay including salary and fees, taxable benefits and annual bonus with the wider employee population.
The Company considers the 50 full-time employee population, excluding the Executive Directors, to be an appropriate comparator group: Taxable benefits Bonus Salary % increase % increase % increase decrease decrease 1 2 CEO 0.7 n a Total employee pay 6.1 2.8 7.0 Average employee pay 6.1 7.6 12.6 Notes 1.
No change during year ended 31 March 2018 from date of appointment.
No comparison has been made as Jonathan Murphys prior year bonus did not relate to a full year as CEO.
Relative importance of spend on pay The table below sets out the overall spend on pay for all employees compared with the returns distributed to shareholders: 2017 18 2016 17 Significant distributions m m % change Overall spend on pay for employees, including Executive Directors 4.4 3.3 33.3 Distributions to shareholders by way of dividends 46.4 37.0 25.4 68 Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Remuneration Report continued Payments to past Directors or for loss of office The remuneration arrangements in respect of Andrew Darke, who stepped down from the Board on 31 March 2018, are as follows: Salary, benefits and pension were paid up to 31 March 2018.
Annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2018 was paid following the year end in cash i. e. no deferral was operated given the 300% share ownership guideline being met.
The 2016 and 2017 PSP awards will continue to vest at the normal vesting date subject to the relevant performance targets and time pro-rating.
No payment was made or will be made in respect of loss of office.
However, Mr Darke will be retained by the Company as a consultant after stepping down from the Board to retain access to his skills, knowledge and contacts.
The consultancy agreement will run until 31 March 2019 for a fee of 2,000 per calendar month and is terminable by either party on one months notice.
Statement of shareholder voting The table below shows the advisory vote on the 2016 17 Directors Remuneration Report at the AGM held on 15 June 2017 and the binding vote on the Remuneration Policy at the AGM held on 14 June 2016: AGM resolution Votes for % Votes against % Votes withheld Annual Report on Remuneration 2017 AGM 1,444,072,651 98.38 23,722,945 1.62 8,648 Remuneration Policy 2016 AGM 1,322,798,958 99.25 10,029,694 0.75 8,359 Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2018 19 Executive Directors Salary In setting salary levels for 2018 19 for the Executive Directors, the Committee considered a number of factors, including individual performance and experience, pay and conditions for employees across the Group, the general performance of the Company, pay levels in other comparable companies and the economic environment.
The salaries for 2018 19 and the relative increases are set out below: 2017 18 2018 19 salary salary Executive Director 000 000 % change Jonathan Murphy 335 365 9 Jayne Cottam 180 184.5 2.5 The CEO received a salary increase of 9% from 335,000 to 365,000 in recognition of his growing experience and performance in the role noting that he has now served a compete financial year as CEO, in addition to his time as interim CEO.
While this increase is above that awarded to the general workforce, the Committee has adopted this approach given the size and responsibility of the role and noting that it still remains very conservatively positioned against companies of a comparable size in the FTSE 250 Real Estate sector.
Pension and benefits As was the case last year, Jonathan Murphy and Jayne Cottam will receive payments in lieu of pension contributions equivalent to 13.5% of salary respectively.
Benefits will be provided in line with the Remuneration Policy.
Annual bonus The maximum bonus opportunity for 2018 19 will continue to be 100% of salary for Jonathan Murphy and 75% of salary for Jayne Cottam.
The performance objectives under the annual bonus plan for 2018 19 will continue to relate to value-added opportunities, within the portfolio and from market activity and financial targets.
The Committee is of the opinion that the precise performance targets for the bonus plan are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them before the start of the financial year.
Appropriate levels of disclosure of the actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the performance period so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs.
The Committee will also follow the practice of previous years and view the weightings for bonus purposes at the end of the year, having regard to all known factors.
As was the case with the 2017 18 bonus, a deferred share element will apply, under which up to 50% of any bonus earned by an Executive Director will be deferred into shares for two years to the extent that the Executive Director does not already hold shares worth at least 300% of salary.
com 69 Long-term incentives A further grant of awards will be made under the PSP to Jonathan Murphy and Jayne Cottam over shares worth 150% of salary which will vest subject to the extent to which three-year performance targets are satisfied.
However, reflecting the Companys focus on earnings growth and a progressive dividend policy, the Remuneration Committee is proposing to switch the NAV target to an EPS target for the 2018 PSP awards onwards.
As such, the performance targets for the 2018 PSP awards, which are expected to be granted in July 2018, will be as follows: Absolute TSR growth: 50% of award Absolute average annual compound TSR growth over performance period Percentage of this portion of award that vests Below 5% 0% 5% 0% 15% 100% EPRA EPS: 50% of award EPRA EPS Growth over performance period Percentage of this portion of award that vests Below 5% 0% 5% 0% 15% 100% Straight line vesting would occur between each target.
A post vesting holding period will also apply to the extent that, on vesting, a participant does not comply with the shareholding guideline in place at that time currently 300% of salary.
Non-Executive Directors The following table sets out the fee rates for the Non-Executive Directors from 1 April 2018: 2018 19 2017 18 000 000 % change Chairman fee 150.0 133.4 12.4 Non-Executive Director base fee 38.6 37.7 2.4 Additional fee for Chairing of Audit and Remuneration Committee 8.7 8.5 2.4 Additional fee for Senior Independent Director 8.7 8.5 2.4 Following consultation with our remuneration consultants and reviewing the current market position for comparable roles and the commitment required to fulfil the role the Board decided to increase the Chairman fee by 12% to 150,000.
This level is conservatively positioned with market comparables and represents the first increase above inflation since 2011.
