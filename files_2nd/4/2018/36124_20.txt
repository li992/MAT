2018 Annual bonus outcome audited For the financial year to 30 June 2018, the annual bonus measures, targets and performance against those targets are set out in the table below.
Senior management was subject to similar targets, which were applied to their respective business or business unit performance.
The bonus outcome was subject to a scale-back if certain non-financial targets in relation to health and safety were not achieved.

The average monthly month end target was 307.8m net debt compared with an achieved average of 227.0m excluding any benefit from proceeds raised from the rights issue in April 2018.
2 Actual performance refers to a notional profit before tax figure of 175.37m, being the sum of reported profits before tax of 143.7m and 31.67m, being the element of the exceptional charge arising from the compulsory liquidation of Carillion as announced in February and May 2018.
3 Actual performance refers to a notional profit before tax figure of 81.3m, being the sum of reported profits before tax of 56.3m and 25.0m, being the element of the exceptional charge arising from the compulsory liquidation of Carillion as announced in February 2018.
Our business Strategic review Business review Governance Financial information Annual Report and 67 Financial Statements 2018 The Committee considered the performance against targets set at the start of the year for profit before tax and cash flow, and looked at a broader assessment of management, the key strategic decisions taken during the year and overall business performance.
While the full year pre-exceptional profit before tax targets were partially achieved during the year, the Committee considered the impact of the 25.0m exceptional charge reported in the first half and the further 6.67m resulting from the compulsory liquidation of Carillion as announced by the Company in February and May 2018 as well as the adjustments made last year.
The half year profit target and actual profit performance were not impacted by the exceptional charge and will pay out in full.
The month end cash balances were above target for each month and in most cases exceeded the stretch target of 10% improvement.
As a result of this strong cash performance over the course of the entire year, the total bonus payable for the year was 86.5% of maximum.
A health and safety bonus deductor was also considered, based on a health and safety matrix in force across the entire Group that could reduce bonus by specified percentages relating to the number of accidents, incidents and other reportable events.
In addition, as set out in last years Annual Report, the Committee reserved the right to adjust the 2018 bonus outcomes depending on the outcome of the investigations into the two fatalities in the year ended June 2017.
In reviewing the Groups health and safety performance against the matrix, the Committee took these factors into consideration and decided that the Group targets were met to the extent shown in the table above.
The Committee determined that, in respect of the year to 30 June 2018, the resulting annual bonus awards were as follows: Actual bonus payable for On-target bonus Maximum bonus 2017 18 Cash Shares % of salary % of salary 000 000 000 Peter Truscott 84 150 689 407 282 Graham Prothero 56 100 344 247 97 Two-thirds of the bonus earned in excess of the 50% of salary threshold is required to be deferred into restricted shares.
Although beneficially held by the participants, the allocated restricted shares are legally retained by the EST for a period of three years, and are subject to forfeiture provisions, unless otherwise agreed by the Committee.
Subject to continued employment, the restricted shares are legally transferred to participants on the third anniversary of allocation.
LTIP awards vesting in September 2018 The LTIP awards granted to Peter Truscott and Graham Prothero on 25 September 2015 were based on TSR and EPS performance over the three years to 30 June 2018.
50% of the base award was based on EPS performance and vesting of up to 75% of the base award was based on TSR performance against each of a housebuilding group and construction group.
In total, 36.6% of the base award 18.3% of the maximum possible award will vest as a result of the performance achieved.
EPS performance Threshold 1 1 condition Stretch condition % of base award % of max award 1,2 Measure % of base award 15% vesting 50% vesting Actual vesting vesting Cumulative notional EPS 50% 410p 500p 465.5p 36.6% 18.3% 1 Actual EPS is based on the sum of: reported basic EPS for the year ended 30 June 2016 of 132.5p: pre-exceptional EPS for the year ended 30 June 2017 of 145.8p: and adjusted pre-exceptional EPS for the year ended 30 June 2018 of 187.2p.
2 As disclosed last year, pre-exceptional EPS for the year ended 30 June 2017 was based on a notional profit before tax figure of 157.0m, being the sum of reported profit before tax of 58.7m and 98.3m, being the one-off charge relating to legacy contracts announced in May 2017.
As set out on page 70, adjusted basic EPS for the year ended 30 June 2018 is based on a restated notional profit before tax figures of 188.7m, being the sum of reported profit before tax of 143.7m plus the total 45m exceptional charge of the 2017 18 financial year: resulting in 154.7m of earnings divided by 82.7 million shares, being the average number of shares in issue less the additional number of shares resulting from the rights issue.
The Committee believes that this approach ensures that the EPS targets applying to this award are no less stretching than when the targets were originally set, while ensuring that the determination of performance against this condition fairly reflects the underlying performance of the Company over the performance period.

1 Targets have been adjusted to take account of the impact of the increased number of shares resulting from the rights issue.
The original cumulative underlying EPS targets for the 2016 awards were 489p threshold to 568p stretch.
The original underlying EPS targets for the 2017 awards were: 186.8p threshold to 218.4p stretch.
2 Note that owing to an administrative error the RoNA targets set for the 2017 LTIP awards on grant were overstated due to forecast profit used to calculate the targets also being overstated.
The Committee therefore approved corrected targets as set out below.
Original Corrected Threshold 32.0% 31.0% Target 33.7% 32.6% Maximum 35.4% 34.3% In addition, so as to ensure management is not penalised or advantaged as a consequence of the rights issue, the Committee has decided to apply appropriate adjustments to RoNA when performance is measured.
The basis and impact of these adjustments will be disclosed at that time.
70 Galliford Try plc Annual report on remuneration continued In light of the collapse of Carillion and of the rights issue which took place in 2018, the Committee determined that the cumulative EPS target applying to the 2016 award and the EPS target applying to the 2017 award should be adjusted to take account of the increase in the number of issued shares in the Company.
In doing so the Committee has sought to ensure that these targets remain no less challenging than they would have been but for the impact of the rights issue.
The adjusted targets are therefore based on the three-year plan in place at the time the original targets were set, with the Companys forecast of EPS for the years following the rights issue restated to take account of the additional number of shares in issue.
As reported last year, the EPS measures attached to the 2015 and 2016 LTIP awards are based on cumulative targets and the Committee considered carefully how to treat these awards in light of the 98.3m one-off charge in 2016 17.
After a thorough consultation with major shareholders and shareholder bodies in 2017, the Committee determined that performance should be measured on a pre-exceptional basis.
In 2018, the Committee also considered how to treat the exceptional charge of 25m announced in February 2018 and a further exceptional charge of 20m announced in the full year results, of which 31.67m resulted from the collapse of Carillion, and having established the approach following the previous consultation, determined that these events should not be included in the calculation of underlying EPS for 2017 18.
It therefore confirmed that underlying EPS for 2017 18 should also be measured on this pre-exceptional basis.
