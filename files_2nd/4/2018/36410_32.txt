In reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors, the Committee has also taken account of both the individuals and Companys performance and the employment conditions and salary increases awarded to employees throughout the Company.
The increase for Nick Sanderson reflects that his remit has broadened significantly with him taking on a number of wider operational responsibilities including greater day-to-day oversight of human resources, sustainability and health and safety.

2 Personal objectives 20% The approach to assessing the personal element of the bonus has been modified for 2018 19 to create more thematic objectives which permit a richer discussion of the level of achievement.
These focus around a one-third weighting on the Executive Directors contribution to each of the following categories: strategy, portfolio positioning and team, culture and behaviour.
The Committee will assess each element against targets set at the start of the year and the Executive Directors contribution to meeting additional priorities set by the Board during the year.
The assessed out-turn and details of their delivery against these objectives will be disclosed in the following report.
Any dividends will be deducted from the base figure from the point of distribution as it is not realistic to deliver growth after capital has been repaid to shareholders, except where reflected in some other way, such as through a share consolidation.
The Committee is of the opinion that, given the commercial sensitivity around GPEs business, disclosing precise individual targets for the Annual Bonus Plan in advance would not be in the best interests of shareholders or the Company.
Objectives, performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the performance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts.

Notes to the Future Policy Table 1.
Performance measures and targets Shortand long-term performance measures will be selected by the Committee in order to provide a direct connection to the Companys strategy by being linked to the key fundamental performance indicators at the time.
In normal circumstances, they would be expected to include metrics such as TPR capital growth, NAV or TAR targets and relative TSR performance.
Relative measures will be assessed against a relevant IPD index and or an appropriate group of other UK listed real estate companies with similar operations.
Absolute measures are set following a robust budget setting process which takes into account internal financial indicators as well as a broader view of the market environment.
The targets for the annual bonus and the LTIP for 2018 19 are set out in the Annual report on remuneration on pages 112 and 113.
Other than in exceptional circumstances, the TAR range is set at 4% to 10% per annum foreach year of this policy.
The awards are also subject to an underpin under which the level of vesting may be reduced in certain circumstances.
The Committee is of the opinion that given the commercial sensitivity around GPEs business, disclosing individuals targets for the Annual Bonus Plan inadvance would not be in the best interests of shareholders or the Company.
Actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published attheend ofperformance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees All employees of GPE are entitled to base salary and benefits on the same basis, with quantum of awards being set at levels commensurate with their role.
All employees participate in an employee annual bonus plan, with quantum of awards being set at levels commensurate with their role and with performance measures, similar to the executive scheme, based on Group performance and against personal objectives.
Senior managers receive LTIP awards under the 2010 Plan with quantum of awards being set at levels commensurate with their role.
All employees are eligible to participate in the Company SIP and the SAYE on the same terms as the Executive Directors.
Employees who joined the Company before April 2002 are members of the Companys defined benefit pension plan, and all other employees are eligible tojoin the Companys defined contribution pension plan and receive a contribution of up to 10% of salary.
Changes to remuneration policy from previous policy The changes to previous policy have been noted in the table above.
The inclusion of caps does not represent any aspiration.
Discretion The Committee will operate the annual bonus, LTIP and SMP awards according to their respective rules and ancillary documents and in accordance with the Listing Rules where relevant.
The Committee retains discretion consistent with market practice, in a number of regards to the operation and administration of these plans as noted in the policy table and in the recruitment remuneration and payments for loss of office sections as relevant.
Any use of these discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual report on remuneration and may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultations with the Companys major shareholders.
In addition, the Committee has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or wait for shareholder approval.
Details of share awards granted to existing Executive Directors are set out on pages 118 and 119 of the Annual report on remuneration.
These remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms, in line with the policy set out in the policy table or under the authority of the previously approved remuneration policy as will other legacy arrangements, including those awarded prior to promotion to the Board.

Governance 130 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2018 Directors remuneration report continued Approach to recruitment remuneration The Committees approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract appropriate candidates to the role, and our principle is that the pay of any new recruit would be assessed following the same principles as for the directors and the policy previously summarised.
Executive Director recruitment Component Policy Base salary The salary level will be set taking into account relevant market data, the experience and skills of andbenefits the individual, responsibilities of the individual and the salaries paid to similar roles in comparable companies in line with the current process undertaken by the Committee when setting the salary levels for its existing directors.
Whilst it is not envisaged that it will be required, as provided for in the relevant regulations, the Committee reserves the right to exceed the fixed pay limits set out in the policy table, in exceptional circumstances, to secure the appointment of a high calibre individual.
Executive Directors shall be eligible to receive benefits in line with the Companys benefits policy asset out in the remuneration policy table.
Pension Executive Directors will be able to receive a pension contribution or receive a supplement in lieu of pension contributions in line with the Companys pension policy as set out in the remuneration policytable.
Annual bonus Executive Directors will be eligible to participate in the Annual Bonus Plan as set out in the remuneration policy table.
For Executive Directors joining part way through a year, awards would be pro-rated.
Different performance measures may be set initially for the annual bonus, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial year that they joined.
The annual maximum potential opportunity under this plan is 150% of salary.
Long-term Executive Directors will be eligible to participate in the Long-Term Incentive Plan set out in the incentives remuneration policy table.
Awards may be granted up to the maximum opportunity allowable under plan rules at the Committees discretion of 300% of salary under the LTIP.
An award may be made onor shortly following an appointment assuming the Company is not in a prohibitive period.
Share buyouts Awards may be granted to replace those forfeited by the Executive Director from a previous employer replacement on taking up the appointment where considered necessary by the Committee.
awards The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards such that overall they are no more generous in terms of quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited.
Where the Company compensates new directors in this way, it will seek to do so under the terms of the Companys existing variable remuneration arrangements, but may compensate on terms that are more bespoke than the existing arrangements, including awards granted under Listing Rule 9.4.
2, where the Committee considers this to be appropriate.
In such instances, the Company will disclose afull explanation of the detail and rationale for such recruitment related compensation.
In making such awards, the Committee will seek to take into account the nature including whether awards are cash or share based, vesting period and performance measures and or conditions for any remuneration forfeited by the individual in leaving a previous employer.
Where such awards had outstanding performance or service conditions which are not significantly completed, the Company will generally impose equivalent conditions.
In exceptional cases the Committee may relax those requirements where it considers this to be in the interest of the shareholders, for example through applying a significant discount to the face value of the replacement awards.
Relocation In instances where the new Executive Director is non-UK domiciled or needs to be relocated, policies the Company may provide one-off or ongoing compensation as part of the Executive Directors relocation benefits to reflect the cost of relocation for the Executive in cases where they are expected to spend significant time away from their country of domicile.
The level of the relocation package will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and may take into consideration any cost of living differences, housing allowance and or schooling.
Legacy Where an Executive Director is appointed from within the organisation, the normal policy of the arrangements Company is that any legacy arrangements would be honoured in line with the original terms and conditions on a pro rata basis.
Similarly, if an Executive Director is appointed following the Companys acquisition or merger with another company, legacy terms and conditions on a pro rata basis would be honoured.
Annual Report 2018 Great Portland Estates 131 Non-Executive Director recruitment Component Policy Fees Newly appointed Non-Executive Directors will be paid fees consistent with existing Non-Executive Directors.
Service agreements and payments for loss of office The policy of the Company is to have service contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of one year.
It is sometimes necessary when recruiting a new Executive Director to give a service contract with an initial term of up to 18 months in which case a 12-month notice period may be given no earlier than six months from the start date orthe contract.
Non-Executive Directors who have letters of appointment, are subject to the provisions of the Articles of Association dealing with appointment and rotation every three years, however, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Codethey are subject to annual re-election and have a notice period of three months by either party.
They are not eligible for payment in lieu of notice or any other payment on termination.
The following table sets out the dates of each of the Executive Directors service agreements and their unexpired term, the dates of the Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment and the date on which the Non-Executive Director isnextsubject to reappointment or re-election.

The Companys policy on termination payments for Executive Directors is to consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant contractual terms, the circumstances of the termination and any applicable duty tomitigate.
It is the Committees policy not to reward poor performance.
The Committee will always seek to minimise the cost to the Company whilst seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time.
The Committee will honour Executive Directors contractual entitlements.
Service contracts do not contain liquidated damages clauses.
If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case.
There are no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement.
There is no agreement between the Company and its directors or employees, providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
The Company reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation : or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising on connection with the termination of an Executive Directors office or employment.
