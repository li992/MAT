Cathleen brings substantial experience to the Committee from her international roles and we look forward to working with her.
I also extend my thanks to Gerhard Fusenig and Kevin Parry, both of whom stepped down from the Board at end of the year and have offered invaluable advice during their time on the Committee.
2018 was a year of change for Standard Life Aberdeen.
There has Richard Mully been a significant amount of work behind the scenes and I would like Chairman, Remuneration Committee to thank the People team who, under Kerry Christies leadership, have helped deliver on critical projects.

Significant outflows have materialised as a result of both Approval investment performance in those areas and general investor The Directors remuneration report was approved by the Board and sentiment in challenging market conditions.
Conversely, performance signed on its behalf by for Fixed Income, Cash Liquidity and Alternatives remains strong over 3 and 5 years, and we have maintained capital strength which has enabled us to sustain strong dividend payments.
We have continued to set and execute our long term strategic agenda with the sale of our UK and European insurance business to Phoenix in August 2018 marking a significant milestone in our transformation to a fee based, capital-light investment company.
There has been substantial progress made on transformational and operational integration projects as a result of the merger.
We remain on track to deliver the targeted annual efficiency savings of over 350m by 2020.
Richard Mully While the strategy remains well supported by shareholders and the Chairman, Remuneration Committee execution of the strategy has been good, it is clear that the challenges 13 March 2019 associated with the prevailing economic and geopolitical environment have impacted our financial performance, as a result of which our share price has not been what we would want over the past year.
Executive Incentive Plan EIP outcomes The financial performance indicated above has rightly impacted executive reward with the outcome of the Executive Incentive Plan EIP scorecard being heavily weighted 80% towards financial outcomes.
However, the Committee did acknowledge that achievements from the perspective of strategic and personal performance also need to be taken into account when determining overall remuneration outcomes for our executive Directors.
Directors remuneration report continued To consider whether the awards generated by the scorecard were fair employee consultation.
Implementation is expected to be in the in the broader performance context the Committee considered the second half of 2019. following factors: The Committee has approved the proposed changes and is The outcome from the perspective of overall company performance monitoring progress in line with its duty to periodically review trends in the wider remuneration landscape and to oversee relevant changes The shareholder experience during 2018 for our employees.

As a result, taking a holistic view of these factors, the Committee decided to apply a discretionary reduction to the EIP outcome for the Corporate Governance Code co-CEOs in recognition of the disappointing outturn in 2018, reducing Alongside the above work, the Committee noted the publication of the the awards to 50% of the calculated outcome.
In addition, the 2018 Corporate Governance Code in July 2018.

Restated targets are set out on page 88 for the EIP and page 93 for the LTIP.

Alignment of remuneration across our workforce As a result of the merger, a diverse range of terms and conditions are currently in operation across the Group.
In 2018, work started on a project to harmonise terms and conditions for all UK based colleagues, with other activities underway or planned to achieve similar harmonisation objectives in our other locations.
The harmonisation programme includes alignment of pension contributions, variable pay structures and other benefits.
This provides an opportunity to improve alignment of remuneration with the Groups culture and to further enhance our one company vision.

The Remuneration Committee determined there should be no adjustments made to the EIP scores as a result of the feedback from the Group Audit Committee, and the Group Risk and Capital Committee.
As set out in the Chairmans letter, to consider whether the awards generated by the scorecard were fair in the broader performance context the Committee considered the following factors: The outcome from the perspective of overall company performance The shareholder experience during 2018 The context of the incentive funding position across our workforce Taking everything into account, the Committee decided to apply discretion to the EIP outcome for the co-CEOs to reduce the awards to 50% of the calculated outcome.
In addition, the Committee decided that this amount would be deferred in full, with vesting determined by performance against underpins which links the award to future performance.
In the Committees view, this outcome best balances disappointing financial results and shareholder outcomes with appropriate recognition for the contribution made by the executive Directors to manage the Companys performance in a challenging marketplace and to continue to move forward on the Companys strategic agenda as articulated to, and strongly supported by, our shareholders.
The overall outcome of the scorecard and the discretionary adjustment is set out on page 91.
90 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 GOVERNANCE As a result of the approved ratings, the EIP outcome for 2018 is as set out in the table below: Final outcome after 1 Formulaic outcome discretion applied Total payable Total payable EIP cash EIP deferred % of maximum % of maximum % of salary 000s 000s 000s Martin Gilbert Maximum 100% n a 600% 3,600 900 2,700 Actual 20.4% 10.2% 61.2% 367 367 Keith Skeoch Maximum 100% n a 600% 3,600 900 2,700 20.4% 61.2% Actual 10.2% 367 367 Rod Paris Maximum 100% n a 600% 2,700 675 2,025 22.4% 22.4% 134.4% Actual 605 151 454 Bill Rattray Maximum 100% n a 350% 1,575 394 1,181 19.4% 19.4% 67.9% Actual 306 77 229 1 EIP deferred awards are subject to performance underpins measured over three years as set out in the following section.
EIP deferred awards to be granted in 2019 EIP deferred awards will be made in 2019, in the form of nil-cost options, under the Deferred Bonus Plan rules.
Awards will be subject to performance underpins, measured over a three-year period.
Subject to performance against the underpins, awards will vest pro-rata over years three, four and five following grant.
Awards will not be released to participants until the fifth anniversary of grant.
The following table sets out each of the performance underpins: Performance measure Weighting Underpin level The outcome is calculated at the end of each financial year in the three-year underpin period 2019-2021, Investment with the average of the three years results to be at or above 55% of AUM by value to be outperforming 25% performance benchmark 2 Gross new business flows underpin 12.5% approved target of 251.5bn is based on 2019 budget for the three year period 2019 2021 reduced by the % midpoint of the range between Threshold and Target applied in the 2019 EIP.
1 3 Flows 25% Net new business flows underpin 12.5% approved target of 40.6bn is based on the 2019 budget sum of the differential between gross inflows and gross redemptions for the three year period 2019-2021 reduced by the mid-point between Threshold and Target applied to 2019 in the EIP.
The underpin requires return on adjusted equity, calculated as the average rate over the three-year underpin Return on adjusted 25% period 2019-2021, to be 17% or higher equity The underpin approved target of 66.0% is based on averaging the three annual cost-income ratios for the three year period 2019-2021 from the 2019 budget increased by the % midpoint of the range between Cost income ratio 25% Threshold and Target applied in the 2019 EIP.
1 Flows exclude investments in cash and liquidity funds.
Long-term incentives In line with the arrangements in place prior to the merger of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen Asset Management PLC, Keith Skeoch and Rod Paris have outstanding awards under the Standard Life Executive LTIP and Rod Paris also has outstanding awards under the Standard Life Investments LTIP.
The following section sets out the level of vesting of outstanding awards due to vest based on performance to the end of 2018.
2016 Executive LTIP award vesting in respect of performance ending in 2018 audited The awards granted in 2016 under the Executive LTIP have two performance conditions.
The outcome is based 70% on cumulative Group adjusted profit before tax and 30% on cumulative Group net flows.
The awards are also subject to two underpins when assessing the Group performance.
The first requires the Risk and Capital Committee to be satisfied that performance obtained has been achieved within acceptable defined risk parameters.
The second requires the Remuneration Committee to be satisfied that performance against the plan metrics appropriately reflects overall Group performance.
Keith Skeoch received an award in March 2016 of 400% of salary with the performance period ending in 2018.
Rod Paris does not have an award under the Standard Life Executive LTIP with performance ending in 2018 as he was not an executive Director at the time of grant in March 2016.
Directors remuneration report continued The following adjustments were made to the performance targets for the 2016 awards: Following its sale to Phoenix, removal of targets linked to the Standard Life Aberdeens UK and European insurance business from 31 August 2018 Addition of Phoenix profit share post 31 August 2018 Removal of targets related to the change in share of HDFC AMC following the IPO and inclusion of interest on the sales proceeds The underlying principle to the adjustments made was that the adjusted targets should not be easier more challenging than the original targets.
The table below shows the original and adjusted performance targets together with actual outcomes for the 2016 LTIP award: Actual Level of Threshold Target Maximum performance vesting 1 Cumulative Group adjusted profit before tax for Standard Life Aberdeen Group for the three years ended 31 December 2018 1 Original performance conditions 2,490m 2,705m 3,030m Adjusted performance conditions 2,395m 2,600m 2,910m 2,305m Vesting outcome 70% weighting 0% Cumulative Group net flows for the Standard Life Aberdeen Group for three years ended 31 December 2018 1 Original performance condition 30.8bn 38.9bn 51.0bn Adjusted performance condition 30.8bn 38.9bn 51.0bn 53.7bn Vesting outcome 30% weighting 0% 1 These performance conditions were adjusted in 2017 in light of the merger, full details can be found in the Annual report and accounts 2017.
No change was made to the net flows condition from those originally set in 2016.
In line with the above results, it was determined the performance conditions were not met and the award lapsed in full.
2016 Standard Life Investments LTIP award vesting in respect of performance ending in 2018 audited Under the Standard Life Investments LTIP, awards are only capable of vesting if Aberdeen Standard Investments investment performance three-year money-weighted average is above the lower quartile of the money-weighted average of all assets under management both captive and third party assets compared to other asset managers.
When awarded, the vesting outcome was subject to a consolidated cumulative three-year third party EBITDA performance and this measure was used to capture vesting outcomes up to the end of 2017.
As a consequence of the merger the awards became based on an adjusted profit before tax performance target for Aberdeen Standard Investments for the 2018 performance year.
The actual profit targets are not disclosed as Aberdeen Standard Investments is a subsidiary business of Standard Life Aberdeen plc and the Board deems that this is commercially sensitive information which, if disclosed, could seriously prejudice the Groups business.
Before an award can vest, the Risk and Capital Committee is required to verify to the Remuneration Committee that the level of vesting was not as a result of behaviour that has exposed the Group to undue risk.
The Remuneration Committee took the view of the Risk and Capital Committee into account when determining the level of vesting.
Rod Paris, who was not a Director at the time of grant in March 2016, received an award with a maximum value of 500% of salary with the performance period ending in 2018.
The following table sets out performance against targets for the 2016 award: Performance level Below threshold Threshold Target Maximum Adjusted profit before tax performance target 70% of target 70% of target 100% of target 130% of target Actual performance 72.4% of target Vesting outcome 6.35% of target As performance was above the lower quartile of the money-weighted average of all assets under management both captive and third party assets compared to other asset managers, and having considered the risk underpin, the Remuneration Committee determined that 6.35% of the target award 3.175% of the maximum award granted in 2016 would vest in 2019.

This resulted in the above awards being granted on 28 March 2018 based on the average share price for December 2017 as per plan rules of 423.41p.
5 Under the Aberdeen variable pay plans, deferred bonus awards in the form of nil-cost options were granted to Martin Gilbert and Bill Rattray.
As disclosed in the Annual report and accounts 2017, of the above awards 837,827 Martin Gilbert : 172,943 Bill Rattray relate to the period post completion of the merger i. e. 14 August 2017 to 31 December 2017.
These awards will vest in equal tranches between 5 March 2019 to 5 March 2023 share price on award 368.88 pence which was the average Standard Life Aberdeen plc share price for the 5 days prior to the 5 March grant.
The balancing figures 2,239,000 Martin Gilbert : 464,000 Bill Rattray relate to the period prior to the completion of the merger i. e. 1 October 2016 to 13 August 2017.
These awards will vest in equal tranches between 14 August 2018 to 14 August 2022 share price on award 328.08 pence, being the average Aberdeen Asset Management share price for the five days prior to grant, i. e. 14 August 2017.
Performance conditions for Executive LTIP awards granted 2018 and 2017 The awards granted in 2018 under the Executive LTIP have two performance conditions.
The outcome is based 80% on cumulative Group adjusted profit before tax and 20% on cumulative Group net flows.
In addition to business performance criteria, all of the awards are subject to an additional personal performance underpin whereby, if an executive Director performs at an unsatisfactory level in any year during the three-year performance period, their original award would be reduced by one-third, unless the Co-Chief Executive Officers, or the Remuneration Committee in the case of Keith Skeoch, recommends otherwise.
Keith Skeoch and Rod Paris were granted awards under the Executive LTIP in 2018 and 2017.
As set out in the Remuneration Committee Chairmans statement, the performance targets for the 2018 and 2017 awards under the Executive LTIP Plan have been adjusted as follows: Following its sale to Phoenix, removal of targets linked to the Standard Life Aberdeens UK and European insurance business from 31 August 2018 Addition of Phoenix profit share post 31 August 2018 Removal of targets as a result of the change in share of HDFC AMC following the IPO and inclusion of interest on the sales proceeds The underlying principle to the adjustments made was that the adjusted targets should not be easier more challenging than the original targets.
The table below sets out the adjusted performance targets for Executive LTIP awards granted in 2018: Performance measurement Original adjusted Performance condition period target Threshold Maximum original 2,675m 3,615m Cumulative Group adjusted profit before tax excluding 1 January 2018 - spread risk margin adjusted 2,295m 3,105m 31 December original 45.1bn 83.7bn Cumulative Group growth net flows excluding strategic 2020 insurance partners adjusted 36.5bn 67.9bn The table below sets out the adjusted performance targets for Executive LTIP awards granted in 2017: Performance 1 measurement Original adjusted Performance condition period target Threshold Maximum original 3,000m 3,650m 1 January 2017 - Cumulative Group adjusted profit before tax adjusted 2,665m 3,245m 31 December original 27.7bn 45.9bn 2019 Cumulative Group net flows No adjustment 27.7bn 45.9bn 1 These are the performance targets after the adjustments in 2017 in light of the merger, full details can be found in the Annual report and accounts 2017.
No change was made to the net flows condition in 2017 from those originally set at grant.
Directors remuneration report continued Directors interests in shares audited A shareholding requirement was implemented in 2014 and amended in 2018.
We continue to require executive Directors and senior management to maintain a material long-term investment in Standard Life Aberdeen plc shares.
The Remuneration Committee reviews progress against the requirement annually and retains discretion to require executive Directors to purchase shares to meet the requirement.
Personal investment strategies such as hedging arrangements are not permitted.
For the purpose of the shareholding requirement, awards qualifying include 50% of the value of deferred awards held by the executive Directors that have vested but not been exercised and 50% of the value of long-term incentive awards that are no longer subject to a performance condition but have not been exercised.
As illustrated in the tables below, all executive Directors have complied with the current requirement as at 31 December 2018.

Executive Directors will be required to retain shares held in respect of the post cessation requirement 500% of salary for the co-CEOs and 300% of salary for other executive Directors for a period of one year following their departure from the Group.
All former Directors held or continue to hold the shares required under their post-employment holding requirement.
Luke Savage is required to hold 15,940 shares until 28 February 2019 and met this requirement.
Paul Matthews met his requirement to hold 157,934 shares until 1 March 2018.
Colin Clark retained in excess of his requirement at the point of the share consolidation on 22 October 2018.
As no subsequent disposal of shares has been made he therefore has retained the necessary holding at 31 December 2018.

Implementation of policy for non-executive Directors in 2019 The following table sets out non-executive Director fees to be paid in 2019.
No changes were made to the level of fees from 2018.
With regards to the Chairmans fee, as set out on page 59, Sir Douglas was appointed following an extensive international search led by the CoChairs of the Appointment Committee Simon Troughton and Melanie Gee.
Sir Douglas has joined the Company in a period of significant organisational change, following the merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management and the sale of Standard Life Aberdeens UK and European Insurance business.
In addition, the wider asset management sector is going through a period of consolidation and market conditions remain challenging as macroeconomic and political uncertainties continue to affect investor sentiment.
Given the calibre of the candidate and taking into account market data on Chairman fees for other large international financial services companies, the Remuneration Committee approved an all-inclusive fee of 475k per annum for Sir Douglas.
Whilst the Remuneration Committee acknowledges the fee represents an increase on the base fee for the current incumbent, it was considered appropriate to ensure that the right candidate was appointed to lead the Company through a period of significant change.

This is within the maximum 1,000,000 permitted under Article 87 of Standard Life Aberdeen plcs articles of association.
Total fees including additional duties are expected to amount to 1,131k for 2019 2018: 1,599k.

3 The Committee has agreed to provide life insurance benefits to the Chairman with effect from April 2019 to reflect his personal circumstances and business travel requirements.
4 For non-executive Directors, individual fees are constructed by taking a base fee and adding extra fees for being the senior independent Director or, the chairman of, or member of, committees and subsidiaries boards where a greater responsibility and time commitment is required.
