Therefore, the 2019 annual general meeting that would broaden our corporate despite the strong business results for the year, we assessed 2018 reporting to describe how our strategy is consistent with the goals of performance as below plan, at 81% of target 40.5% of maximum.

Thus, there is directional alignment between which includes BPs role in the energy transition, we are increasing executives and shareholders.
However, the formula from which the the weighting of this measure from 20% to 30%, while reducing the outcome was calculated originated in the 2014 plan which we returns measure from 30% to 20%.
The committee recognized that merely applying a dated formula might not best serve the interests of the Following our review of their total remuneration, we have decided to stakeholders.

This represents a 3% decrease for Bob, reflecting significant reductions in both his annual bonus and the investment return on his retirement savings, partly offset by an increase attributable to share price growth.

In 2018 Bob incurred investment losses of $193,910 in this account, hence this aggregate value is negative and reported as zero per regulations.
Full details are set out on page 96.
For Brian Gilvary this represents the annual increase in accrued pension, net of inflation, multiplied by 20.
In 2018 Brians salary increased by less than inflation, hence the net increase is reported as zero per regulations.
Full details are set out on page 96. b R epresents the assumed vesting of shares in 2019 following the end of the relevant performance period, based on a preliminary assessment of performance achieved under the rules of the plan and includes accrued dividends on shares vested.
In accordance with UK regulations, the vesting price of the assumed vesting is the average market price for the fourth quarter of 2018 which was 5.33 for ordinary shares and $41.48 for ADSs.
The final vesting will be confirmed by the committee in the second quarter of 2019 and provided in the 2019 directors remuneration report.
c I n accordance with UK regulations, in the 2017 single figure table, the performance outcome values were based on fourth-quarter average prices of 5.01 for ordinary shares and $39.85 for ADSs.
In May 2018, after the external data became available, the committee reviewed the relative reserves replacement ratio position, and this resulted in no adjustment to the final vesting of 70%.
On 22 May 2018, 198,306 ADSs for Bob Dudley and 603,831 ordinary shares for Brian Gilvary vested at prices of $47.09 and 5.88 respectively.
On 31 July 2019 an additional 2,599 ADS and 7,795 ordinary shares vested, representing accrued dividends at prices of $45.09 and 5.73 for Bob and Brian respectively.
The 2017 reported values for the total vesting have therefore increased by $1,168 thousand for Bob and by 614 thousand for Brian.
d B ob Dudley has voluntarily agreed to defer performance assessment and vesting of the awards related to his 2015 annual bonus until at least one year after retirement, therefore the performance period is expected to exceed the minimum term of three years.

e T he amounts reported for 2018 relate to the 2015 annual bonus deferred over three years, which vested on 19 February 2019 at the market price of 5.38 for ordinary shares and include accrued dividends on shares vested.
Brian Gilvary has voluntarily agreed to defer performance assessment and vesting of the matching awards related to his 2015 annual bonus for a further two years see the Deferred shares table on page 101 for further details on these awards.
The amounts reported for 2017 relate to the 2014 annual bonus and have been adjusted from the number provided in the 2017 directors remuneration report to include the accrual and vesting of accrued dividends.
f Due to rounding, the total does not agree exactly with the sum of its component parts.
g T he values shown for performance shares and deferred share awards include the share price appreciation experienced over the three-year vesting periods.
This additional line shows the value of those awards that is directly attributable to share price appreciation, being the number of shares vesting, including accrued dividends, multiplied by the increase in share price from grant date to vesting date.

For instance, our larger gender pay gaps relate to BP understanding how effectively current pay policies and processes Exploration and BP p. l. c. where we have the largest differential between manage fairness and avoid bias in pay outcomes.
We noted the female representation in the top and bottom pay quartiles.
By contrast, February 2018 UK gender pay gap reporting for the five legal entities we reported a negative pay gap in BP Chemicals, where male to female covered by the regulations, and the explanations provided in the representation is more consistent.
narrative that accompanied BPs reporting.
Overall the committee feels assured that the anti-discrimination controls written into pay policies, and the quality of processes behind individual pay decision making, are effective in delivering an equal pay environment like pay for like work for the wider workforce.
While the UK gender pay gap reporting showed pay gaps in favour of men for four out of the five entities, we understand that these gaps result largely from the relative under-representation of women in senior roles, and that the groups primary focus should therefore be on improving female representation, rather than adjusting pay practices.
Therefore we have reviewed the various initiatives taken by management to address these representation concerns and will continue to monitor progress in addressing the underlying issues.
Proportion of females and males in each quartile band These charts show how men and women are represented in each pay band.
An even distribution across the quartiles would tend to minimize the gender pay gap.

There is no identified overall minimum vesting threshold level but to comply with UK regulations a value of 44.4%, which is conditional on the TSR, operating cash flow, each of the strategic imperatives and strategic progress reaching the minimum threshold, has been calculated.
For awards under the 2017-19 plan, performance conditions are measured 50% on TSR relative to Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and Total over three years: 30% on ROACE based on performance in 2019 and 20% on strategic progress assessed over the performance period.
For awards under the 2018-20 plan, performance conditions are measured on the same basis as the 2017-19 plan, except ROACE which will be based on performance in the last two years of the performance period i. e. 2019 and 2020.
Each performance period ends on 31 December of the third year.
b Bob Dudley received awards in the form of ADSs.
The above numbers reflect calculated equivalents in ordinary shares.
One ADS is equivalent to six ordinary shares.
c Represents vestings of shares made at the end of the relevant performance period based on performance achieved under rules of the plan and includes reinvested dividends on the shares vested.
The market price of each share at the vesting date of 22 May 2018 was 5.88 and for ADSs was $47.09.
These totals include the additional accrual of dividends which vested on 31 July 2018. d The 2015-17 award vested on 22 May 2018.
Details can be found in the single figure table on page 95. e Bob Dudley has requested that the EDIP performance shares vesting in respect of the performance period 2016-18 is based on the 500% maximum annual award level which applies under the 2017 directors remuneration policy, rather than the 550% maximum annual award level which applies under the 2014 directors remuneration policy.
The number reported here has been re-based to 500%.
f For the assumed vestings in the second quarter of 2019 a price of 5.33 per ordinary share and $41.48 per ADS has been used.
These are the average prices from the fourth quarter of 2018. g The face value has been calculated using the market price of ordinary shares on 19 May 2017 of 4.72. h In our 2017 report, the 31 December 2017 value for this award was incorrectly stated as 1,428,750. i The face value has been calculated using the market price of ordinary shares on 22 May 2018 of 5.88.
If the committee assesses that there has been a material deterioration in safety and environmental performance, or there have been major incidents, either of which reveal underlying weaknesses in safety and environmental management, then it may conclude that shares should vest only in part, or not at all.
In reaching its conclusion, the committee will obtain advice from the SEEAC.
There is no identified minimum vesting threshold level.
c The face value has been calculated using the market price of ordinary shares on 11 February 2015 of 4.46. d Bob Dudley has voluntarily agreed to defer the performance assessment and vesting of these awards until at least one year after retirement, therefore the performance period is expected to exceed the minimum term of three years.
e The face value has been calculated using the market price of ordinary shares on 4 March 2016 of 3.68. f The market price at closing of ordinary shares on 19 May 2017 was 4.72 and for ADSs was $36.94.
The sterling value has been used to calculate the face value.

h Represents vestings of shares made at the end of the relevant performance period based on performance achieved under rules of the plan and includes reinvested dividends on the shares vested.
The market price of each share used to determine the total value at vesting on the vesting date of 20 February 2018 was 4.75.
These totals include the additional accrual of dividends which vested on 22 May 2018 and 31 July 2018. i Brian Gilvary has voluntarily agreed to defer the performance assessment and vesting of these matching awards for a total of five years with a further one-year retention period.
The face values have been calculated using the market prices of 4.46 per ordinary share on 11 February 2015 and 3.68 per ordinary share on 4 March 2016. j Represents vesting of shares at the end of the relevant performance period based on performance achieved under rules of the plan.
