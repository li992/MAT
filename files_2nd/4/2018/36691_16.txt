Herald Investment Trust plc Annual report & financial statements 2018 42 GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 1 CHAIRMANS ANNUAL STATEMENT Dear Shareholder I present below at section 3 the Companys remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Our remuneration policy see section 2 below was approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
The policy must be put to shareholders for approval every three years and the board must only operate in accordance with the approved policy during the three year cycle, unless shareholder approval is sought to amend the policy.
I confirm that the board has complied with the policy during the year ended 31 December 2018.
Fees were increased with effect from 1 July 2018 to: chairman 33,750: audit committee chair 25,500: NED 22,500.
This means that fees have increased by c. 8% since our remuneration policy was approved.
The law requires the Companys auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated as such.
The auditors opinion is included in their report on pages 46 to 49.
SCOPE AND RESPONSIBILITY As the Company has no employees and no executive directors, the policy relates only to the non-executive directors.
2 POLICY ON DIRECTORS FEES The boards policy is that the remuneration of directors should be set at a reasonable level that is commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the role and consistent with the requirement to attract and retain directors of the appropriate quality and experience.
It should also reflect the experience of the board as a whole and be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts that are similar in size.
The board has taken account of any views expressed by shareholders in formulating this policy.
Component Commentary Basic fee arrangement At the time the policy was approved in April 2017, the directors received fees for their services as follows: Chairman fee 31,500 Audit committee chair 23,000 NED fee 21,000 These fees are determined within an aggregate limit set out in the Companys articles of association which stands at 200,000 per annum, increased from 125,000 at the AGM in 2018.
There is no separate remuneration committee and the board as a whole considers changes to directors fees from time to time.
The company secretary provides advice and comparative information when the board considers the level of directors fees.
If the board concludes that it is appropriate to increase fees during the three year period that the policy is in force, such increase or increases will be limited to a maximum total increase of 20% of the amounts payable when the policy was approved, as set out above.
Any new directors will be paid at the rates set out above subject to any increase that may have been introduced in line with this policy.
Under the terms of the directors appointment letters, there is no notice period and no provision for compensation upon early termination of appointment.
