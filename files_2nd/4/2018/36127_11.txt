REMUNERATION REPORT Introduction The remuneration report for the 53 weeks ended 3 June 2018 has been prepared on behalf of the board by the remuneration committee in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008, as amended, and meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Corporate Governance Code.
This remuneration report is split into two parts: The directors remuneration policy, which sets out the Companys proposed policy on directors remuneration.
This proposed policy will be subject to a binding vote at the 2018 AGM and will apply for three years from this date.
The annual report on remuneration, which sets out payments made to executive directors and non-executive directors and details the relationship between company performance and remuneration for the 2017 18 financial year.
The 2017 18 report will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2018 AGM.
2017 18 a year in review Following T H F Kirbys retirement from the Companys board at the 2017 AGM, N J Donaldson was appointed non-executive chairman of Games Workshop and I was appointed chairman of the remuneration and nomination committee.
2017 18 was a truly outstanding year for Games Workshop, building upon the great performance delivered last financial year.
The operational changes introduced by the executive directors have continued to deliver growth and to strengthen the business.
Sales have grown in all channels and territories.
Operating profit has increased by 94% in 2017 18 compared to 2016 17 and return on capital has grown from 72% to 120%.
For the first time sales have exceeded 200m, with core operating profit percentage of 29% and in April 2018 the Company was promoted to FTSE 250 status.
In the light of this performance, the committee has supported the executive directors proposal to make a discretionary payment to all employees of 1,500 per employee in addition to the maximum profit share of 1,000 per employee as well as a discretionary bonus of up to 50% of 2017 18 salary to those employees who have contributed to the outstanding performance.
The executive directors only received a profit share payment of 250 in line with the shareholder approved policy.
In addition, the committee has approved a 5% pay rise for all employees excluding retail employees who have their own salary bandings from 1 June 2018 in order to align all jobs to market rates and to reward the great performance.
2017 18 - executive remuneration review project The board takes seriously its responsibilities in applying the principles of UK corporate governance and properly incentivising executive directors, and senior management generally, forms part of this area of focus.
As outlined in last years annual report, in light of the ongoing exceptional progress achieved by the Company, in 2017 18 the committee decided to review the executive remuneration policy to ensure that it was still fit for purpose and that the executive directors were being appropriately rewarded.
An external remuneration benchmarking exercise was carried out by PwC, the findings of which have led the committee to conclude that the total remuneration package of the executive directors is significantly behind the market in the context of the current size and operating performance of the Company.
The current remuneration policy, approved at the 2016 AGM, only allows for a maximum profit share payment of 250 per year per person, leaving the committee in a position whereby the only way to reward the executive directors for delivering exceptional performance is to increase base pay.
The committee does not feel this is appropriate or indeed sustainable over the long term.
The committee is therefore seeking to address this issue by amending the existing policy through: 1.
Introducing an exceptional bonus award: and 2.
Increasing the opportunity under the existing profit share scheme.
The introduction of an exceptional bonus award will enable the committee to reward the executive directors outstanding performance in a way that is directly aligned with shareholder interests.
The award will be delivered in cash and will be capped at 100% of salary.
The committee will require that the executive directors invest 50% of any bonus awards net of tax into shares in the Company, which it would expect to be held for a minimum of two years.
The committee is also proposing some changes to the general employee profit share scheme which, by extension, applies to the executive directors.
In particular, the maximum opportunity will increase from 250 to 1,000 in order to recognise and more meaningfully reward the contributions of the wider employee population to the Companys performance.
In addition, to recognise the exceptional performance achieved this year and in recent years, the committee is proposing to make an exceptional bonus award for 2017 18 equal to 100% of salary to the executive directors.
As this payment is not covered by the current remuneration policy, this will be subject to a separate binding shareholder approval at the 2018 AGM.
22 Games Workshop Group PLC 2017 18 - executive remuneration review project continued In considering the proposed changes to the remuneration policy, a consultation exercise was held in May 2018 during which both the nonexecutive chairman and I met with a number of shareholders to discuss the proposals in detail.
The committee has taken account of the feedback received from shareholders as part of this exercise in setting the proposed policy presented in this report.
In addition, following the external benchmarking of the executive directors salaries and non-executive directors fees and in the interests of maintaining market position, the committee has resolved to increase the annual salary of K D Rountree from 410,000 to 525,000, the annual salary of R F Tongue from 250,000 to 300,000 and the fees of N J Donaldson from 120,000 to 140,000 with effect from 1 June 2018.
The committee believes that by introducing the exceptional bonus award and by adjusting base salaries, it is able to appropriately reward the executive directors for the outstanding performance delivered this year and in future years if appropriate.
The committee next proposes to review the base salaries payable to the directors at or about the end of the 2018 19 financial year.
In conducting such reviews, the committee seeks to take into account, among other factors, corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues.
2018 19 the year ahead The committee and the boards philosophy to pay and reward remains the same: we believe that the main focus of the remuneration policy should be on the fixed elements of pay.
The committee is very mindful of the risks of incentive plans and complex bonus schemes driving short term and or individual behaviours which are not in the interests of the Company and its shareholders.
As such, the committee has no intention of introducing any form of longer term incentive.
As a board we have high performance expectations and the executive directors are even more demanding of themselves and their teams.
Consequently, due to the stretching nature of underlying financial and or operational performance targets for the exceptional bonus award, the committee does not necessarily anticipate that awards will be made under the exceptional bonus award every year.
However, the amended policy will allow the committee the flexibility to make awards to the executive directors in years where performance has been judged to be truly exceptional, which we will fully describe to shareholders in future remuneration reports.
The profit share scheme has also been amended in that the amount of profit share each employee may receive is based on the operating profit percentage of the Group.
The maximum potential value will be 1,000 per person per year.
This scheme will also continue to apply to the executive directors.
In the last few years in managing executive succession, the committee has been very aware of the importance to the Company and its shareholders of the successful transfer of power and responsibility to the new executive team.
When T H F Kirby stepped down at the 2017 AGM, he was retained as a consultant to the Company, principally to support K D Rountree.
This consultancy agreement comes to an end at the 2018 AGM.
In 2017 18 T H F Kirby will have been paid 171,000 in consultancy fees and 69,000 in the period to September 2018.
The committee would like to thank T H F Kirby sincerely for all of his support.
Looking to the future, the committee will continue to monitor the consistency of the remuneration policy across the Group with a view to ensuring that an appropriate reward structure exists to recognise and retain the Groups top talent.
As part of this process the committee will continue to keep under review and discuss regularly the effectiveness of the Companys approach to remuneration and its component parts.
E ODonnell Chairman Remuneration and nomination committee 30 July 2018 Policy report This part of the report sets out the proposed directors remuneration policy, which will apply for three years from the date of 2018 AGM if approved by shareholders.
The current remuneration policy has applied since the AGM held on 14 September 2016 when it was approved by shareholders.
As set out in the chairmans introduction, the committee is proposing a small number of amendments to the existing policy to enable the Company to reward the executive directors for their outstanding performance this year and in future years, and achieve greater market alignment.
The proposed remuneration policy will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM.
The aim of the Groups remuneration policy is to reward fairly and to attract, motivate and retain high quality management.
The total size of the remuneration package for executive directors is judged by comparison with the remuneration packages of similar companies, having regard to: the size of the company, its turnover, profits and number of people employed the diversity and complexity of the business the geographical spread of the business the growth and expansion profile The Companys non-executive directors are remunerated with fees in line with market rates.
They do not receive any pension or other benefits, other than the reimbursement of reasonable expenses, and they do not participate in any bonus or share schemes.
23 Games Workshop Group PLC REMUNERATION REPORT continued Remuneration policy table The table below summarises each of the components of the remuneration package for directors of the Company which comprise the policy.

Non-executive directors are entitled to claim reasonable out of pocket expenses in connection with the performance of their duties.
Changes to the remuneration policy There are no proposed changes to the salary, benefits or pension elements of remuneration.
The profit share element is changing the performance metrics from being based on growth in sales revenue with a maximum potential pay out of 250 per person to being based on core business operating profit percentage and a maximum pay out of 1,000 per person.
This is to enable more meaningful and incentivising pay outs.
The exceptional bonus award was not included in the existing remuneration policy.
This will now be included and will based on performance measured against stretching financial and operational targets.
The maximum bonus opportunity will be 100% of salary.
The bonus will be payable in cash with the expectation that 50% of any bonus net of tax will be invested in the Companys shares for not less than two years.
This change is proposed in order to enable the executive directors to be rewarded for continued exceptional performance above and beyond the stretching targets: the objective is to increase alignment between directors and shareholders and with wider market practice.
In addition, as part of the bonus will be invested in shares, this aligns with market best practice and encourages performance is sustained over the longer term.
Explanation of the performance metrics chosen The performance measures selected are aligned with the Companys strategy and business objectives.
The profit share is based on core business operating profit percentage.

Where remuneration is not determined by statutory regulation, the Company operates the same core principles as it does for the executive directors, namely: to remunerate people in a manner that allows for stability of the business and the opportunity for sustainable long-term growth to seek to remunerate fairly and consistently for each role with due regard to the market place and internal consistency to apply the profit share equally to all employees, including the executive directors to encourage employees to own shares through the operation of the sharesave scheme As is common practice, the Company is proposing to introduce elements of variable pay through an exceptional bonus award which will be focused on the executive directors to ensure that the overall remuneration policy remains market competitive.
Remuneration policy for new directors When setting the remuneration package for a new executive director, the committee would seek to apply the same principles and implement the policy framework as set out above.
Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the experience of the director being appointed.
Benefits, pension, profit share and the exceptional bonus award will be in line with the stated policy.
Any buy-out award, should one be required, would be limited to the amount of salary that would be forgone.
Non-executive director fees will be set at a competitive market level, reflecting the skills, knowledge, experience, responsibilities and time commitment.

Non-executive director appointments are made through letters of appointment for a one year term, subject to election and reelection by the Companys shareholders in accordance with the Companys articles and the Code.
The letters of appointment may be inspected at the Companys registered office.
Policy on payment for loss of office If an executive directors employment is to be terminated, the committees policy in respect of the service agreement in the absence of a breach of the service agreement by the director is to agree a termination payment based on the value of base salary and contractual pension and other benefits that would have accrued to the director during the contractual notice period.
Depending on the particular circumstances, a director may work the notice period, be placed on garden leave for some or all of the notice period or receive a payment in lieu of notice in accordance with the service agreement.
The committee will consider mitigation to reduce the termination payment to a leaving director when appropriate to do so, having regard to the specific circumstances.
Non-executive directors appointments may be terminated without compensation but with six months notice.
External appointments The executive directors may each accept one external appointment with the prior approval of the board, from which any fees may be retained.
At present, neither of the executive directors holds any outside directorship.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Group aims to provide a remuneration package to all employees that is market competitive, complies with any statutory requirements and is applied fairly and equitably across the employee population, taking into account local employment market conditions.
The committee takes into account the general basic salary increase being offered to employees elsewhere in the Group when annually reviewing the salary increase and remuneration of the executive directors.
Employees are not consulted in respect of board remuneration.
Consideration of shareholder views The committee takes into account shareholder feedback received on remuneration matters, including comments in relation to the AGM in addition to any additional comments in correspondence direct with the Company.
The committee would seek to engage directly with major shareholders should any material changes be made to the policy.
In considering the proposed changes to the remuneration policy, a consultation exercise was held in May 2018 during which both the non-executive chairman and the chairman of the remuneration and nomination committee met with a number of shareholders to discuss the proposals in detail.
The committee has taken account the feedback received from shareholders as part of this exercise in setting the proposed policy presented in this report.

This reviewed the salaries of the executive and non-executive directors in order to assess how they compared with prevailing market levels of remuneration.
The following salaries fees will apply from 1 June 2018 From 1 June 2018 K D Rountree 525,000 R F Tongue 300,000 N J Donaldson 140,000 The remuneration policy for the non-executive directors is determined by the board and is reviewed every year.

The nonexecutive directors do not participate in the Groups sharesave scheme or profit share scheme nor do they receive any benefits or pension contributions.
Profit share The maximum profit share that is payable is 1,000 per person per year.
The performance targets are based upon operating profit percentage growth from the prior year.
Exceptional bonus award The maximum exceptional bonus award is up to 100% of salary per person per year.
The performance targets are at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
The committee is of the opinion that disclosing detailed performance targets in advance would not be in shareholder interests for reasons of commercial sensitivity.
A discussion of performance attributable to any future awards will be included in the annual report on remuneration for that year, so that shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay outs.
Sharesave A further award of options will be made under the new sharesave scheme during the year which is on the same basis as previous years.
Pension Executive directors will continue to receive up to 7.5% of salary subject to a maximum of 10,000 per annum and the tapering restrictions set out in the remuneration policy Remuneration and nomination committee The committee is appointed by the board and comprises E ODonnell chairman, C J Myatt, N J Donaldson and J R A Brewis.
The committee is responsible for setting the remuneration packages of the executive directors as well as approving their service contracts.
The terms of reference are available on the Companys investor relations website.
Advisers As referred to above, in 2018 the committee was assisted in its work by PwC which was appointed by the Company in consultation with the committee.
The committee assessed whether PwC was independent in the provision of its remuneration advice and concluded that it was independent.
The amount paid to PwC during the 2017 18 year for its advice was 15,000 2017: nil.
