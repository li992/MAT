86 DIAGEO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Directors remuneration report Salary Salary increases to be applied in the year ending 30 June 2019 As outlined in the 2017 annual report on remuneration, base salaries for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer were increased by 2%, effective from 1 October 2017.
In June 2018, the Remuneration Committee reviewed base salaries for senior management and agreed new salaries which will apply from 1 October 2018.
In determining these salaries, the Remuneration Committee took into consideration a number of factors including general employee salary budgets and employment conditions, individual performance and experience, and salary positioning relative to internal and external peers.
The overall budgeted salary increase for the salary review in October 2018 is 3% of base salary for employees in the United Kingdom and 3% in North America.
The Committee considered very carefully the total remuneration positioning of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, the salary budget for all employees in the United Kingdom and the expectations of shareholders with respect to continuing pay restraint.
As a result, it was agreed that there would be a 2% salary increase for both the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer, effective from 1 October 2018.
Ivan Menezes Kathryn Mikells Salary at 1 October 000 2018 2017 2018 2017 Base salary $1,613 $1,581 $1,061 $1,040 % increase over previous year 2% 2% 2% 2% AIP design for the year ending 30 June 2019 The measures and targets used in the AIP are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are chosen to drive financial and individual business performance goals related to the companys short term strategic operational objectives.
The AIP design for Executive Directors in the year ending 30 June 2019 will comprise of the following performance measures and weightings: Operating profit % growth 26.67% weighting : stretching profit targets drive operational efficiency and influence the level of returns that can be delivered to shareholders through increases in share price and dividend income not including exceptional items or exchange: Net sales % growth 26.67% weighting : a key performance measure of year-on-year top line growth: Average working capital as a proportion of net sales 26.67% weighting : ensures focus on working capital management throughout the year and incentivises sustainable actions that are beneficial for the business in the long term: Individual business objectives 20% weighting : measurable deliverables that are specific to the individual and are focused on supporting the delivery of key strategic objectives.
This is the same structure as applied in the year ended 30 June 2018, except that the weightings across the financial measures have been equalised to ensure an appropriate focus on both profit and loss and balance sheet measures.
Details of the targets for the year ending 30 June 2019 will be disclosed retrospectively in next years annual report on remuneration, by which time they will no longer be deemed commercially sensitive by the Board.
DLTIP awards to be made in the year ending 30 June 2019 The long-term incentive plan measures are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are selected to reward long-term consistent performance in line with Diageos business strategy and to create alignment with the delivery of value for shareholders.
The Committee has ensured that the incentive structure for senior management does not raise environmental, social and governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
As last year, DLTIP awards made in September 2018 will comprise awards of both performance shares and share options, based on stretching targets against key performance measures as outlined in the table below.
The performance share element of the DLTIP applies to the Executive Committee and the top cadre of Senior Leaders across the organisation worldwide, whilst the share option element is applicable to a much smaller population comprising only members of the Executive Committee.
One market price option is valued at one-third of a performance share.
The table below outlines the targets and the vesting profile for these awards to the Executive Directors and the relative weightings of each performance measure as a percentage of the total award in performance share equivalents.
Performance will be tested over three financial years, beginning with the year ending 30 June 2019.
