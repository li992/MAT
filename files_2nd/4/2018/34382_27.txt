78 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2018 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT: ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION How we intend to apply our Remuneration Policy during the year commencing 1 April 2018 The following pages set out how the Committee intends to apply the Remuneration Policy during the coming year.
Executive Directors remuneration Basic salaries Basic salaries for our current Directors have been set at the following levels for the year commencing 1 April 2018.
Basic salary Director Chris Grigg 856,800 Charles Maudsley 455,175 Tim Roberts 455,175 Simon Carter from 21 May 2018 485,000 Annual Incentive awards The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors remains at 150% of salary.
The performance measures for the Annual Incentive awards have been selected to reflect a range of quantitative and qualitative goals that support the Companys key strategic objectives.
The performance measures and weightings for the year commencing 1 April 2018 will be as follows: Proportion of Annual Incentive as a percentage Measure of maximum opportunity Quantitative measures 70% Total Property Return relative to IPD sector reweighted 42% Profit growth relative to budget 28% Qualitative measures 20% Right Places Progress on key projects including developments 5% Customer Orientation Company reputation with all stakeholders 5% Capital Efficiency Execution of targeted acquisitions and disposals 5% Progress on strengthening the dividend Expert People Promoting an inclusive, performance driven culture 5% Individual objectives Performance against individual success factors 10% The Committee has set targets for the quantitative measures for the coming year and will disclose these in the 2019 Remuneration Report as they are felt to be commercially sensitive.
In assessing how the Executive Directors performed during the year commencing 1 April 2018, the Committee will take into account their performance against all of the measures and make an assessment in the round to ensure that performance warrants the level of award determined by the table above.
As disclosed in 2017, the Committee agreed that for Annual Incentive awards, the sector weighted IPD March Annual Universe benchmark which includes sales, acquisitions and developments and so takes into account active asset management as well as a more representative peer group would be most suitable.
However, due to timing of publication of the March Universe benchmark, the Companys actual performance against IPD metrics is unlikely to be known when the 2019 Annual Report is approved by the Board.
The 2019 Remuneration Report will therefore include an estimate of the vesting value of Annual Incentive awards for that financial year, with the actual awards, based on the final IPD March Annual Universe Data, set out in the following Annual Report for the year ending 31 March 2020.
British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2018 79 Governance DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT: ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED Long term incentive awards An LTIP award will be made to Executive Directors during the year commencing 1 April 2018.
It is anticipated that the grant size of LTIP awards will be 250% of salary for each Executive Director.
This continues to be below the maximum available under the policy of 300% ofsalary approved by shareholders in July 2016.
The performance measures that apply to this LTIP award will be as follows: Measure Link to strategy Measured relative to Weighting Total Property Return TPR The TPR measure is designed TPR performance will be assessed against the 40% The change in capital value, less tolink reward to strong performance of an IPD benchmark.

Performance against the LTIP measures will be assessed over a period of three years.

If performance against a measure is equal to the median, 20% of the proportion attached to that measure will vest and if performance is below median the proportion attached to thatmeasure will lapse.
There will be straight-line vesting between median and upper quartile performance for each measure.
For the TPR award, 20% of the award will vest for matching a sector weighted IPD index reflecting the Companys property assets.
There will be straight-line vesting between this index performance and the higher of 1.1x the index performance and 100 basis points per annum outperformance.
The Committee retains the discretion to reduce the formulaic vesting amount if it feels that there is a material inconsistency between the level of reward and relative performance delivered.
Non-Executive Directors fees Fees paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are positioned around the mid-market of our comparator group of companies FTSE100 companies with broadly similar market capitalisations to British Land with the aim of attracting individuals with the appropriate degree of expertise and experience.
The fee structure set out below was adopted at the 2016 AGM and incorporates a 2.5% increase to the annual fee for the Non-Executive Directors and a 4.2% increase to the Chairmans fee for the year commencing 1 April 2018.

The Committee determined that the level of award would be 7.5% of basic salary for each Executive Director with Chris Grigg receiving an additional 2.17% reflecting his strong individual performance, Tim Roberts receiving an additional 1.5% reflecting his personal performance and that of the Office business and Lucinda Bell receiving an additional 1.22% in line with her remuneration terms on leaving.
82 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Long term incentives The information in the long term incentives column in the single total figure of remuneration table see page 81 relates to vesting of awards granted under the following schemes, including, where applicable, dividend equivalent payments on those awards and interest accrued on those dividend equivalents.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The awards granted to Executive Directors on 22 June 2015, and which will vest on 22 June 2018, were subject to two equally weighted performance conditions over the three-year period to 31 March 2018.
The first measured British Lands TPR relative to the funds in the December IPD UK Annual Property Index the Index, while the second measured TAR relative to a comparator group of British Land and 16 or so other property companies.
The TPR element is expected to lapse, based on British Lands adjusted TPR of 7% when compared to the funds in the Index.
The TAR element is also expected to lapse based on British Lands TAR of 27%.
The actual vesting rate of the TPR and TAR elements can only be calculated once results have been published by IPD and all the companies within the comparator group respectively.
The actual percentage vesting will be confirmed by the Committee in due course and details provided in the 2019 Remuneration Report.

Matching Share Plan The performance conditions for the MSP Matching awards granted on 29 June 2015 were i TSR relative to a comparator group of British Land and 16 other property companies and ii British Lands gross income growth GIG relative to the IPD Quarterly Universe the Universe.
These performance conditions are equally weighted.
The MSP Matching awards will vest on 29 June 2018.
Korn Ferry Hay Group Limited Korn Ferry has confirmed that the TSR element of the award will vest at 0% as British Lands TSR performance over the period was -9.8% compared to a median of 40.6% for the comparator group.
The GIG element is expected to vest at 100% as British Lands annualised GIG over the period of 4.7% is expected to exceed the expected growth of the Universe by more than the upper hurdle.
As a result, 50% of the MSP Matching awards granted in June 2015 are expected to vest.
As disclosed for the 2015 LTIP above, the actual percentage vesting will be confirmed by the Committee and details provided in the 2019 Remuneration Report.

The long term incentives figures in the 2017 comparatives of the single total figure of remuneration table have therefore been updated to reflect the actual share price on vesting 601.10 pence rather than the average for the 90-day period used in the 2017 Annual Report of 608.078 pence.
British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2018 83 Governance DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT: ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED Share scheme interests awarded during the year audited Long-Term Incentive Plan The total value of each Executive Directors LTIP award for the year ended 31 March 2018 was equivalent to 250% of basic salary at grant.
At grant each Director is able to indicate a preference as to the proportion of the award that they wish to receive as either performance shares or market value options.
The share price used to determine the face value of performance shares and the fair value of options, andthereby the number of performance shares or options awarded, is the average over the three dealing days immediately prior to the dayofaward.
For the award granted in June 2017, no Executive Director elected to receive market value options and the share price for determining the number of performance shares awarded was 617.167 pence.
The performance conditions attached to these awardsare set out in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in July 2016 and summarised on page 80.

Lucinda remained a member of the SIP until her departure from British Land on 4 April 2018.
Under the Rules of the SIP, Lucinda received matching shares in February and March 2018 with a total value of 603.
In addition, Lucinda will receive an additional 80,350 in relation to the Annual Incentive awards for the year ended 31 March 2018 which related to the period after she had stepped down from the Board.
A contribution of 10,000 plus VAT was also made to Lucindas legal fees.
Payments to Lucinda Bell on leaving British Land audited After over 25 years at British Land, Lucinda Bell informed the Board in October 2017 of her intention to stand down from the Board and to leave the Company.
Following the completion of the search for a replacement Chief Financial Officer, Lucinda Bell stood down from the Board on 19 January 2018 and left British Land as planned on 4 April 2018.
Lucindas remuneration terms on leaving were in line with the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
Lucinda received her salary and employment benefits in full to the date of her departure and will receive payments in lieu of notice for the remainder of her 12-month notice period to 4 October 2018.
The maximum amount payable for this period comprises base salary of 246,500, car allowance of 8,350, pension contributions allowance of 52,500 and the value of other benefits of 2,546.
These payments may be reduced by the value of any alternative paid employment secured during this period.
As mentioned in the Committee Chairmans letter on page 76, Lucinda is eligible for an annual bonus for the 2017 18 financial year, subject to the satisfaction of a combination of corporate and personal objectives.
In line with the Remuneration Policy, two-thirds ofanyannual bonus will be paid in cash and one-third will be used to purchase British Land shares which must be held for a further periodofthree years.
Lucinda ceased to participate in the Companys all-employee employee share plans on departure and any unvested Sharesave awards lapsed at that time.
Lucindas vested executive share awards remain exercisable until 4 October 2018.
The Committee determined that Lucinda be treated as a good leaver under the Companys executive share plans.
Consequently, awards including any dividend equivalents will continue to vest on the normal vesting dates subject to the extent to which the applicable performance criteria have been met and where relevant any time pro-rating reduction applied.
The vesting levels of these awards will be confirmed in the Annual Reports for 2019 and 2020 respectively.
