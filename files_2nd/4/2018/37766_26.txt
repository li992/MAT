Our remuneration structure Melroses philosophy is that executive remuneration should be simple and transparent, support the delivery of the value creation strategy and pay only for performance.
This philosophy is reflected in our remuneration structure that restricts the opportunity in annual salary and bonus, and weights potential reward to the variable long-term incentive plan based entirely on performance.
The Committee feels strongly that rewards should be linked to generation and delivery of real returns to shareholders.
The Companys long-term incentive arrangements have applied since Melrose was floated in 2003 and have been regularly renewed with shareholder approval since then.
Consistent with Melroses remuneration principles, they are intended to align managements incentive arrangements directly with the interests of shareholders by linking remuneration specifically to shareholder value.

David Lis Shareholder engagement Chairman, Remuneration Committee We remain committed to maintaining an open and transparent 7 March 2019 engagement with our investors.
We believe that a key objective of the Annual Report on Remuneration is to communicate clearly to shareholders how our Directors Remuneration Policy is operating in practice and to demonstrate how our executive remuneration is clearly linked to the Companys performance.
We are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with investors and corporate governance advisory agencies in order to better understand their views on Melroses approach to executive remuneration.
Specifically, during 2018, the Company conducted a formal engagement with key shareholders and corporate governance advisory agencies in respect of feedback received at the 2018 AGM and the vote on the 2017 Directors Remuneration Report.
We listen to our shareholders and the clarifications to the implementation of the Directors Remuneration Policy that we are making in 2019 see pages 104 to 107 have been influenced by this dialogue.
Furthermore, following feedback from the shareholder engagement, advice is being sought on potential changes to the long-term incentive arrangements at the next proposed renewal in 2020.
Annual Report 2018 Melrose Industries PLC 95 Directors Remuneration report Continued Annual Report on Remuneration In this section, we set out: the actual performance and executive remuneration outcomes for the 2018 financial year: the application of the Directors Remuneration Policy to the 2018 financial year, how the Directors Remuneration Policy was operated in 2018 and the proposed alterations to how it is to be applied from 1 January 2019 onwards: and the link between our strategy for 2019 and the Directors Remuneration Policy.
The Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders on 11 May 2017 with over 80% of votes cast in favour of the resolution, a level of support which was also reflected in the approval of the 2017 Incentive Plan.
The following table sets out the key elements of the Annual Report on Remuneration and where to find them.

The values included in the above table are calculated in accordance with the applicable regulations.
The 2017 Incentive Plan is a five-year plan in total comprised of a three-year performance period and a two-year holding period and, accordingly, no value was vested to participants in respect of the year to 31 December 2018.
2 All of the amounts attributable to pension contributions were paid as supplements to base salary in lieu of pension arrangements.
3 Appointed as Chairman of the Board with effect from 1 January 2019.
Base Salary Salaries are fixed at a level which is considered low in comparison to peers.
Each executive Director received an increase in base salary of approximately 3% effective from 1 January 2018.
Benefits The range of benefits provided to executive Directors, including a pension contribution equal to 15% of base salary which the Committee notes is materially below the lower quartile of pension contributions in the FTSE 100 of 20%, has not changed since the inception of Melrose and there is no intention to widen the range of benefits Directors may receive.
All of the executive Directors received certain benefits during 2018, being a company car allowance, fuel allowance, private medical insurance, life insurance and group income protection.
Geoffrey Martin also received paid train travel to and from London.
No executive Director participates in, or has ever participated in, a Group defined benefit or final salary pension scheme.
96 Melrose Industries PLC Annual Report 2018 Governance 2018 Annual Bonus audited The maximum bonus opportunity is capped at 100% of base salary, which is significantly below the maximum lower quartile annual bonus opportunity for other FTSE 100 companies, reflecting the participation of the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director in the 2017 Incentive Plan.
Following the application of the formulaic basis used in previous years and as explained below, it was determined by the Committee that Simon Peckham and Geoffrey Martin being the only executive Directors participating in the annual bonus plan should be awarded a bonus of 95% of base salary.

98 Melrose Industries PLC Annual Report 2018 Governance Remuneration Philosophy Melroses remuneration philosophy is that executive remuneration should be simple and transparent, support the delivery of the value creation strategy and pay only for performance.
This philosophy is reflected in our remuneration structure, whereby: the base salary, benefits and annual bonus of the executive Directors are positioned below the lower quartile maximum opportunity for FTSE 100 companies: and long-term incentive remuneration is intended to directly align the executive Directors remuneration with that of shareholders by connecting remuneration specifically to the creation of shareholder value and with any award typically being granted in shares, not cash.
The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that this simple and transparent incentive framework is aligned with the Companys strategy for creation of shareholder value.
To help illustrate the application of this philosophy, we have set out below a series of tables that clearly demonstrate the alignment between the executive Directors and our shareholders.
Illustration and application of the Directors Remuneration Policy in 2018 The charts set out below are updated versions of charts which appeared in the Directors Remuneration Policy shareholder circular approved in May 2017.
These set out an illustration of the Directors Remuneration Policy compared to the actual executive Director remuneration paid in 2018.
The executive Directors options under the 2017 Incentive Plan will deliver to them part of the growth in value of the Company from May 2017 to May 2020 or an earlier trigger date determined in accordance with the Articles.
Accordingly, the value of participation in the 2017 Incentive Plan was not expressed as a multiple of salary but on a valuation done at the time of the renewal of the incentive plan in 2017 see shareholder circular dated 7 April 2017 available at www.
Base salary effective from 1 January 2018, and benefits and pension rate as set out in the single figure table for the year ended 31December 2018 on page 96.
On-Target: fixed elements of remuneration as above, plus a bonus of 50% of salary other than in the case of Christopher Miller and David Roper, who do not participate in the annual bonus arrangements, plus an amount in relation to the executive Directors entitlements under the 2017 Incentive Plan, being 50% of the fair value of the award, calculated as set out above.
High-performance: fixed elements of remuneration as above, plus a bonus of 100% of salary other than in the case of Christopher Miller and David Roper who do not participate in the annual bonus arrangements, plus an amount in relation to the executive Directors entitlements under the 2017 Incentive Plan, being 100% of the fair value of the award, calculated as set out above.
Annual Report 2018 Melrose Industries PLC 99 Directors Remuneration report Continued Comparison to Peers The following chart shows the relative position of base salary and total compensation for our executive Directors in 2018 compared to the FTSE 100 in 2018.
The charts demonstrate the Remuneration Committees policy of providing conservative salary, benefits and annual bonus to the executive Directors, with heavily-weighted variable incentives in the form of the 2017 Incentive Plan, which ensures that the executive Directors only receive very substantial rewards when they have outperformed and created very significant value for shareholders.
The chart below includes the actual salary, benefits and annual bonus awarded to the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director in 2018.
Although no value accrued to the executive Directors under the 2017 Incentive Plan during 2018, for comparison purposes only, we have included in the LTIP element of total remuneration in the chart below an amount equivalent to the annualised award from the crystalisation of the 2012 Incentive Plan.
This is the total award under the 2012 Incentive Scheme in 2017 as set out on page 98, divided by the five year performance period, which equates to 8.354 million per year for the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.

3 For these purposes, the value of a share is 163.85 pence, being the closing mid-market price on 31 December 2018, the last business day of the 2018 financial year.
4 As at 31 December 2018, the interest of Christopher Miller included 8,750,000 ordinary shares held by Harris & Sheldon Investments Limited, a company which is connected with Christopher Miller within the meaning of section 252 of the Act.
5 An additional amount of 10,386 options over Incentive Shares 2017 is expected to be allocated on 8 March 2019 to the executive Directors as follows: Christopher Miller will be granted 2,584 options, David Roper will be granted 2,584 options, Simon Peckham will be granted 2,834 options and Geoffrey Martin will be granted 2,834 options.
6 Each executive Director was granted options over Incentive Shares 2017 on 31 May 2017: Christopher Miller was granted 2,583 options, David Roper was granted 2,583 options, Simon Peckham was granted 2,833 options and Geoffrey Martin was granted 2,833 options.
Each executive Director exercised his options on 29 June 2017 and 2,583 Incentive Shares 2017 each were issued to Christopher Miller and David Roper and 2,833 Incentive Shares 2017 each were issued to Simon Peckham and Geoffrey Martin.
In addition, each executive Director was granted options over Incentive Shares 2017 on 7 June 2018: Christopher Miller was granted 2,583 options, David Roper was granted 2,583 options, Simon Peckham was granted 2,833 options and Geoffrey Martin was granted 2,833 options.
The value which may be derived from the Incentive Shares 2017 acquired on exercise will be determined on 31 May 2020, or any other earlier crystallisation date in accordance with the Incentive Plan 2017.
For accounting purposes, the IFRS 2 charge has been calculated as if all tranches have been granted on day one because of a common expectation, established at that date but subject to changes to take account of exceptional circumstances, between participants and the Company that the remaining options will be allocated annually in two more equal tranches over the three-year performance period.
100 Melrose Industries PLC Annual Report 2018 Governance As disclosed at the time of crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Plan, the executive Directors considered it appropriate that they, together with their immediate families, would hold at least half of the shares acquired pursuant to that crystallisation after satisfying tax obligations following the crystallisation of that plan and subject to capital adjustments for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Committee has adopted the minimum share retention guidelines outlined above in relation to the holding of ordinary shares by executive Directors who participated in the 2009 Incentive Plan and the Incentive Plan 2012 and who participate in the Incentive Plan 2017, reinforcing the executive Directors long-term stewardship of the Company and long-term investment in the Companys shares.
No executive Director may dispose of any ordinary shares without the consent of the Committee, which will not normally be withheld provided the executive Director will continue to hold at least the minimum number of ordinary shares referred to in the table above following any such disposal.
As at 31 December 2018, each executive Director held much more than the minimum number of ordinary shares and so satisfied the guidelines.
Internal Company rules on shareholdings are extended to senior management in addition to the executive Directors, in order that appropriate remuneration principles are applied to Melrose senior management on a similar basis to executive Directors.
There have been no changes in the shareholdings of the executive Directors between 31 December 2018 and 7 March 2019.

Annual Report 2018 Melrose Industries PLC 101 % of salary Directors Remuneration report Continued Overall Link to Remuneration, Equity and Wealth of the executive Directors It is the Remuneration Committees view that it is important when considering the remuneration paid in the year under the single figure to take a holistic view of how each executive Directors total wealth is linked to the performance of the Company.
In the Committees opinion, the impact on the total wealth of the executive Director is as important than the single figure in any one year: thisapproach encourages executive Directors to take a long-term view of the sustainable performance of the Company and aligns them with shareholders.
A key facet of the Directors Remuneration Policy is the ability for the executive Directors to gain and lose dependent on the share price performance of the Company at a level which is material to their total remuneration.
The following table sets out the single figure for 2018, the number of ordinary shares of the Company held by each executive Director at the end of the 2017 and 2018 financial years and the impact on the value of these ordinary shares taking the closing mid-market prices for those dates.
2 For these purposes, the value of a share is 163.85 pence, being the closing mid-market price on 31 December 2018, being the last business day of the 2018 financial year.
3 As at 31 December 2017, the interest of Christopher Miller included 8,750,000 ordinary shares held by Harris & Sheldon Investments Limited, a company which is connected with Christopher Miller within the meaning of section 252 of the Act.
Long-term Performance The following chart shows the single figure of remuneration for the Chief Executive over the last ten financial years compared to the Companys comparative FTSE 100 and absolute shareholder return.

This provides clarity to all stakeholders on the relationship between the successful implementation of the Companys strategy and the remuneration paid.
Simplicity The operation of the Annual Bonus Plan is linked to an earnings-based target 80% and the achievement of strategic factors 20%.
The 2017 Incentive Plan simply rewards the creation of shareholder value and has been awarded in shares, not cash.
In the Committees view, this provides a simple incentive framework which can be understood by all of the Companys stakeholders.
Risk The Directors Remuneration Policy includes the following: Setting defined limits on the maximum award which can be earned.
Requiring the deferral of a substantial proportion of the incentives in shares for a material period of time.
Aligning the performance conditions with the strategy of the Company.
Ensuring there is sufficient flexibility to adjust payments through malus and clawback and an overriding discretion to depart from formulaic outcomes.
These elements mitigate against the risk of target-based incentives by: Capping the maximum annual bonus to 100% of base salary.
The requirement to hold any ordinary shares arising from crystallisation of Incentive Shares 2017 for a period of two years post-crystallisation date and the ability to defer 50% of the annual bonus into shares where the minimum shareholding requirement is not met, which help ensure that the performance earning the award was sustainable and thereby discouraging short term behaviours.
Aligning any reward to the agreed strategy of the Company.
Reducing the award or cancelling it if the behaviours giving rise to the award are inappropriate or if it appears that the criteria on which the award was based do not reflect the underlying performance of the Company.
Predictability The Committee sets out the possible values on approval of the Companys incentive plan by shareholders.
In addition, the limits and discretions under the Directors Remuneration Policy were clearly set out on shareholder approval.
Proportionality The Annual Bonus Plan clearly rewards the successful implementation of the Companys strategy and the 2017 Incentive Plan ensures that the executive Directors have a strong drive to ensure that the performance is sustainable over the long-term.
Alignment to culture The focus on ownership and long term sustainable performance is a key part of the Companys culture.
This is supported by the Directors Remuneration Policy.
It should be noted that the Directors Remuneration Policy operated over the 2018 financial year as intended by the Committee.
The link between our strategy and the Directors Remuneration Policy The Companys Buy, Improve, Sell strategy, full details of which are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 3, is well formulated and known by our shareholders.
The Committee believes that the strategy is clearly linked to the Directors Remuneration Policy, which sets the base salary, benefits and annual bonus for the executive Directors low, but with a heavy weighting towards long-term incentives, which reward only for significant outperformance and where our shareholders also share in that success.
In particular: The executive Directors are wholly aligned with shareholders as substantial equity investors themselves see page 100 for further details, and are also required to defer their annual bonus payments if they do not meet the shareholding requirement of 200% of base salary and it is noted that all executive Directors meet and exceed this shareholding requirement.
Strategic metrics for use in calculating the strategic elements of the annual bonus are focused on the specific investments of the Company and its strategy.
Fixed remuneration for the executive Directors is set at the lower end of the market to limit fixed costs for the Group and to ensure desirable levels of profitability.
Management are incentivised to maximise returns for shareholders through the LTIP metrics, which entitle incentive shareholders to 7.5% of the increase in the index-adjusted value of the Company from and including May 2017 to May 2020 i. e. returns are only received for successful investment strategies and have been awarded in shares, not cash.
Annual Report 2018 Melrose Industries PLC 103 Directors Remuneration report Continued Operation of the Directors Remuneration Policy in 2018 and 2019 The Committee has taken into account feedback received from shareholders over the course of the year on the current Directors Remuneration Policy a copy of which can be found in the circular dated 7 April 2017, available at www.
pdf, and will be using such feedback to guide the Directors Remuneration Policy review ahead of the new Directors Remuneration Policy being put to shareholders in 2020.
For 2019, the Committee has made clarifications to the implementation of the Directors Remuneration Policy to ensure alignment with the new UK Corporate Governance Code, which takes effect for financial years on and from 1 January 2019, and to reflect shareholder feedback received during 2018.

The Committee has always been committed to ensuring that the Chief Executives reward is commensurate with performance.
The chart shows a clear alignment between shareholder returns and the Chief Executives single figure pay.

It is this element of his package which provides the volatility in his remuneration when comparing on a year-to-year basis.
The Committee is comfortable through the analysis set out above that the underlying picture is not one of a greater divergence of the ChiefExecutives remuneration from employees, i. e. excluding the volatility of the LTIP, the relationship is consistent.
There is likely to be significant volatility in this ratio year-on-year, and we believe that this is likely to be caused by the following factors: Our Chief Executives pay is made up of a higher proportion of incentive pay than that of our employees, in line with the expectations of our shareholders.
This introduces a higher degree of variability in his pay each year, which will affect the ratio.
The value of long-term incentives which measure performance over three years is disclosed in pay in the year it vests, which increases the Chief Executives pay in that year, again impacting the ratio for that year.
Long-term incentives are typically provided in shares, and therefore an increase in share price over the three years magnifies the impact of a long-term incentive award vesting in a year.
We recognise that the ratio is driven by the different structure of the pay of our Chief Executive versus that of our employees, as well as the make-up of our workforce.
This ratio varies between businesses even in the same sector.
What is important from our perspective is that this ratio is influenced only by the differences in structure, and not by divergence in fixed pay between the Chief Executive and the wider workforce.
Where the structure of remuneration is similar, as for the executive Directors and the Chief Executive, the ratio will be much more stable over time.
Total Shareholder Return The total shareholder return graph below shows the value as at 31 December 2018 of 100 invested in the Company in October2003, compared with 100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index, the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE All-Share Index.
The Committee considers the FTSE 100 Index, the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE All-Share Index to be appropriate indices for the year ended 31 December 2018 for the purposes of this comparison because of the comparable size of the companies which comprise the FTSE 100 Index and the FTSE 250 Index and the broad nature of companies which comprise the FTSE All-Share Index.
The data shown below assumes that all cash returns to shareholders made by the Company during this period are reinvested in ordinary shares.

This means that the full value of the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Plan on 11 April 2012 is shown for the year ended 31December2012 and that the full value of the 2012 Incentive Plan which crystallised in May 2017 is shown for 2017.
The value of each Incentive Plan was earned over a period of approximately five years.
Therefore, in the view of the Committee, inclusion of these values in respect of the years ended 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2017 does not give a fair representation of the Chief Executives yearly remuneration over each of the previous five years.
Therefore, a separate column has been added showing the total remuneration with the incentives averaged over the five-year periods during which they were earned the value used is based on their value on maturity.
No other long-term incentive plan vested in favour of any executive Director in any of the other years.
The amount of that value shown in respect of David Roper and Simon Peckham for the year ended 31 December 2012 reflects the proportion of that year for which each was the Chief Executive.

2 The value of the 2017 Incentive Shares will only be known upon the crystallisation date, which is 31 May 2020.
3 The value derived in 2017 from the 2012 Incentive Shares represents the Chief Executives share, determined in accordance with the terms of those shares, of the shareholder value created over a period of approximately five years.
This amount was paid in shares, not cash.
4 On the crystallisation in May 2017 of the 2012 Incentive Plan, participants as a whole were entitled to 7.5% of the increase in shareholder value from 22 March 2012 to 31 May 2017.
Because the value derived on the crystallisation of the Incentive Shares 2012 depended upon the shareholder value created over the relevant period, it is not possible to express the value derived as a percentage of the maximum opportunity.
5 In the year ending 31 December 2012, David Roper was Chief Executive for the period from 1 January 2012 until 9 May 2012 and Simon Peckham was Chief Executive for the period from 9 May 2012 onwards.
In the table above: i the Total remuneration figure shows, in respect of David Roper, his total remuneration in respect of his service in the period 1 January 2012 to 9 May 2012 and in respect of Simon Peckham his total remuneration in respect of his service in the period from 9 May 2012 to 31 December 2012.
Included in this figure for each of David Roper and Simon Peckham is the value of the long-term incentives vesting in the year, pro-rated to reflect the portion of the year for which he was Chief Executive: and ii the Total remuneration including average long-term incentive value shows in respect of each of David Roper and Simon Peckham total remuneration in respect of the period for which he was Chief Executive excluding any value received on the maturity in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Plan.
6 The value derived in 2012 from the 2009 Incentive Shares represents the Chief Executives share, determined in accordance with the terms of those shares, of the shareholder value created over a period of approximately five years.
7 On the crystallisation in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Plan awarded in 2009, participants as a whole were entitled to 10% of the increase in shareholder value from 18 July 2007 to 23 March 2012.
Because the value derived on the crystallisation of the 2009 incentive shares depended upon the shareholder value created over the relevant period, it is not possible to express the value derived as a percentage of the maximum opportunity.
The crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Shares was satisfied by the conversion of those shares into ordinary shares.
