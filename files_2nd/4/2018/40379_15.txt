DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT ANNUAL STATEMENT Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to provide an introduction to the Remuneration Committee Report which appears in full on pages 50 to 72.
The Committee continues to believe that remuneration packages should be simple, competitive, align the interests of management with those of external shareholders, and both incentivise and reward superior longterm performance in a highly transparent manner.
As set out in last years report, the first awards under the new long-term incentive plan LTIP 2016 approved by shareholders in 2016 were made to the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer in April 2017, further details of which are included in this report.
No further awards under the LTIP 2016 were made to the executive directors during the year.
Executive directors salaries are reviewed annually.
During the year covered by this Report, the Executive Chairman received an increase of 2% on his salary to 440,262: this was in line with the Companys average cost of living increase.
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer received increases to their salaries of 13.3% and 16.2% respectively to 530,000 each for the period.
Whilst these increases were higher than the Companys average level of increase, the Committee concluded that they were fully justified by reference to the relevant competitor benchmarks, the strong performance of both the Company and the individuals, and the absence of any bonus element in their remuneration structure.
For the year to 31 March 2019, the Executive Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer will receive increases on their salaries to 452,369, 554,575 and 554,575 respectively: the underlying increases are in line with the Companys average cost of living increase for all employees of 2.75%, and in the case of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer also reflect an increase of 10,000 each to compensate for reductions to their pension contributions by the Company from 20,000 per annum to 10,000.
The Committee continues to believe that the provision of competitive base salaries together with market price equity incentives including the awards made under the new LTIP 2016, are the best way to ensure a clear alignment of interest between management and other shareholders, combined with the longterm retention and motivation of the individuals involved.
Nonetheless, the Committee acknowledges the significant number of votes against the approval of the Remuneration Committee Report at the last AGM and, as described later in this report, intends to further discuss the position with shareholders in due course.
In conclusion, I would like to thank shareholders for their continued engagement on remuneration matters during the year.
Andrew Blowers Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 18 June 2018 50 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements REMUNERATION POLICY REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding the policy relating to the total remuneration paid to the executive directors and members of senior management of the Company.
It meets regularly to review and set all elements of the remuneration paid to the executive directors of the Company, including pension rights, and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for other senior management of the Company.
It also exercises all the powers of the Board in relation to the operation of the Companys share incentive schemes, including the grant of options and the terms of those grants.
The Committee met formally four times during the year and details of attendance at these meetings are provided in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 40.
The Committees principal activities during the year included: reviewing and approving executive director remuneration packages: monitoring senior management remuneration packages: reviewing and approving the issue of share options to certain employees and Partners of the Company: and reviewing and approving the award of growth shares under the LTIP 2016 to the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer and certain other employees.
REMUNERATION POLICY INTRODUCTION The Companys overall remuneration policy remains to ensure that the executive directors and other senior managers are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their individual contribution to the overall long-term performance of the Company, in a manner that ensures that the Company is able to attract, motivate, and retain executives of the quality necessary to ensure the successful management of the Company.
The Companys remuneration policy will continue to be based on the principle that the fortunes of the directors and senior management should be directly aligned with those of external shareholders.
The Committee believes this is best achieved by using share-based incentives granted at market value, and that issuing growth shares under LTIP 2016 provides a far more transparent method of directly aligning each directors interests with all shareholders compared with paying annual cash bonuses linked to short medium term performance measures.
In view of the weight placed by the company on long term performance as part of its remuneration structure, the Committee continues to believe it is more appropriate to grant meaningful share awards in blocks with phased vesting over the medium long term, rather than using a phased approach to granting them as set out in the Corporate Governance Code.
The remuneration policy described in this part of the report was prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 8 of the Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended in August 2013.
The policy was duly approved by the Companys shareholders at the AGM on 22 July 2016 and is intended to apply for the three years beginning on that date.
The Committee will continue to review the policy annually to ensure it remains appropriate for the Companys requirements and consistent with market practice.

Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 57 REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED CHOICE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES The Committee chose the performance measures described in the table above as these are deemed to align directly the executive directors interests with those of all shareholders in an easily understood and transparent manner.
Share Incentive Schemes excluding LTIP 2016 The performance measures comprise a combination of relative total shareholder return TSR, Adjusted EPS excluding share incentive scheme charges and amortisation of intangible assets and service number growth measures.
Adjusted EPS is considered appropriate as a key strategic objective of the Company if it is to drive profitable growth in each year.
It also provides a balance to relative TSR, which considers shareholder value creation and reflects market expectations of future performance, and absolute service number growth which, when achieved responsibly, will also drive long-term value creation.
The use of relative TSR and Adjusted EPS growth measures provides a combined focus on the Companys financial performance and shareholder value creation.
Targets for Adjusted EPS are set by reference to internal budgeting plans and external market expectations.
TSR targets are set on a standard practice, median to upper quartile ranking range.
Only 30% of share incentive awards vest for threshold levels of performance.
The Committee wishes to retain the ability to change the composition of performance conditions for future grants to directors should this be required in order to reflect appropriately the strategic responsibilities of the particular director concerned.
LTIP 2016 The Committee has chosen growth in the Companys share price as the primary measure for LTIP 2016 because it directly links the rewards received by participants with the value that has been created for shareholders.
However, the Committee recognises that share price is not in the control of senior management, and periods of stock market volatility may coincide with the dates on which growth shares issued under the plan are due to vest.
An alternative stretching growth metric of adjusted earnings per share for the purposes of determining the number of ordinary shares in the Company received by participants on each vesting date has therefore been included at the discretion of the Committee.
58 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY The bar chart below seeks to illustrate the potential rewards available under the proposed remuneration policy for the coming financial year under varying levels of performance in relation to the LTIP 2016.
The illustration reflects the issue of 30,000 growth shares each to Andrew Lindsay and Nick Schoenfeld on 4 April 2017, and that no annual cash bonuses are paid.
The amounts for pensions and benefits included in the fixed remuneration figure have been calculated on the same basis as payments made for the year ended 31 March 2018.
The potential rewards available under the LTIP 2016 reflect the annual equivalent value of the awards over the 10 year life.
The ontarget and maximum performance under the LTIP 2016 have been based on a Company share price of 20 and 50 respectively at vesting.

Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 61 REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION The Committees approach to recruitment is to pay a sufficient amount necessary to attract the best candidates to the particular role.
In determining these amounts the Committee will be mindful of, inter alia, prevailing market rates, the chosen candidates skills, knowledge and experience, and their existing location and position.
Where the candidate has variable remuneration arrangements with a previous employer that will be lost on leaving employment, the Company will consider offering a sign-on award in compensation for the value foregone, either as an award under an existing share incentive scheme or a bespoke award under the Listing Rules exemption available for this purpose.
The face and or expected values of the award s offered will not materially exceed the value ascribed to the award s foregone, and would normally follow the same vesting timing and form ie: cash or shares save that the Committee may award the whole of the value in shares, at its discretion.
The application of performance conditions would be considered and, where appropriate, the awards could be made subject to claw-back in certain circumstances.
For material amounts the Committee would, where practicable, consult with key institutional shareholders ahead of committing to make any such sign-on awards, and in any event a full explanation of any amounts awarded, an explanation of why it was necessary and a breakdown of the awards to be made will be announced to the markets at the time of granting.
For the avoidance of doubt, should a new director be internally promoted from the Companys senior management team they will not be expected to give up or amend any element of remuneration granted to them prior to becoming a director which is inconsistent with the remuneration policy set out above.
Any new executive directors remuneration package would include the same elements, and be subject to the same constraints, as those of the existing executive directors as outlined in the above policy table.

62 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS The Chairman of the Committee engages with certain of the Companys largest shareholders who have expressed an interest in being consulted in relation to remuneration matters to understand their expectations and monitor any changes in their views.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP The Committee considers pay levels across the organisation when setting remuneration for all directors both executives and non-executives.
However this review is undertaken against a background of ensuring that the prevailing market rates for all levels of employee in the organisation are taken into account in order to attract, retain and motivate the best employees at each level.
In relation to directors, specific account is taken of any change in the level of responsibility of the director whether through a change in role or the increased size of the Company or an increase in experience and knowledge of the Company and its markets which may not be relevant to roles elsewhere in the Company.
The Company does not deem it appropriate to formally consult with employees regarding the determination of the directors remuneration policy as the broad remuneration structure for directors mirrors that of all employees, ie: the payment of a base salary, benefits and share incentive scheme awards at market price and or LTIP 2016 awards.
However, employees have the opportunity to make comments on any aspect of the Companys activities through an employee survey and any comments made which are relevant to directors remuneration would be considered by the Committee.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 63 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION This report, which has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in April 2016 and Schedule 8 of the Large and MediumSized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended in August 2013 the Regulations, has been approved by the Board of directors for submission to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The sections under the headings Single Total Figure of Remuneration, parts of Share Incentive Schemes and Pension Schemes have been subject to external audit.
SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION The Committee recommended increases to the annual base salaries of Executive Chairman Charles Wigoder, Chief Executive Andrew Lindsay and Chief Financial Officer Nick Schoenfeld during the year as follows: Charles Wigoder - increased from 431,629 to 440,262: Andrew Lindsay - increased from 467,598 to 530,000: and Nick Schoenfeld - increased from 456,000 to 530,000.
The increase for Charles Wigoder was in line with the Companys average cost of living increase for employees.
Andrew Lindsay and Nick Schoenfeld received increases to their salaries of 13.3% and 16.2% respectively to 530,000 each for the period.
The non-executive directors receive fees for their services, the details of which are described below.
The level of these fees for the existing non-executive directors was unchanged during the year.

SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES The Company has two conventional share option plans and the LTIP 2016.
The first share option plan and the LTIP 2016 are available to employees, and the second share option plan is available to the Companys Partners.
The Company also has a Save As You Earn share option plan the Employee SAYE Share Option Plan for employees.
The Employee Share Option Plan Subject to serving the requisite probationary period, all employees are eligible to participate in the Companys employee share option plan and be issued with market price options over shares in the Company, the number of shares being related to their seniority and length of service.
The Committee recognises that the collective contribution of all employees is critical to the success of the Company and continues to believe that the granting of share options at all levels within the organisation generates employee loyalty and helps to ensure that staff turnover is kept to a minimum and below the levels seen across the industry for employees passing their probationary periods.
Following the expiry of the previous employee share option plan put in place in 2007, a new employee share option plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM in July 2017.
The new scheme is based on substantially the same terms and conditions as the previous plan.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 65 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED The LTIP 2016 The LTIP 2016 comprises the issue to participants of a class of growth shares, which potentially become convertible into ordinary shares in the Company over a period of typically 3-10 years following the achievement of stretching targets.
If these targets are not achieved, then the growth shares lapse with no value to participants.
The first awards of growth shares were made to initial participants in the scheme on 4 April 2017: these included the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
The intention behind introducing LTIP 2016 was to reward the creation of significant shareholder value, therefore the following hurdles have been chosen, with no value accruing to participants unless either: i the share price has risen to at least 20: or ii the adjusted earnings per share of the Company has at least doubled.
The initial participants have been set further stretching targets of growing the share price and adjusted EPS: as each of these hurdles is achieved, the conversion ratio of growth shares to ordinary shares in the Company increases as follows: SHARE PRICE EPS GROWTH CONVERSION RATIO 20 2.0x Nil 20 to 24.99 2.0x to 2.24x 2.5x 25 to 29.99 2.25x to 2.49x 3.75x 30 to 34.99 2.5x to 2.74x 5.0x 35 to 39.99 2.75x to 2.9x 6.25x 40 to 44.99 3.0x to 3.24x 7.5x 45 to 49.99 3.25x to 3.5x 8.75x 50 3.5x 10.0x For initial participants, the awards vest progressively over approximately a 9 year period with 25% vesting after approximately 2 years in August 2019, 25% after approximately 4 years in August 2021, 25% after approximately 6 years in August 2023, and the final 25% vesting after approximately 9 years in August 2026: in all cases, conversion is subject to the relevant hurdles having been achieved on the conversion date.
In addition, transfer restrictions will apply on a proportion of the shares for up to two years, to ensure the interests of management and shareholders remain aligned.
For any future LTIP 2016 grants, stretching targets will be set by the Committee that will not be below those which apply to initial participants.
One of the key drivers behind the introduction of LTIP 2016 is the retention of key individuals over the longer term, therefore any growth shares issued to a participant will generally lapse if they cease to be employed by the Company before they have vested.
In accordance with best practice, both malus and clawback provisions have been included.
A summary of the principal terms of the LTIP 2016 was included in the Appendix to the 2016 AGM circular sent to all shareholders.

A summary of the principal terms of the Employee SAYE Share Option Plan were set out in the Appendix to the 2015 AGM circular sent to all shareholders.
The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide incentives and rewards to those distributors who have been most successful in gathering new Members for the Company.
These distributors, whilst not being employees of the Company, are nevertheless essential to its future growth, and it is the opinion of the Committee that this plan can in some cases be an important factor in their motivation.
Following the expiry of the previous networkers and consultants share option plan put in place in 2007, a new networkers and consultants share option plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM in July 2017.
Statement of Directors Shareholding and Share Interests audited Details of the directors shareholdings are set out in the Directors Report on page 74.
As set out in the Remuneration Policy Table of the Companys Remuneration Policy, a target level of share ownership is not stipulated for directors, however, subject to personal circumstances and existing shareholdings they are encouraged to retain 25% of shares issued as a result of the exercise of share incentive awards.

Mr Nick Schoenfeld Mr Schoenfeld relinquished the options awarded to him on 13 July 2015 for no consideration after the year end on 4 April 2017 and therefore no benefit will accrue to Mr Schoenfeld from this award.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH SHOWING TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN The following graph shows the Companys performance measured by total shareholder return compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Telecommunications Index and the FTSE 350 for the period 1 April 2013 to 30 March 2018.
As noted in previous years, the FTSE All Share Telecommunications Index was initially selected at a time when a larger proportion of the Companys revenues related to the supply of telephony services: only approximately 18.7% of the Companys revenues are now generated from such telephony services.
The FTSE 350 Index is included as a further comparator in the light of the fact that there are no sector specific indices containing directly comparable quoted companies supplying a broad range of services similar to that provided by the Company.

No share incentive awards vested to the Chief Executive in the years ended 31 March 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018.
PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE REMUNERATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE The following table shows the change in certain aspects of the remuneration of Mr Lindsay.

RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPEND ON PAY The Regulations require an illustration of the significance of the Companys expenditure on pay in the context of its operations.
Set out below is a summary of the Companys levels of expenditure on pay and other significant cash outflows to key stakeholders.
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018 2017 CHANGE 000 000 % Wages and salaries 36,772 31,501 16.7% Dividends paid 38,273 37,633 1.7% 70 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR Base Salaries For the year to 31 March 2019 the Committee recommended that the Executive Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer receive increases on their salaries to 452,369, 554,575 and 554,575 respectively: the underlying increases are in line with the Companys average cost of living increase for all employees of 2.75%, and in the case of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer also reflect an increase of 10,000 each to compensate for reductions to their pension contributions by the Company from 20,000 per annum to 10,000.
The Committee also recommended an increase in the base salary of Julian Schild, the Companys senior non-executive director and Deputy Chairman, from 35,000 to 40,000 per annum.
This mainly reflects the fact that Mr Schild has not received an increase in base salary since his appointment in 2010.
Other benefits Directors remuneration in relation to pension contributions and other benefits for the year will be made in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
SHAREHOLDER VOTE AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT As set out in the Remuneration Policy, the Committee encourages dialogue with the Companys major shareholders regarding remuneration matters and will endeavour to consult with these shareholders ahead of any significant future changes to the remuneration policy.
Details of the votes cast in relation to the main remuneration resolutions at last years AGM are set out below: 2017 AGM % To approve the 2017 Remuneration Report Votes cast in favour & Chairman discretion 24,616,193 50.41 Votes cast against 24,217,946 49.59 Total 48,834,139 100.00 To approve the adoption of the 2017 Employee Share Option Plan Votes cast in favour & Chairman discretion 36,302,804 74.34 Votes cast against 12,531,162 25.66 Total 48,833,966 100.00 To approve the adoption of the 2017 Networkers & Consultants Share Option Plan Votes cast in favour & Chairman discretion 35,474,152 72.64 Votes cast against 13,360,804 27.36 Total 48,834,956 100.00 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 71 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED In addition to the above there were 2,446, 2,619 and 1,629 votes withheld for each vote above respectively.
The Committee believes that a key factor behind the high number of votes cast against the Remuneration Report concerned the awards made under the LTIP 2016, where a particular area of concern related to the relatively short period between participant subscription to the growth shares in April 2017 and the first vesting period in August 2019.
In relation to this, the Committee notes that the implementation of the LTIP took longer than initially expected and that it did not want the participants to be unfairly disadvantaged as a result.
Had the LTIP been implemented and awards made within the originally envisaged timeframe, the vesting period would have been more aligned with the normal three-year benchmark for share incentive awards.
The Committee also notes that only 25% of the awards vest in August 2019 and that a key hurdle in the scheme requires that the Companys share price is over 20 before any growth share awards vest, regardless of the length of the period before vesting.
The Committee continues to believe that the LTIP 2016 awards are in the best long-term interests of the Company, and the strong alignment they create between the interests of the executive directors and external shareholders will drive significant increases in shareholder value over the lifetime of this incentive.
In relation to the adoption of the new share option schemes, the Committee understands that a key factor behind the relatively high number of votes cast against the resolutions concerned the dilution limits in the schemes.
The Committee firmly believes it is in the best interests of the Company to retain relatively higher dilution limits given the Company needs to incentivise both its employees and unique network of Partners.
THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE The Committee acknowledges the requirement set out in the Corporate Governance Code issued by the FRC in April 2016 the Code for companies to put in place arrangements that will enable them to recover or withhold variable remuneration when appropriate to do so.
The Committee therefore included provisions to withhold or recover such remuneration in the event of fraud or malus committed by a director in the LTIP 2016 awards.
