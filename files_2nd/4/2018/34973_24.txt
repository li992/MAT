We have taken the opportunity to simplify our Non-executive Director fee structure.
Since 2008, Non-executive Directors have been paid a base fee of 55,000, plus 2,500 per annum for committee membership.
Directors travelling from the US were paid a travel allowance of 5,000 per annum.
A 10,000 annual fee was paid to each of the Chair of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and to the Senior Independent Director.
With effect from 1 October 2018, the Nonexecutive Directors base fee was increased from 55,000 to 60,000 and the separate Committee membership fee has been removed.
The 10,000 annual fee paid to each of the Chair of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and to the Senior Independent Director has been increased to 12,500.
This simplifies the fee structure and recognises the refreshment and realignment of Board skills to match the complexity of the Group and the enhanced role of the Non-executive Directors, where some Board members sit on multiple Board committees.
