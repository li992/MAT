99 Company Overview Strategic report GOVERNANCE Financial statements EXISTING GRANTS OR ENTITLEMENTS It is the Companys intention to honour all pre-existing commitments at the date of this report and to honour all future obligations entered into, consistent with the approved remuneration Policy in force at that time.
In the case of internal promotion to the Board, the Committee intends to honour any pre-existing commitments made prior to becoming a member of the Board, including where these differ from the approved remuneration Policy.
PERFORMANCE MEASURE SELECTION AND APPROACH TO TARGET SETTING Annual bonus measures are selected to reflect the Companys short-term financial and non-financial priorities.
At its discretion, the Committee may vary these measures at the start of each financial year to maintain close alignment between executive incentives and the annual business plan.
The measures used in the Long-Term Incentive Plan are selected to reflect Smiths strategy and to reinforce the key drivers of value creation and growth highlighted elsewhere in this Annual Report: earnings per share, cash conversion, organic sales growth and delivering sustainable return on capital.
Annual bonus and LTIP targets are reviewed annually, and take into account the Companys strategic plan, analyst forecasts for Smiths and its sector comparators and external expectations for Smiths key markets.
The Committee sets targets that it considers to be challenging but attainable and aligned to the Companys business objectives over the short term, as reflected in the annual business plan, and longer term, consistent with the strategic plan.
On top of aligning incentives with strategy, targets are designed to ensure that participants are aligned with the interests of shareholders.
DIFFERENCE IN POLICY BETWEEN EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES The reward policy for other senior employees is broadly consistent with that for executive Directors, and the Company does not currently operate any incentive plans in which only executive Directors participate.
The Committee reviews each year the all-employee pay and incentive trends and takes these into account in setting executive Director pay levels.
The principles of remuneration packages being market related, performance sensitive and driven by business needs are applied at all levels and geographies in the Group.
PAY SCENARIOS The graphs below provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunity for the CEO, and the potential mix between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Minimum, On-Target and Maximum.

For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for FY2019.
It should be noted that any awards granted under the LTIP in a year do not normally vest until at least the third anniversary of the date of grant.
This illustration is intended to provide further information to shareholders on the relationship between executive pay and performance.
Please note, however, that actual pay delivered will further be influenced by factors such as share price appreciation or depreciation and the value of dividends paid.

Additional fees are paid to the Chairs of the Nomination, Audit and Remuneration Committees and to the Senior Independent Director to reflect the additional time commitment of these roles.
Additional fees may also be paid to members of the Nomination, Audit and Remuneration Committees.
The additional fee paid to the Chairman of the Board is determined by the Committee, absent the Chairman, while the fees for all nonexecutive Directors are agreed by the executive Directors.
Other The Chairman and non-executive Directors are not eligible for benefits.
The Chairman and the non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses or participation in share schemes or any pension provision.
They may be paid an attendance allowance for each meeting attended outside their home continent in addition to the annual fee and are reimbursed for actual expenses incurred transportation, hotels etc..
Modest retirement gifts may be provided for non-executive directors in appropriate circumstances.
Approach to remuneration on recruitment and leaving EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS The Committee approves the remuneration of each executive Director on their appointment.
In setting the remuneration during the recruitment of external appointments, the Committee will apply the following policy: Pay element Policy on recruitment Salary Salary on recruitment is determined based on the same principles as the annual salary review, as outlined in the policy table.
Pension As described in the policy table.
Benefits As described in the policy table.
Annual Bonus As described in the policy table and typically pro-rated for the proportion of year served.
Maximum annual award opportunity: 180% of salary with mandatory deferral of 33% into shares.
LTIP May be considered for an award under the LTIP on similar terms to other executives.
Maximum annual award opportunity: 400% of salary.
Other The Committee may make an award in recognition of incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Any such award will take account of relevant factors including the fair value of awards forfeited, any performance conditions attached, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
For the purposes of making such awards, but for no other reason, the Committee may avail itself of Listing Rule 9.4.
The Committee may also make payments to cover reasonable expenses in recruitment and relocation, and any other miscellaneous expenses including but not limited to housing, tax and immigration support.
101 Company Overview Strategic report GOVERNANCE Financial statements INTERNAL PROMOTIONS In cases of appointing a new executive Director by way of internal promotion, the policy will be consistent with that for external appointees, as detailed above.
Any commitments made prior to an individuals promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Company may, where appropriate, seek to revise an individuals existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive Directors and prevailing market best practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive Director external or internal, including details of any exceptional payments, will be disclosed in the RNS notification made at the time of appointment and in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year in which the recruitment occurred.
Respecting diversity is woven into everything we do.
We ensure that equal opportunities are practiced when interviewing, recruiting and promoting employees with decisions made based on skills and expertise first and foremost.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS In recruiting a new non-executive Director, the Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on page 100.
SERVICE CONTRACTS The Companys policy is that executive Directors are normally employed on terms which include a one-year rolling period of notice from the Company and six months notice from the individual.
The contract includes provision for the payment of a predetermined sum in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances but excluding circumstances where the Company is entitled to dismiss without compensation.
In addition to payment of basic salary, pension allowance and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the one-year notice period, the predetermined sum would include annual bonus and share awards only in respect of the period they have served, payable following the end of the relevant performance period and subject to the normal performance conditions.
Existing service contracts and letters of appointment for non-executive Directors or other applicable agreements are available for viewing at the Companys Registered Office.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Andy Reynolds Smith is employed under a service contract with the Company dated 6 July 2015 and effective from 25 September 2015.
John Shipsey is employed under a service contract with the Company dated and effective from 18 October 2017.
He became an executive Director on 1 January 2018.
The service contracts for both executive Directors may be terminated by 12 months notice given by the Company or six months notice given by the Director.
The Company may elect to terminate the contract by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to the Directors base salary and benefits including pension allowance in respect of any unserved period of notice.
The service contract contains specific provisions enabling a reduction in any phased payments in lieu of notice, in the event that the Director finds alternative employment during the notice period.
BILL SEEGER Bill Seeger was employed under an extended letter of agreement with the Company dated 22 June 2017 and effective from 19 May 2017 in the role of Chief Financial Officer for an interim period until 31 December 2017.
He returned to his non-executive Director role on 1 January 2018.
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The Chairman and the non-executive Directors serve the Company under letters of appointment and do not have contracts of service or contracts for services.
Except where appointed at a general meeting, Directors stand for election by shareholders at the first AGM following appointment.
Although the Articles of Association only require Directors to stand for re-election at every third AGM or such earlier AGM as the Board may determine thereafter under Article 49, the Board has resolved that all Directors who are willing to continue in office will stand for re-election by the shareholders each year at the AGM.
Either party can terminate the appointment on one months written notice and no compensation is payable in the event of an appointment being terminated early.

Deferred bonus awards are forfeited on dismissal for cause.
A good leaver will typically remain eligible for a pro-rated annual bonus award to be paid after the end of the financial year and deferred bonus awards will be paid out at the normal vesting date.
LTIP awards will typically vest at the normal vesting date to the extent that the associated performance conditions are met, but will normally be pro-rated on the basis of actual service within the performance period.
In cases of death or disability, individuals are automatically deemed to be good leavers under the plan rules of the LTIP.
All other good leavers will be defined at the discretion of the Committee on a case-by-case basis.
In the event of a change of control, LTIP awards will vest to the extent that each of the performance conditions is met based on the Committees assessment of performance over the performance period to the date of change of control.
For internal performance measures, the Committee may exercise its judgement in determining the outcome based on its assessment of whether or not the performance conditions would have been met to a greater or lesser extent at the end of the full performance period.
Awards will also normally be pro-rated to reflect the time that has elapsed between the grant of the award and the date of change of control.
The Committee retains discretion to vary these provisions on a case-by-case basis.
In connection with the termination of an executive Directors contract, the Company may make a payment on account of accrued but untaken leave and may pay outplacement and legal fees for support provided to the individual.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS Subject to the overriding requirements of the Company, the Committee allows executive Directors to accept one external appointment where it considers that such appointment will contribute to the Directors breadth of knowledge and experience.
Directors are permitted to retain fees associated with such appointments.
CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS The Committee always takes into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company.
We do not consult directly with employees regarding executive Director pay.
However the Committee is regularly, and at least annually, provided with information on pay trends and ratios of the wider employee population across the Group.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS The Committee has taken account of the views expressed by shareholders.
The proposed changes to the remuneration policy are receptive to and respectful of shareholder views.

The bonus payments without application of this discretion would have been 57.5% of maximum for the CEO and 59.0% of maximum for the CFO.
As the annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive they will be disclosed in next years report or at such later time as they are considered to be no longer commercially sensitive.
PERSONAL OBJECTIVES Challenging personal objectives were set for each executive Director to reinforce the Companys annual and strategic priorities.
For FY2018, these targets focussed on four categories of equal weighting: business growth, internal excellence, strategy development, and leadership and organisation.
Andy Reynolds Smiths performance in the business growth category was rated at 72%, reflecting the excellent progress in the second half measured against the stretching revenue targets set at the start of the financial year.
He also scored 72% against the objectives set in the excellence category, based on the successful achievement of working capital targets, improved inventory performance and deployment of the Smiths Excellence System SES.
The strategy category was rated at 76% based on the Committees assessment of the execution of Group tax strategy and the continued good progress in meeting milestones related to the development of the future Group structure.
105 Company Overview Strategic report GOVERNANCE Financial statements The leadership and organisation measure was assessed as being achieved in full, reflecting the excellent progress in developing the capability of the Executive Committee.
Overall the Committee determined that this resulted in 80% achievement of the personal objectives.
John Shipseys performance in the business growth category was scored as 80% to reflect his contribution to driving the excellent progress in revenue growth in the second half of the year, and following his appointment as CFO.
He achieved a score of 80% in the excellence category to reflect strong progress in the development of operational procedures aligned to SES.
The strategy measure was assessed by the Committee as being achieved in full, as a result of his excellent contribution to, and performance in, developing and implementing the Group tax strategy to underpin delivery of the Groups strategic plan.

Having considered a number of important factors including individuals performance and experience, the relative performance of the Company and the remuneration policy within the Company, the Committee has determined the following annualised salaries for executive Directors for FY2019, which are in line with the average increase for UK employees of 2.9%: Executive director FY2018 FY2019 Andy Reynolds Smith 800,000 820,000 John Shipsey 510,000 525,000 PENSION AND BENEFITS Andy Reynolds Smith and John Shipsey will continue to receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension of 25% of base salary.
The executive Directors do not have a prospective entitlement to a defined benefit pension.
ANNUAL BONUS For FY2019, Andy Reynolds Smith will continue to have a maximum bonus opportunity of 180% of salary and John Shipsey 150%.
Annual bonus measures and their weightings will be amended from FY2019 as set out in the proposed Policy Changes table on page 94.
33% of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares for three years.
Specific targets cannot be disclosed at this time due to the commercially sensitive nature of these objectives, but they will be disclosed at such a time as the Committee deems them to no longer affect the commerciality of the Company, likely to be within two years of the end of the performance period.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN The LTIP is a conventional share plan under which an award over a capped number of shares will vest if demanding performance conditions are met.
LTIP awards of conditional shares are granted to selected senior executives including the executive Directors with face values of up to 400% of salary.
Under the LTIP, for the FY2019 award a fixed number of shares will be granted equivalent to 300% of salary for the Chief Executive and 250% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
The LTIP awards granted to Andy Reynolds Smith and John Shipsey in FY2019 will vest on the achievement of the following performance conditions: Maximum performance Threshold target full performance vesting of Performance measure Weighting target element Three-year EPS growth after tax 25% 4% p. a.
Three-year average return on capital employed 20% 15% 18% p. a.
Three-year average annual operating cash conversion 25% 90% 105% Three-year average organic sales growth 30% 3% 6% p. a.
This represents a change to the LTIP performance measures and weightings from the 2017 18 cycle as set out in the proposed Policy Changes table set out on page 94.
The Committee believes that the proposed structure provides an appropriate balance between earnings growth, returns, cash and sales growth.
The Committee recognises that this balance of Group performance measures remains very important for many of our largest shareholders.
As previously stated, the scorecard will be reviewed at the start of each future LTIP cycle to ensure it continues to reflect the Groups strategic priorities.
For performance between threshold and maximum, awards vest on a straight-line sliding scale.
