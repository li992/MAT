Wider workforce considerations SIG is committed to creating an inclusive working environment and to rewarding our employees throughout the organisation in a fair manner.
In making decisions on executive pay, the Remuneration Committee considers wider workforce remuneration and conditions.
We believe that employees throughout the Company should be able to share in the success of the Company and in 2005 we introduced a Share Incentive Plan for this purpose.
We also believe that employees should have the opportunity to save for their futures and to this end we operate pension saving mechanisms for all employees.
As part of our commitment to fairness, we have introduced a new section to this Report see page 96 which sets out more information on our wider workforce pay conditions, our CEO to employee pay ratio, our gender pay statistics, and our diversity initiatives.
Whilst we recognise there is much work still to do, we believe that transparency is an important first step towards making improvements in relation to these important issues.
Shareholders I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support during the year.
I will be available at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 8 May 2019 to answer any questions in relation to this Remuneration report.

In this section we provide a summary of the key elements of the new Remuneration policy for Executive Directors approved by shareholders at our 2018 General Meeting on 7 November 2018.
In addition, we have set out how the current policy was operated in 2018 and how it is intended that the new Remuneration policy is to be operated in 2019.
You can find the full new Remuneration policy in the Companys Notice of General Meeting dated 15 October 2018 at www.
The Companys policy is to provide remuneration packages that fairly reward the Executive Directors for the contribution they make to the business and that are appropriately competitive to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior managers of the right calibre.
A significant proportion of remuneration takes the form of variable pay, which is linked to the achievement of specific and stretching targets that align with the creation of shareholder value and the Companys strategic goals.

The chart demonstrates the Committees policy of ensuring that salary and benefits are set at or below the market level with the incentives allowing an overall above market positioning when the Company has performed.
What is our 2018 single figure compared to our current policy?
When shareholders approved our Remuneration policy in 2017, we set out scenarios for the potential remuneration to be earned by our Executive Directors under the policy for various performance assumptions.
We have set out the actual single figure of remuneration for the Executive Directors for 2018 against these scenarios to demonstrate how the actual remuneration paid lines up with our policy.

The Company feels that using Gender Pay data ensures that these individuals are reasonably representative of pay levels at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles.
We have determined the individuals at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles as at 26 October 2018.
In determining the quartile figures the hourly rates were annualised using the same number of contractual hours as the CEO.
One employee with the relevant annual salary was then chosen for each quartile and the single total remuneration figure was calculated for them to compare to the CEO.
For the purpose of the calculations the following elements of pay were included for all employees: Annual basic salary Private medical insurance value Car car allowance Employer pension contribution Bonus earned in the year in question LTIP value Management incentive plan value Group Life Assurance value In future years, we will provide context to the ratios and set out a table showing changes over time and narrative explaining them, together with a chart tracking CEO to employee pay ratios alongside SIGs TSR performance over the same period.
The Committee continues to be committed to ensuring that CEO pay is commensurate with performance.
We are expecting there to be significant volatility in this ratio over time and we believe that this will be caused by the following: Our CEO pay is made up of a higher proportion of incentive pay than that of our employees, in line with the expectations of our shareholders.
This introduces a higher degree of variability in his pay each year which affects the ratio.
The value of long-term incentives which measure performance over three years is disclosed in pay in the year it vests, which increases the CEO pay in that year, again impacting the ratio for that year: Long-term incentives are provided in shares, and therefore an increase in share price over the three years magnifies the impact of a long-term incentive award vesting in a year.
We recognise that the ratio is driven by the different structure of the pay of our CEO versus that of our employees, as well as the make-up of our workforce.
This ratio varies between businesses even in the same sector.
What is important from our perspective is that this ratio is influenced only by the differences in structure, and not by divergence in fixed pay between the CEO and wider workforce.
Where the structure of remuneration is similar, as for the Executive Committee and the CEO, the ratio is much more stable over time.
