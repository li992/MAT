Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 95 Governance | Directors Annual Remuneration Report Mark Hanafin 2018 was a challenging year in which Mark delivered considerable strategic and operational progress across Centrica Business and established the Spirit Energy JV and its associated Board and shareholder processes.
Financial performance was mixed, with some significant achievements in EM&T, UK Business and growth in fide&P.
In the area of safety, compliance and conduct, a step-change has been delivered during the year in process safety performance and market conduct within EM&T, and controls within North America Business were robust.
Occupational safety was mixed and included some disappointing results in fide&P.
In delivering for the customer, account numbers were stable and NPS improved in all customer facing business units.
At the business unit level, the recovery of UK Business was notable for the quality of margin management and innovation.
Under Marks leadership the business responded well to the issues arising in 2017 and focused on customer segmentation, improved propositions and tight gross margin forecasting, resulting in on-plan financial performance.
Elsewhere in Centrica Business, EM&T performed well and NEAS continues to make a strong contribution.
LNG also secured important business development options for the future.
However, performance during the year in North America Business was disappointing.
The underlying performance delivery within Spirit Energy was poor, with production finishing the year behind plan.
The business did, however, improve process safety significantly.
In Nuclear, progress was made in the divestment process but underlying performance was affected by safety and regulatory concerns in a number of sites resulting in lower throughput.
Overall, Mark demonstrated strong leadership during the year, providing direction, coaching and support, but the financial performance overall in Centrica Business was behind plan.
Richard Hookway Richard has made an impressive start in his role as Chief Executive for Centrica Business.
He brings a deep understanding of running large scale international energy businesses and is already demonstrating his capabilities and experience.
Chris OShea Chris is a very experienced Chief Financial Officer, having operated internationally within large complex organisations.
His experience of energy, commodity businesses and of key commercial aspects such as pricing and performance risk management are so far being demonstrated strongly and, following a well-executed handover, he is fully engaged with the important strategic and performance issues facing the Group.
