Details of Non-Executive Directors fees are set out in the next section.
The taxable benefits relate to the provision of independent financial advice, a car or car allowance fully inclusive of all scheme costs including insurance and maintenance, health care and private medical assessments, as well as taxable business expenses.
Where Serco settles the PAYE and NIC liability in respect of benefits provided, the value of the benefit has been grossed up at the individuals marginal tax rate.
Rupert Soames 2018 taxable benefit includes 23,367 company car benefit.
Angus Cockburns 2018 taxable benefit includes 21,716 on a grossed up basis for travel between his home, in Scotland, and London.
The 2017 taxable benefit values have been restated to include taxable benefits provided in the period but not previously disclosed.
The pension amount includes payments made in lieu of pension, calculated as a percentage of base salary, from which the Executive Directors make their own pension arrangements.
Performance bonuses earned in the period under review, but not paid until the following financial year.
For 2018 this figure includes 296,863 of Rupert Soames and 85,900 of Angus Cockburns 2018 bonuses which will be subject to mandatory deferral into Serco shares for a three year period at the point the bonuses are paid in 2019.
During the year Rupert Soames participated in the DBP for the last time, voluntarily deferring 25% of his 2017 bonus paid in 2018 via the purchase of Investment Shares.
This is the estimated or actual value of long-term incentives for which the performance period ended in the year.
The 2014 PSP Awards and 2014 Recruitment Awards granted to Rupert and Angus that were subject to an Absolute Share Price performance condition, and the 2015 PSP Awards that were subject to TSR performance for which the performance period in each case ended 22 February 2018 did not meet the minimum criteria for each condition and therefore these awards lapsed in full.
The 2014 PSP Awards granted to Rupert and Angus that were subject to a five year EPS performance condition for which the performance period ended 31 December 2018 did not meet the minimum criteria and therefore these awards will also lapse in full in 2019.
The 2016 PSP Awards that were subject to EPS and ROIC performance, and the 2016 DBP Awards subject to EPS performance, for which the performance periods ended 31 December 2018, are reported for 2018 on an estimated basis.
Further details are provided on pages 119 to 120.
The long-term incentive values reported for 2017 have been restated to reflect the actual share price at the relevant vest dates for the Awards.
Variable pay outcomes audited information Performance-related annual bonus For 2018, the Executive Director bonus was based on achieving a mix of financial and non-financial objectives which were weighted 70:30 respectively.
The financial measures were based on Trading Profit 40%, Free Cash Flow 40% and Revenue 20% and the non-financial measures were individually set and based on key strategic goals.
Payments under the 2018 annual bonus were subject to an Underlying Trading Profit underpin after adjustment for in-year Onerous Contract Provisions OCP items of 89.5m at constant currency rates.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the achievements against the targets for the year and the proposed annual incentive payments for the Executive Directors.

Therefore, these components were determined to pay out at 95% and 100% of maximum respectively.
The level of Revenue achieved over the period was below threshold and as such none of this component of the bonus was awarded.
The financial bonus outcomes have been calculated after appropriate adjustments, which were agreed at the beginning of the year as part of the target-setting process and in line with the approach disclosed in respect of 2016.
The Committee has once again spent considerable time reviewing the Trading Profit calculation for bonus purposes, initially working with management to determine a robust approach to decision-making, informed by a review of each individual contract and with crossreferencing to information shared with the Audit Committee.
The Companys external auditors verified the extraction of figures appearing in the accounts and those tabled for bonus purposes, followed by a formal sign-off by the Audit Committee on the numbers used to determine bonus payments prior to decisions being made by the Committee.
As a result of the rigour applied to this process, the Committee is satisfied that the annual bonus out-turn fairly reflects management performance in the year.
Trading Profit of 116.7m is adjusted by the Committee to arrive at a figure for Trading Profit for bonus purposes: shareholders were consulted on the principles behind these adjustments in early 2015, and the bonus outcomes for 2015, 2016 and 2017 reflected these principles, the purpose of which is to ensure that management are measured against their in-year performance and are not given credit for gains for which they have not materially influenced.
The Committee has applied 2018 in a consistent manner to the principles established in 2015, 2016 and 2017.
The first adjustment is to put Trading Profit into constant currency, so that it is consistent with the targets set at the beginning of the year: this is a 4.4m increase.
The Committee then considers items to properly reflect management effort and in-year operational performance.
The Committee has concluded that a total of -15.2m should be deducted from Trading Profit in constant currency to arrive at a calculation of Trading Profit for bonus purposes in 2018: this compares with 23.6m which was added to Trading Profit in 2017.
The main difference between the two years is that in 2018 there was a 13.0m net credit to Trading Profit related to Onerous Contract Provisions charges and releases which was excluded from Trading Profit for bonus purposes, whilst in 2017 there was a net charge of -19.5m, similarly excluded.
For the purposes of comparison, the table below sets out the adjustments made by the Committee between Trading Profit and Trading Profit for bonus purposes in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. m 2018 2017 2016 2015 Trading Profit 116.7 54.0 100.3 137.6 Constant currency adjustment 4.4 6.8 5.7 7.7 Trading Profit at constant currency 121.1 47.2 94.6 145.3 Adjustment for bonus purposes 15.2 23.6 20.9 32.9 Trading Profit for bonus purposes 105.9 70.8 73.7 112.4 Underlying Trading Profit at constant currency 97.1 63.4 73.4 95.9 | Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Serco Group plc 117 Remuneration Report continued Rupert Soames Ruperts objectives included: Improving Business Development The Committee deemed performance to be very strong overall.

| 118 Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Long term incentives The long term incentives amount included in the 2018 single total figure of remuneration includes the following Performance Share Plan, Deferred Bonus Plan and Recruitment Awards.
Performance Share Plan PSP A number of Performance Share Plan awards are included in the 2018 single figure of remuneration for the Executive Directors: the Absolute Share Price element of the 2014 Performance Share Plan PSP awards with a performance period ending on the announcement of the Companys 2017 results on 22 February 2018: the five year EPS element of the 2014 PSP awards with a performance period ending 31 December 2018: the TSR element of the 2015 PSP awards with a performance period ending on the announcement of the Companys 2017 results on 22 February 2018: and the elements of the 2016 PSP awards subject to EPS and ROIC performance in the period to 31 December 2018.
The above awards were granted in the form of nominal cost options.
The performance assessment and vesting outcome for each award is as follows: 4 Relative Threshold Maximum Percentage of Award Performance condition weighting 25% vesting 100% vesting Actual max achieved 2014 PSP Absolute Share Price 1 3 4.50 6.00 0.91 0% 2014 PSP Five year EPS 1 6 30.0p 35.0p 9.1p 0% 1 2015 PSP Relative TSR 1 3 Median ranking Upper quartile ranking Below median 0% 2 2016 PSP Aggregate EPS 1 3 7.5p 9.1p 17.58p 100% 3 2016 PSP Average pre-tax ROIC 1 3 8.4% 10.2% 11.7% 100% Notes 1.
The Companys TSR performance was assessed relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250, excluding investment trusts, over the period starting on the completion of the Rights Issue in 2015 and ending on 22 February 2018 with the announcement of the Companys results for the 2017 financial year.
The financial outturns supporting the three year aggregate EPS performance of 17.58p reflect reported values: being pre-IFRS 15 for 2016 and 2017, and post IFRS 15 for 2018.
A separate internal assessment for the impact of IFRS 15 on Trading Profit was undertaken to support the Committees assessment that the EPS performance related element of the 2016 PSP award should vest in full.
The impact of IFRS 15 was determined to be relatively minor, and did not impact the vesting level of 100% for the EPS tranche of the 2016 PSP award.
ROIC targets for the 2016 PSP award were also set pre IFRS 15.
The financial outturn above reflects the average of reported ROIC: being pre IFRS 15 for 2016 and 2017, and post IFRS 15 for 2018.
As for the EPS vesting outcome, an adjusted calculation was also performed to assess the impact of IFRS 15 on the vesting outcome, and the impact on ROIC performance was determined to be minor, not affecting the vesting outcome.
In all cases 25% of the award vests at threshold performance, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting at maximum performance.
The number of shares under award was adjusted on the Rights Issue in 2015.
These are the adjusted number of shares awarded.
As these awards are still to vest at the time of reporting the share price used 0.9471 is the Q4 average closing share price to 31 December 2018.
The value included in the single figure reflects a small depreciation in the share price from that at grant 0.9605 to the estimate of the share price at vest based on the 2018 Q4 average share price.
| Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Serco Group plc 119 Remuneration Report continued Deferred Bonus Plan DBP The performance period for the 2016 Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Matching Share Award a conditional share award wholly subject to EPS performance ended on 31 December 2018.
25% of this award vests for threshold performance of an Adjusted EPS of 7.5p rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting for at or above maximum performance of an Adjusted EPS of 9.1p measured as an aggregate over the three-year performance period.
The Adjusted EPS for the period was measured as 17.58p therefore the 2016 DBP Matching Share Award will vest in full.

Recruitment Awards The 2018 LTI value includes the element of the Recruitment Awards in the form of nominal cost options with performance periods ending in the relevant year which were granted in 2014 to Rupert Soames and Angus Cockburn subject to an Absolute Share Price performance condition.
For the Absolute Share Price element, 25% of the award would vest for an average closing share price over the 30 days following the announcement of the Companys 2017 results of 4.50 rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting for an average closing share price of 6.00.
The share price assessed at the end of the performance period was 0.91 which is below that required for threshold vesting and therefore this element lapsed in full.

Performance graph and table This graph shows the value as at 31 December 2018, of a 100 investment in Serco on 31 December 2008 compared with 100 invested in the FTSE 250 index on the same date.
It has been assumed that all dividends paid have been reinvested.
The TSR level shown at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the 30-day period up to and including that date.
The Company chose the FTSE 250 index as the comparator for this graph as Serco has been a constituent of that index throughout the period.
The 2018 single figure of remuneration for the CEO reflects the new approved Remuneration Policy which gave the CEO a higher maximum opportunity but which will be subject to compulsory deferral above a threshold.
As set out in the notes to the single figure table, LTI awards with performance periods ending in 2018 include a number of shares under awards reportable in 2018 which did not or will not vest.
The single figure also includes an amount in respect of past DBP awards which are no longer part of the current Policy.
In line with our TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250, our awards subject to TSR have consistently not vested.
Percentage change in CEOs remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in the salary, benefits and bonus of the CEO compared to that for the average UK employee.
The UK employee sub-set of the Companys global employee population has been chosen as the group which provides the most appropriate comparator: this comprises some 20,000 of the 50,000 individuals Serco employs worldwide.
Inflation and local pay practices form a key driver in the salary and benefits provided in each location, and as the CEO is based in the UK we have chosen employees within the same country.
2 3 Salary Benefits Bonus CEO 0% -3% 20% 1 Average change for all other UK employees 1.18% -1% -8% 1.
This represents the average pay increase for all UK employees that was applied in the 2018 annual pay review cycle.
The nature of benefits provided to the CEO and to employees in 2018 compared to 2017 remains the same.
The percentage change between 2017 and 2018 reflects the reduction in the costs incurred in providing those same benefits.
The bonus element is shown for those employees eligible for such payments.
The figures shown here relate to a calculation of the bonus earned, but not yet paid, related to performance in 2018 compared to the 2017 bonuses paid in April 2018.
The reduction in the average employee bonus is due to the different performance outcomes at Divisional and Business Unit levels compared to 2017 which impacts the bonuses for the comparator population.
The increase in the CEOs bonus is due to the change in opportunity in line with the approved Remuneration Policy and the performance outcomes compared to 2017.
The CEOs 2018 bonus over 100% of salary is subject to compulsory deferral for three years into shares.
Relative importance of spend on pay The table below details the percentage change in dividends and overall expenditure on pay compared with the previous financial year.
Serco considers overall expenditure on staff pay in the context of the general finances of the Company.
This includes the determination of the annual salary increase budget, the annual grant of shares and annual bonus for the business.
2018 vs 2017 2018 2017 Dividend per share 0% nil nil Overall expenditure on wages and salaries -4.9% 1,438.7m 1,513.6m Dividend per share, and overall expenditure on wages and salaries have the same meaning as in the notes to the Company Financial Statements.
