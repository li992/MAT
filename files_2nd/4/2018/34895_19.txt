The Remuneration Committee noted that the Executive Directors had proposed a sacrifice of a proportion of the bonuses they were eligible to receive, to enable the Company to reward other senior members of staff.

All-employee remuneration matters The Board is committed to giving as many employees as possible the opportunity to share in the Groups success through all-employee share plans, and I am pleased to confirm that we are seeking shareholder approval at the AGM for a new share plan in which US-based employees will be able to participate.
The plan will operate in a similar way to ShareSave in the UK to the extent possible under US regulations.

Dr Tim Miller Remuneration Committee Chair 8 March 2019 Clarkson PLC | 2018 Annual Report 111 Directors remuneration report continued Annual report on remuneration Implementation of the Directors Remuneration Policy for 2019 Base salary No changes have been made to the base salaries of the Executive Directors for 2019, and salaries therefore remain as set out below: Executive Directors: base salary 1 January 2019 1 January 2018 % change Andi Case GBP 550,000 GBP 550,000 0% Jeff Woyda GBP 350,000 GBP 350,000 0% Peter M. Anker NOK 4,015,000 NOK 4,015,000 0% Fixed in NOK as 350,000 at NOK GBP 11.4723 at 2 February 2015 being the date Peter M. Anker joined the Board.
Peter M. Anker has expressed a wish to retire from full-time employment on his 62nd birthday in July 2019, and consequently he has decided not to offer himself up for re-election as a Director at the AGM on 9 May 2019.
He will continue on his current terms until that date and then remain with the Group as an employee on a part-time basis.
His pay will be reduced accordingly as a result.
Peter will retain any outstanding share awards on their normal terms.
No payment for loss of office is envisaged.
Taxable benefits The taxable benefits received by the Executive Directors in 2018 included a car allowance, private medical insurance and club memberships.
No material changes to taxable benefits are proposed for 2019.
Annual bonus for 2019 The annual bonus opportunity for 2019 will be calculated on the same basis as in previous years and will continue to be based on a bonus pool derived from Group profit before tax as follows: below a profit floor set by the Remuneration Committee: no bonus is triggered: and above the profit floor: an escalating percentage of profits is payable into a bonus pool for progressively higher profit before tax performance.
Profit for bonus calculations may be adjusted by the Remuneration Committee where appropriate and do not include mark-to-market valuations or business that has not been invoiced.
As in 2018, the share of the executive bonus pool allocated to the CFO & COO will, in part, be determined by performance against a series of non-financial, strategic and operational objectives.
The profit floor and thresholds for 2019 have not been disclosed on a prospective basis as these are considered to be commercially sensitive although disclosure will be provided retrospectively.
The target ranges are higher than those that applied for 2018.
Consistent with the policy applied to the majority of senior employees, 90% of the bonus payable will be paid in cash with 10% deferred into restricted shares which vest four years after grant.
Executive Directors have agreed to this deferral, although they have no contractual obligation to defer bonuses.
Clawback provisions will continue to apply in circumstances of misstatement or error.
112 Clarkson PLC | 2018 Annual Report Corporate governance Long-term incentive awards to be granted in 2019 Consistent with past practice, it is envisaged that: Executive Directors will receive LTIP awards over shares worth up to 150% of salary in 2019: The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Companys Earnings Per Share EPS for 31 December 2021, as shown in chart i below.
The EPS for 2018 is shown grey line for reference: and The vesting of the remaining 50% will be determined by the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2021 against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts, as shown in chart ii below.
The level of TSR achieved against the FTSE 250 Index over the last three-year cycle is shown grey line for reference.
EPS and relative TSR are considered to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance for the Group, in that they ensure executives are incentivised and rewarded for the earnings performance of the Group as well as returning value to shareholders.
EPS target range for 2019 award 50% of award TSR target range for 2019 award 50% of award The awards will be subject to clawback provisions and a two-year post-vesting holding period.

Fees for the Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Director fee levels for 2019 are as set out below.

Annual bonus targets audited Consistent with the way in which it operated in prior years, the annual bonus for 2018 was based on the allocation of the following pool: Executive Directors: bonus pool Underlying profit before taxation and bonus % of pre-bonus profit If profit 28.62m 0% If profit 28.62m then 0m 57.23m 11% If profit 57.23m then 57.23m 66.73m 16% If profit 66.73m then on profits 66.73m 18% 114 Clarkson PLC | 2018 Annual Report Corporate governance This formula generates a pool, with the CEO entitled to 58% of the pool: the CFO & COO entitled to 12.5%-15% of the pool dependent on delivery of his personal objectives : and the balance of 27% being available to meet discretionary awards to Peter M. Anker and other staff.
The CFO & COO was awarded the full 15% of the pool following an assessment of his personal objectives.
As in a number of previous years, the Executive Directors have proposed not to receive their full bonus entitlement and, rather, waive a proportion of their bonuses to the benefit of the wider staff bonus plans.
In 2018, each of the Executive Directors agreed to waive 30% of their entitlement.
This is shown as follows: Actual underlying profit before taxation 45.3m Actual underlying profit before taxation for bonus calculation after deducting the minority interest of pre-tax profit, adding back the cost of bonus 47.4m Actual executive bonus pool 5.2m % of executive bonus pool allocated to Executive Directors after 30% voluntary sacrifice by Directors 56% The bonus is paid 90% in cash and, although they have no contractual obligation, the Directors have agreed that 10% of the bonus will be deferred in to shares which vest after four years.
Both the cash and share element of the bonus are subject to clawback where overpayments may be reclaimed in the event of misstatement or error.
The executive pool is an incentive scheme for the Executive Directors, separate from the bonus schemes paid to staff.
However, in each of the last eight years, the Executive Directors have voluntarily waived part of their entitlement in favour of the staff pool.
Under the staff bonus scheme, 10% of bonus is deferred into four-year bullet vesting restricted shares for all staff whose bonus exceeds a fide minimis level.
While unusual in the context of typical bonus arrangements for executive directors at UK-listed companies, it recognises that the CEO essentially serves two roles that: i he is the senior executive responsible for Group strategy and management of the Group: and ii he is also a leading broker with direct fee-earning responsibilities.
The plan reflects this, in a listed company context, unusual mix of responsibilities and ensures he is appropriately rewarded for his actual contribution to the success of the Company.
Long-term incentive targets audited Long-term incentives relate to awards granted on 15 April 2016 which vest in April 2019 based on performance over the three-year period to 31 December 2018.
The performance conditions attached to these awards and actual performance against these conditions are as follows: Long-term incentive awards: performance outturn Threshold Stretch Performance measure Performance condition target target Actual % vesting EPS 25% of award vesting at threshold 140p 190p 105.2p 0% out of 50% up to 100% of award vesting at stretch on straight-line basis TSR relative to the constituents 25% of award vesting at threshold Median Upper Below 0% of the FTSE 250 Index up to 100% of award vesting at quartile median excluding investment trusts stretch on straight-line basis out of 50% Total vesting out of 100% The Companys TSR over the three-year performance period was 11.1% which was below the median 11.8% of the comparator group.
