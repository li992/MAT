C Credit quality per class of financial assets The credit quality of financial assets is managed by the Group through internal and external credit ratings used Grades are not supposed to be linked to each other across the rating categories above.
For corporate and SME loan portfolios the Group runs an internal rating model in which its customers are rated from 1 to 7 using internal grades.
The models incorporate both qualitative and quantitative information and, in addition to information specific to each borrower, utilising supplemental external information that could affect the borrowers behaviour.
It is the Groups policy to maintain accurate and consistent risk ratings across the credit portfolio.
This facilitates focused management of the applicable risks and the comparison of credit exposures across all lines of business, geographic regions and products.
The rating system is supported by a variety of financial analytics to provide the main inputs for the measurement of counterparty risk.
All internal risk ratings are tailored to the various categories and are derived in accordance with the Groups rating policy.
Attributable risk ratings are assessed and updated regularly.
