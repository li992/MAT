The Committee is therefore mindful that the total remuneration opportunity for executive directors This was also enhanced by Element B of the PIP which remains competitive compared to peers in the FTSE 250 provided an additional maximum award of 100% of salary.
The Committee review of the previous policy highlighted that there was a remuneration gap to the The Committee chose to increase the incentive opportunity market.
Therefore, the introduction of new equity elements given its intention that under the Policy there would be under the PIP helped to ensure a more competitive market no changes to the base salary, pension and benefits for positioning, provided that the executive team delivers the the executive directors beyond the standard awards for annual performance objectives and that these lead to longall employees.

3 Mr Mortstedt provided specific advice that was in addition to the duties under his contract of employment, which are his participation at CLS Holdings plc board meetings.
The Committee has agreed the fees and is of the opinion that the market rate for the specific nature of the advice he provided was appropriate based on his experience and historical knowledge of the Group.
The specific advice related to the corporate bond portfolio, investments and cash management: refinancing and borrowing: and specific property acquisitions and disposals.
4 The Bonus total comprises 50% of the Element A 2018 contribution into the Directors Plan Account and the award made of deferred shares in respect of Element B of the PIP see below for details of calculations.
The reason that only 50% of Element A is disclosed as Bonus is because the balance is deferred and at risk of forfeiture in respect of future years performance and therefore under the Regulations is required to be disclosed on vesting.
The award of deferred shares under Element B does not vest until three years after the date of grant and cannot be sold for a further 2 years.
However, in accordance with the Regulations the value of these shares is shown in the Bonus column on the date of grant as there are no further performance conditions which have to be satisfied for the shares to vest.
The value of the Element B award disclosed in the table has been calculated using the average market value of a share for the 30 day period to 31 December 2018 of 213.5 pence in accordance with the rules of the PIP.
5 The LTIP column value is the difference between the values calculated in 4 above in respect of the PIP Element A and the 2018 payment see page 67 for details of calculation and is the payment of part of the deferred performance-based element under the PIP.
The date of payment will be on or around 25 March 2019.
The value of the notional shares under Element A has been based on the average market value of a share for the 30 day period to 31 December 2018 of 213.5 pence in accordance with the rules of the PIP.
6 Taxable Benefits relate to the provision of private medical insurance.
