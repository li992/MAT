Chairs letter As Chair of the Remuneration Committee the Committee and on behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to present our Board report on remuneration for the 2018 financial year, in line with the requirements of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
Structure of report This year, in accordance with regulatory requirements, we will bring a new policy to shareholders at the 2019 AGM, at which point our previous policy as approved at the 2016 AGM, expires.
Our report is therefore structured as follows: Section A: This describes how the existing policy, approved at the 2016 AGM, was applied in 2018: Section B: This sets out our proposed remuneration policy.
It is also available on our website at www.
com en investors reports-and-results 2018. aspx The UK Corporate Governance Code The revised UK Corporate Governance Code represents some of the most significant changes to the work of the Committee to occur in recent years.
The Committee fully endorses the requirements and underlying intent of the Code and we will continue to ensure we operate in compliance with its requirements.
Focusing on simplicity and strategic alignment is fundamental to our thinking, alongside a desire to create long-term alignment between management and the shareholder experience.
We also recognise the importance of considering wider stakeholders including our employees in our decision making processes.
The Committee is working together with the Companys human resources team to ensure the Committee can best support the Board in its new overarching responsibility to ensure workforce policies and practices are in line with culture and strategy, and will report on our approach in due course.
In developing the revised Policy we considered the Principles prescribed by the revised Code around Clarity, Simplicity, Risk, Predictability, Proportionality and Alignment to culture.
We believe that our new policy fully and appropriately addresses each of these areas.
Business performance and incentive outcomes for 2018 Bodycote has performed strongly through 2018, with Group revenue growth of 5.6% after a negative impact from foreign exchange of 1.4%.
Across all our core markets, revenues have grown significantly, with 8% growth in civil aviation.
Through a targeted programme of investments in Emerging Markets we have delivered revenue of 21%, and our Specialist Technologies business grew revenues at 12%.
Group return on sales also increased 1 percentage point to 19.0%.
We believe that the incentive payouts we have made to our executive directors reflects this performance and is aligned to the overall performance of the Company.
As such, the Committee determined that no discretionary adjustments either upward or downward would be required from the formulaic outcomes.
Annual bonus We have faced challenging cost inflation headwinds, but through price increases and a continued focus on cost discipline and operational efficiencies we have been able to recover the majority of the impact this has had.
The Groups headline operating profit grew 12% to 138.3m.
Our headline operating cash flow has also grown by 15% to 128.7m, supporting our ability to return cash to our shareholders.
As these measures are our core internal financial metrics they form the core annual bonus metrics.
The annual bonus also contains a personal element weighted to 13% of the total that primarily reflects how our executive directors have delivered on our strategic goals, and in particular our investments in growth.
Given the strength of our strategic implementation and the extent to which this has been reflected in financial performance, the outcome under the personal measure of 80% for the CEO and 70% for the CFO are appropriate in the context of the overall performance of the Business.
The annual bonus therefore paid out at 68.5% of maximum for the CEO and 67.2% of maximum for the CFO, of which 35% will be deferred into shares for three years, in line with our approved policy for bonus deferral.
Long-term incentive The Companys principal long-term incentive, the Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP is based on performance against return on capital employed ROCE and earnings per share EPS targets over a three year period.
Our ongoing focus on operating efficiency, margins, and targeted investments in high growth markets has supported earnings development over the three year period despite the challenging environment, resulting in an outcome of 100% under this measure.
Strong returns have also been delivered, helped by the focus on capital investment in specialist markets, and ROCE performance was 78.5% of maximum.

This plan no longer forms part of our active policy and this represents the final vesting under the CIP.
Revised remuneration policy Through the course of the year the Committee has considered carefully our strategic objectives and how our incentive structure as approved at the 2016 AGM supports this.
We also recognise the commentary in the Code that relates to incentive arrangements, and the views of investors and proxy bodies on different models of pay and package structure.
We firmly believe that our current structure continues to be fit for purpose, and we will therefore not be proposing any significant changes to our new policy which we currently anticipate will run to AGM 2022.
In addition, we believe that the structure in totality is well aligned to the purpose and values of the business.
We will however make a number of small amendments to ensure we are aligned with the relevant areas of best practice, including: Increasing our shareholding requirement for the CFO to 200% of salary.
Incorporating a formal two year post-vest holding period for the BIP into our policy.
In recognition of the views of shareholders and the revised Code, our pension provisions for new Executive Directors are being reduced.
The company contribution will be set at the time of appointment to align to that of other employees as part of our ongoing process to align Executive Directors pension to those of the other employees legacy contributions or cash equivalents of up to and including 25% of salary remaining in place for current Executive Directors.
We are further increasing the protection our clawback and malus policy provides through extension of our trigger clauses to include reputational damage.
In reviewing our policy we consulted extensively with our largest shareholders together with proxy agencies, and discussed the rationale for our proposals.
We received an overwhelmingly positive response, recognising the success of our historic remuneration framework in driving exceptional business performance over the last three-year period and the alignment of our new proposals with investor expectations and corporate governance requirements.
We further consulted with shareholders concerning a one-off salary increase of 10% for our Chief Executive reflecting the increased complexity and significant growth of our Company in recent years, coupled with an excellent performance in his role.
However, reflecting feedback received from shareholders, we have decided to amend our original decision and Stephen Harris will instead receive an inflationary increase of 3%, in line with the average increase of the wider UK workforce.
Application of policy for 2019 We set out below a brief overview of our intended application of policy for 2019.
Base salaries: The Committee is also proposing an increase of 3% for the CEO and the CFO in line with the general employee population.
Benefits and pension: There will be no changes to benefits and pension provided to our executive directors.
Annual bonus: The maximum bonus opportunity remains 200% of salary for the CEO and 150% of salary for the CFO, with 35% of any bonus paid being deferred in shares for three years.
The measures and weightings used have been reviewed and we believe a bonus consisting of 77% headline operating profit, 10% headline operating cash management and 13% personal objectives continues to enable the annual bonus to be aligned to the Companys strategy and ensures our executives are focused on delivery of improved profitability and control on working capital.
Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP : Award levels will remain 175% of salary for Executive Directors.
Similarly, measures and weightings have been reviewed and we believe the equal focus on returns and earnings is strongly aligned with our strategic priorities.
The growth of our business and our ability to deliver strong and sustainable returns to investors is based on delivery of an effective deployment of capital in rapid growth areas and on acquisitions, which ROCE and EPS continue to create alignment to.
I trust the information presented in this report enables our shareholders to understand both how we have operated our remuneration policy over the year and the rationale for our decision making.
We remain fully committed to continuing an open and transparent dialogue with our shareholders.
I would welcome your views on our policy, the content of this report or any other items you would like to discuss and I look forward to meeting you and answering any questions you may have at the AGM.

An estimated market price at vesting was used and this was calculated as the three months average from 1 October to 31 December 2018 of 7.68.

Annual performance related bonus The 2018 annual bonus was based on three elements headline operating profit, headline cash management and personal objectives.

Following strong performance in the year the bonus paid out at 68.5% for the CEO and 67.2% for the CFO, 35% of the award will be deferred in shares for both the CEO and the CFO.

Specific focus areas for the CEO were the achievement of year on year growth in Specialist Technologies and emerging market revenues.
In 2018 Specialist Technologies sales grew by 12% on 2017 and emerging markets grew by 21%, in both cases outperforming the objectives.
The Board tasked the CEO with increasing the levels of sales.

The Policy has been revised in order to ensure continued alignment between remuneration and the evolving strategic direction of our business, as well as to ensure alignment with the new UK Corporate Governance Code.
Below is an explanation of how the Bodycote Remuneration Committee has addressed the principles prescribed by the new UK Corporate Governance Code in determining the new Executive Remuneration Policy.

Simplicity remuneration structures should avoid complexity and No significant structural changes to incentive plans are proposed their rationale and operation should be easy to understand.
The Committee concluded that the operation of the deferred Annual Bonus and Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP would remain easy for stakeholders to understand given the prevalence of these structures in the FTSE market and that the rationale for their operation remains unchanged and is clearly set out within the Policy.
Risk remuneration arrangements should ensure reputational and The Committee concluded that there are two principal approaches other risks from excessive rewards, and behavioural risks that can to mitigate these risks: to ensure that remuneration arrangements arise from target-based incentive plans, are identified and mitigated.

As such, no increases to maximum incentive opportunities are proposed in the new Policy and the malus and clawback provisions for the annual bonus and Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP have been extended to include a provision for the action or conduct of a participant which results in reputational damage to the Group.
Predictability the range of possible values of rewards to individual The unpredictability of company performance, including share price directors and any other limits or discretions should be identified and performance, means that the Committee cannot provide certain explained at the time of approving the policy.

However, in order to provide a guideline range of outcomes possible under the Policy, the illustration of application of remuneration policy chart on page 60 indicates the potential impact of share price appreciation on Executive Director pay outcomes for both on-target and maximum performance scenarios.

that the disclosure of BIP performance targets provides a clear link between individual awards and the long-term performance of the Company.
The Policy also provides the Committee with discretion to adjust incentive outcomes so that reward fairly and accurately reflects the performance of the Company over the relevant period.
Alignment to culture incentive schemes should drive The Committee assessed the incentive plans and considered that behaviours consistent with company purpose, values and strategy.

The Committee reviews all outcomes for executive directors and has discretion to adjust outcomes where appropriate.

Discretion In line with the new Corporate Governance Code provision for remuneration policies to enable the use of discretion to override formulaic outcomes, the Committee has discretion in several areas of Policy as set out in this report.
The Committee may also exercise operational and administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules.
In addition, the Committee has the discretion to amend Policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.

Notes to the Remuneration Policy Table The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out on pages 68 to 77 where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the Policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment being agreed at the time the award is granted.
Executive Directors remuneration is reviewed annually and takes into account a number of factors.
The Company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the Company to pay any more than is necessary.
Senior and high performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, which are similar to those offered to the Executive Directors to ensure reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.

Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to the market but which does not require the Company to pay any more than is necessary.
Senior and high-performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, similar to the executive directors to ensure reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when formulating Executive Director pay policies.
However, it does take into account information provided by the Human Resources function on pay and conditions across the Company, and considers these as part of its discussions and decision making, along with feedback from employee satisfaction surveys.
In addition, the Board of Bodycote is developing its approach to engagement with the workforce in line with the guidance in the new Corporate Governance Code and the results of this engagement will be available to the Remuneration Committee.
We recognise the Governments recent commentary in this area, and will ensure that our approach to consideration of employee views and pay and conditions across the Company reflect appropriate legislative and corporate governance requirements.
Statement of consideration of Shareholders Views The Committee always welcomes the views of shareholders in respect of pay policy as well as those views expressed on behalf of shareholders by their respective proxy advisers.
The Committee documents all remuneration related comments made at the Companys AGM and feedback received during consultation with shareholders throughout the year.
Any feedback received is fully considered by the Committee.
In developing the proposed Remuneration Policy for 2019 and beyond the Remuneration Committee engaged extensively with the Companys key shareholders and their representative bodies.
Through this process the Remuneration Committee took on board the feedback received and refined the proposed Remuneration Policy as appropriate to ensure it meets the expectations of our shareholders.
Approach to Recruitment Remuneration When recruiting new Executive Directors, the Companys Policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and experience appropriate to the role to be filled, taking into account remuneration across the Group, including other senior executives, and that offered by other FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar size and complexity.
New Executive Directors will generally be appointed on remuneration packages with the same structure and pay elements as described in the Policy table on pages 68 to 77.
Component Policy General The Companys Policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and experience appropriate to the role to be filled.
The initial notice period may be longer than the Companys one year policy up to a maximum of two years.
However, this will reduce by one month for every month served, until the Companys Policy position is reached.
Base salary Base salary levels will be set at an appropriate level to recruit the best candidate in consideration of the new recruits existing salary, location, skills and experience and expected contribution to the new role, the current salaries of other Executive Directors in the Company and current market levels for the role.
Other benefits Other benefits will be considered in light of the Policy in place for the other Executive Director s. If it is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders, the Committee may consider providing additional benefits.
Pension Pension contribution levels will be considered by the Committee in light of the new recruits package as a whole, market practice at the time and in line with the new provision that Executive Director pension contributions will be in line with Bodycote contribution rates applicable to other employees.
Annual bonus Normal awards will be made under the annual bonus plan in line with the Remuneration Policy.
The Executive Director may be invited to participate in the bonus on a prorated basis in the first year of appointment.
Long-term incentives Normal awards will be made under the BIP in line with the Remuneration Policy.
The Executive Director may be invited to participate in in flight BIP awards on a prorated basis when appointed.
The Company is required to set out the maximum amount of variable pay which could be paid to a new Director in respect of his her recruitment.
In order to provide the Company with sufficient flexibility in a recruitment scenario, the Committee has set this figure as 450% of base salary.
This covers the maximum annual bonus and the maximum face value of any long-term incentive awards.
This level of variable pay would only be available in exceptional circumstances, and in order to achieve such a level of variable pay, stretching targets would need to be met.
For the avoidance of doubt, this 450% variable pay limit excludes the value of any buyout payments or awards associated with forfeited awards.

Such payments may take into account remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attached to that remuneration.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buyout awards which will be forfeited on leaving the previous employer.
Our approach to this is to carry out a detailed review of the awards which the individual will lose and calculate the estimated value of them.
In doing so, we will consider the vesting period, the option exercise period if applicable, whether the awards are cash or share based, performance related or not, the companys recent performance and payout levels and any other factors we consider appropriate.
If a buyout award is to be made, the structure and level will be carefully designed and will generally reflect and replicate the previous awards as accurately as possible.
We will make the award subject to appropriate malus and clawback provisions in the event that the individual resigns or is summarily terminated within a certain time frame.
An explanation will be provided at the time of recruitment of why a buyout award has been granted.
Internal promotions For internal promotions any commitments made prior to appointment may continue to be honoured as the executive is transitioned to the new remuneration arrangements.
Shareholders will be informed of any Director appointment and the individuals remuneration arrangements as soon as practicable following the appointment.
Fee levels for a new Chair or new Non-Executive Directors will be determined in accordance with the Policy set out on page 73.
