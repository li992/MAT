Directors Remuneration Policy This Policy provides details of the remuneration policy for the Directors of the Company.
It was approved at the 2017 AGM and will be subject to shareholder approval at the 2020 AGM.
The Boards policy is that the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors should reflect the responsibilities of the Board, Directors time commitments, the experience of the Board as a whole, and be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts similar in size, capital structure and investment objective.
To this end, the Nomination Committee may engage independent external advisors to provide a formal review of Directors remuneration.
Any changes to fee levels as a result of this review will be subject to an annual review.
The review process involves an analysis of fees paid to Directors of other companies having similar profiles to that of the Company.
This review is submitted to the Nomination Committee and the Directors fees are agreed for the next year subject to approval by the shareholders at the relevant AGM.
A review was carried out this year which recommended an increase of 1,000 for all independent non-executive Directors with an additional increase for the Chairman of 1,000, effective from 1 April 2018.
Directors and Officers liability insurance cover is maintained by the Company, at its expense.
Directors remuneration is not linked to the performance of the Company and Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, long-term incentive schemes or other benefits.
The Directors are entitled to reclaim reasonable expenses incurred in order to perform their duties as Non-Executive Directors for the Company.
Directors are not entitled to payment for loss of office.
