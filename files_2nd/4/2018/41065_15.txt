Directors remuneration report Statement from the Chairman I am pleased to present the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2018.
The Companys auditor is required to verify certain information within this report subject to statutory audit by the Companies Act 2006.
Where information set out below has been audited, it is indicated as such.
As at 31 December 2018 and the date of this report, the Board consists entirely of independent non-executive Directors and the Company has no employees.
The Directors fees for the year are set out as follows: 40,000 per annum for the Chairman, 32,000 per annum for the Chairman of the Audit Committee, 29,000 for the Senior Independent Director and 27,000 for the other Directors.
Directors' fees have not been changed since the launch of the Company in 2015.
During the year, the Board decided to increase fees paid to Directors to better reflect market rates, the time spent on the Companys business and to ensure that candidates of a high calibre are recruited to the Board and retained.
It is important that the Board is fully independent and as such remunerated fairly.
From 1 January 2019, Directors have been paid at the following rates: 46,000 per annum for the Chairman, 35,000 per annum for the Audit Committee Chairman, 33,000 for the Senior Independent Director and 30,000 for the other Directors.
In order to arrive at these figures, the Board consulted with its advisers and reviewed comparator data for other investment trusts in excess of 500m under management.
The fee for the new enlarged role for the Audit Committee Chairman once recruited will be set at a higher level than the current Audit Committee Chairman due to the increased time commitment specified and the increased scope of the role.
The increase in Directors fees remains well within the approved maximum aggregate set out in the Companys Articles of Association of 500,000 per annum.
Ordinary resolutions to approve the Directors remuneration report and Directors remuneration policy will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM to be held on 16 May 2019.
No significant changes are proposed to the way in which its current Directors' Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in 2016 will be implemented during the course of the next financial year.
