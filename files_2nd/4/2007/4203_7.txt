The Group will apply IFRIC 11 from 1 January 2008, but it is not expected to have any Accounting estimates and judgements impact on the Group accounts.
The Groups critical accounting policies under IFRS have been set by management with the approval of theAudit Committee.
Interpretations of existing standards that are not yet effective and not relevant for the Groups operations The application of these policies requires estimates and assumptions to be made concerning the future and judgements to The following interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting be made on the applicability of policies to particular situations.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 or later periods but are not relevant for the Groups operations: based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Under IFRS an estimate or judgement may be considered critical if it involves matters that are i IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements - IFRIC 12 is effective from 1 January 2008 and applies to contractual arrangements whereby a private sector operator participates in the development, financing, operation and maintenance highly uncertain, or where different estimation methods could reasonably have been used, or if changes in the estimate that would have a material impact on the Groups results are likely to occur from period to period.
The critical judgements of infrastructure for public sector services.
IFRIC 12 is not relevant to the Groups operations as none of the Groups companies provide for public sector services.
required when preparing the Groups accounts are as follows: ii IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes - IFRIC 13 clarifies that where goods or services are sold together with i Provisions as disclosed in note 21, the Group has made significant provision for potential environmental liabilities a customer loyalty incentive for example, loyalty points or free products, the arrangement is a multiple-element and for the costs of the restructuring exercise following the acquisition of Uniqema.
The rationale behind these arrangement and the consideration receivable from the customer is allocated between the components of the and other provisions is discussed in note 21.
The directors believe that these provisions are appropriate based on arrangement using fair values.
IFRIC 13 is not relevant to the Groups operations as none of the Groups companies information currently available.
The standard is effective from 1 July 2008. ii Goodwill and fair value of assets acquired the Groups goodwill carrying value increased significantly in 2006 following the acquisition of Uniqema as disclosed in note 28.
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment and Group accounts the Groups goodwill value has been supported by detailed value-in-use calculations relating to the recoverable amounts Subsidiaries of the underlying cash generating units.
These calculations require the use of estimates, however as recoverable amounts Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern significantly exceed carrying values, including goodwill, there is no impairment within a range of assumptions.

In assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are iii Retirement benefit liabilities as disclosed in note 12, the Groups principal retirement benefit schemes are of the included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Year end recognition of the liabilities under these schemes and the valuation of assets held to fund these liabilities require a number of significant assumptions to be made, relating to levels of scheme membership, The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an key financial market indicators such as inflation and expectations on future salary growth and asset returns.
These acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assumptions are made by the Group in conjunction with the schemes actuaries and the directors are of the view that assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their any estimation should be prudent and in line with consensus opinion.
fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
New IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007 The IASB and IFRIC have issued additional standards which are effective for this accounting period.
The following Associates standards and interpretations have been adopted by the Group: Associated undertakings are those companies in which the Group has a beneficial interest of between 20% and 50% in the equity capital and where the Group exercises significant influence over commercial and financial policy decisions.
The i IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements Capital consolidated income statement includes the Groups share of post-acquisition profits after tax, the consolidated statement disclosures These standards introduce new disclosures relating to financial instruments.
The Groups accounting of recognised income and expense includes the Groups share of other recognised gains and losses, and the consolidated policies and notes to the financial statements have been expanded to cover the required disclosures.
balance sheet includes the Groups share of the underlying net tangible assets of associated undertakings.
ii IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 This standard requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments, Intangible assets where the identifiable consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued in order to establish whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2.
This interpretation was not relevant to the Group in 2007.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of iii IFRIC 10 Interim financial reporting and impairment prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim period the consideration given for a business exceeds such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to on goodwill and investments in equity instruments and in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
This interpretation was not applicable to the Group in 2007. is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of this impairment testing.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after New IFRS standards and interpretations not applied 31 December 1997 and prior to 1 January 2004 was amortised over its estimated useful life: such amortisation ceased on The IASB and IFRIC have issued additional standards and interpretations which are effective for periods starting after the 31 December 2003.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made prior to 31 December 1997 was written off directly to reserves date of these financial statements.
The following standards and interpretations have yet to be adopted by the Group: in the year of acquisition, as a matter of accounting policy, and under IFRS 1 and IFRS 3 such goodwill will remain eliminated against reserves and will not be written back to the income statement in the event of disposal.
i IFRS 8 Operating Segments This standard will be applicable in 2009 and replaces IAS 14, aligning segment reporting with the requirements of the US standard SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.
Research and development The new standard requires amanagement approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis Research expenditure, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is as that used for internal reporting purposes.
The Group will apply IFRS 8 from 1 January 2009 but it is not expected to charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure, whereby research findings are applied have any impact on the Group accounts.

Measurement and other uncertainties generally mean that such criteria are not met.
Where, however, the recognition criteria are met, intangible assets are but will be applicable to Croda in 2009.

The option of immediately expensing these borrowing costs will be removed.
The Group will apply IAS 23 Amended from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU, but the standard is Any impairment losses are written off immediately to income.

iii all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
Revenue recognition On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings Sales of goods and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Revenue comprises the fair value for the sale of goods, excludes inter-company sales and value-added taxes and represents net invoice value less estimated rebates, returns and settlement discounts.
Group sales are recognised as revenue in the Taxation period in which the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party.
The charge for taxation is based on the profits for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary Interest and dividend income differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting purposes.
Temporary differences arise Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised from the inclusion of profits and losses in the accounts in different periods from which they are recognised in tax assessments when the right to receive payment is established.
and primarily arise as a result of the difference between tax allowances on tangible fixed assets and the corresponding depreciation charge, and upon the pension fund deficit.
Full provision is made for the tax effects of these differences.
No Segmental reporting provision is made for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit such earnings.
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products and services that are subject to risks Similarly, no provision is made for temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries since realisation of such or returns that are different from those of other segments.
A geographical segment operates within a particular economic differences can be controlled and is not probable in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent environment that is subject to different risks and returns from other economic environments.
that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Employee benefits Exceptional items Pension obligations Exceptional items are non-recurring material items which are outside the normal scope of the Groups ordinary activities The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19Employee Benefits.
In respect of defined benefit plans such as liabilities and costs arising from a fundamental restructuring of the Groups operations.
Such items are disclosed pension plans that define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent separately within the financial statements.
on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation, obligations are measured at discounted present Property, plant and equipment value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the net of the plan obligations and assets.
No allowance is made in the past service liability in respect of Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation, with the exception of assets acquired as part of either the future expenses of running the schemes or for non-service related death in service benefits which may arise in a business combination which are recorded at fair value.
The Groups policy is to write off the difference between the cost the future.
The operating costs of such plans are charged to operating profit and the finance costs are recognised as financial of all property, plant and equipment, except freehold land, and their residual value on a straight line basis over their estimated income or expense as appropriate.
Service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs useful lives.
Reviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual productive assets, are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of taking account of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear, and adjustments are made recognised income and expense.
Payments to defined contribution schemes pension plans under which the Group pays where appropriate.
Under this policy it becomes impractical to calculate average asset lives exactly.
However, the total lives fixed contributions into a separate entity are charged as an expense as they fall due.
range from approximately 15 to 40 years for buildings, and 3 to 15 years for plant and equipment.
All individual assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
By far the bulk of the Other post-retirement benefits Groupsplant and equipmentasset class relates to the value of plant and equipment at the Groups manufacturing facilities, Some Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees.
The entitlement to these benefits is consequently the Group does not seek to analyse out of this class other items such as motor vehicles and office equipment.

The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology Impairment of non-financial assets similar to that for defined benefit pension plans.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of The Group assesses at each year end whether an asset may be impaired.
If any evidence exists of impairment, the estimated recognised income and expense.
These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.
recoverable amount is compared to the carrying value of the asset and an impairment loss is recognised where appropriate.
In addition to this, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
The Group recognises termination Non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either i terminating the employment of current employees according to to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or ii providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made use.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business to encourage voluntary redundancy.
or geographical area of operations.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
Share based payments The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using the Black-Scholes or binomial model as appropriate.
In Leases accordance with IFRS 2Share-based Payments the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting Assets acquired under finance leases are included in the balance sheet under tangible fixed assets at an amount reflecting period of the options.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting as the the fair value of the asset and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their estimated useful lives.
The capital Group does not use market-based performance criteria.
element of future lease rentals is included in creditors.
Finance charges are allocated to the income statement each year in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
The cost of operating leases is charged to the income statement as incurred.
Currency translations Functional and presentation currency Financial risk factors Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.

Regular reports are received from all operating companies Transactions and balances to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate action may be taken.
Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the end of the financial period.
Exchange profits or losses on trading transactions are included in the Group income statement except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash Currency risk flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges, which, along with other exchange differences arising from non-trading The Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with items are dealt with through reserves.

Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Entities in the Group use forward contracts and foreign currency Group companies bank balances to manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation liabilities.
The Groups risk management policy is to hedge transactional risk up to three months forward.
The Group has currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency i assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is not specifically hedged but is reduced primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies where it is efficient to do so.

Cost comprises all expenditure, borrowings at floating interest rates and at 31 December 2007 over 70% of Group borrowings were at floating rates.
The including related production overheads, incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the inventory to its location Group uses interest rate swaps where appropriate and currently has a number of interest rate swaps in place as fair value and condition at the balance sheet date.
Net realisable amount is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business and cash flow hedges of a proportion of borrowings.
The swaps are settled on a six monthly basis with the Group paying or less any applicable variable selling costs.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective inventory where appropriate.

Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities designed to ensure the Group Cash and cash equivalents has sufficient funds available for operations and planned investments.
The Group also has a share buyback programme which Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and short term deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand is managed to ensure the efficiency of the Groups funding structure.

On a regular basis, management monitors forecasts of the Groups cashflows against both internal targets and those targets imposed by external lenders.
As shown in note 27, the Group has substantial committed, unused facilities and the Environmental and restructuring provisions directors are confident this situation will remain the case for the foreseeable future.
The Group is exposed to environmental liabilities relating to its operations and liabilities arising from the restructuring of its operations following the acquisition of Uniqema.

Other dividends are recognised as a and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the liability when the liability is irrevocable.
Accordingly, final dividends are recognised when approved by shareholders and hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
interim dividends are recognised when paid.
ii Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are Investments recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Investments in quoted securities are stated at fair value, being the appropriate quoted market value, with movements in Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect the fair value passing through the income statement.
Investments in unquoted securities are carried fair value unless such profit or loss for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
