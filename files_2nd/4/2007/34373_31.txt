Bonus payments to executive directors for 2006 7 averaged 82% of salary compared to the on target and maximum levels described on page 65.
These bonus levels were individually set reflecting high levels of successful business activity during the year, leading to substantial outperformance for shareholders, very strong and above trend financial results, and the related strong performance of individuals against their specific responsibilities.
In each case both the Company results and individuals contributions were assessed to have beaten the targets agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the year.
The measures used for bonus determination are set out on page 65 of the Remuneration Report.
The accomplishments relative to these measures are set out fully elsewhere in the Annual Report where the activities of the Company in 2006 7 are described.

Since the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 came into force, company accounts are subject to two sets of disclosure requirements in relation to directors pensions rather than one.
The extended Companies Act 1985 requirements have to be observed in addition to, not in place of, the current UK Listing Authority requirements.
The requirements differ slightly and these Regulations are expected to remain in force for the time being.
The three tables shown below provide the details of directors pensions necessary to satisfy the two sets of requirements.
