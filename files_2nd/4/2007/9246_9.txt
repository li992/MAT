Directors remuneration report for the year to 31 December 2007 The Directors remuneration report sets out the Companys policy on the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors together with details of directors remuneration packages and service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee, which met six times during the year, is responsible for recommending to the Board the Companys general policy on remuneration and in particular determining the remuneration packages of the Chairman and the executive directors, and the grant of all options and awards of shares.
The Chairman does not attend discussions on his own remuneration.
The members of the Committee are appointed by the Board and the membership of the Committee is reviewed at least annually.
The Chairman of the Committee is appointed by the Board and cannot be the Chairman of the Board.
The Chief Executive is given notice of all meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Committee, attends the meetings.
The Chief Executive may request that he attends and speaks at Committee meetings.
In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive will be consulted on general policy matters and matters concerning the other executive directors and employees.
The written Terms of Reference are available on the Companys website and from the Company on request.
They will also be on display at the Annual General Meeting.
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Mr A J Reading, comprises the Chairman, Mr N J Keen, and Sir Christopher Hum, Professor Michael Kelly, Mr A M Robb and Dr W R Spivey, all independent non-executive directors.
Mr Keen is a member of the Committee because the Board considers it essential that the Chairman be involved in setting remuneration policy.
Mr D J L Hudson, the Company Secretary, acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Board, as a whole, is responsible for setting the remuneration of the non-executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee has during the past year retained Watson Wyatt Limited to provide independent external professional advice.
Watson Wyatt Limited also provide pension actuarial services to The Laird Group and to the Trustees of two of The Laird Group pension schemes.
The Remuneration Committee has also sought the views of the Chief Executive, Mr P J Hill, during the year.
Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the Board has established a policy for the non-executive directors.
Executive Directors The current policy for providing remuneration for the executive directors is to have an incentive driven remuneration package which promotes the alignment of interests of executive directors and shareholders.
That policy is based upon the following principles: the need to link remuneration to achieving strategic objectives and to sustainable long-term corporate success having due regard to environmental, social and governance issues: the reward opportunity offered to executive directors should be sufficiently competitive to recruit and retain management of the appropriate calibre and experience: and the need to provide a total compensation package which reflects the international complexity of the Groups operations.
The executive directors receive base salary, annual performance awards up to a maximum percentage of base salary, pensions and other benefits, and long term performance awards.
Base salaries, benefits and performance awards of the executive directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
Base salaries are determined with reference to an appropriate comparator group of companies which is reviewed annually.
Benefits comprise the provision of a car or car allowance, life, disability and health insurance, participation in the annual performance scheme and membership of a pension scheme.
Neither performance incentive awards nor benefits in kind are pensionable.
Performance linked incentives are a key component of the total remuneration package.
Since 2003, the Remuneration Committee has granted options and awards under its executive share option plans and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
A summary of these arrangements is set out below.
The Committee believes that a combination of Share Option Plans and the LTIP for senior executives is the most appropriate way of providing the incentive to create substantial improvement in the Companys performance in a way that aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.
A proposal will be put to shareholders to establish a share price improvement plan for the executive directors aimed at rewarding exceptional performance over a five year period.
Details of the plan are contained in the notice convening the 2008 Annual General Meeting.
Service Agreements Each of the executive directors has a service agreement.
Messrs Hill and Silvers service agreements are dated 8 March 2004.
Mr Rapps service agreement is dated 31 December 2004.
In line with the Companys policy, the executive directors service agreements are not for a fixed term and provide for twelve months written notice of termination from either party.
Mr Rapps service agreement is with Laird Technologies, Inc. and he has a separate letter dated 7 March 2008 from the Company in respect of his appointment as an executive director.
In 2006, the terms of employment for the executive directors in the UK were amended to change the contractual retirement date from age 60 to age 65 to comply with the Employment Equality Age Regulations 2006 which came into force in the UK on 1 October 2006.
The executives may still retire at age 60 with their retirement benefits unchanged from the previous arrangements.
The Companys policy on termination is to comply with the contractual terms and conditions set out in the service agreement.
The Company may, at its election, make a payment in lieu of notice.
The payment would be calculated as the total of the directors base salary plus the value of his benefits, in each case by reference to the period of the unexpired notice of termination.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts but their appointments are subject to review every three years and the rotation provisions of the Companys Articles of Association.
Shareholding Guidelines Shareholding guidelines, under which executive directors will be expected to retain as shares all of the after-tax profit on the gains made on the vesting of Long Term Incentive Plan awards and the exercise of existing or future executive share options, until they have acquired a shareholding equal in value to their base salaries, were introduced in 2003.
At 31 December 2007, Messrs Hill, Silver and Rapp owned shares equivalent to a multiple of 1.46, 2.97 and 0.98 of their base salaries respectively.
The Laird Group PLC 45 Directors remuneration report continued for the year to 31 December 2007 Non-Executive Directors The Laird Groups policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and experience that is relevant to The Laird Groups global businesses.
In this context, it is the Boards policy for the non-executive directors to be paid a level of fee that reflects market conditions and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience.

He was entitled to retain the fees of 41,000 and 4,800 respectively, which were paid in addition to the above.
Mr Rapp was a non-executive director of Kionix, Inc during the year and he was entitled to retain fees of 14,993 paid in addition to the above.
Mr Silver was appointed a non-executive director of INVESCO Income Growth Trust plc on 1 August 2007 and he was entitled to retain fees of 7,500 paid in addition to the above.
Executive directors salaries were reviewed on 1 July 2007, with those of Messrs Hill, Rapp and Silver being increased by 5%, 15% and 5% respectively.
The Remuneration Committee took account of the individuals and the Companys performance, as well as an analysis prepared by Watson Wyatt of salaries and compensation of both a comparator group and a wider spread of companies.
The increasing complexity and breadth of Lairds operations and, in the case of Mr Rapp, the increased scale of Laird Technologies business and operations were also considered.
Mr Rapps base, performance and pension related compensation is denominated in US dollars and the figures above are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for each year.
Annual Performance Incentive Awards The awards in 2007 for the executive directors were determined by the Remuneration Committee.
For the UK executive directors, up t o a maximum of 100% of base salary could be earned for exceptional performance and for Mr Rapp the maximum was 125%.
Actual awards as a percentage of base salary in respect of 2007 for Messrs Hill, Rapp and Silver were 91%, 115% and 91% respectively.
The potential level of awards made in 2007 took into account the underlying financial performance of both the Laird Group and of its principal operating division, Laird Technologies, and the strategic development of the Company.
Awards made have been at the high end of the range reflecting the significant improvement in underlying profit before tax in 2007 to 76.8 million, with underlying profit before tax from continuing operations up 59% compared with 2006.
The Committee also considered a number of criteria designed to assess performance against a number of key strategic objectives.
These benefits are not disclosed for reasons of commercial sensitivity.
Of particular importance were the successful divestiture of Laird Security Systems and the significant increase in shareholder value during the year: for 2007, the increase in the Companys total shareholder return made it the best performer in the FTSE Electrical and Electronics Equipment Sector.
For 2008, the annual performance incentive awards will take into account environmental, social and corporate governance issues.
Pensions Mr Rapp, who is based in the USA, is a member of an employee managed defined contribution program to which Laird Technologies, Inc. makes a 50% match of the members contributions up to 6% of gross earnings.
The amount paid in by Laird Technologies in 2007 was 3,373.
In addition, Mr Rapp receives a taxable cash payment of 30% of base salary in lieu of any additional pension.
Messrs Hill and Silver are members of a UK Group contributory defined benefits plan, which is supplemented, where necessary, by unfunded arrangements to maintain the same level of benefits as if the earnings cap maintained in the defined benefits plan did not apply.
The main benefits are: on pension retirement at age sixty, a maximum pension of two thirds final salary excluding bonuses and other benefits dependent on service: on death in retirement, a dependants pension of 60% of the members pension: on death in service, a lump sum of four times salary and a dependants pension of 20% of salary or 60% of the members expected pension, if higher.
Following the introduction of the A Day legislation in April 2006, Mr Silvers pension has ceased to accrue within the defined benefits plan.
In light of the Companys previous pension commitment to Mr Silver, he now receives a taxable salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of future pension accrual under the pension plan.
This is expected to be cost neutral for the Company and will reduce future pension risks for the Company.
Payments in lieu of pension provision are excluded from the calculation of bonus entitlements and share scheme awards.
Pensions in payment for Messrs Hill and Silver will increase by the lesser of the increase in the retail price index or 8.5% per annum compound.
Transfer values provided on leaving service do not include any allowances for discretionary benefits.

The changes in transfer value reflect the normal build-up of pension under the scheme, and changes in market conditions.
Mr Silver ceased to accrue further pension benefits from 6 April 2006, however, his benefits accrued at that date remain linked to any growth in his pensionable pay.
Share Plans The Company currently operates two share incentive schemes for the executive directors, the Long Term Incentive Plan and Share Options, as the Remuneration Committee believes that this is the most appropriate way of providing the incentive to create substantial improvement in the Companys performance in a way that aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.
a Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan involves the award of shares which only vest after the achievement of demanding performance targets measured over three years.
Executives are eligible for annual awards of shares.
The maximum annual award value under the Plan is one times base salary.
In setting the level of awards the Remuneration Committee takes into account options granted to executives under the 2003 executive share option plans in the same financial year.
The extent to which awards granted under the Plan in 2007 vest will be determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return relative to FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts and the following targets will apply: Total Shareholder Return Amount of Award Vesting Performance Level % Upper Quartile Full vesting Median to Upper Quartile Pro rata between 30% and full vesting Below Median Nil These performance conditions will be measured only over a single three year period.
There is no provision for retesting.
In addition, no awards will vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance.
The Long Term Incentive Plan may use either market purchased shares or new issue shares, provided that any new shares issued will count against the overall dilution limit.
Awards under the plan in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 took the form of nil cost options or conditional awards in order to comply with US tax legislation, to be satisfied by shares from The Laird Group 1990 Employee Benefit Trust the Trust purchased in the market.
Further details on the Trust are on page 50.
Awards made in 2004 lapsed at the end of 2006 as the performance criterion for total shareholder return was not met.
The awards made in 2005 will vest on 18 March 2008.
The amount of award vesting as determined by the total shareholder return performance level is 85.7%.
The awards in 2007 were made at one times base salary on 15 May 2007 and were calculated with reference to a share price of 587.50p the closing mid-market share price on that day.
They will, apart from Mr Rapps awards, be exercisable between 15 May 2010 and 15 May 2012, to the extent to which the performance criteria are met.
Mr Rapps award will vest automatically on 15 May 2010 once the performance criteria have been met.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, outstanding awards may become exercisable before their normal vesting date in the event of a change of control of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee made these awards at one times base salary as it considered that this, together with awards under the Share Option Schemes described below, should be at this level to promote the interests of executives and shareholders in the continuing delivery of above market growth in shareholder value that the Company has achieved in recent years.
The amount charged to the income statement during the year in respect of the Long Term Incentive Plan granted to the executive directors was 625,000.
The directors interests in the Long Term Incentive Plan are as follows: Vested Awards Exercised Lapsed 1.1.
Mr Hill sold 133,274 shares and retained the balance and Mr Silver sold 96,870 shares and retained the balance.
The market price at the time of exercise was 599.86p and the notional gains were 922,433.79 and 610,714.82 for Messrs Hill and Silver respectively.
Under the terms of the Scheme, unlike the Share Options described below which are exercisable up to seven years from the date of vesting, the nil cost options under the Long Term Incentive Plan are only exercisable up to two years from the date of vesting and therefore these options needed to be exercised by June 2008.
The breakdown of outstanding awards are: Number of nil cost options conditional awards as at 31 December Date of Grant 2007 Exercise period P J Hill 18.3.
10 194,902 Mr Rapps conditional awards vest automatically, in order to comply with US tax legislation.
b Share Options The executive directors have outstanding options under the 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive Share Option Plan No.
The 1994 scheme was replaced by new share option schemes approved by shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting.
Since May 2001 the basis for calculation of the maximum grant of options to executive directors and other employees is the equivalent of shares with a market value at the time of grant of up to one times salary in any one year and up to two times salary in special circumstances, such as the recruitment or promotion to a key management position.
1994 Share Option Scheme The 1994 scheme granted options over new shares to be issued at the time of exercise and also over existing shares.
The exercise of options under the 1994 scheme is dependent upon the attainment of performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee.
The scheme permitted the grant of both approved and unapproved options.
Options were granted at the closing middle market price on the last dealing day prior to grant and are exercisable after three years but not more than ten years from the date of grant.
The performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee for grants made in 2002, the last year in which options were granted under this Scheme, is that the increase in earnings per share must not be less than the increase in the rate of United Kingdom Retail Price Inflation plus an average of 3% per annum over a three year period.
In 2006 the Committee reviewed the performance conditions and agreed that the earnings per share target had been met and that there had been a significant and sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company.
The directors interests in options under the 1994 executive share option scheme in respect of new shares to be issued are shown in the table below: Exercised Lapsed 1.1.
He sold 28,727 and retained the balance.
The market price at the time of exercise was 546.696p and the notional gain was 49,104.03.
Had they not been exercised, these options would have lapsed on 8 September 2007.
48 The Laird Group PLC The 2003 Executive Share Option Plans There are two plans which were approved by shareholders in 2003.
One plan permits the grant of options approved by Her Majestys Revenue and Customs to be made to individuals who may be eligible for capital gains tax relief on the exercise of options: otherwise both plans are identical in all material respects.
The value of shares under options granted to an executive in any financial year are limited, to one times base salary, unless there are exceptional circumstances e. g. a high level recruitment, in which case the limit is twice base salary.
When granting options, the Remuneration Committee takes into account both the level of awards made to executives under the new Long Term Incentive Plan and the prevailing share price.
The performance criteria used since 2003 has been to measure the increase in earnings per share against the rate of UK retail price inflation plus a specified percentage per annum over a fixed three year period.
The Committee considers that a consistent and real rate of growth in earnings per share is an appropriate performance target as it is a good guide to the underlying financial performance of The Laird Group.
The rules of the 2003 plan permit the waiver of performance criteria in certain limited circumstances, such as a change of control, death or retirement.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, outstanding options may become exercisable before their normal exercise date in the event of a change of control of the Company.
The performance conditions under the plans are based on the Companys earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which do not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance.
Applicable Performance Target: Average Annual growth in earnings Tier of Option Grant per share in excess of inflation Up to 0.5 x salary UK RPI 3% per annum 0.5 x salary 1 x salary UK RPI 3% to 5% per annum applied and above pro rata to the multiple of salary The performance conditions are measured over a three year period.
To the extent that the performance conditions have not been met after three years, the options will lapse.
In order to allow for the grant of options to employees who are not executive directors, there is an overall dilution limit of 10% of the ordinary share capital in issue from time to time for allocations in respect of newly issued shares over a ten year period under these plans and all other share schemes operated by the Company.
In considering whether share options granted in 2004 should vest in 2007, the Remuneration Committee considered not just whether the performance criteria described above had been met, but also the absolute level of growth in underlying earnings per share over the three year period.
This showed that average annual growth in underlying earnings per share over the three year period was approximately 33%, which the Remuneration Committee considered did represent a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group.
Mr Rapp exercised options over 106,051 shares at a price of 195p per share and 74,236 shares at 271p per share, all of which were sold at 599.92p: he then acquired 7,000 shares at a price of $11.92 601p per share.
The gain on the exercise was 673,591.
Mr Silver exercised options over 40,000 shares at a price of 195p: all of the shares were sold at 599.92p giving a gain of 161,966.
The aggregate of actual and notional gains made by the directors on the exercise of options during the year was 2,417,810.
The targets shown above applied for options granted in 2007 and the earnings per share growth is measured from a base point of 31.7p.
The awards in 2007 were made at one times base salary as the Remuneration Committee considered that this, together with awards under the LTIPs as described above, should be at this level to clearly promote the continuing delivery of above market growth in shareholder value that the Company has achieved in recent years.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of the share option plans granted to the executive directors was 296,000.
The directors interests in options under the 2003 executive share option No.
1 plan in respect of new shares to be issued are shown in the table below: Granted Exercised Lapsed 1.1.
The performance criterion is that the average annual growth in the Companys earnings per share is at least UK RPI plus 3% to 5% per annum applied pro rata to the multiple of salary at time of grant for the three year period ending 31 December 2009.
For grants of options to be made in 2008 the criterion is that the average growth in the Companys earnings per share is at least UK RPI 5% to 7.5% per annum applied pro rata to the multiple of salary at date of grant for the three year period ending 31 December 2010.
The Laird Group PLC 49 Directors remuneration report continued for the year to 31 December 2007 The breakdown of the outstanding options is shown in the table below: Number of shares under option as at Exercise 31 December 2007 price p Exercise period P J Hill 1994 Executive Scheme 236,357 161 10.12.05-10.12.12 2003 Executive No.
The middle market share price at 31 December 2007 the last business day of the year was 580p.
During the year the share price was in the range 417.48p adjusted for the 8 for 9 share consolidation which occurred on 11 June 2007 to 635p.
The Laird Group 1990 Employee Benefit Trust the Trust The Trust purchases and holds shares in The Laird Group to meet the requirements of share option awards and grants under the Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Trust, which is financed by a loan of 1.9m from the Company, currently holds 610,087 ordinary shares of which 579,048 shares relate to the Long Term Incentive Plan.
The balance of the shares is unallocated.
Currently there are no outstanding share options to be satisfied by the Trust.
Whilst shares are held within the Trust, the voting rights in respect of those shares are exercisable by the trustee, in accordance with its fiduciary duties.
Independent Non-executive Directors Chairman Under an arrangement between the Company and Imperialise Limited, Mr Keen is retained to act as Chairman of the Company.
Mr Keens fees for his services, for which he must account to Imperialise Limited, are 175,000 per annum.
Imperialise is responsible for Mr Keens National Insurance and is paid a sum equivalent to the National Insurance on those fees of 22,400, for which it accounts to Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC whereas National Insurance in respect of the non-executive directors is paid directly to HMRC.
NI payments are not included in the table overleaf.
Mr Keens initial period of appointment as Chairman was for three years commencing 5 June 2000.
