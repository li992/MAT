Elements of Remuneration in determining the remuneration package of each Executive Director the Committee considers five main elements, each of which is benchmarked against the external market.
the benchmarking process draws comparisons across a wide range of organisations, predominantly major uK listed public companies including utility companies.
Benchmarking also involves consultation with the Committees external advisors and commercial providers of remuneration surveys.
Base Pay Base pay and benefits in kind are reviewed annually.
the Committee aims to maintain individual salaries at or about the market median, taking into account experience, level of responsibility and individual performance.
the base pay of Executive Directors and senior staff was last reviewed as at 1 July 2006. the current annual base salary levels for the Executive Directors are as follows: Bill Coley 660,000 and stephen Billingham 415,000.
Annual Performance Incentive Plan With the exception of Bill Coley, the Committee has not historically operated an annual performance incentive plan for the Executive Directors.
part of the Lt plan is, however, paid as cash.
During 2006 07, Bill Coley was entitled to a maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of base salary, as indicated in last years report.
the targets set by the Committee for 2006 07 were: 50% 100% output 63tWh 68tWh uCLF 5tWh 3tWh As these targets were not met, no bonus was paid to Bill Coley for 2006 07.
For the financial year commencing 1 April 2007, a new annual bonus plan will be introduced for the Executive Directors under which the maximum potential bonus opportunity will be set at 150% of salary for each Executive Director with the performance targets reflecting the groups focus on improved operational performance.
the targets that will apply for the forthcoming year will focus on some or all of the following: outage quality, unplanned losses, unit operating margin, revenue generation, cost control, plant life extension and project delivery.
the weighting of the selected measures will be tailored to the individual and their responsibilities.
Material out-performance of budget will be required for bonus payments towards the maximum with all bonus targets underpinned by a safety condition.
if the minimum safety threshold is not met, no bonuses will become payable.
Share Options and Incentive Schemes LT Plan the Finance Director and three other senior staff participate in the Lt plan.
the table below shows the targets, relative weightings and outturn appropriate to the Lt plan for 2006 07. the maximum level of award for financial year 2006 07 was 420% of salary.

2 the Committee resolved that notwithstanding the threshold group target, if output was less than 63tWh or uCLF performance was greater than 5tWh then there would be no award.
on the basis of the details above no award was made under the Lt plan for 2006 07. r E M u n E r At i o n C o M M i t t E E r E p o r t British EnErgy group plc Annual report and Accounts 2006 07 35 remuneration Committee report for the year ended 31 March 2007 no further awards will be made under the Lt plan and the Anglo American Committee intends that it will be replaced with a revised longAntofagasta term incentive plan if shareholder approval is given at the Anglo pacific Companys 2007 AgM.
Bg group Bhp Billiton Chief Executive Incentive Arrangements Bp Bill Coley has historically not participated in the Lt plan and Burren Energy been subject to a separate set of incentive arrangements as Cairn Energy disclosed last year.
his incentive arrangements have been Dana petroleum participation in the annual performance incentive plan Drax group disclosed above and grants of share options.
international power JKX oil & gas in addition to the grant of options made to Bill Coley on 20 Kazakhmys December 2005 as indicated in last years report a further Lonmin grant of options worth two times salary was made to him on premier oil 24 november 2006.
Details of options granted are shown in rangold resources the table on page 39. rio tinto scottish & southern Energy Both grants of options are subject to a performance shell condition based on nuclear output during the 2007 08 tullow oil financial year.
the original intention had been to align the Vedanta resources targets to the Lt plan target set for that year.
however, with Venture production the proposal to replace the Lt plan with a performance share Xstrata plan, the Committee have set targets specifically for this option grant.
the targets have been set as a sliding scale.
the vesting schedule to apply to awards is set out below: the minimum target has been set at a level that is rank of British Energys Level of vesting commensurate with the business plan target for nuclear tsr against comparator group % of total award output set for the year 2007 08 and its achievement will result in 75% of the options vesting.
the maximum target Less than median 0 requires performance significantly ahead of the threshold Median 25 level and its achievement will result in the entire option upper quartile 100 award vesting.
if the minimum target is not achieved then, Between median and no options will vest.
the Committee does not consider it upper quartile 25 to 100 straight line prorating appropriate to disclose the actual targets at this time for commercial reasons.
however, the targets will be disclosed in the Committees report next year.
use of a tsr performance condition is considered to provide the clearest alignment between shareholders and the Committee does not intend to make any further share management and, when considered in tandem with the option awards to Bill Coley who will, in future years, performance targets set under the annual bonus plan, participate in the new long-term incentive arrangements along provides a balanced focus between the delivery of immediate with the other members of the senior team.
