39 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Directors remuneration report For the year ended 31 December 2007 This report, prepared by the Remuneration Committee the Committee on behalf of the Board, has been prepared pursuant to Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 and the Listing Rules issued by the Financial Services Authority.
Remuneration Committee Membership The Committee comprised the following independent non-executive directors during the financial year to 31 December 2007: David Felwick CBE Committee Chairman Sharon Hintze Louise Makin Ian Ramsay retired 10 May 2007 Christine Cross was appointed as an additional member of the Committee on 21 January 2008.

Role The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility for reviewing and recommending the pay and benefits and contractual arrangements of the Chairman, executive directors and the Company Secretary and for overseeing the Groups share plans and bonus schemes.
The Committee recommends and monitors the structure and levels of remuneration for senior managers throughout the Group and ensures that contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, are fair to the individual and the Company, ensuring that failure is not rewarded and that the departing managers duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised.
It is committed to principles of accountability and transparency to ensure that remuneration arrangements demonstrate a clear link between reward and performance.
In its work, the Committee considers fully the principles and provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and its terms of reference are available on the Groups website: www.

Remuneration policy Broad policy The broad policy of the Board and the Committee is to continue to set remuneration levels so as to attract and retain high-calibre executives and to encourage and to reward superior business performance.
Remuneration for executive directors is intended to reward against criteria that are relevant and realistic but also challenging, so that superior performance is encouraged.
Therefore, remuneration policy is reviewed annually and focuses on performance-related incentives, as well as annual salary, to encourage the alignment of operating objectives as well as delivering shareholder value.
Annual salaries continue to be rigorously tested and reviewed and set at levels not normally exceeding median.
In relation to bonuses and long-term incentive plans, the policy will continue to be to provide an opportunity for executives to earn total remuneration packages in the upper quartile range, provided that stretching and demanding performance conditions are met.
The Committee have reviewed all aspects of the remuneration policy, including pay benchmarking for the most senior roles and consideration of the performance measures used, and have not made any changes to the remuneration policy adopted in 2005.
The remuneration policy in place for senior executives is designed to place emphasis on key performance objectives and strengthening executive shareholding.
While committed to the use of equity-based performance-related remuneration as a means of aligning directors interests with those of shareholders, the Committee is aware of shareholders concerns on dilution through the issue of new shares to satisfy such awards.
Therefore, when reviewing remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into account the effects such arrangements may have on dilution.
In determining the remuneration arrangements for executive directors, the Committee is sensitive to the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group, especially when determining base salary increases.
Share ownership A minimum shareholding requirement was introduced in 2006 whereby executive directors are required after three years to hold shares with a market value at least equal to their annual basic salary.
At 31 December 2007, Mr Schofield held shares with a total market value equivalent to 4.01 times his annual basic salary and Mr Thomas held shares with a total market value equivalent to 3.25 times his annual basic salary.
Remuneration for executive directors The Committee considers that the remuneration package of an executive director should be aligned closely with the interests of shareholders and, therefore, that a significant proportion of the remuneration package should be performance related.
41 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 In arriving at the balance between fixed and variable remuneration it is agreed that the fixed portion will relate only to annual salary, whilst the variable portion includes both annual bonuses and long-term incentive arrangements.
It is the Committees policy that, for 2008, the balance between fixed and variable remuneration for the executive directors shall be as follows: At Target At Maximum Chief Executive Officer 40% Fixed : 60% Variable 13% Fixed : 87% Variable Finance Director 44% Fixed : 56% Variable 16% Fixed : 84% Variable Base salaries Basic salary for executive directors takes into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual.
This is normally reviewed annually unless responsibilities change.
Salary levels are set with reference to the relevant marketplace for companies of a comparable size and complexity, and for 2008 have been set at 606,900 2007:595,000 for the Chief Executive and 408,000 2007: 400,000 for the Finance Director.
Annual bonus At the discretion of the Committee, executive directors are eligible to receive an annual bonus subject to the achievement of performance targets which are set each year by the Committee.
Bonus potentials are set on an individual basis.
Executive directors are required to defer 50% of any such bonus earned into shares in the Company until they have built up a significant personal shareholding in the Company see page 40.
The deferred bonus shares will normally vest three years after their award.
Generally, the deferred bonus shares will not be forfeitable.
However, in the event that the executives employment is terminated by reason of his gross misconduct or by reason of a material breach of his employment contract, his deferred bonus shares may, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, be forfeited.
For 2008, the annual bonus potentials are set at 100% of salary for Mr Schofield and 75% for Mr Thomas, with a target level of 50% of salary and remain unchanged from 2007.
The performance targets will be based on profit before tax and growth in branded sales.
In 2007 Mr Schofield and Mr Thomas were paid discretionary bonuses of 125,000 and 75,000 respectively in recognition of their contribution to the successful acquisitions of Campbells and RHM.
Pensions Mr Thomas is a member of the Premier Foods Pension Scheme PFPS which is a funded, registered, scheme that provides benefits on a defined benefit final salary basis and is contracted out of the State Second Pension.
Under the PFPS he accrues benefit at the rate of 1 45th of final salary for each year of pensionable service.
Final salary is subject to a Scheme earnings cap equivalent to that previously imposed by the Finance Act 1989.
Mr Schofield elected for enhanced protection under the Finance Act 2004 with effect from 6 April 2006, and no longer accrues benefits under the Scheme.
Instead Mr Schofield receives a payment in lieu of pension accrual which is included in his salary.
His benefit accrued up to 6 April 2006 continues to be linked to his final salary, subject to the Scheme earnings cap.
Further details of pension arrangements can be found on page 48.
Other benefits Each executive director is entitled to a car and telecommunication services and an allowance for personal tax and financial planning.
Each executive director is also provided with private health cover and permanent health insurance.
Mr Thomas is entitled to a housing allowance of 18,303 p. a.
Other directorships The Group is supportive of executive directors who wish to take on a non-executive directorship with a publicly quoted company in order to broaden their experience.
They are entitled to retain any fees they may receive.
Neither Mr Schofield nor Mr Thomas currently serves as a director of another public company.
Share Plans Following the acquisition on RHM during 2007, the Company implemented new long-term incentive arrangements for executive directors and key senior executives, after the Committee determined that the size and scale of the transaction justified a review of the Companys existing remuneration arrangements.
The CIP is intended to be the primary long-term incentive arrangement for executive directors and other key individuals and looks to ensure that those who are most able to have a real impact on performance are sufficiently and appropriately incentivised.
The Premier Foods LTIP will be retained for the purposes of incentivising other members of senior management.
It is intended that individuals will not be invited to participate in both plans in the same year other than in exceptional circumstances e. g. in relation to recruitment.
There is currently no intention to grant further options to executive directors under the Premier Foods plc Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, other than in exceptional circumstances.
42 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Directors remuneration report continued In 2007 the Company also adopted the Premier Group Performance Share Plan PSP.
The awards granted under this plan were made to individuals previously employed by RHM and replaced awards previously made under the RHM Group Performance Share Plan that lapsed on the date of the completion of the RHM acquisition.
There is currently no intention to grant further awards under the PSP, other than in exceptional circumstances.
Awards made under the CIP, LTIP, ESOS and PSP are all subject, in part, to Total Shareholder Return TSR based performance conditions.
All TSR measurements for the purposes of calculating vesting under the relevant plans will be calculated on an independent basis by Deloitte.
Co-Investment Plan The CIP requires participants to commit and retain a significant amount of capital in the form of Premier Foods shares.
The purpose of the commitment is so that the participants are encouraged to adopt the attitudes of shareholders.
CIP participation is restricted to individuals who will have a real and measurable impact on the delivery of Group performance targets and long-term growth in shareholder value.
Based on the current senior team of Premier, this is considered to be 12 to 15 individuals including the executive directors.
However, this number may grow to reflect executive responsibilities, but shall not be more than 20 in any one Plan cycle.
Participants in the CIP will not be eligible for participation in any other form of discretionary share plan operated in the same year other than in exceptional circumstances.
The CIP is structured as a share matching plan.
An investment of shares pledged or purchased by the participant can be matched by Company-provided shares on the basis of the achievement of the performance targets over a three year period.
To the extent that the performance conditions are achieved, then the level of Company matching of the purchased pledged shares is enhanced.
At the maximum level of performance, a match of 3:1 i. e. 300% Company shares is provided for the achievement of exceptionally stretching performance criteria.
At the time awards vest under the CIP participants will be required to retain no less than half of the vested matching shares until such time that they are no longer an employee of the Company.
The Committee will decide the maximum level of individual share purchases or pledges that may be made within the terms of the CIP, taking account of Company and individual performance.
At the discretion of the Committee, the maximum level of invested shares pledged or purchased by executive directors is 200% of salary.
In respect of the 2007 grant cycle for the CIP, Mr Schofield was invited to pledge into the plan shares up to a value of 200% of salary and Mr Thomas up to a value of 150% of salary.
Both Mr Schofield and Mr Thomas decided to pledge up to the full level of invitation.
At tiers of participation below executive director level, the level of investment from the employee will be set at a maximum of 100% of base salary.
In subsequent years of the CIPs operation, the Committee will decide the appropriate level of share purchase pledge, and the associated match up to a maximum of 3:1, taking full account of Company and personal performance at that time.
For the 2008 grant cycle, Mr Schofield and Mr Thomas will be invited to pledge or purchase into the scheme shares up to the value of 200% and 150% of salary respectively.
Performance will be measured on the basis of strong EPS growth and by delivering shareholder returns ahead of those provided by the market.
The Committee therefore agreed a performance target for the CIP awards which was based on a combination of EPS growth performance measured in absolute real terms, and performance against the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a three year period.
Following the publication of ABI guidelines in 2007 which recommended that lengthy averaging periods should be avoided when calculating TSR the Committee has agreed that for awards under the CIP made in 2008 and future years a 3 month TSR averaging period will be adopted.
5.0% 8.0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 50% 100% 100% 150% 200% 5.0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 50% 100% 100% 150% 10th 20th 30th 40th 50th 60th 70th 80th 90th Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile TSR against FTSE 250 index constituents 43 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 It should be noted that a combination of truly exceptional real annual EPS growth and TSR market out-performance is required for the maximum match.
The Committee believes that the performance scale represents a truly exceptional level of stretch which will require a confluence of both internal and external factors.
There will be no retesting of performance conditions under the CIP.
To the extent that performance conditions are not met on the vesting date, all matching awards shall lapse.
The Company believes that this performance matrix remains robust and therefore intends to apply the same condition in respect of awards to be granted in 2008.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards under the LTIP have been made since 2005 see page 47.
The executive directors will not participate in future awards.
Following the approval and implementation of the CIP, the Committee also reviewed the performance conditions of the LTIP.
The Committee has decided that the performance conditions used for the CIP will also apply to the LTIP, in order to align all levels of senior management.
Vesting of awards under the LTIP will therefore be subject to a combination of EPS growth and TSR-based performance conditions, as measured over a three-year period.
The vesting schedule for the CIP as detailed above will also apply to future awards made under the LTIP, with the exception that no investment shares will be required in order to qualify for matching shares.
As with the CIP for awards under the LTIP made in 2008 and future years a 3 month TSR averaging period will be adopted.
The maximum value of initial awards under the LTIP will be 33.3% of base salary with the potential to achieve up to three times this award i. e. 300% match for exceptional EPS and TSR performance.
As in previous years, awards for full vesting therefore remain capped at 100% of base salary.
As with the CIP, there will be no retesting of performance conditions under the LTIP.
To the extent that performance conditions are not met on the vesting date, LTIP awards shall lapse.
The Committee may determine that alternative secondary performance conditions might apply for future awards under the LTIP.
Premier Group Performance Share Plan As part of the process of ensuring a successful integration of the RHM business into the Premier Foods group, during the year former RHM employees who held outstanding RHM share awards were given the opportunity to receive proportionate replacement Premier Foods awards.
As previously disclosed, the size of these special rollover awards correspond to the 2005 and 2006 RHM PSP awards which lapsed due to the pro-rating of the awards, as a result of the acquisition.
The performance conditions applicable to these replacement awards are identical to the performance conditions on outstanding Premier Foods LTIP awards for the equivalent performance periods see above.
The Committee believes that this is the most appropriate way of aligning all levels of senior management throughout the enlarged Premier Foods Group.
The awards replacing the 2005 RHM PSP awards will ordinarily vest in July 2008, subject to continued employment and the same performance conditions as applied to the 2005 LTIP awards.
Similarly, the awards replacing the 2006 RHM PSP awards will ordinarily vest in July 2009, subject to continued employment and the same performance conditions as applied to the 2006 LTIP award.
The current intention is that no further awards will be granted under the PSP, other than in exceptional circumstances.
44 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Directors remuneration report continued Share options The Premier Foods plc Executive Share Option Scheme the ESOS The Company adopted the ESOS at the time of Admission.
Options granted under the ESOS may be exercised between three and 10 years after grant provided that the applicable performance criteria have been met.
Options were granted to executive directors under the ESOS at the time of flotation in 2004.
The grants were split into three portions, each subject to a stretching performance condition.
Two of the portions representing 50% of the total award are subject to a performance condition based on TSR, and the third portion representing the other 50% of the total award is subject to a performance condition based on adjusted EPS.
The performance conditions which are summarised in the table below were chosen because they align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders.
TSR: against select TSR: against FTSE 250 comparator group EPS 25% of Option 25% of Option 50% of Option 50% of the above portion vests for median Full vesting of the above portion if Increase in adjusted earnings performance, rising on a straight-line basis the Company is in first or second per share must be equal or to full vesting for upper quartile performance.

None of the above portion if the Company is below fourth position.
No retesting No retesting One retest at end of fourth year from same base year In respect of the 2004 ESOS awards, the performance periods for the two TSR portions of the award ended during 2007.
Following independent review of performance, the Committee decided that 37.5% of the total award vested and became available for exercise: accordingly 12.5% of the award lapsed on this date.
The remaining 50% of the award, which is subject to EPS targets will be considered by the Committee following the year end.
The current intention is that no further options will be granted under the ESOS, other than in exceptional circumstances e. g. in relation to recruitment.
Performance graph The following graph shows the TSR performance of the Company since listing in July 2004, against the FTSE 250 which was chosen because it represents a broad equity market index of which the Company is a constituent and the FTSE Food Producers and Processors Index which was chosen because it contains the Companys key comparators.
TSR was calculated by reference to the growth in share price, as adjusted for reinvested dividends.

Executive directors may also participate in the Companys Savings Related Share Option Scheme, on the same basis as all other employees.
There are no performance conditions attached to these schemes.
TSR rebased to 100 at 19 July 2004 45 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Service agreements The Committee periodically reviews the Companys policy on the duration of directors service agreements, and the notice periods and termination provisions contained in those agreements.
The current policy of the Committee is that notice periods contained in executive directors service contracts should be limited to 12 months other than in exceptional circumstances, such as for the purposes of recruitment and that provisions for early termination should reflect prevailing market practice.
Executive directors have service agreements that continue until terminated by 12 months notice on either side.
Both Mr Schofields and Mr Thomas service agreements are dated 20 July 2004.
In the event of early termination other than for a reason justifying summary termination in accordance with the terms of the service agreement the Company may but is not obliged to pay to the executive director, in lieu of notice, a sum equal to the annual value of the executive directors then salary, benefits, pension contributions and on-target bonus calculated on a pro rata daily basis which he would have received during the contractual notice period the sum of which shall be payable in 12 monthly instalments.
To the extent that the executive director receives any sums as a result of alternative employment or provision of services while he is receiving such payments from the Company, the payments shall be reduced by the amount of such sums.
The service contracts of executive directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the Company.
None of the non-executive directors have employment contracts with the Company.
However, each has entered into a letter of appointment with the Company confirming their appointment for periods ranging from two to three years, unless terminated by either party giving the other one months written notice.
The appointments are subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 and 2006 and the Companys Articles of Association, in particular the need for periodic re-election.
Continuation of an individual non-executive directors appointment is also contingent on that non-executive directors satisfactory performance, which is evaluated annually.
There are no provisions for compensation being payable upon early termination of an appointment of a non-executive director.
Details of non-executive appointment periods appear below: Date of current appointment or reappointment Expiry Date Notice Period David Kappler 14 June 2006 13 June 2008 One month David Felwick CBE 20 July 2007 19 July 2010 One month Sharon Hintze 14 June 2006 13 June 2008 One month Louise Makin 1 October 2006 30 September 2009 One month Ian McHoul 20 July 2007 19 July 2010 One month Directors interests in ordinary shares The interests of directors all of which are beneficial at the beginning and end of the year in shares in Premier Foods plc were: Fully paid Ordinary Share of 1p each As at As at 31.12.07 31.12.06 Robert Schofield 1,163,040 1,113,040 Paul Thomas 626,836 606,836 David Kappler 247,558 232,558 David Felwick CBE 74,418 74,418 Sharon Hintze 16,000 Nil Louise Makin 4,000 Nil Ian McHoul 84,418 74,418 Directors share interests include the interests of their spouses, civil partners and infant children, or step children as required by Section 822 of the Companies Act 2006.

Relative TSR performance will be measured against two appropriate comparator groups: 50% based on performance measured against the FTSE 250 excluding investment companies 1 and 50% based on performance measured against a group of relevant companies from the food sector.
For both parts of awards, 30% will vest for median performance, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
In addition, to ensure that underlying financial performance is also achieved, vesting of awards will be subject to the minimum requirement that Premier Foods EPS must have exceeded the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by an average of at least 2% per annum, over the performance period.
1 The food sector comparator Group for the 2005 and 2006 awards at the date of grant was Arla Foods plc, Associated British Foods plc, Cadbury Schweppes plc, Cranswick plc, Dairy Crest Group plc, Devro plc, Greencore plc, Geest plc, Northern Foods plc, Richmond Foods plc, Robert Wiseman Dairies plc, Tate & Lyle plc and Uniq plc.
Richmond Group was removed from the Group after the company fide-listed on 3 July 2006.
Kerry Group plc were substituted into the Group for Geest plc who were taken over, and subsequently fide-listed in May 2005.

The transfer values disclosed above are net of directors contributions and do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director.
Instead, they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
