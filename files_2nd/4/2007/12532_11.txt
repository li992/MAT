GOVERNANCE 31 REMUNERATION REPORT Compliance This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
As required, this report is being put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM for an advisory vote.
The sections within this report that have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP are indicated.
Throughout 2007 the company complied with Schedule A of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code regarding best practice on the design of performance related remuneration.
The remuneration, including pensions and compensation payments, of all executive directors and the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee the Committee and ratified by the Board.
The Committee also reviews and advises on the general principles under which remuneration including any bonus or long-term incentive schemes and pensions is applied to employees of the company.
The Committee is composed entirely of non-executive directors whom the Board considers to be independent, and comprises Mr J R W Orange, who chairs the Committee and is the company's senior non-executive independent director, Messrs J Darby appointed 18 September 2007, S J Dobbie, R V Emerson and Professor D G Roberts.
Sir David John, the companys Chairman, is not a member of the Committee, but attends by invitation.
The Chairman is absent during any discussions about his own remuneration.
Mr S C Lockett is not a member of the Committee but usually attends meetings by invitation, except when his own remuneration is being discussed, as the company considers it important that the Chief Executive is fully aware of discussions concerning remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of its most senior employees.
The Committee acts within its agreed written terms of reference and complies with the relevant provisions of the Code in implementing its remuneration policy.
The terms of reference are published on the companys website www.
None of the executive directors of the company are involved in determining their own remuneration.
The Committee takes independent advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, a leading firm of remuneration consultants, which is appointed as an advisor to the Committee.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP do not provide any other services to the company.
No other person or company materially assisted the Committee during the year.
Remuneration policy The companys remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages which ensure that directors and senior management are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their contributions.
The aim is to provide remuneration packages which are sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the quality required to achieve the groups objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value.
The Committee takes account of the level of remuneration paid to executive directors and senior managers of comparable public companies, as well as pay and conditions throughout the remainder of the group.
The main components of executive directors remuneration are basic salary, an annual performance-related cash and share bonus scheme with a deferred element, benefits, long-term incentives and pension provision.
Each element is discussed in detail below.
The remuneration therefore contains a suitable balance of direct performance-related remuneration, which links both the short-term financial performance of the group and the long-term shareholder return with the executives total remuneration.
The remuneration package is weighted so that the majority of reward may potentially come from the performance-related elements of the package.
The Committee endorses the principle of mitigation of damages on early termination of a service contract.
It is the Committees current intention to continue with the above remuneration approach for 2008 and subsequent years although the Committee will keep the matter under review.
The Committees current intention with regard to share options is that they will continue to be awarded only in special circumstances.
Shareholders approved the adoption of the Asset and Equity Plan AEP at the AGM in 2004 together with a matching shares element approved at the AGM in 2006, and the Committee continues to regard this plan as the most appropriate method of rewarding the companys executives for achieving growth in share price and the underlying asset value of the company.
The matching shares element also provides a good alignment between executives and investors, as this rewards relative stock market outperformance.
The companys Articles of Association provide that the remuneration paid to non-executive directors is to be determined by the Board within the limits set by the shareholders.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 32 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Performance chart The chart below shows the company's total shareholder return TSR over the last five financial years compared with the equivalent information in respect of the Oil & Gas Exploration and Production sector, which the Committee considers to be the closest equity market index.
The company has recorded eight consecutive years of positive TSR.
Total shareholder return Value 500 Premier Oil plc FTSE All Share Oil & Gas Producers Index 450 451.70 400 350 300 250 200 204.20 150 100 50 0 31 Dec 02 31 Dec 03 31 Dec 04 31 Dec 05 31 Dec 06 31 Dec 07 This graph looks at the value, at 31 December 2007, of 100 invested in Premier Oil plc on 31 December 2002 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE All Share Oil & Gas Producers Index.
Contracts of service Save for automatic termination when each executive director becomes 60 years of age, the executive directors have rolling service contracts and are subject to re-election by shareholders under the companys Articles of Association and the provisions of the Code.
The service contract of each executive director may be terminated on 12 months notice in writing by either side, in accordance with current market practice.
In such event, the compensation commitments in respect of their contracts could amount to one years remuneration based on base salary, annual bonus and long-term incentive scheme entitlement, benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period.
There are provisions for earlier termination by the company in certain circumstances.
If such circumstances were to arise, the executive director concerned would have no claim against the company for damages or any other remedy in respect of the termination.
There are no other provisions, such as liquidated damages clauses, which expressly provide for compensation in the event of early termination.
The Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment made to a departing executive director and would consider each case on an individual basis.
Details of the contracts of employment for the executive directors are as follows: Director Effective date of contract Unexpired term Notice period Provision for payment upon early termination S C Lockett 09.12.2003 12 months None specified R A Allan 09.12.2003 12 months None specified A R C Durrant 01.07.2005 12 months None specified N Hawkings 23.03.2006 12 months None specified Non-executive directors have letters of appointment, which are all effective for a period of three years subject to reappointment by the members in General Meeting, all of which have a notice period of three months.
Sir David John and Messrs S J Dobbie, R V Emerson and J R W Orange have letters of appointment issued on 28 July 2006.
Professor D G Roberts has a letter of appointment dated 30 June 2006 following his appointment to the Board on 28 June 2006.
Mr J Darby was issued with a letter of appointment dated 1 September 2007 following his appointment to the Board on that date.
External appointments Executive directors are entitled to accept non-executive appointments outside the company providing that the Boards approval is sought.
Mr A R C Durrant currently holds one external non-executive directorship with Clipper Windpower plc and is entitled to retain the fees earned connected therewith 2007: US$43,500.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements GOVERNANCE 33 Remuneration structure The remuneration package for the executive directors comprises base salary, benefits, bonus, pension, and entitlement to participate in the companys all-employee share schemes and long-term executive share schemes.
Base salary Base salary is reviewed each year against other comparable companies in the oil and gas sector and general market data on the basis of companies in similar industries and those of a similar size.
The objective is to ensure that the base salary, when taken together with the rest of the package, provides a competitive but performance-driven remuneration package.
The policy of the Committee has been to position base salaries between the median and upper quartile.
This is felt to be necessary and appropriate bearing in mind the fact that there is a shortage of executive talent in the industry and the current executive team is considered highly attractive for other companies.
The salaries of the executive directors as at 1 January 2008 are as follows: Percentage increase Salary from 2007 % S C Lockett 395,000 5.6 R A Allan 285,000 5.9 A R C Durrant 290,000 7.4 N Hawkings 260,000 6.6 The percentage range of base salary increases for 2008 was between 5 and 8 per cent.
For all the executive directors, the increases were determined after considering a range of factors such as company performance and the development of the executive, as well as taking account of the recommendations of New Bridge Street Consultants LLP that these levels represent salaries between median and upper quartile for executives in similar roles, in companies of similar size in the oil and gas sector and in general industry companies excluding financial services also of a similar size.
While salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, the performance of the company and the performance of the individual, the Committee would not regard this element of remuneration as directly performance-related.
Annual bonus scheme The total annual bonus potential, which is non-pensionable, is 100 per cent of base salary.
Half of any bonus earned is payable immediately in cash and the remaining half is payable in shares and deferred for three years.
The deferred element of the bonus is contingent upon the relevant beneficiary remaining in employment for the three years from the date of the award, but is not dependent on any further performance-related measures.
Performance measures for 2007 are explained in the table below: Performance measures Maximum bonus potential Conditions Cash flow 10% Base target to achieve the operating cash flow number contained in the 2007 budget approved by the Board.
10% Stretch target to achieve the base target plus 15 per cent.
Health, safety, environment and security 10% Combined frequencies of lost time injuries and restricted workday cases of or below 1.9 cases per million manhours worked.
Exploration, portfolio management 70% Various milestones identified to achieve the medium-term and strategic development production target of 50,000 boepd.
These include the drilling and success of exploration wells, the control of operating costs and the development of strategic investment divestment opportunities.
Following a review of the 2007 targets, the Committee agreed that the cash flow targets base and stretch and the health, safety, environment and security target had been achieved.
The Committee agreed a 35 per cent award out of the maximum 70 per cent in relation to the exploration, portfolio management and strategic development targets.
This resulted in a total award of 65 per cent of salary 32.5 per cent paid as cash and 32.5 per cent deferred in shares as indicated above for performance against the above targets 2006: 75 per cent of salary, paid as 37.5 per cent cash and 37.5 per cent deferred shares.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 34 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The annual bonus scheme for the 2008 financial year has a similar structure and the same maximum award level.
The performance metrics have been changed slightly to include production and operating cost per barrel targets, rather than cash flow targets which were included in previous years.
This reflects the current priorities of the business.
Performance measures for 2008 are explained in the table below: Performance measures Maximum bonus potential Conditions Production 10% To achieve the production number contained in the 2008 budget approved by the Board.
Operating cost per barrel 10% To achieve the operating cost per barrel number contained in the 2008 budget approved by the Board.
Health, safety, environment and security 10% Combined frequencies of lost time injuries and restricted workday cases of or below 1.7 cases per million manhours worked.
Exploration, portfolio management 70% Various milestones identified for the year, to achieve the and strategic development medium-term production target in excess of 50,000 boepd, including the drilling and success of exploration wells and the development of strategic investment divestment opportunities.
Benefits Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings each received the benefit of a car allowance and medical insurance.
Mr R A Allan also received a gym membership subsidy.
35,672 of Mr S C Locketts remuneration relates to a salary supplement, received as part of his pension arrangements.
From September 2007, this supplement was paid as a contribution to Mr S C Locketts personal money purchase pension scheme.
47,869 of Mr A R C Durrants remuneration relates to a salary supplement as part of his pension arrangements.
Mr N Hawkings total remuneration in 2006 is calculated from 23 March 2006, being the date of his appointment to the Board.
The basic fee for each of the non-executive directors excluding the Chairman at the end of 2007 was 35,000 per annum.
An additional fee of 6,000 per annum was paid per committee Chairmanship.
Mr J R W Orange is provided with an additional set fee of 5,000 per annum in respect of his position as senior independent non-executive director.
Mr J Darby was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2007.
Professor D G Roberts total remuneration in 2006 is calculated from 28 June 2006, being the date of his appointment to the Board.
Relates to the non-executive director fees for Messrs M A K Alizai and I Gray, who retired from the Board in 2006.
On 22 July 2006 the company entered into an Advisory Service Agreement with Mr M A K Alizai, under which he continues to provide services as an advisor to the Board at a rate of US$150,000 per annum.
This agreement will terminate on 21 July 2008.
Benefits in kind represent gym membership, car allowance and medical insurance.

Mid-market closing price on date of award.
Pension schemes Audited Mr S C Lockett is a member of the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme, subject to the Earnings Cap.
The Scheme is a funded, registered final salary scheme, which provides a pension on broadly a fiftieths accrual basis of up to twothirds salary at the normal pension age of 60.
Benefits are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of inflation or 5 per cent per annum.
The company has decided to continue to operate its own cap on pensionable earnings beyond April 2006, when the external cap was removed.
For the year to 31 December 2007 this was set at 108,600, increasing to 112,800 for the year to 31 December 2008.
The company has agreed to provide Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings with a pension substantially as if they were contributing members of the Scheme and, in regard to service completed subsequent to their appointment as directors, not subject to the Earnings Cap.
The additional value of this target pension provision, relative to the standard terms applied to staff, is made available at the directors option in the form of either an enhanced scale of pension contributions or a non-pensionable salary supplement.
As at the year-end, Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan and N Hawkings had elected the former and Mr A R C Durrant had elected the latter.
For life insurance purposes, Messrs R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings are members of the Scheme.
Messrs R A Allan and N Hawkings are members of a money purchase pension arrangement to which, during 2007, the company contributed 54,428 and 49,436 respectively: these amounts include 32,178 and 27,186 respectively in regard to the enhanced pension contributions referred to above.
Mr S C Lockett is a member of a money purchase pension arrangement to which, during 2007, the company contributed 15,684 in regards to the enhanced pension contributions referred to above.
The accrued pension entitlements of the directors who were members or deemed members of the Scheme during 2007 are as follows: b d f a Transfer value c Transfer value Increase from e Increase Accrued in respect Accrued in respect d to b less Transfer value in accrued pension as at of a as at pension as at of c as at contributions of increase pension 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December by director in accrued excluding 2007 2007 2006 2006during 2007 benefit inflation '000 pa '000 '000 pa '000 '000 '000 000 S C Lockett 42.7 290.8 32.3 211.2 58.2 62.7 10.4 R A Allan 17.9 166.8 11.5 103.7 48.0 55.9 6.4 A R C Durrant 11.9 117.3 6.5 61.4 40.8 51.3 5.4 N Hawkings 8.0 68.9 3.3 27.3 28.0 39.6 4.7 Notes: The amounts of accrued pension under a and c represent the accrued pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
The transfer values under b, d and e have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the guidance note GN11: Retirement Benefit Schemes Transfer Values issued by the Board for Actuarial Standards under the Financial Reporting Council.
The amounts under e represent the increase in value of the directors' benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the year, of the excess of the end-year accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits as revalued by price inflation less contributions by the directors.
The values stated above correspond with the target level of final salary pension provision: in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are principally established through individual money purchase arrangements and salary supplements.
Thus, in the case of Mr A R C Durrant, who has elected not to receive enhanced pension contributions, the companys pension obligation will be met entirely by the payment of salary supplements.
In addition to the current provision noted above, Mr R A Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of a prior service period with the company between September 1986 and November 1999.
Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: none of the directors have elected to do so.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 36 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The following payments were made to a former director of the company in respect of unfunded pension liabilities: Amount of unfunded Amount of unfunded pension paid during 2007 pension paid during 2006 J A Heath 31,275 29,956 Long-term incentive arrangements The company currently operates four share option schemes, the Asset and Equity Plan AEP and the Share Incentive Plan SIP.
The Scheme of Arrangement relating to the groups capital in 2003 affected two of the option schemes in operation at that time.
The company therefore adopted two new share option schemes to replace the Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1999.
Asset and Equity Plan Audited This plan is designed to reward an improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period.
The plan therefore has two bonus pools an asset bonus pool and an equity bonus pool.
The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity value per share of the company over a three-year period.
In both cases, no bonus pool is created where the compound growth per annum in the relevant measure asset value or share price is below 10 per cent.
At 10 per cent compound growth per annum, 1 per cent of the growth becomes the pool.
At 20 per cent compound growth per annum, 2.5 per cent of the growth becomes the pool.
There is proportionate vesting between these two points.
The maximum benefit that an individual may receive will normally be limited to twice his or her base salary per annum, except where the compound growth rate exceeds 20 per cent per annum in either the asset or equity bonus pool, in which case the Remuneration Committee may increase the limit on such a proportionate basis as it determines to be fair and reasonable.
Under this plan awards can be made annually and will mature on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The AEP is a broadly-based plan, with participation points being awarded to eligible employees, including executive directors, throughout the group.
In addition to the performance conditions set out above, vesting of awards is subject to the Remuneration Committee being satisfied that there has been satisfactory improvement in the performance of the company.
Awards are normally made in January in the first year of each three-year award period.
New employees who join the company part of the way through the duration of a three-year award are awarded participation points in that award on a time-apportioned basis.
In addition, employees who receive a significant promotion during an award period are eligible to receive an increased participation, also on a time-apportioned basis.
Messrs A R C Durrant and N Hawkings thus received participation points under the 2005 award, time-apportioned to their date of joining the company, and Mr S C Lockett received additional participation points in the 2005 award, to reflect his promotion to Chief Executive in March 2005.
At the time of vesting, 50 per cent of an award is payable in cash and 50 per cent is payable in the form of an award of deferred shares.
Matching Award scheme At the 2006 AGM, shareholders approved an amendment to the plan which gave participants in the plan the option to increase the six-month deferral of the share element released under the plan to three years.
This extended deferral is mandatory for the executive directors and senior management but voluntary for other staff.
Where shares are deferred for three years, individuals will be able to participate in a Matching Award.
The release of this part of the award will therefore be six years following the initial grant of the award under the plan.
The number of shares awarded by way of matching will be subject to the achievement of a performance condition, which is comparative TSR over the three-year deferral period.
The comparator group consists of about thirty-five companies in the oil and gas sector derived from the Alternative Investment Market as well as the main Market.
TSR will be measured as the percentage increase in a return index between the beginning and end of the performance period, which begins on the first day of the financial year in which the Matching Award is granted.
The return index at the beginning of the performance period is the average of the return index on each weekday in the three-month period prior to the start of the performance period.
In order to ascertain the return index at the end of the performance period, the same averaging method will be used for the three months prior to the end of the performance period.
The comparator companies will then be ranked, in descending order, according to their TSR.
If the company is ranked at or above the median against the comparator group, then Matching Awards will be eligible to vest.
Matching will be between one-half of a share for each deferred share where the comparative performance is at the median and 2.5 shares for each deferred share where the performance is at or above the upper decile.
There will be proportionate vesting between these points.
The Committee will obtain independent external advice to assess whether the company has met the TSR performance condition at the end of the performance period and to confirm that the companies which made up the index and the measurement of the companys performance are both in accordance with the rules of the long-term incentive plan.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements GOVERNANCE 37 Details of Matching Awards granted under the Matching Award scheme are set out below: Matching Matching Matching Matching Awards Awards Awards Awards Matching Deferred as at granted lapsed vested Awards as at Earliest shares 1 January during during during 31 December vesting 1 2 awarded 2007 the year the year the year 2007 date S CLockett  RA Allan 29,600 74,000 74,000 01.01.10 A R C Durrant 15,574 38,935 38,935 01.01.10 N Hawkings 13,206 33,015 33,015 01.01.10 Notes: 1.
As disclosed in the 2006 Remuneration Report, the deferred shares vested on 17 January 2007 under the Asset and Equity Plan 2004 award.
The Matching Awards granted during the year relate to the deferred shares which vested in 2007, and are the maximum award possible under the Matching Award scheme, subject to performance criteria.
The mid-market closing price on the date of grant of Matching Awards 27 March 2007 was 12.35.
Release of 2005 awards The equity bonus pool of the 2005 award was calculated by comparing the market value calculated by reference to the average share price for the three months prior to the date of award 1 January 2005, with the market value similarly calculated to 31 December 2007.
An independent external valuation of the equity pool was undertaken when the 2005 award matured and the Remuneration Committee determined the 2005 vesting level as set out in the table below.
50 per cent of the awards were released in cash and 50 per cent in deferred shares.
The minimum vesting threshold for the asset bonus pool was not achieved, resulting in this part of the award lapsing.
The benefits received by directors under the 2005 award were as follows: Cash awarded Deferred shares 1 awarded S C Lockett 443,909 33,706 R A Allan 264,913 20,114 A R C Durrant 264,913 20,114 N Hawkings 232,559 17,658 Notes: 1.
The mid-market closing price on the date of calculation 11 January 2008 was 13.17.
The deferred shares will be held in the Matching Award scheme until 31 December 2010.
Outstanding awards 1 As at 31 December 2007, a total of 1,255.65 participation points have been allocated under the 2006 award.
1,171.25 participation points were awarded in 2006 on the date of grant and 163.90 have been awarded since then, as time-apportioned compensatory awards to employees who have joined the company during the three-year performance period.
79.50 participation points have been forfeited due to participants leaving the employment of the company.
The directors have been allocated the following points: Number of participation points S C Lockett 62 R A Allan 45 A R C Durrant 45 N Hawkings 45 Notes: 1.
The figure of 1,292.50 published in the 2006 Annual Report regarding the 2006 award contained 121.25 compensatory awards issued in the latter part of 2006.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 38 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED As at 31 December 2007, a total of 6,266.20 participation points have been allocated under the 2007 award.
The increase in aggregate participation points reflects the decision to extend the award to all global employees.
The directors have been allocated the following points: Number of participation points S C Lockett 320 R A Allan 210 A R C Durrant 210 N Hawkings 210 2008 awards Awards for the 2008 plan have not been granted as at the date of this report, but are expected to be issued in the second quarter of 2008.
Share option schemes Audited Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 Options granted under the 1995 scheme are normally exercisable, at the acquisition price, not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse unless previously exercised on their tenth anniversary.
No payment is made for the grant of an option.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
For options granted prior to 2000 the performance requirement was that the share price plus the value of dividends paid must, as measured at the end of any consecutive three-year period, have grown at a rate equal to or greater than the Oil Exploration and Production Index over the same period.
Options granted during and after 2000 are dependent upon growth in the company's earnings per share of at least 3 per cent per annum compound above the Retail Price Index over a three-year period.
Mr S C Lockett held options under this scheme during the financial year.
The options are listed in the table below: Options Mid-market Options Acquisition held at price on held at price per 1 January date of 31 December Date of grant Exercisable dates share 2007 Event exercise 2007 1 S C Lockett 07.04.97 07.04.02 07.04.07 4.00 7,680 Exercised 12.64 16.04.98 16.04.03 16.04.08 3.725 7,680 7,680 Notes: 1.
The mid-market closing price on the date of exercise 29 March 2007 was 12.64 resulting in a gain on exercise of 8.64 per share.
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 This scheme replaced the 1995 scheme on completion of the companys Scheme of Arrangement in 2003.
Options granted under the scheme are normally exercisable not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse unless previously exercised on their tenth anniversary.
Options cannot normally be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
In the case of certain employees the performance condition is growth in earnings per share of at least 3 per cent per annum compound above the Retail Price Index over a three-year period.
In other cases, including grants made to Mr A R C Durrant under the scheme in 2005, the performance condition is based on the companys TSR in comparison with a group of eight companies as follows: Burren Energy, Cairn Energy, Dana Petroleum, Paladin Resources, Tullow Oil, Venture Production, Soco International and JKX Oil & Gas, measured between 1 June 2005 and 31 May 2008.
Options will vest as to 30 per cent in the event that median performance is achieved, with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis up to 100 per cent if upper quartile performance is achieved.
TSR was selected as the performance measure for this plan as it aligns the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior TSR compared to competitor companies.

The grant to Mr N Hawkings was made as part of his recruitment terms, where it was agreed that the grant would not be subject to any pre-vesting performance conditions.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1999 Under this scheme, employees including executive directors with six months or more continuous service are invited, within a period of 42 days of the announcement of the annual results, to join the scheme.
Employees may save between 5 and 250 per month, through payroll deduction for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at a market value set at the time of invitation discounted by up to 20 per cent.

Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 40 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Share Incentive Plan Audited Under this plan, employees, including executive directors, may make contributions to acquire shares in the company Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares, the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.
Should an employee leave the SIP scheme before the end of the three-year holding period they will lose the right to the Matching Shares, unless he she leaves due to injury, redundancy, TUPE transfer, retirement, death or the sale of the company.
In the case of the award of Matching Shares, the company has not required performance criteria to be fulfilled, as the purpose of the plan is to encourage all employees to become shareholders in the company.
The company invites all company employees to make contributions to acquire Partnership Shares on a monthly basis.
During 2007, Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings contributed the maximum monthly amount of 125 to the plan.
Shares held beneficially in this plan by the directors during the financial year were as follows: Total Total Matching Partnership Partnership Shares and Matching Shares awarded in Shares purchased in 2007 at prices Shares acquired 2007 at prices between 1020p held on between Shares held on between 1020p and 1270p, 31 December 1 January and 1 January 2007 and 1270p vesting in 2010 2007 12 March 2008 S C Lockett 3,049 130 130 3,309 56 1 R A Allan 3,040 130 130 3,300 56 A R C Durrant 500 130 130 760 56 N Hawkings 500 130 130 760 56 Notes: 1.

Sourcing of shares and dilution limits The company uses the Premier Oil plc Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy the obligations of the AEP and the directors deferred bonus shares.
The Trust currently holds sufficient shares to meet short-term requirements, and future obligations will be met using a combination of market purchases, financed by the company, and newly-issued shares.
The number of shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust as at 31 December 2007 was 205,152 31 December 2006: 485,733.
The rules of each of the companys share-based incentive schemes, including the AEP, share option and employee share savings schemes, contain limitations on the total number of options and awards over new shares that can be awarded, in accordance with the Association of British Insurers guidelines.
