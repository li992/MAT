Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Introduction The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration the Committee within a framework set by the Board.
The Committees members are three non-executive directors, Mr Finn Chairman, Mr Perry and Mr Johnson.
None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
During the period, the Group Company Secretary attended a number of Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee and provided advice on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration.
The Committee also received independent external advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC.
NBSC was appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other service to the Company other than those to the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors apart from the Chairman is determined by the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors.
The Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration also receives advice from the Group Company Secretary and NBSC.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by the other non-executive directors.
Objectives The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and motivate executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has set, as an objective, a policy of paying remuneration around the median of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses and it is satisfied that the structure of the executives packages, as described in this section, will broadly achieve this objective.
The Committee has used this comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising the risk of upward only reviews of remuneration.
The structure of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance related elements of remuneration annual bonus and long-term incentives constitute a significant proportion of an executives potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable if demanding and stretching performance targets are achieved.
In framing the Companys remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best practice provisions in the Combined Code.
Overview of changes to remuneration policy for the year to 31 July 2008 Some changes are proposed to the remuneration policy for the year to 31 July 2008.
These can be summarised as follows: There have been some adjustments to base salary so as to ensure that the effect on total remuneration is to achieve a broadly median level of positioning, in line with the objectives above.
The performance condition for the annual bonus plan will be changed from an EPS-based condition to one based on operating profit.
The performance conditions for the Performance Share Plan will be changed from being exclusively based on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR against other major listed housebuilders, to a condition whereby half of the award is based on TSR against other major listed housebuilders, with the remaining half subject to a performance condition based on Return On Capital Employed ROCE.
Further, regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee considers that the Companys TSR over the performance period is reflective of the underlying financial performance.
A Share Matching Plan will be operated in conjunction with the annual bonus plan.
Rather than the current position whereby half of the bonus has been paid in cash and half compulsorily in deferred shares, the bonus will be payable entirely in cash, but executives may choose instead to invest up to 25% of bonus in Bellway shares voluntarily.
In return for making an investment in shares, the Company will provide a matching award of shares, which will vest subject to the achievement of a performance condition based on ROCE.
The Committee considers that the proposed changes to the remuneration package will ensure that the remuneration level and structure are fully competitive with the market, with a significant element of the package payable in the form of share-based incentives, subject to long-term TSR and ROCE performance conditions, thereby creating an excellent alignment with the interests of shareholders.
The change to the performance conditions for the Performance Share Plan and the introduction of the Share Matching Plan will both require specific shareholder approval at the 2008 AGM.
Further details of the above changes are contained in this report.
In addition, a resolution will be put to shareholders inviting them to consider and approve this Report.
Service contracts and letters of appointment The executive directors have fixed-term service contracts which specify that retirement is at age 60, with a 12 month notice period on either side.
For executive directors, on termination, an amount equivalent to one years salary, benefits and the average amount of the last two years annual bonus payments, would be payable.
The inclusion of average annual bonus in the calculation of compensation payable for early termination will ensure that there is variability in the potential level of compensation.
In particular, after a period of poor performance, it could be expected that little or no bonus would be payable, reducing potential payout in these circumstances.
42 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2007 continued Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration The notice period of all executive directors service contracts is kept under review by the Committee.
It is the Committees view that the notice period for the executive directors is appropriate and consistent with current market practice.
The details of the executive directors service contracts are as follows: Executive Director First appointed Current contract as a director commencement date J K Watson 1 August 1995 16 March 2001 P J Stoker 1 August 1995 19 January 1996 and amended with effect from 1 November 2003 A M Leitch 1 August 2002 1 September 2002 All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company of no more than three years with a three month notice period by either side.
Non-Executive Director First appointed Current letter of appointment Current letter of appointment as a director commencement date expiry date H C Dawe 9 August 1977 1 November 2004 31 October 2007 L P Finn 1 August 1995 12 January 2007 11 January 2008 D G Perry 1 November 1999 1 November 2006 AGM 2009 P M Johnson 1 November 2003 1 November 2006 31 October 2009 On the expiry of their existing letters of appointment, it is the intention of the Company to issue a new letter of appointment to Mr Dawe which will expire on 31 October 2010, and to Mr Finn which will expire at the conclusion of the AGM in 2009.
Salaries and fees Salaries are reviewed on 1 August each year, taking into account the general settlement across the Company.
Any changes are implemented from that date.
For the year under consideration, the executive directors were awarded rises varying from 3.57% to 12.5%.
These increases were considered appropriate by the Committee after an assessment of base salary levels in peer group companies and also taking into consideration the performance of the executive directors and of the Company as a whole.
Fee levels for non-executive directors reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role and are reviewed annually, taking into account the level of fees for similar positions in comparable companies.
They are not entitled to any benefits with the exception of the Chairman or pension, they do not participate in any bonus or long-term incentive plan and they are not entitled to compensation on termination of their agreements, other than normal notice provisions of three months notice given by either party.
The Chairmans fees are payable in cash, and he also receives certain benefits in kind.
The Chairman was an executive director from 1977 until 1 November 2004, when he became non-executive Chairman.
As an executive director he was eligible to participate in bonus and long-term incentive plans, and his beneficial and future potential beneficial interests in those arrangements are disclosed below although there are no outstanding interests remaining at the date of this report.
Since 1 November 2004, as a non-executive director, the Chairman has not participated in any bonus or long-term incentive plan.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind provided to the executive directors include car allowance, the provision and use of motor vehicles and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus scheme has a potential which is currently capped at 120% of basic salary other than in exceptional circumstances where outstanding performance may, in the view of the Committee, merit a higher bonus, subject to an overall cap of 150% of basic salary.
For 2008 a range of operating profit targets will be set by the Committee around a challenging budget figure.
Only where budget is achieved or exceeded is there an opportunity for executives to earn a significant bonus.
The Committee has changed the performance condition from being EPS-based to a condition based on operating profit, on the basis that operating profit is a better measure of underlying annual performance and more in line with market practice.
In prior years there has been a requirement for half of any annual bonus earned to be payable in the form of shares which are released to the executive after three years, subject to continued employment.
Taking effect from the 2007 annual bonus plan, a new policy is proposed whereby the entire bonus is paid in cash.
It is proposed that the executive may then choose to invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus in Bellway shares under the terms of the Bellway p. l. c. 2008 Share Matching Plan see below.
The Committee considers that this change to the annual bonus scheme is sensible: recognising that the existing annual bonus plan with the deferred shares element has enabled senior executives to build a substantial level of shareholding in the business.
However, now that all of the executive directors have significant shareholdings well in excess of their shareholding requirement the requirement to compulsorily defer shares is no longer viewed as necessary.
This structural change also brings the bonus plan more in line with other competitors plans, which do not require compulsory deferral.
43 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2007 continued Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Whilst there will be no compulsory deferral element, for those executives who choose to purchase shares, they may participate in the Bellway p. l. c. 2008 Share Matching Plan on a voluntary basis.
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
The shares held in trust on behalf of directors pursuant to the grant of deferred bonus entitlements are shown in the table on page 46.
Long-term incentive schemes Options have been granted on a discretionary basis to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors under the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme, an approved scheme, and the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme, an unapproved scheme.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to executive directors in October 2003.
No further options may be granted under these schemes, and the last awards granted to executive directors were exercised during the year.
The exercise of options under both schemes were subject to the achievement of either of the following objective performance conditions: a the growth in earnings per share of the Company in any three consecutive years will not be less than the growth in the Retail Price Index plus six per cent over the same period: or b the growth in earnings per share of the Company in any three consecutive years exceeding the mean average growth in earnings per share in the same period of companies whose shares were formerly quoted in the Building and Construction sector but whose shares are now quoted in the Household Goods sector of the FTSE Actuaries Shares Indices.
The Bellway p. l. c. Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which was established in 2003, is available to all employees, including the executive directors.
The original scheme was established in 1990.
Bellway has, since January 2004, operated the Bellway p. l. c. 2004 Performance Share Plan the PSP as the sole type of long-term incentive for its executive directors and the Group Company Secretary.
Under the PSP, executives have been granted awards over shares worth 100% of base salary each year.
The performance condition applying to awards has been based on TSR performance against a comparator group of other housebuilders.
The directors holdings in the PSP are set out in the table on page 47.
The Committee has recently undertaken a review of the PSP.
The review concluded that the PSP has operated successfully but, going forward, has the following shortcomings: Since the PSP was introduced in 2004, due to consolidation in the housebuilding sector, the comparator group for the TSR condition has reduced in size from 13 to 6.
This has meant that the previous method of measuring TSR, which was based on comparing Bellways TSR to the companies ranked between median and upper quartile, is not workable in practice as it would make the performance condition and consequent vesting pattern much more volatile.
More fundamentally, the Committee feels that having the entire long-term incentive element of the package based on TSR makes the incentive rather remote from the perspective of the executives and does not provide sufficient focus on driving the Companys specific performance.
The Committee, therefore, has concluded that some changes are needed to the policy.
In particular, it is proposed to seek two changes to the policy for long-term incentives which will require specific shareholder approval at the 2008 AGM.
i Change to the PSP Performance Condition Shareholder approval is being sought to change the performance condition for future awards under the PSP, as follows: Currently the entire award is subject to a TSR condition, measuring performance on a median to upper quartile basis.
It is proposed that, for future awards, two performance conditions will apply to separate parts of the award.
50% of the award will be based on a TSR condition against other housebuilders but, instead of a ranking approach comparing Bellways TSR to that of each other company an Index will be created out of the TSR of the other housebuilders in the group.
Bellways TSR will be compared to that of the Index.
If Bellways TSR matches that of the Index, 25% of the TSR part of the award would vest reduced from the previous vesting profile whereby 33% of the award vested at median.
Full vesting would be achieved for 7.5% per annum outperformance of the Index.
The Committee has carried out significant modelling, the results of which support the premise that 7.5% per annum outperformance is equivalent to average upper quartile TSR performance of the housebuilders.
Further, regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee considers that the Companys TSR over the performance period is reflective of underlying financial performance.
The companies comprising the Index for the awards in the financial year commencing on 1 August 2007 are as follows: Barratt Developments PLC Bovis Homes Group PLC Redrow plc The Berkeley Group plc Persimmon plc Taylor Wimpey plc TSR is recognised as enabling excellent alignment with the interests of institutional shareholders through providing a reward mechanism for delivering superior stock market performance.
44 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2007 continued Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration The remaining 50% of the award will be based on a range of ROCE based targets requiring average annual ROCE of 15% per annum at which point, 25% of the ROCE part of the award would vest to 22% per annum for all of this part of the award to vest.
Awards will vest on a straight line basis in between these two points.
The Committee feels that ROCE is the most rounded measure of financial performance for a housebuilder and is satisfied that this ROCE range represents a stretching incentive.
The Committee may review the range for future awards and will ensure that any amended range remains no less demanding than that which is approved by shareholders for this award.
ii The Bellway p. l. c. 2008 Share Matching Plan It is proposed to seek shareholder approval for the introduction of a new long-term incentive plan, the Bellway p. l. c. 2008 Share Matching Plan the SMP to operate in conjunction with the annual bonus plan.
As mentioned above, part of the annual bonus will no longer be subject to compulsory investment in Bellway shares although there may be voluntary investment, as set out below.
Under the SMP senior executives may invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus on a voluntary basis in Bellway shares, which must be held for a minimum of three years.
Invested shares will not be subject to a risk of forfeiture and executives will enjoy full beneficial ownership including voting rights and dividends.
In return for investing in shares, under the SMP, an award of matching shares will be granted.
The level of matching will be on a gross basis to the net of tax bonus invested in shares.
Matching shares will vest subject to the executive remaining employed, retention of the invested shares and also subject to a performance condition.
It is proposed that the same ROCE performance condition will be set as will apply to the PSP see above i. e. the level of match will range from 0.5:1 to 2:1, based on a sliding scale of ROCE performance between 15% and 22%.
It is proposed that the first cycle of the SMP will operate in conjunction with the bonus earned in respect of the financial year ended 31 July 2007 the bonus is payable in November 2007 and disclosed in the table of directors emoluments.
Shareholding Guidelines There is a minimum shareholding requirement for the executive directors equivalent to 100% of basic salary.
As at 31 July 2007, and at the date of this report, all executive directors hold shares with an equivalent value in excess of 100% of their basic salary.
Any executive directors appointed in the future will be given an appropriate period of time to acquire the requisite shareholding.
Directors interests The directors interests including family interests and holdings in which directors are interested only as trustees in the ordinary share capital of the Company are set out below: Fully paid ordinary 12.5 pence shares 31 July 2007 1 August 2006 Beneficial interests H C Dawe 123,634 100,352 J K Watson 364,733 303,770 P J Stoker 506,238 486,000 A M Leitch 100,000 68,900 L P Finn 34,000 29,747 D G Perry 5,000 5,000 P M Johnson 4,300 2,000 There has been no change in the above interests between 31 July 2007 and the date of this report.
Mr Dawe had a beneficial interest in 554,164 Bellway p. l. c. 9.5% cumulative redeemable preference shares 2014 of 1 each which are held in his Self Invested Personal Pension SIPP at 31 July 2007 and at the date of this report 1 August 2006 554,164.
Pensions The executive directors are members of the Bellway p. l. c. 1972 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme defined benefit section and, in accordance with the Combined Code recommendations, only basic salary is pensionable, and in some cases only a proportion of basic salary.
The Scheme, on a noncontributory basis, provides for two thirds of final pensionable salary at normal retirement age.
Death in service benefits provide for a lump sum of four times pensionable salary together with a spouses pension of two thirds of the executive directors pension.
These arrangements were largely unaffected other than the imposition of the lifetime allowance, and annual allowance by the changes to the tax treatment of the current UK pension regime as contained in the Finance Act 2004.
Further details in relation to executive directors pensions can be found under Directors pension information on page 49.

The auditors are required to report on the information contained in the following part of this report.
Directors interests in deferred bonus plan The executive directors and the non-executive Chairman have a beneficial interest in certain shares held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 pursuant to the grant of deferred bonus entitlements.
For further information concerning the directors bonus arrangements, see pages 42, 43, 44 and 45.
The number of shares held in the Trust in respect of each director is as follows: Fully paid ordinary 12.5 pence shares Held in Trust as Awarded Vested during Held in Trust 2 at 1 August during the year the year as at 31 July 2006 2007 1 H C Dawe 67,789 - 34,506 33,283 J K Watson 81,638 17,857 29,315 70,180 P J Stoker 66,456 12,946 24,853 54,549 A M Leitch 53,713 12,054 19,672 46,095 Notes: 1.
These shares relate to deferred bonus shares awarded to Mr Dawe while he was executive Chairman.
Additional shares not included above were awarded on vesting in lieu of dividends accrued on the shares held in the Trust from the date of the award to vesting in respect of each director as follows: Mr Dawe 3,613 shares, Mr Watson 3,069 shares, Mr Stoker 2,602 shares and Mr Leitch 2,060 shares.
There has been no change in the above holdings between 31 July 2007 and the date of this Report.
46 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2007 continued Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration In addition, the executive directors and the non-executive Chairman, by virtue of awards made to him while he was executive Chairman of the Company, have a potential future beneficial interest in certain shares held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 pursuant to the allocation of shares under the PSP.
Further information on the PSP is set out on pages 42, 44 and 45.
The number of shares allocated in the Trust in respect of each director, along with the market price of the shares at the date of award, are shown below: Fully paid ordinary 12.5 pence shares Award date Awards Awarded Awards Awards Awards held at during the lapsed vested held at 1 August year during the during the 31 July 5 2006 year year 2007 Potential future beneficial interests 1 H C Dawe 19.1.

Market value on award 1344.0p, performance period 1 August 2006 31 July 2009.
Market value on 24 January 2007, which was the day the shares vested 1477.00p.
Aggregate gross gains made by directors on vesting of the performance share plans in the year were 1,750,890.88 2006 - nil.
Details of the performance conditions are shown on page 44 and below.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 July 2007 was 1247p and the range during the year was 1148p to 1690p.
Vesting of these awards is conditional on the achievement of a TSR performance condition requiring Bellways TSR to be at least at the median of a comparator group of other housebuilders at which point 33% of the award vests.
Full vesting requires Bellways TSR to be at the upper quartile.
The Comparator group contains Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc, Taylor Wimpey plc plus Countryside Properties PLC, Crest Nicholson plc, McCarthy & Stone plc, Taylor Woodrow plc, Westbury plc and Wilson Bowden plc, all of whom have now fide-listed.
There has been no change in the above potential future beneficial interests between 31 July 2007 and the date of this Report.
The executive directors had no further potential future beneficial interest in ordinary shares at 31 July 2007 and at the date of this report 1 August 2006 Nil which are held by the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992.
For this Trust, a linking agreement is in place between the Group and the Trustees of the Trust, 47 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2007 continued Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Capita IRG Trustees Limited.
This agreement ensures that sufficient shares cash are available in the Trust to meet obligations as they arise.
The directors had a joint non-beneficial interest in 18,000 ordinary shares at 31 July 2007 and as at the date of this report 1 August 2006 - 18,000 which are held by the Bellway p. l. c. 1988 Employee Benefit Trust.
Taxable benefits include car allowance, the provision and use of motor vehicles and private medical insurance.
The annual bonus is payable in November 2007 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2007.
This bonus level reflected very good EPS performance in challenging market conditions, where Bellway maintained EPS growth.
All of the above options were granted for nil consideration.
Aggregate gains made by directors on exercise of share options in the year were 1,962,732 2006 - 1,797,649.
The performance conditions set out on page 44 in relation to the options exercised during the year have been achieved.
Directors pension information The following directors had accrued entitlements under the Bellway p. l. c. 1972 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme defined benefit section as follows: Accrued Increase in Increase in Transfer value Accrued Transfer value Transfer value pension accrued accrued of the increase pension of pension of pension as at pension during pension during in entitlement as at as at as at 31 July 2006 the year the year during the year 31 July 2007 31 July 2007 31 July 2006 excluding including inflation to inflation to 31 July 2007 31 July 2007 J K Watson 207,431 13,736 21,204 211,202 228,635 3,515,000 3,053,000 P J Stoker 139,485 10,465 15,486 194,531 154,971 2,881,000 2,550,000 A M Leitch 135,210 16,759 21,627 258,946 156,837 2,423,000 2,002,000 Notes: 1.
The pensions shown are those that have accrued based on service to the end of the year, but excluding any statutory increases, which will reflect future inflation after the year end.
The net of inflation increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase in respect of inflation.
The inflation rate used is that published for September 2006 i. e. 3.6%.
There are no contributions from the directors to the Bellway p. l. c. 1972 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme: therefore there are no contributions to offset against the transfer values shown.
The transfer values shown above have been calculated as at 31 July 2007 employing the transfer value basis adopted for the scheme as at that date.
The pension entitlement is based on the pensionable salary as at 31 July 2007 which is derived from the basic annual salary on the previous 31 October.
This report will be put to an advisory vote of the Companys shareholders at the AGM on 11 January 2008.
On behalf of the Board of Bellway p. l. c. Leo P Finn Chairman of the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration 15 October 2007 49 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Statement of Directors Responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and the Accounts The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Company accounts in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company accounts for each financial year.
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group accounts in accordance with Adopted IFRSs and have elected to prepare the Company accounts on the same basis.
The Group and Company accounts are required by law and Adopted IFRSs, to present fairly the financial position of the Group and Company and the performance for that period.
The Companies Act 1985 provides, in relation to such accounts, that references in the relevant part of that Act to accounts giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Company accounts, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether they have been prepared in accordance with Adopted IFRSs: and prepare the accounts on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that its accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors Report, Directors Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Companys website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of accounts may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
