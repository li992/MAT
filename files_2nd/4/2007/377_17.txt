This clause expired on 18 August 2007.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this provision was reasonable and appropriate given the circumstances surrounding the Company it was in an offer period at the time of the negotiations with Mainardo fide Nardis for him to join the Company.

Unless there are exceptional circumstances, it is the Companys policy that under any new service contracts, notice periods to be given by the Company will not exceed 12 months.
In addition, new contracts will not normally include liquidated damages clauses and any termination payments will be calculated on normal contractual principles taking into account a directors duty to mitigate loss.
