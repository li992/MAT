REMUNERATION REPORT Approval of the report This report for the year ended 1 September 2007 has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the provisions of the Combined Code 2003.
The sections on directors emoluments, the Debenhams Performance Share and Executive Share Option Plans and pension have been subject to external audit by  LLP.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the report at the AGM on 4 December 2007.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Richard Gillingwater and its other members throughout the year are Adam Crozier, Peter Long, Dennis Millard and Paul Pindar.
All the members of the Committee are independent non-executive directors and have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
The Committee met once during the 2006 07 financial year all members were present at the meeting, once informally and matters were reviewed by the Committee through written or telephone consultation on two further occasions.
The Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee.
The Committees duties include determining all elements of the remuneration of the executive directors and the Company Secretary, considering succession planning for senior management, reviewing the remuneration policy and overseeing the operation of the Companys share schemes.
The Committees terms of reference are published at www.
pdf The Committee has appointed KPMG LLP to provide it with independent advice on directors remuneration and share plans.
KPMG also provides industry and comparative employee remuneration data to Debenhams management.
The Committee has also consulted with the Companys Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director and Human Resources Director but not on matters relating to their own compensation or contracts.
The Remuneration Committee considers data from KPMG about total remuneration in other comparable companies, and the elements of that total remuneration, in order to inform its consideration of the remuneration of Company executives.
Remuneration policy It is the Companys policy to provide levels of remuneration which will attract and retain high quality employees in a competitive retail market and, where possible, to structure its remuneration in the most cost effective way for the business.
In addition to basic salary and pension provision the Company seeks to incentivise its employees through an annual bonus scheme and through its share schemes.
It is the intention of the Committee to weight executive directors remuneration towards performance-linked pay and to strike a balance between short and long-term incentives that gives greater participation to the longer term for superior levels of performance.
The Committee considers executive salary increases in the light of comparative data from companies similar in size and sector and in the context of salary increases across the Groups wider employee population.
The salaries of the executive directors increased in 2006 07 by 2.5 per cent: this was in line with the rate of payroll inflation across the employee population as a whole.
The annual bonus focuses on the achievement of specific sales, profit and other business targets for the financial year.
For example, for store managers it is based on the sales and cash profit performance of their store, for buyers it is based on the sales and margin of the product area for which they are responsible, for certain other head office areas it is based on sales and profit performance of the Company as a whole.
For executive directors in 2006 07 it was made up of a number of factors, some Company-wide such as profit and net debt, some more specific such as the performance of the stores acquired from Allders and Roches.
In normal circumstances executive directors could potentially earn an annual bonus of up to 100 per cent of salary subject to the achievement of these targets.
For 2006 07 the executive directors bonus targets comprise profit, net debt and like-for-like sales hurdles.
Incentives are also provided through the Performance Share Plan in which the executive directors participate or the Executive Share Option Plan, encouraging a long-term commitment to the Companys share price and earnings per share performance.
It is the Companys policy that the notice periods of executive directors should not exceed one year.
The Remuneration Committee has considered the financial consequences of early termination of directors service contracts: in order to limit liability and provide certainty in the event of termination of a contract without cause, their contracts contain liquidated damages clauses.
If the Company terminates the employment without due notice, other than in circumstances such as gross misconduct or other immediate justifiable cause, the Company is required to make a payment equal to the aggregate of the executive directors basic salary and the value of his contractual benefits for the notice period and an amount equal to the average of the annual bonus paid to the executive director in the two bonus years prior to the termination of his employment.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 41 Section 3 Management and governance REMUNERATION REPORT The cost of operating defined benefit pension schemes has, over recent years, become higher and more unpredictable and potentially, if not addressed, could increase the risk for accrued benefits including pensioners and deferred members.
Following consultation over 60 days with employees, the Company ceased accrual of pensionable service under the Debenhams Executive Pension Plan and the Debenhams Retirement Scheme with effect from 1 November 2006, with benefits accrued to 31 October 2006, including the benefits of deferred and pensioner members, being retained in the schemes.
In addition, the Debenhams Retirement Scheme was closed to new members with effect from the same date the Debenhams Executive Pension Plan was closed to new entrants in 2002.
Pension arrangements are now provided through a Defined Contribution Stakeholder Plan.
In the Republic of Ireland, pension arrangements are made by way of a Defined Contribution Scheme.
The pension benefits of the executive directors are now therefore provided through a defined contribution of 15 per cent of salary 20 per cent for Michael Sharp : only Michael Sharp was a member of the old defined benefit plan and details of his accrued benefits in the scheme are set out in the section headed pension in this report.
Letters of appointment and service contracts The Chairman and the non-executive directors have letters of appointment from the Company covering matters such as duties, time commitment, fees and other business interests.
The appointments may be terminated by either party giving one months notice.
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the board and is made up of an annual fee for acting as a non-executive director of the Company and fees for chairing and for membership of a board committee.
The non-executive directors do not take part in discussions on their own remuneration.
The fees are set to reflect the time which they are required to commit to their duties, their experience and the amounts paid to non-executive directors in comparable companies.
There has been no increase in non-executive directors fees in the year.
Details of the letters of appointment of the non-executive directors are set out below and the terms are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours and at the AGM.

Each agreement is terminable by either party giving not less than 12 months written notice, save that Michael Sharp is required to give the Company six months notice.
Executive directors are entitled, in addition to salary, to other benefits or equivalent cash allowances, the value of which is set out in the table of directors emoluments, including company car and fuel, life, medical and personal accident insurance.
Rob Templeman and Chris Woodhouse are permitted to hold up to two non-executive directorships in noncompeting companies.
The executive directors retain payments received in respect of their other directorships.
On 22 December 2006 Chris Woodhouse was appointed non-executive Chairman of Gondola which owns restaurant groups including Pizza Express, for which his fees in 2006 07 were 104,032.

Share schemes Baroness Employee Limited Partnership BELP In June 2004, certain senior managers were invited to invest in the Group through the purchase of units in BELP corresponding to shares in the Company.
In the 2005 06 financial year 30 per cent of those shares were distributed and the balance of 70 per cent totalling 12,891,480 shares were distributed on 9 May 2007 to 37 employees including 5,250,000 shares distributed to Michael Sharp, an executive director, which have not subsequently been sold by him.
In addition BELP transferred 335,505 shares on 9 May 2007 to the Debenhams Employee Retail Trust 2004.
There will be no further share transfers or distributions by BELP, which no longer holds any shares in the Company.
The Debenhams Employee Option Plan When the Group was privately owned, an executive option plan was put in place.
On exercise, participants acquired shares in the Company at a specified option price per share.
The balance of 50 per cent of the options became exercisable on 9 May 2007, 365 days after admission of the Companys shares to listing on the London Stock Exchange.
Participants were, in all except three instances, required to pay the employers national insurance contributions arising on the exercise of their options.
In recognition of this cost, participants were awarded a bonus in the form of shares on the exercise of their option.
The bonus shares had a market value which on a post tax basis was equal to the cost to the participant of meeting the employers national insurance contributions on the relevant exercise.
The Debenhams Retail Employee Trust 2004 the Trust held shares to satisfy the exercise of options granted under the Debenhams Employee Option Plan.
On 2 September 2006 the Trust held 3,290,535 shares.
It purchased a further 70,000 shares on 6 November 2006 at 190.14 pence per share and 335,505 shares were transferred to it by BELP on 9 May 2007.
A total of 3,592,438 shares were transferred from the Trust to satisfy the exercise of options and the award of bonus shares.
The Trust currently holds 103,602 shares in the Company.
No further awards will be made and there are no outstanding shares to be transferred or exercised under this share option scheme.
Michael Sharp was the only director who held options under the Debenhams Employee Option Plan and details are set out below Michael Sharp has retained the shares obtained on the exercise of this option : Options Market held at Share price Options at Value Date Expiry Exercise 2 September Granted Exercised at time of Lapsed 1 September on date of grant date price 2006 in year in year exercise in year 2007 of exercise Michael Sharp 31 01 05 30 01 15 0.2p 60,758 60,758 147.75p Nil 147.75p Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 43 Section 3 Management and governance REMUNERATION REPORT The Debenhams Performance Share Plan the PSP Under the PSP, executives may receive shares the number of which is determined by the extent to which a performance condition is achieved on vesting provided that they remain employed in the Group.
Awards under the PSP comprise an option to receive free shares or a nil cost option.
On 24 November 2006 awards over 2,408,253 shares were made under the PSP to 102 employees, including to the executive directors as set out below, and on 29 May 2007 awards were made over 3,274,793 shares to 57 employees.

In the 2006 07 financial year the award to the executive directors was at the level of 50 per cent of base salary.
Awards under the PSP will normally only vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and must be exercised within six months of vesting subject to performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time awards are granted and if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Company over the performance period is sufficient to justify the vesting of the award.
Half the PSP awards made in 2006 07 are subject to a performance target based on the Adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS growth of the Company above the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index RPI over a three-year performance period starting at the end of the 2005 06 financial year.
The EPS targets for the November 2006 award are compound annual EPS growth of RPI 7 per cent at which 30 per cent of this element of the award would vest to RPI 14 per cent 100 per cent of this element of the award would then vest, with a straight-line basis for calculating the percentage that would vest between 30 per cent and 100 per cent.
In relation to the award in May 2007, the same structure for calculating the percentage of the award that vests apply, with the EPS targets being 30 per cent at EPS growth of RPI 3 per cent per annum to 100 per cent at EPS growth of RPI 7 per cent per annum.
In determining the EPS targets for 2006 07, the Committee took into consideration the current business plan, prevailing economic conditions and shareholder expectations.
It took advice from KPMG LLP, including their analysis of brokers consensus forecasts.
EPS was chosen as the Remuneration Committee considers it to be a key underlying value driver of the business that will focus managements attention on continued growth and profitability.
The remaining half of the 2006 07 PSP awards are based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR against the weighted TSR of the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index over a three-year performance period starting at the end of the 2005 06 financial year.
The TSR performance conditions have not changed, continuing to trigger at 30 per cent vesting of this element of the award for Debenhams TSR equal to the weighted TSR of the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index, to 100 per cent vesting of this element for Debenhams TSR equal to or more than 12 per cent per annum above the weighted TSR of the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index, with a straight-line level of vesting between these two points.
The weighted TSR is the aggregate of the TSR of each company in the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index weighted by their respective market capitalisations at the start of the relevant three-year performance period.
A three-month average TSR at the start and end of the performance period will be used to mitigate the effect of any short-term share price volatility.
The Committee considers TSR to be an approximate proxy for shareholder value and it chose this comparator group as Debenhams and its main listed general retail competitors are a constituent of the index.
The Committee determined that a weighted index is a fairer and more reasonable method of determining relative performance as opposed to a conventional TSR ranking as it factors in the size of each comparator company and therefore the absolute levels of value that each company generates relative to its size.
When determining the maximum TSR target, the Committee took into consideration the historical TSR performance of the comparator companies over the last ten years.
The current maximum target of 12 per cent per annum above the index broadly equates to upper quartile TSR performance.
Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 44 Section 3 Management and governance If one or both of the performance conditions are not met at the end of the performance period, 50 per cent or 100 per cent as appropriate of the awards will lapse immediately without any opportunity to re-test the relevant performance condition.
The Remuneration Committee may set different performance conditions for future awards and may decide that different conditions should be applicable to different executives awards depending on their job function.
No PSP awards vested during the year.
The Debenhams 2006 Executive Share Option Plan the ESOP The ESOP allows the Company to grant options to acquire shares to eligible employees.
Options granted under the ESOP may either be Her Majestys Revenue & Customs approved options up to the prescribed limit or unapproved options.
Share options were granted over 1,677,153 shares on 24 November 2006 to 196 senior managers at an option price of 198.25 pence being the middle-market price at the close on the day before grant date.
A grant was also made on 29 May 2007 to 64 employees, over 450,341 shares, at an option price of 137.5 pence the closing price on the trading day before grant.
These options will normally become exercisable three years after grant and expire ten years after the date of grant.
The exercise of options is subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition, which will be stated at the date of grant.
There will be no re-testing of the performance condition.
For the November 2006 grant of options the performance condition will require the Adjusted EPS growth to be at least equal to the percentage increase in RPI 7 per cent per annum over a period of three years commencing with the 2005 06 financial year.
For the May 2007 award the required growth in Adjusted EPS is RPI 3 per cent per annum.
In determining the EPS targets the Committee took advice from KPMG LLP and sought to establish targets which, although stretching, were capable of being achieved and would provide a real incentive for store managers, senior buying and merchandising executives and other participants in the scheme.
No options under the ESOP were exercised during the year.
The maximum market value of shares over which options may be granted to an employee under the unapproved part of the ESOP in any financial year as measured at the date of grant may not be greater than 100 per cent of the employees annual basic salary at the date of grant.
However, the Remuneration Committee has a discretion, in exceptional circumstances which include recruitment to grant awards over shares with a market value in excess of this amount.
No options under the ESOP were granted to executive directors during the year.
EPS Under the rules of both plans, to ensure comparability of financial years of the Company within the EPS performance period and for the base year, the Remuneration Committee may following consultation with its independent advisers and the Companys external auditors adjust the reported figure for earnings per share as calculated in accordance with the relevant accounting standard including adjustments to achieve consistent measurements of performance during the transition to international accounting standards to arrive at a figure that is a fair and reasonable reflection of the underlying business performance of the Group.
Such adjustments shall include, but are not limited to, adjusting the issued share capital to a comparable basis, excluding extraordinary or exceptional items, adjusting for the effect of a 53rd week, adjusting for the effect of incremental costs or charges, adjusting for property profits no longer accruing, and adjusting for the effect of interest on preadmission levels of borrowing.
Debenhams 2006 Sharesave Scheme the Sharesave Scheme Under the Sharesave Scheme, employees may be granted an option to acquire shares at a fixed exercise price.
At the end of the savings period the employee may either exercise the option within six months of the end of the savings period using the savings contributions and bonus which he has accumulated, or have the savings and bonus repaid to him.
No options have been granted under this scheme.
The Debenhams Deferred Bonus Matching Plan the DBMP Under the DBMP, participants will be able to invest up to the full amount of their annual bonus on an after-tax basis in shares.
If the participant remains in service for three years he she will, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target, be eligible to receive a matching share award based on the pre-tax amount of the bonus that has been invested.
The Remuneration Committee has not determined what performance conditions will apply to awards under the DBMP although it is intended that they be appropriately demanding and linked to the Companys performance.
If the performance target is not met at the end of the performance period, the Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2007 45 Section 3 Management and governance REMUNERATION REPORT awards will lapse immediately and there will no opportunity to re-test the performance condition.
No awards have yet been made under the DBMP.
Pension The directors are not members of a Company pension plan, except for Michael Sharp who is a deferred member of the Debenhams Executive Pension Plan.
