terms of reference of the remuneration committee The Group has established a remuneration committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The members of the committee during 2007 were Mr Maarten Henderson and Mr John Sleeman who are both independent nonexecutive directors.
The committee has discretion to decide who, other than its members, shall attend its meetings.
In this respect the executive directors may be invited to attend meetings as considered appropriate to make proposals and discuss the performance of directors, subsidiary company directors and others as necessary.
No director takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benefits.
The committee met twice in 2007.
However, no changes have yet been made to the remuneration of directors as reported in the listing prospectus of the Group at the time of the IPO.
The committee makes recommendations to the Board.
remuneration policy for executive directors Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the highest calibre needed to maintain the Groups position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value.
The performance measurement of the executive directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the committee.
There are five elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior management: basic annual salary: benefitsinkind: annual bonus payments, which cannot exceed 50% of salary: share incentives: and pension arrangements.
The Groups policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of executive directors should be performance related.
Executive directors may earn annual incentive payments of up to 50% of their basic salary.
Basic salary An executive directors basic salary is reviewed by the committee prior to 1 July, which is the start of the salary year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate remuneration levels, the committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective research which gives uptodate information on a comparator group of companies of similar size and complexity.
The present incumbents were appointed internally and their current packages were agreed by contracts entered into on 21 May 2007 in readiness for transition to public status.
Executive directors contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Benefitsinkind Executive directors receive either a Company expensed motor vehicle commensurate with their seniority or a monthly car allowance.
All other benefitsinkind are available to all employees dependent upon local conditions in their country of employment.
