JJB Sports plc Directors remuneration report For the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The Report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the Report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting AGM of the Company.
The auditors are required to report on the audited information within the Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the Report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The Report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Constitution of the Committee The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Roger Lane-Smith and also consists of Andrew Thomas, David Beever and Roger Best.
David Whelan, attends as appropriate, to give advice.
Roger Lane-Smith and David Whelan do not participate in the determination of their own remuneration package.
Remuneration of Executive Directors The remuneration of Executive Directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The remuneration policy aims to ensure that the Executive Directors are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Groups performance and that their remuneration packages are competitive with regards to those of comparable public companies and, through a performance related bonus and the award of share options, incentivise the Director concerned to improve the performance of the Group.
The elements of remuneration are a basic salary, performance related bonus, share options, certain taxable benefits and contributions made into Directors personal pension schemes.
Basic salary The basic salaries of Executive Directors are set by the Remuneration Committee who take into consideration the current rate of inflation together with the levels of salaries of Directors in similar sized public companies within the FTSE 350 Index: these levels are then tailored to individual experience, responsibility and performance.
This policy will be continued during the current accounting period.
The basic salaries of Barry Dunn, David Greenwood and Tom Knight were reviewed in August 2005 with the increase backdated to 1 February 2005.
The basic salary of David Whelan was reviewed following his change of position from that of Chairman to Executive Director on 6 July 2005.
In April 2007, the basic salaries of the Executive Directors have been reviewed by the Remuneration Committee and the increases have been applied from 1 February 2007.
Performance related bonus The Executive Directors are entitled to a performance related bonus scheme to which members of the Associate Director Board of JJB are also entitled.
This bonus takes the form of an annual payment, calculated as a percentage of basic salary, based upon the annual pre-tax profits of the Group but dependent upon profit targets being achieved.
A further bonus is payable at the end of the fourth year, representing an amount equal to any bonus paid in the 3 previous years, provided the Executive Director or Associate Director is still in the Companys employment at the end of the fourth year.
The first bonus scheme was set over 3 years which commenced from the accounting period to 25 January 2004 and ended with the accounting period to 29 January 2006.
The maximum amount payable in any one of the first 3 years of this scheme was limited to 40 per cent of the Directors basic salary.
Whilst an entitlement to bonus of 220,000 was achieved and paid in respect of the 52 weeks to 25 January 2004, no entitlement was earned in respect of the 53 weeks to 30 January 2005 or for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006.
A performance related bonus scheme was adopted for the accounting period of 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 which was set at the beginning of the accounting period and was very similar in form to the scheme which applied during the last 3 accounting periods referred to above.
The scheme for this accounting period resulted in the maximum bonus entitlement of 40 per cent of basic salary being achieved.
During the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007, a bonus equivalent to that paid for the 52 weeks to 25 January 2004 of 220,000 2006: nil was paid to the Executive Directors and a provision was made in the Consolidated income statement of 388,000 in respect of the bonus earned for the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 2006: nil.

Options are not routinely granted but made on an individual basis to incentivise the participants to the scheme to improve the performance of the Group.
For a number of years, JJB had operated two share option schemes that were created in 1999.
However in 2006, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the share based incentive arrangements then in operation and concluded that in order to ensure that there is a sufficient range of share based incentives available to the Committee, shareholder approval should be sought at the 2006 AGM for the adoption of two new share plans.
These two share plans were duly approved at the 2006 AGM and comprise a Long term incentive plan from which awards have only been made to Executive Directors and a Share option plan, awards from which have been made to senior executives but not to Executive Directors.
Details of share plans which have been awarded to the Executive Directors, being the 1999 Share option schemes and the Long term incentive plan are set out below.
1999 Share option schemes The maximum value of options granted to any employee under the 1999 Approved Share option scheme was restricted to 30,000.
In addition, options could be granted under the 1999 Unapproved Share option scheme, the maximum number being calculated by a formula which restricted the value of the options granted to any employee to four times their basic salary, less the value of any options granted under the 1999 Approved Share option scheme.
The exercise of these share options was subject to performance conditions requiring various growths in earnings per ordinary share of the Group, over at least three consecutive financial periods.
In respect of the share options granted to D. Whelan and J. D. Greenwood, on which the expiry date is 2009, the performance condition attaching to the options was a growth in Group earnings per ordinary share of more than 10 per cent per annum plus the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index, for the option to be fully exercisable.
For share options issued subsequently, the performance condition was a growth in Group earnings per ordinary share of more than 4 per cent per annum plus the percentage increase in the Retail Price index.
For the options to be exercisable in relation to half the shares subject to any option, the increase in earnings per ordinary share was to be half the annual rates quoted above, plus the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index.
Long term incentive plan Awards made under the Long term incentive plan LTIP are made over a specified number of shares.
The shares are acquired by the award holder at the beginning of the measurement period but the ownership of the shares are held in Trust and will remain conditional until after the end of the measurement period.
For the awards to become unconditional, certain performance conditions must be satisfied and then a participant will obtain absolute ownership of the shares.
The Remuneration Committee proposed that the performance conditions to which any award was to be made under the LTIP in 2006 would be split into two equal parts and each part would be subject to different performance measures.
One part was based upon a challenging increase in earnings per share for the 52 weeks to 25 January 2009, when compared to that achieved in the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006.
The second part was based upon a total shareholder return performance measured against comparative companies over a three year period commencing on the date of the award of the LTIP.
Awards under the LTIP have only been made to Executive Directors and totalled 1,695,712 ordinary shares in the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 2006: nil.
Different performance conditions may be selected by the Remuneration Committee for future awards made under the LTIP, but if the performance conditions for future awards are changed, shareholders will be informed through the Directors remuneration report in future Annual reports.
Details of all share options held by the Executive Directors are set out in the table on page 28 of this Report.
Taxable benefits Executive Directors are eligible for taxable benefits, which include membership of a private medical scheme and the provision of a company car with payment of its operating expenses, including private mileage, or the payment of a monthly lump sum towards the costs incurred on business travel in their own car.

Remuneration and contracts of service of Non-executive Directors The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is in the form of Directors fees and is determined by the Board after consultation with the other Executive Directors and after taking into account the performance of the Non-executive Directors and the levels of remuneration paid by comparable Plcs.
The Directors fees of the Non-executive Directors were reviewed in August 2005 with the increase being backdated to 1 February 2005.
In April 2007, the fees of the Non-executive Directors have been reviewed and the increases applied from 1 February 2007.
