Remuneration Committee report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the Regulations.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the Combined Code and the Markets Law relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, an advisory resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report is therefore divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Directors who were members of the Committee during the year under review are set out on pages 36 to 39 in the Corporate Governance report.
The responsibility for the establishment of a remuneration policy and its cost is a matter for the full Board, on the advice of the Remuneration Committee.
The ongoing recommendations of the Remuneration Committee have been approved without amendment by the Board for submission to shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior management and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Remuneration Committee sought the assistance of the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice-Chairman on matters relating to directors performance and remuneration in respect of the period under review.
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice Chairman and General Counsel may attend meetings by invitation except when their individual remuneration arrangements are discussed.
No director takes part in discussions relating to his own remuneration or benefits.
As detailed below, during the year the Remuneration Committee received wholly independent advice on executive compensation from Halliwell Consulting.
Halliwell Consulting also provides associated administrative support for the Companys share plans.
No services other than those detailed in this report were provided to the Company by Halliwell during the year under review.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference with the full remit of the Committee role described.
The terms of reference are available on the Companys website or on request by shareholders in writing from the Company Secretary whose contact details are set out on page 104 of the Annual Report.
Philosophy behind Remuneration Committees approach The Companys remuneration policy is designed to encourage, reward and retain executives and the Remuneration Committee believes that shareholders interests are best served by remuneration packages which have a large emphasis on performance related pay, thus encouraging executives to focus on delivering the Groups business strategy.
By providing meaningful incentives to executives the Companys policy seeks to ensure that the appropriate balance between fixed and performance related pay is maintained.
44 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 Remuneration Committee report Remuneration policy 2007 Overall policy The Remuneration Committees policy during the year under review was to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in comparison to the Companys Comparator Group: Potential total short-term Potential annual Potential total Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in kind remuneration available share awards compensation value Lower quartile Upper quartile Lower quartile to median Median to Upper quartile Median to to median upper quartile upper quartile This supports the performance based culture of the Company.
Fixed costs are minimised The policy in respect of long-term and total short-term remuneration will only reach and exceed the median if the incentives and potential performance-based bonus is earned for the relevant financial year.
compensation value is an extension of the policy on total short-term remuneration.
Executives will only receive a market competitive package if the annual bonus and long-term incentives are earned.
2007 Comparator Group The constituents of the Companys Comparator Group CG for benchmarking remuneration during 2007 were as follows: Name Name Name Acambis Plc Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc Oxford Biomedica Plc Alizyme Plc CAT Group Plc Protherics Plc Allergan Inc Forest Laboratories Inc Shire Pharmaceuticals PLC Alpharma Inc King Pharmaceuticals Inc SkyePharma Plc AstraZeneca PLC Mylan Laboratories Inc Vernalis PLC Axis-Shield Plc Neutec Pharma Plc Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc Factors the Remuneration Committee took into account when selecting the Comparator Group included: the industry within which the Company operates, specifically taking into account both the international nature of the Company s business and its competitors, and the international nature of the Companys current executive team and potential recruits to that team: the market capitalisation, turnover and number of employees of the Company: and the UK listing environment of the Company.
Throughout this report, references to quartiles are to quartiles in the Comparator Group.
It is the Committees current intention to use the same Comparator Group with the removal of CAT Group Plc and Neutec Pharma Plc due to acquisition to benchmark the Companys Executive compensation in 2008 and as the Comparator Group for the total shareholder return performance condition attached to awards under the Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Ongoing review The Remuneration Committee continues to review the remuneration policy on an annual basis to ensure it remains appropriate for the financial year under review.
Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include: market conditions affecting the Company: the recruitment market in the Companys sector: changing market practice: and changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
It is the current intention of the Remuneration Committee to apply the 2007 policy in 2008.
Background During the year, the Company appointed Said Darwazah as its Chief Executive Officer.
His appointment commenced on 1 July 2007.
At the same time, Samih Darwazah relinquished his executive role, continuing in his position as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Company.
At this time the Committee undertook an independent review of remuneration for Chief Executive Officers in conjunction with the appointment.
This was performed by the Committees independent external remuneration consultants, Halliwell Consulting.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 45 Remuneration Committee report 2007 balance between fixed and variable performance based compensation The chart below demonstrates the balance between the potential fixed and variable performance based compensation for each Executive Director for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Fixed compensation Variable performance is calculated as: compensation is calculated as: Maximum bonus available Salary fair market benefits value of maximum Name pension contribution potential LTIP award Said Darwazah 43% 57% Mazen Darwazah 45% 55% Elements of Executive Directors remuneration Basic salary Policy 2007 and 2008 Lower quartile to median The Companys remuneration policy is to set the levels of base salary for the Executive Directors below the median to support a performance based culture.
Median rise in Comparator Name 2007 salary 2008 salary Rise Group Samih Darwazah $458,494 0% 8.1% Median $676,000 Lower quartile $500,000 Said Darwazah $600,000 $630,000 5% 8.1% Median $676,000 Lower quartile $500,000 Mazen Darwazah $371,763 $420,000 13% 10.6% Median $449,000 Lower quartile $374,000 The salary for Samih Darwazah has been annualised for the purposes of comparison, though Mr Darwazah performed an executive role only until 30 June 2007.
The salary for Said Darwazah has been annualised for the purposes of comparison, though he performed an executive role only from 1 July 2007.
As in 2007, the increases in executive salary reflect the Committees ongoing policy that, save in exceptional circumstances, only modest salary rises should be required.
When determining the salary of the executives the Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the lower quartile and median salary levels of those comparable companies within the pharmaceuticals industry and the Comparator Group: the performance of the individual executive director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and pay and conditions throughout the Company.
46 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 Remuneration Committee report Annual performance related bonus Policy 2007 and 2008 Upper quartile bonus potential Bonus payments are not pensionable.
The following tables summarise the main features of the Companys executive bonus plan.
Bonus Samih Darwazah Said Darwazah Mazen Darwazah Company bonus potential 100% 100% 100% Upper quartile CG 94% 94% 94% Median CG 55% 55% 55% 2007 bonus paid as percentage of salary 80% 80% 90% Upper quartile bonus payments in the CG as a percentage of salary 133% 133% 104% Certain of the US companies contained in the CG do not have a cap on bonus and therefore pay in excess of the CG Upper quartile amount.
The maximum target bonus potential is 100% of salary.
It is possible for exceptional performance to earn up to a total maximum bonus of 200% of salary.
The maximum bonus potentials for 2008 will remain the same as those applied for 2007.
The bonuses for 2007 have been paid on the basis of the level of the satisfaction of the performance targets, and in respect of Samih Darwazah and Said Darwazah, on a pro rated basis.
The table below shows the principal performance targets used for 2007 and their percentage satisfaction.
Percentage of maximum bonus Percentage satisfaction potential subject to target of bonus target Percentage of salary payable Samih Darwazah Profit after tax 50% 60% 30% Operational milestones 30% 100% 30% Personal business targets 20% 100% 20% Total 80% Said Darwazah Profit after tax 50% 60% 30% Operational milestones 30% 100% 30% Personal business targets 20% 100% 20% Total 80% Mazen Darwazah Profit after tax 50% 80% 40% Operational milestones 30% 100% 30% Personal business targets 20% 100% 20% Total 90% The targets for the annual bonus plan are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company in order to ensure that they continue to remain challenging.
It is the opinion of the Committee that the overall nature of the conditions remains appropriate for the requirements of the Group in 2008, although the percentage targets will be reviewed.
Share incentives Policy 2007 and 2008 Upper quartile The Remuneration Committees policy is to provide annual share grants to senior executives at the upper quartile level compared to the Comparator Group.
Ongoing share incentives, excluding all-employee plans, are provided to the Executive Directors solely through the LTIP.
The Remuneration Committee believes that share awards under the LTIP enable the Company to provide a competitive incentive and retention tool which is also cost effective in respect of both shareholder dilution and income statement expense.
Furthermore, the proposed grant of awards with the attached performance condition ensures that the Companys 1 comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance against the Comparator Group is at least at the upper quartile before executives will receive the full benefit of their share incentives.
This structure demonstrates the Remuneration Committees desire to correlate incentive arrangements with the achievement of substantial performance.
1 Total Shareholder Return TSR is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the performance period the return is the value of the capital gain and reinvested dividends.
It is normally used comparatively and the Company which achieves the best return is ranked number one.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 47 Remuneration Committee report The Remuneration Committee granted the following awards to Executive Directors during 2007.
Name Percentage of salary Said Darwazah 139.42 Mazen Darwazah 112.50 For operational reasons the Company granted smaller awards than indicated in its consultation with shareholders on the changed parameters of the LTIP.
The Committee intends to revert to the policy agreed during this consultation for the 2008 grants.
The following table summarises the main features of the LTIP and its proposed operation during 2008.
2 Maximum annual grant face value as percentage of salary and performance condition Maximum annual grant 300% current normal operating maximum set by the Remuneration Committee 200% The Awards will be subject to comparative TSR performance against the Comparator Group.
20% of Awards will be released for median performance with full release occurring for upper quartile comparative performance.
The Remuneration Committee will also ensure that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with its TSR performance.
When considering this underlying financial performance the factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee will include profit after tax, revenue growth and the achievement of operational milestones.
Said Darwazah Mazen Darwazah Proposed grants for 2008 face value as a percentage of salary 200% maximum of 200% maximum of 148,778 Ordinary Shares 138,363 Ordinary Shares The maximum numbers of shares detailed above have been fixed pursuant to a resolution approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 6 June 2007 in accordance with Rule 9 of the Takeover Code.
It should be noted that the real value received by the Executive Directors under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the degree to which the performance conditions are satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share price of the Company at this time.
Basis of performance condition selection and measurement Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for the proposed awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that the executives have outperformed their peers over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions.
The Remuneration Committee will provide a full explanation and justification at the time of the release of the award and why it believes that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with this TSR performance.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards are satisfied.
The Committee has appointed Halliwell Consulting to assist in the ongoing calculation of TSR in accordance with the rules of the LTIP.
The Committee will approve these figures prior to the release of any award.
Dilution In accordance with the guidelines set out by the Association of British Insurers ABI the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all its share plans.
Under the LTIP rules, grants of no more than 3% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be awarded in the first three years following the Companys IPO in 2005.
The following table summarises the current level of dilution resulting from Company share plans following the IPO: Share awards as a percentage of issued share Share awards as a percentage of issued share capital as at 31 December 2007 in a rolling capital as at 31 December 2007 granted ten year period during the year All-employee Share Plans 0% 0% Discretionary Share Plans 0.454% 0.454% The Company has currently not implemented any all-employee option arrangements.
It is the Companys current intention that the awards granted in 2008 will be satisfied by newly issued shares.
Post employment benefits Policy 2007 and 2008 Lower quartile to median The Executive Directors participate in the Hikma Pharmaceuticals Defined Contribution Retirement Benefit Plan the Benefit Plan in accordance with the Rules of the Benefit Plan relevant to employees of the Group based in Jordan.
Under the Benefit Plan the Group matches employee contributions made to the Benefit Plan.
These are fixed at 5% of applicable salary.
Participants are entitled to 30% of the Groups contributions to the Benefit Plan after three years of employment with the Group, and an additional 10% in each subsequent year.
The participants interest in the Groups contribution fully vests after ten years of employment.
2 Face value for awards under the LTIP face value is the aggregate market value of the shares subject to the award at the date of grant.
48 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 Remuneration Committee report The following table sets out the percentage post employment contributions compared to the Comparator Group.
Samih Darwazah Said Darwazah Mazen Darwazah Company 1.37% 0.47% 2.07% Upper quartile 17% 17% 9% Median 10% 10% 5% Lower quartile 0% 0% 0% In addition, pursuant to applicable law, each of the Executive Directors receives contributions as a percentage of salary which are paid by the Group into government social security systems.
Benefits in kind Policy 2007 and 2008 Market practice The Company provides the normal benefits in kind for executives of this level in a company of this size, such as company cars, healthcare and life insurance.
Total compensation Policy 2007 and 2008 Median to upper quartile depending on performance The following table shows the value of each of the main elements of the remuneration package provided to the Executive Directors during the year ended 31 December 2007.
Total in Total Total 2007 CG Salary Bonus paid Benefits payments FMV LTIP Actual and FMV at median Name $000s $000s $000s $000s $000s $000s $000s Samih Darwazah $458 $367 $83 $908 $0 $908 $2,572 Said Darwazah $600 $480 $126 $1,206 $468 $1,674 $2,572 Mazen Darwazah $372 $335 $89 $796 $234 $1,030 $982 Whilst each of Samih Darwazah and Said Darwazah served only half of the year in an executive role, the amounts received by them have been annualised to allow for comparison against the CG benchmarks.
Other remuneration matters Directors shareholding policy The Remuneration Committee does not currently have a formal shareholding requirement due to the substantial shareholdings of the Executive Directors.
The Committee, however, wholeheartedly supports the alignment of interests created by a minimum level of executive shareholding and should the make-up of the Board change would consider the introduction of a formal shareholding requirement.
All-Employee share arrangements Historically, the Company has used options to provide share incentives to employees of the Company.
While options may continue to be a part of the compensation package for those employees who do not participate in the LTIP, the Company has decided to operate a Company-wide all-employee share purchase and matching plan which will be implemented as soon as practicable.
The view of the Board is that this type of arrangement has the same cost versus benefit advantages behind the change from options to LTIP awards and is important in supporting the engagement of employees with the business as a whole.
The main features of the Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 2006 Share Incentive Plan SIP are set out below.
Shares required to satisfy awards under the SIP will be purchased in the market.
Name Status Eligibility Main features SIP As soon as practicable All employees of the The Plan provides employees with the opportunity of Company including the purchasing 1,500 or local currency equivalent of shares a Executive Directors year out of salary and providing additional matching shares on a 1:1 ratio.
These matching shares will be normally released three years after they have been awarded provided that the associated shares purchased by the employee have been retained and provided the employee is still employed by a Group Company at this time.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 49 Remuneration Committee report Executive Directors contracts Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors of the Company in force at the end of the year under review are as follows: Name Company notice period Contract date Unexpired term of contract Potential termination payment Said Darwazah 12 months 1 July 2007 Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits Mazen Darwazah 12 months 25 May 2006 Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits The Executive Directors contracts are on a rolling basis, unless terminated by at least 12 months written notice.
This arrangement is in line with best corporate practice for listed companies.
In the event of the termination of an executives contract, salary and benefits will be payable during the notice period there will, however, be no automatic entitlement to bonus payments or share incentive grants during the period of notice other than in accordance with the rules of the relevant incentive plan.
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that there have been no unjustified payments for failure on an Executive Directors termination of employment.
There are no special provisions in the contracts of employment extending notice periods on a change of control, liquidation of the Company or cessation of employment.
Said Darwazah, who has an executive service contract with the Company as detailed above, will be proposed for re-election at the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
External appointments The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public sector appointments, and that these can broaden the experience and knowledge of the Director, from which the Company can benefit.
Executive Directors may therefore accept non-executive appointments as long as they do not lead to a conflict of interest, and are allowed to retain any fees paid under such appointments.
During the year under review, Said Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah received fees of US$10,155 and US$36,150 respectively, in respect of such appointments.
Non-discretionary statutory entitlement On 1 July 2007, on the appointment of Said Darwazah as Chief Executive Officer, Samih Darwazah relinquished his executive role within the Group.
Pursuant to the requirements of Jordanian Social Security legislation, this triggered a one-off compulsory statutory payment to Mr Samih Darwazah in lieu of social security contributions relating to his historical employment with the Group.
The details of this payment are set out on page 51 of this report.
No other payment was made to Samih Darwazah in respect of the termination of his executive role, including any payment in lieu of notice.
Jordanian Social Security legislation is such that the Group will not be required to make any such payment in respect of any other Executive Director.
Non-Executive Directors fees Policy 2007 Upper quartile The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Chairman and is within the limits set by the Articles of Association.
The nature of the Companys business is international, requiring the Non-Executive Directors to travel to the USA, Middle East and Europe.
The Board is therefore made up of Non-Executive Directors with a wide range of experience both in the UK and internationally.
The use of options for Non-Executive Directors is very prevalent in the US and also to some extent internationally.
However, as a UK listed company complying with UK best practice it is not considered appropriate to grant options to the Companys independent Non-Executive Directors.
To ensure that the Company remains able to attract the appropriate calibre of candidate and to take account of its inability to grant options, the Board has therefore set its fee policy at the upper quartile.
During the year Samih Darwazah relinquished his executive role with the Group, remaining its Non-Executive Chairman.
At this time, the Board consulted external advisors in respect the appropriate level of fees to be paid in respect of his role as Non-Executive Chairman.
The individual basic and committee fees, which are paid in Sterling, are as follows: 2007 2008 Upper quartile Total fee Basic fee Committee fee Total fee fees in CG Name 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Samih Darwazah 150 150 150 123 Michael Ashton 64 57 76476 Ali Al-Husry 57 57 57 71 Breffni Byrne 71 57 14 71 77 Ronald Goode 57 57 57 71 Sir David Rowe-Ham 64 57 76476 The fees of Samih Darwazah, who has only served part of the year, have been annualised on the same basis as the remuneration of his fellow Non-Executive Directors to allow the levels to be compared to other Non-Executive Directors of the Company and his peers within the Comparator Group.
50 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 Remuneration Committee report The level of Non-Executive Director fees will be kept under review to ensure that that nomination Committee is able to recruit Non-Executive Directors of the appropriate calibre in accordance with the requirements of succession planning.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any bonus plan or share incentive programme operated by the Company and are not entitled to pension contributions or other benefits provided by the Company.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, but have letters of appointment with the Company.
Each appointment is terminable on one months notice from either the Company or the Director, but is envisaged to be for an initial period of up to 36 months, subject to the terms of the Companys Articles of Association, the Companies Act and shareholder approval.

The Comparator Group has been selected as it is the group of companies whose performance the Company is compared to in determining the release of awards under the LTIP.
The FTSE 250 Index has been selected to provide a broader comparator of the Companys performance and is the main Index in which the Companys shares are included.
