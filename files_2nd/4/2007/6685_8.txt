Remuneration committee procedures Meetings Details of the members, the number of meetings and attendees in the year are shown on page 18.
The board continues to believe that, in the circumstances of this group, the chairman of the board is the proper person to be chairman of the remuneration committee as he has more direct lines of communication with the business than the other nonexecutive directors.
Support to the committee At the meetings considering executive director remuneration, the committee receives independent advice from Watson Wyatt Limited, a remuneration specialist appointed by the committee.
In addition to the advice to the committee, Watson Wyatt Limited are also consulting actuaries to the group and advise on various pension issues.
The committee receives recommendations from the group chief executive on executive directors remuneration other than his own.
The committee also monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior managers in the group.
The committee considers executive directors bonuses, which are dependent on the achievement of safety, corporate governance and financial targets in the relevant financial year.
The committee considers the group chief executives remuneration in his absence.
Acceptance by the board of remuneration committee proposals Following the meetings, the committee recommends salary increases and bonus payments for the executive directors to the board.
During the relevant period, the board accepted the recommendations of the committee without amendment.
Policy on directors remuneration The policies for the next financial year are detailed below.
In subsequent years the policies will be kept under review to ensure that they reflect changing circumstances.
The overall policy adopted by the remuneration committee is to ensure that the group is paying sufficient to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the desired calibre.
The committee is informed of the pay, incentives and benefits packages of senior executives in the group and its operating companies.
In considering the executive directors remuneration, the committee takes into account the pay practices of its major commercial competitors.
The committee also has regard to other factors specific to the group and to each director and his role and to the wider pay market in the FTSE 250.
The last formal benchmarking exercise was conducted prior to the August 2006 salary review.
The remuneration committee recognises that, for this groups business, shareholder value is dependent on factors not all necessarily appearing within the published financial statements, although their effect on later financial statements can be significant.
Leading these corporate governance issues are safety, control of risk and other executive actions of a strategic nature that may take several accounting periods to show changes in shareholder value.
Executives in the group are encouraged to take corporate governance and strategy extremely seriously and always to consider the long term implications of their decisionmaking.
The remuneration committee has regard to these factors, as well as the annual reported financial statements, in arriving at the directors overall remuneration and in considering the mix between fixed and variable pay.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter for the chairman and the executive members of the board.
During the year, the fees of the non-executive directors were subject to an increase reflecting inflation effective from April 2007.
The remuneration committee also considers the remuneration of the chairman in his absence and during the year, the committee proposed, and the board agreed, that the chairmans salary should increase from 125,000 p. a to 140,000 p. a with effect from April 2007, to reflect the fees of chairmen of companies of comparable size and complexity.
Executive directors salaries Base salaries are reviewed annually in April.
Salaries may be increased beyond inflation if justified by reference to the performance of the individual and if there is clear evidence that the existing salaries are not competitive.
A special review was undertaken in August 2006 with remuneration specialists Watson Wyatt Limited, following changes in executive responsibility as a consequence of the resignation of the former group chief executive.
As a result of this review, Keith Ludemans salary, on appointment as group chief executive, was increased from 340,000 p. a to 450,000 p. a with effect from 10 July 2006 and a further increase was awarded in April 2007 bringing Keith Ludemans salary to 470,250 p. a at the year-end.
Ian Butchers salary at the year-end, and also at his retirement on 1 July 2007, was 410,160 p. a. Nicholas Swifts salary upon appointment on 17 July 2007 was 250,000 p. a.
21 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2007 20435 P17 P76 21 9 07 02:29 Page 22 Directors remuneration report continued Executive directors cash bonuses Executive directors are paid an annual discretionary bonus in addition to salary.
The bonus is paid in November on the basis of achievement of financial and non-financial targets in the financial year ended in the previous June July.
The targets are notified to the executive directors before the start of the year in question.
The bonus is non-pensionable and is paid in cash.
Achievement of performance targets in the year ended 1 July 2006 resulted in the maximum bonus entitlements of 30% of basic salary being confirmed in September 2006 and paid in November 2006.
For the achievement of safety and corporate governance targets, a maximum bonus of 20% was awarded, with a maximum of 10% awarded for the achievement of budgeted operating profit.
Following the review of executive directors remuneration last year, the level of bonus for executive directors was increased to a maximum bonus entitlement of 100% of basic salary, on a basis designed to introduce stretch into the scheme.
For the year ended 30 June 2007, the first year for eligibility, the remuneration committee proposed, and the board approved, bonus awards of 96.4% of basic salary for the group chief executive and former group finance director.
A maximum bonus of 20% was awarded for the achievement of safety and corporate governance targets.
A further maximum of 10% was earned after achieving 95% of budgeted profits.
Out of a potential maximum of 70% of bonus earned on the achievement of 115% of budget, 66.4% of bonus was earned after the achievement of 114.0% of budget.
The cash bonus targets remain unchanged for the forthcoming financial year.
Executive directors Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The Long Term Incentive Plan 2005 LTIP was introduced following approval by shareholders at the October 2005 extraordinary general meeting.
The first awards under the LTIP were granted to the executive directors and one senior executive in March 2006 in relation to the three year performance period commencing with the start of the 2005 06 financial period.
Further awards under the LTIP were granted to the executive directors in September 2006 in relation to the three year performance period commencing with the start of the 2006 07 financial period.
Awards in relation to the three year performance period commencing with the start of the 2007 08 financial period will be granted to the executive directors in September 2007.
It is the remuneration committees opinion that the LTIP remains the preferred choice of share incentive arrangement for the following reasons: it rewards senior executives if they achieve substantial improvements in the groups underlying financial performance and perform well relative to other companies in the transport sector and with other companies in the FTSE 250: it aligns the rewards available to executives with the returns available to shareholders: and it will assist in the retention of the senior management team over the long term.
Under the rules of the LTIP, the market value of individual awards is limited to a maximum of 100% of basic salary at the date of the grant and awards will vest dependent upon the satisfaction of performance conditions that are measured over a period of three years.
The performance conditions applied to each grant of awards is based on a comparison of the groups total shareholder return TSR with the TSR of two peer groups and also an increase in the groups earnings per share EPS in excess of an agreed target.
The performance condition applicable to one-half of each award is based on a comparison of the groups TSR with the TSR of a peer group comprising quoted companies within the transport sector Arriva plc, FirstGroup plc, National Express Group plc and Stagecoach Group plc.
The performance condition applicable to the other half of the award is based on a comparison of the groups TSR with the TSR of the companies excluding investment trusts in the FTSE 250 index of companies.
The extent to which awards will vest depends on the TSR of the group relative to the TSR of other companies within the applicable peer group.
The position in relation to that part of the award based on a comparison of the groups TSR with the TSR of the companies in the transport sector peer group is as follows: if the groups TSR is midway between the TSR of the comparator companies with the highest and the lowest TSRs, the award will vest as to 25%: if the groups TSR is higher than the TSR of the comparator companies with the highest TSR, or is less than that TSR by not more than 25% of the difference between the TSRs of the comparator companies with the highest and the lowest TSRs, the awards will vest in full: and if the groups TSR falls between those two positions, the proportion of the award that will vest will increase, on a straight-line basis, from 25% to 100%, the higher the TSR of the group.
The remuneration committee has recognised that if one company in the peer group performs very badly, an LTIP award could be payable for only marginally better performance.
Accordingly, the remuneration committee has reserved the right to prevent awards vesting automatically if this is not justified by the groups performance.
The position in relation to that part of the award based on a comparison of the groups TSR with the TSR of companies excluding investment trusts that comprise the FTSE 250 index of companies is as follows: if the groups TSR would place it at the median position, the award will vest as to 25% only: if the groups TSR would place it in the top quartile, 100% of the award will vest: and if the groups TSR would place it between those two positions, the proportion of the award that will vest will increase, on a straight-line basis, from 25% 100%, the higher the position of the group.
22 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2007 20435 P17 P76 21 9 07 02:29 Page 23 In all cases, no part of the awards will vest unless the EPS has increased, during the performance period, in excess of the increase in the Retail Prices Index for the same period plus 3% per year.
The remuneration committee considers that these performance conditions are relevant, challenging and designed to enhance shareholder value and that awards will vest in full only if exceptional performance has been achieved.
The performance tests for each award are conducted by the remuneration committees independent advisers, Watson Wyatt, in accordance with recognised methodology.
Following the death of the former group chief executive, Christopher Moyes, on 12 September 2006, the remuneration committee made a judgement, as required under the rules of the LTIP, on whether the award granted to him on 9 March 2006 should vest.
Taking advice from Watson Wyatt on the extent to which the TSR and EPS tests had been met and then pro-rating the award for the period between 9 March 2006 and 12 September 2006, the committee determined that 3,347 of the shares should be allowed to vest.
Executive directors share bonus plan The executive directors share bonus plan has previously been used to make share based awards to executive directors and senior executives in the group.
This has now been replaced by the LTIP described previously.
The final grant of shares under the executive directors share bonus plan was made to the executive directors and one senior executive in December 2005, in relation to the year ended 2 July 2005.
The only outstanding awards made under the plan that have not yet matured were those made to the current group chief executive in October 2004 and December 2005.
These will remain in the trust for a period of three years from the award date, when title will be transferred to the group chief executive, provided he is still employed by the group.
If the group chief executive leaves employment before the expiry of the three years, transfer of title is subject to the discretion of the remuneration committee.
During the year, and following the death of the former group chief executive, Christopher Moyes, in September 2006, his spouse, Mrs Janice Moyes, became absolutely entitled to the awards granted to him in December 2005.
The awards granted to the former group finance director, Ian Butcher, in October 2004 and December 2005, in relation to the years ended 3 July 2004 and 2 July 2005 respectively, vested in full following his retirement with the agreement of the board.
Details of the shares held under the rules of the plan can be found on page 27.
Savings related share option scheme and share incentive plan The company operates a savings related share option scheme and a share incentive plan: the former group finance director, Ian Butcher, participated in both until his retirement on 1 July 2007.
His eligibility and involvement in them was no different from the terms of any other participating group employee and was not separately regulated by the remuneration committee.
There are no other share option or long term incentive schemes available to executive directors.
Other benefits The group does not allocate motor cars to directors or other staff.
Instead, personnel who would have been allocated a motor car as part of their benefits, or to accomplish their work, are given a car replacement allowance.
Pension funds The executive directors are entitled to become members of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan, a registered pension plan.
Following his accession to group chief executive in July 2006, Keith Ludeman opted out of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan with effect from 1 December 2006, but retains a salary link in relation to his accrued benefit which is provided separately through an individual non-registered unfunded pension arrangement.
In lieu of future benefits, Keith Ludeman receives a non-pensionable salary supplement.
Following his appointment as group finance director in July 2007, Nicholas Swift joined The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan with effect from 1 August 2007.
Fixed and performance related pay at maximum performance levels Basic salary excluding pension contributions and benefits Value of LTIP shares vesting Performance related cash bonus A substantial proportion of the executive directors pay is performance related.
The chart above shows the balance between fixed and performance related pay at maximum performance levels.
Maximum performance assumes achievement of maximum bonus and full vesting of shares under the LTIP.
