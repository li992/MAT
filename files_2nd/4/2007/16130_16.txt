Policy on external appointments The Company acknowledges that its directors are likely to be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies.
The Committee believes that these non-executive duties can broaden the directors knowledge and experience to the benefit of the Company.
Executive directors are, therefore, with the Boards permission, allowed to accept one such appointment, as long as there is no conflict of interest, and to retain any fees.
Sly Bailey was senior independent director of EMI plc until 17 August 2007 for which she received a fee of 43,000.
