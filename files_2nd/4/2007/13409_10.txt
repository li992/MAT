The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments, share based payments and retirement benefit obligations.
The following accounting standards and interpretations were adopted by the Group in 2007. i IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the complementary amendment to IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures.
These standards introduce detailed new disclosures relating to financial instruments.
IFRS7 does not have any impact on the classification and valuation of the Groups financial instruments.
ii IFRIC14 IAS19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction.
This interpretation provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS19 Employee Benefits on the amount of the surplus that can be recognised as an asset.
It also explains how a pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding requirement.
The IFRIC had no impact on the Group.
The following accounting standards and amendments to existing standards are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group.
This new standard requires identification and reporting of operating segments on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the Board in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance.
The Group is currently in the process of assessing the impact of IFRS8 and intends to adopt it no later than accounting periods beginning on 1 January 2009. ii IAS23 Revised Borrowing Costs.
This revision of an existing standard requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs directly attributable to an acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale as part of the cost of that asset.
The revised standard is not expected to have any impact on the Group.
The Group intends to adopt IAS23 no later than accounting periods beginning on 1 January 2009. iii IFRS3 Revised Business Combinations.
This revision of an existing standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations with certain changes which could impact the Group.
For example all payments to purchase a business must be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date with some contingent payments subsequently remeasured at fair value through the consolidated income statement.
In addition all transaction costs must be expensed.
The Group intends to adopt IFRS3 Revised no later than accounting periods beginning on 1 January 2009.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the following restatements have been made to the comparative amounts: i The consolidated financial statements have been restated for the discontinuance of the Glass segment.
ii The segment analysis and average number of employees have been restated for the disposal of a Dutch Plastic Packaging business which has moved from Plastic Packaging to Disposals and businesses for sale.
iii The consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2006 has been restated for final fair value adjustments applied to prior year acquisitions.
Key estimates and assumptions The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, ultimately actual results may differ from those estimates.
The key estimates and assumptions used in these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the accounting policy for goodwill set out below and in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
The recoverable amounts of cash generating units are determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates which include cash flow projections for each cash generating unit and discount rates based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with particular cash generating units.
Valuation of acquired intangible assets Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business must initially be recorded at fair value.
The acquisition of OI Plastics in 2007 resulted in significant customer relationships, technology and patents being recognised by the Group.
These intangible assets were valued using the income approach.
The underlying premise in applying this approach is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present value of the cash receipts and cash payments to be received and made over the life of the asset.
In applying this methodology certain key judgements and estimates were required to be made in respect of future gross cash flows and the discount rate.
Retirement benefit obligations The consolidated financial statements include costs in relation to, and provision for, retirement benefit obligations.
There are two principal funded defined benefit pension plans in the UK and US and an unfunded retiree medical plan in the US.
The costs and the present value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on such factors as life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of current employees, the returns that plan assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liabilities.
The Group uses estimates based on previous experience and third party actuarial advice in determining these future cash flows and in determining the discount rate.
If the discount rate was to fall by 0.5%, the net liabilities of the plans at 31 December 2007 would rise by approximately 120m 2006: 160m.
If equity values were to fall by 10% then the plan assets at 31 December 2007 would fall by approximately 90m 2006: 110m.
The accounting policy for retirement benefit obligations is set out below and details of the assumptions used for the two principal pension plans and the retiree medical plan are set out in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
76 Rexam Annual Report 2007 1 Principal accounting policies continued Income taxes Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations whose ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes are likely to be due.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on estimates of future taxable income and recoverability.
Where a change in circumstance occurs, or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax balances in the year in which that change or outcome is known.
The accounting policy for income taxes is set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise Rexam PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the results of its associates and joint ventures.
The financial statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are prepared as of the same reporting date using consistent accounting policies.
Intercompany balances and transactions, including any unrealised profits arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are entities where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanied by a share of more than 50% of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanied by a share of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Joint ventures are entities over which the Group has joint control, whereby the strategic, financial and operating decisions relating to the venture require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control and are generally accompanied by a 50% share of voting rights.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
If the Groups share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
All acquisitions are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group, together with any costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Foreign currencies The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
The presentation currency of the Group is sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
Exceptions to this are where the monetary items form part of the net investment in a foreign operation or are designated as hedges of a net investment, or designated as cash flow hedges.
Such exchange differences are initially recognised in equity.
The balance sheets of foreign operations are translated into sterling using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statements are translated into sterling using the average exchange rate for the year.
Where this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, the exchange rate on the transaction date is used.
Exchange differences on translation into sterling arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement.
The principal exchange rates against sterling used in these consolidated financial statements are as follows: Average Closing Average Closing 2007 2007 2006 2006 US dollar 2.00 1.99 1.84 1.96 Euro 1.46 1.37 1.47 1.49 Revenue recognition Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration, net of rebates and trade discounts.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods to the buyer, when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
The Group makes certain advance payments to customers in relation to supply contracts which are charged in the consolidated income statement over the useful economic lives of the contracts.
Rexam Annual Report 2007 77 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued Exceptional items Items which are exceptional, being material in terms of size and or nature are presented separately from underlying business performance in the consolidated income statement.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide an indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
The principal events which may give rise to exceptional items include significant changes to retirement benefit obligations, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, the restructuring and integration of businesses, major asset impairments, the subsequent recognition of acquired deferred tax assets, significant litigation and tax claims, the amortisation of certain acquired intangible assets and non hedge accounted fair value movements and hedge ineffectiveness on financing derivative financial instruments.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution pension plans.
A defined benefit pension plan is one that specifies the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement.
The Group operates both funded defined benefit pension plans, where actuarially determined payments are made to trustee administered funds, and unfunded defined benefit pension plans, where no such payments are made.
The asset or liability recognised in the consolidated balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the balance sheet date.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated, at least triennially, by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included in operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Past service costs are similarly included where the benefits have vested, otherwise they are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The expected return on assets of funded defined benefits pension plans, less administration expenses of pension plans, and the interest on pension plan liabilities comprise the pension element of the net finance cost in the consolidated income statement.
Differences between the actual and expected return on assets, experience gains and losses and changes in actuarial assumptions are included in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
A defined contribution plan is one under which fixed contributions are paid to a third party.
The Group has no further payment obligations once these contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised in the consolidated income statement when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is likely.
The Group also provides post retirement healthcare benefits retiree medical to certain of its current and former employees.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on an employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period.
The consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet treatment with respect to retiree medical is similar to that for defined benefit pension plans.
These obligations are valued by independent actuaries, usually on an annual basis.
Share based payment The Group operates various equity settled and cash settled share option schemes.
For equity settled share options, the services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options.
The fair value is calculated at grant date and recognised in the consolidated income statement, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest.
Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
For cash settled share options, the services received from employees are measured at the fair value of the liability and recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The fair value of the liability is measured at each balance sheet date and at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement.
IFRS2 Share-based Payment has been applied to equity settled share options granted after 7 November 2002 and to all cash settled share options.
The Rexam Employee Share Trust holds ordinary shares in Rexam PLC which are presented in the consolidated financial statements as a deduction from equity.
Interest Interest on cash and cash equivalents and borrowings held at amortised cost is recognised in the consolidated income statement using the effective interest method.
Interest includes exchange differences arising on cash and cash equivalents and borrowings, where such exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Interest includes all fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, and corresponding adjustments to hedged items under designated fair value hedging relationships, where they relate to financing activities and are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Prior to their redemption, interest included dividends paid on convertible preference shares.
Interest relating to payments made over an extended period of development of large capital projects is added to the capital cost and amortised over the expected lives of those projects.
78 Rexam Annual Report 2007 1 Principal accounting policies continued Segment reporting The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographic segments.
A business segment is a component of the Group that is engaged in providing a group of related products and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographic segment is a component of the Group that operates within a particular economic environment and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments.
Non specific central costs are allocated on the basis of net assets excluding investments in associates and joint ventures, net borrowings, deferred tax, current tax and non current tax.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
At the date of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions on or before 31 December 1997 has been deducted from equity.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business sold except for any goodwill deducted from equity.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented in goodwill and goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and joint ventures is presented in investments in associates and joint ventures.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation begins when an asset is available for use and is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Acquired computer software 2 to 3 years Computer software development Up to 7 years Acquired customer contracts and relationships, technology and patents Up to 20 years Development projects Up to 5 years The cost of intangible assets acquired in an acquisition is the fair value at acquisition date.
The cost of separately acquired intangible assets, including computer software, comprises the purchase price and any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for use.
Computer software development costs that are directly associated with the implementation of major business systems are capitalised as intangible assets.
Expenditure on research is recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement as incurred.
Expenditure incurred on development projects is capitalised as an intangible asset if it is probable that the expenditure will generate future economic benefits and can be measured reliably.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
For all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost less residual value of the assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings Up to 50 years Leasehold buildings Shorter of 50 years or lease term Manufacturing machinery 7 to 17 years Computer hardware Up to 8 years Fixtures, fittings and vehicles 4 to 10 years Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
Impairment of assets At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is written down to its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use and is determined for an individual asset.
If the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined.
Discount rates reflecting the asset specific risks and the time value of money are used for the value in use calculation.
Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first in first out or a weighted average cost basis.
Cost comprises directly attributable purchase and conversion costs and an allocation of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and selling costs.
Rexam Annual Report 2007 79 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement comprise cash at bank and in hand, money market deposits and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are presented in borrowings within current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale The assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are available for immediate sale in their present condition and a sale is highly probable within one year.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Non current assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortised and any future write down to fair value less costs to sell will be recognised as an impairment loss.
Grants Grants received in respect of property, plant and equipment are capitalised and released to the consolidated income statement in equal instalments over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the liability and finance charge to produce a constant rate of interest on the finance lease balance outstanding.
Assets capitalised under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases other than finance leases are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Any incentives to enter into operating leases are recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight line basis.
Income taxes The tax expense represents the sum of current tax, non current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax and non current tax are based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax arising from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than an acquisition, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, unless the tax relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the tax is recognised directly in equity through the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when a present obligation exists in respect of a past event and where the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised for direct expenditure on business reorganisations where plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced, and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken on or before the balance sheet date.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is considered to be material.
Dividends Final equity dividends to the shareholders of Rexam PLC are recognised in the period that they are approved by the shareholders.
Interim equity dividends are recognised in the period that they are paid.
80 Rexam Annual Report 2007 1 Principal accounting policies continued Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments utilised by the Group include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and forward aluminium and energy commodity contracts.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Hedges are classified as follows: i Fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
ii Cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability i n cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
iii Net investment hedges where they hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and similarly recognised in the consolidated income statement.
For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement.
When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a non financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the consolidated income statement.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges and embedded derivatives are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments related to operating activities are included in operating profit when recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments related to financing activities are included in interest when recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Borrowings are measured at amortised cost except where they are hedged by an effective fair value hedge, in which case the carrying value is adjusted to reflect the fair value movements associated with the hedged risk.
Where borrowings are used to hedge the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations, the portion of the exchange gain or loss on the borrowings that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity.
Available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value.
Unrealised gains and losses are recognised in equity except for impairment losses, interest and dividends arising from those assets which are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Trade and other receivables are measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Trade and other payables are measured at cost.

These changes in retiree medical benefits resulted in an exceptional gain of 61m, net of associated legal costs of 2m.
In 2006, a change to the US retiree medical plan was made to coordinate prescription drug benefits payable to certain retirees with cover available from the US government through the Medicare Part D programme.
This change resulted in a gain of 38m, net of associated legal fees of 1m.
In addition, certain changes were implemented to the US defined benefit pension plans that gave rise to a gain of 15m.
Intangible assets, such as technology, patents and customer contracts, are required to be recognised on the acquisition of businesses and amortised over their useful lives.
The directors consider that separate disclosure of the amortisation of such acquired intangibles amounting to 22m 2006: 11m aids comparison of organic growth in underlying profit.
Therefore this cost, which will become more significant as the impact of recent and future acquisitions is reflected, is separately disclosed within exceptional items.
Following the closure of two plants in North America in 2007 and other costs forming part of the integration of OI Plastics, a 6m charge has been made.
In 2006, a charge of 8m arose from the integration of the Plastic Packaging acquisitions of Precise Technology and of FangXin and a cost of 21m arose from the restructuring of existing businesses, principally in the Plastic Packaging sector.
The Group operates in a global tax environment, which can give rise to uncertainty over the quantification of some of its tax liabilities in certain territories.
The tax environment in Brazil is complex: interpretation and application of tax law continues to change and claims are usually subject to long judicial processes.
In this territory, the Group has certain indirect tax exposures, some of which relate to periods prior to its acquisition of ANC in 2000 and Latasa in 2003.
In view of the uncertainty surrounding these Brazilian tax risks, management has concluded it would be appropriate to record an exceptional provision of 17m in 2007.
Notwithstanding the provision, the Group considers that it has defensible positions in most instances and will continue robustly to defend its position on any assessments and claims.
Should the risks crystallise, the cash outflows related to this provision are likely to arise over a number of years, although a payment of approximately 4m is anticipated to be made during the first half of 2008.
86 Rexam Annual Report 2007 6 Exceptional items continuing operations continued Gains on the disposal of subsidiaries, not classified as discontinued operations, amounted to 1m in 2007 2006: losses 3m.
In 2006, a provision of 8m was made in respect of a legacy litigation claim relating to an acquired business.
The claim had been initiated before the Group assumed control of that business.
A charge of 3m in 2006 arose from the recognition of deferred tax assets on prior year acquisitions relating to the utilisation of tax losses not recorded at the date of acquisition.
Following the relocation of a manufacturing facility, a gain on the sale of land and property of 8m in 2006 was made by the associate in Korea.
The fair value of the derivatives arising on financing activities directly relates to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The fair value will change as the transactions to which they relate mature, as new derivatives are transacted and due to the passage of time.
The fair value change on financing derivatives for the year was a net loss of 2m 2006: net gain 7m.
In 2006, Rexam shareholders approved the early redemption, into ordinary shares, of the convertible preference shares.
The enhanced conversion premium of 10m, including associated costs, was included in exceptional items due to its size and one off nature.

Of the total deferred tax assets, 14m 2006: 36m are recoverable within one year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balance net.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised where it is probable that they will be recovered.
In recognising deferred tax assets, the Group has considered if it is more likely than not that sufficient future profits will be available to absorb tax losses and other timing differences.
Deferred tax assets of 35m 2006: 30m have not been recognised in respect of losses, tax credits on dividends and other timing differences due to the uncertainty of the availability of suitable profits in the foreseeable future.
The principal items on which no deferred tax assets have been recognised are tax losses of 60m 2006: 30m and UK tax credits on foreign dividends of 18m 2006: 18m.
There is no expiry date on either of these items.
Other temporary differences within deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2007 include 38m 2006: 35m in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets.
No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates.
If the earnings were remitted in full, tax of 205m 2006: 175m would be payable.

In accordance with IFRS5 Non Current Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations the disposal has been classified as a discontinued operation in these consolidated financial statements.
A summary of results, cash flows and profit on disposal are set out below.

Accounting rules state that depreciation and amortisation should not be charged on a disposal group held for sale.
Accordingly, depreciation and amortisation of 11m were not charged with respect to Glass for the period 12 March 2007 to 21 June 2007.
Had depreciation and amortisation been charged, operating profit and profit before tax for the six months to 30 June 2007 would have been 15m.

This change was deemed appropriate since each division has a managing director and management team reporting to the Group Director of Plastic Packaging and resources are managed on this basis to gain maximum benefits from the enlarged segment.
The recoverable amounts of all cash generating units or groups of cash generating units were determined based on value in use calculations.
The cash flow projections used in these calculations were based on the financial budget for 2008 and the plans for 2009 and 2010 together the budget projections, approved by senior management.
Cash flows beyond the three year period have been extrapolated using a zero real growth rate.
Key assumptions used in the recoverable amount calculation include: i Sales and margins.
Forecasts are based on sector level analyses of sales, markets, costs and competitors for the budget projections.
Consideration was given to past experience and knowledge of future contracts.
ii Raw materials and energy price inflation.
Forecasts for aluminium are based on forward prices at the time the budget projections were prepared and take into account pass through of costs and hedging.
Forecasts for other raw materials and energy are based on inflation forecasts and supply and demand factors.
Forecasts are based on analysis by management of factors likely to affect exchange rates for the budget projections including interest rates and economic growth rates.
The pre tax discount rates used for the cash generating units for which the carrying amount of goodwill is significant in comparison with the total Group were as set out below.

The impairment of 7m in 2006 related to a 5m write down of assets in the UK following the decision to exit the non barrier thin wall plastic packaging business and a 2m write down of assets following the decision to reduce the cost base for Make Up in France.
The impairments were measured by determining the fair values of the assets, being market value less selling costs.
Interest capitalised in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment relates to the construction of a Beverage Cans plant in Austria.

Customer credit facilities for new customers must be approved by designated managers at business level or by senior sector management.
Credit limits are set with reference to trading history and reports from credit rating agencies.
Customer credit facilities are reviewed at the sales order entry stage and at the time of shipment so not to exceed customer limits.
Overdue accounts are regularly reviewed and impairment provisions are created where necessary.
As a matter of policy, all outstanding trade balances greater than 90 days are fully provided except as approved by senior sector management and with due regard to the historical risk profile of the customer.
The Group has extremely low historical levels of customer credit defaults, due in part to the blue chip multinational nature of many of its customers and the long term relationships it has with them.
There were no new customers in 2007 where the Group considered there was a risk of significant credit default.
There are no trade and other receivables that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated.

These facilities may generally be drawn in a range of freely available currencies and are at floating rates of interest.
In addition the Group has a subordinated bond and a number of medium term notes in issue.
The subordinated bond is denominated in euros with a maturity of 2067.
It was issued at a fixed rate of interest but has been swapped to US dollar floating rates of interest through the use of cross currency and interest rate derivatives.
The medium term notes are denominated in euros and sterling with maturities between 2008 and 2013.
They were issued at fixed rates of interest although some have been swapped to floating rates of interest in euro and US dollar through the use of cross currency and interest rate derivatives.
Those medium term notes not swapped to floating rates of interest are denominated in euro and are issued at a fixed rate of 4.375% per annum.

The carrying value of trade and other receivables and trade and other payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
The fair value of the subordinated bond and medium term notes have been determined by reference to quoted market prices at the close of business on 31 December.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, fixed rate loans and finance leases have been determined by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts has been determined by marking those contracts to market against prevailing forward foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of forward aluminium commodity contracts has been determined by marking those contracts to market at prevailing forward aluminium prices.
The fair value of embedded derivatives has been calculated using valuation models incorporating market commodity prices and foreign exchange rates.
100 Rexam Annual Report 2007 24 Financial instruments continued ii Financial risk management The Group bases its financial risk management on sound economic objectives and good corporate practice.
Group Treasury operations are carried out under strict policies and parameters defined by the Rexam Board and supervised by its Finance Committee.
Group Treasury is not operated as a separate profit centre nor does it enter into any transactions for speculative purposes.
The Groups major operational hedges comply with IAS39 and hedge accounting treatment is applied.
Some smaller trading exposures are hedged on an economic basis and hedge accounting treatment is not applied where the compliance burden is deemed to be unduly onerous and the income statement volatility arising is not expected to be significant.
a Market risk: currencies The Group seeks to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange movements between overseas currencies and sterling arising on the translation of the value of non UK operations into sterling for reporting purposes.
This is achieved by borrowing a proportion of debt, either directly or through the use of cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, in currencies which match or are closely linked to the currencies of the overseas businesses.
This approach also provides some protection against the foreign exchange translation of overseas earnings as it matches the currency of earnings to the currency of the interest expense.
These amounts are included in the consolidated financial statements by translation into sterling at the balance sheet date and, where hedge accounted, offset in equity against the translation movement in net assets.
The Group looks to mitigate currency risk arising on cross border trading transactions using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Generally, the Group will hedge a higher proportion of shorter term, contractually committed transactions, but does also hedge some longer term contracts into the medium term.
None of the foreign exchange derivative instruments at 31 December 2007 related to derivative trading activity, although some fair value gains and losses were taken to the consolidated income statement because IAS39 hedge accounting treatment was not applied.
Foreign exchange derivative instruments are used for hedging general business exposures in foreign currencies such as the purchase and sale of goods, capital expenditure and dividend flows.
Group businesses are required to report their foreign exchange risks against their functional currency to Group Treasury and these risks are then hedged in accordance with the Groups policy on foreign exchange management.
Foreign exchange risks are hedged by Rexam Treasury unless it is a legal requirement in the country where the foreign exchange risk arises that hedging is carried out locally.
In this case, hedging is carried out by the individual responsible for treasury within the local business, but still operating within the overall Group policy on foreign exchange management.
b Market risk: interest rates The objective of the Groups interest rate risk management is to reduce its exposure to the impact of changes in interest rates in the currencies in which debt is borrowed.
Interest rate risk is managed through the issue of fixed rate medium term notes and subordinated bonds and through the use of interest rate derivatives that are used to manage the overall fixed to floating mix of bank and bond debt, which was 32% fixed and 68% floating at 31 December 2007 2006: 49% and 51%.
Group Treasury operates within a broad framework in respect of the mix of fixed and floating rate debt, as the optimum blend will vary depending on the mix of currencies and the Groups view of the debt markets at any point in time.
The Group will generally look to keep between 20% and 80% of its overall debt at fixed rates.
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on bank deposit rates in the relevant currency.
Short term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective short term deposit rates.
Other floating rate financial instruments are at the appropriate LIBOR interest rates as adjusted by variable margins.
Interest on floating rate financial instruments is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on fixed rate financial instruments is fixed until maturity of the instrument.
Some interest rate swaps used to manage the Groups fixed to floating debt mix, while economically effective, are ineligible for hedge accounting treatment.
Fair value gains and losses on these hedges are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
In 2007, there was a net loss of 2m 2006: gain of 7m on financing derivatives on which hedge accounting was not applied, recorded within exceptional interest in the consolidated income statement.
c Market risk: commodity prices The objective of commodity risk management is to identify those businesses that have exposures to commodities traded on commodity markets and to then determine which, if any, commodity market instruments are appropriate for hedging those exposures.
To manage such exposures, the Group uses mainly over the counter instruments transacted with banks, which are themselves priced through a recognised commodity exchange, such as the London Metal Exchange.
The Group manages the purchase of certain raw materials, including aluminium and energy costs through physical supply contracts which, in the main, relate directly to commodity price indices.
The supply contracts may be hedged with appropriate derivative contracts to fix and manage costs.
The derivative hedge contracts may extend over several years.
Usually a higher proportion of short term exposures are hedged than those further forward.
The extent of the forward cover taken is judged according to market conditions and prices of futures prevailing at the time.
None of the commodity derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2007 related to derivative trading activity, although some fair value gains and losses were taken to the consolidated income statement because IFRS hedge accounting was not applied.
The commodity hedges mainly relate to contracted and expected future purchases of aluminium but can also include energy and other tradeable commodities.
Rexam Annual Report 2007 101 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 24 Financial instruments continued d Market risk: sensitivities A sensitivity analysis for financial assets and liabilities affected by market risk is set out below.
Each risk is analysed separately and shows the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities when a certain risk is changed.
The sensitivity analysis has been performed on balances at 31 December each year and therefore is not representative of transactions throughout the year.
The rates used are based on historical trends and, where relevant, projected forecasts.
Key methods and assumptions made when performing the sensitivity analysis net of hedging : a For the floating rate element of interest rate swaps, the sensitivity calculation is performed based on the floating rates as at 31 December each year and the number of days since the last interest rate reset date.
b The translation impact of overseas subsidiaries is not included in the sensitivity analysis.
c The sensitivity analysis ignores any tax implications.
Currencies The two tables set out below show the impact at 31 December each year on profit before tax and equity of changing the relative values of currency pairs significant to Rexam by a realistic percentage.
The impact of the sensitivities disclosed is shown gross for each currency pair.
They do not include the effect of any offsetting reductions that are created through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency balances.
Therefore, the sensitivities disclosed are, in overall terms, larger than would be expected to arise taking into consideration all factors.

Interest rates At 31 December 2007, if the US dollar interest rate was changed by1% with all other held variables constant, profit before tax for 2007 would change by 4m 2006: 1% and 1m, mainly as a result of US dollar denominated floating rate debt.
There was no significant interest rate risk relating to equity in either year.
Commodity prices There was no significant price risk relating to the income statement since the majority of the commodity derivatives are treated as cash flow hedges, with movements being reflected in equity.
At 31 December 2007, if the aluminum price was changed by 10% with all other variables held constant, equity for 2007 would change by 27m 2006: 11% and 15m.
Equity prices The Group is not subject to any significant equity price risk.
102 Rexam Annual Report 2007 24 Financial instruments continued e Liquidity risk The Group monitors its liquidity to maintain a sufficient level of undrawn committed debt facilities thereby ensuring financial flexibility.
As at 31 December 2007, Rexam had 707m of undrawn committed debt facilities available, 2006: 503m.
The increase in undrawn committed facilities reflects Rexams action to reduce liquidity risk in response to deteriorating conditions in the financial markets during the second half of 2007.
Group Treasury mitigates refinancing risk by raising its debt requirements from a range of different sources and with a range of maturity dates.
As at 31 December 2007, committed debt maturities ranged from less than two years 18% of drawn debt 2006: less than two years 12% of drawn debt to 2067 32% of drawn debt 2006: 2013, 33% of drawn debt.
No more than 32% of drawn debt 2006: 33% of drawn debt expires in any one financial year.
An analysis of undiscounted contractual maturities for non derivative financial liabilities and derivative financial liabilities and assets is set out below.

There are no significant concentrations of credit risk associated with financial instruments of the Group.
Credit risk arises from exposures to external counterparties.
In order to manage this risk, the Group has strict credit quality measures that are applied to counterparty institutions and also limits on maximum exposure levels to any one counterparty.
For exposure purposes, cash deposits are weighted at 100% of the exposure to the counterparty and derivative instruments on a sliding scale based on the type of instrument and length of contract to maturity.
Rexam Annual Report 2007 103 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 24 Financial instruments continued To manage credit risk, the maximum limits for Group bank exposures held under company policy are set out below by counterparty rating.
These limits are used when making investments and for the use of derivative instruments.
The table also sets out the Groups exposure at 31 December in percentage terms for each counterparty credit rating category.

This objective is subject always to an overriding principal that capital must be managed to ensure the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Group is able to adjust its capital structure through the issue or redemption of either debt or equity and by adjustment to the dividend paid to equity holders.
The Group uses a range of financial metrics to monitor the efficiency of its capital structure, including its weighted average cost of capital and net debt to EBITDA and ensures that its capital structure provides sufficient financial strength to allow it to secure access to debt finance at reasonable cost.
At 31 December 2007, the Groups net debt to EBITDA for financial covenant purposes was 2.2 times 2006: 2.2 times.
The Group aims to keep this ratio within the range 1.25 times to 3.5 times.
For this purpose net debt is broadly net borrowings adjusted to exclude interest accruals, certain derivative financial instruments and an equity portion of the subordinated bond and to reflect non sterling amounts at average exchange rates.
EBITDA is underlying operating profit from continuing operations after adding back depreciation and amortisation of computer software and adjusted to include acquisitions on a pro forma basis and exclude disposed businesses.
iii Derivative financial instruments The net fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges and those not designated as hedging instruments is set out below.
2007 2006 m m Fair value hedges Interest rate swaps 2 3 Cross currency swaps 146 80 148 83 Cash flow hedges Forward foreign exchange contracts 7 5 Forward aluminium commodity contracts 3 36 10 31 Not hedge accounted Cross currency swaps 20 22 Forward foreign exchange contracts 2 Embedded derivatives 2 18 20 Total net fair value of derivative financial instruments 156 134 Fair value hedges The Group has designated interest rate swaps and the interest element of cross currency swaps as fair value hedges whereby interest is receivable at fixed interest rates varying from 4.4% to 7.1% 2006: 4.4% to 7.1%.
These swaps hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of medium term notes which mature in 2009 and 2013 2006: 2009 and 2013.
The cross currency swaps hedge changes in the fair value of US dollar intercompany loans which mature in 2009 and changes in the fair value of the euro subordinated bond which matures in 2067.
Ineffectiveness gains of 1m were included in interest in 2007 2006: nil.
104 Rexam Annual Report 2007 24 Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges The Group has designated forward foreign exchange, aluminium commodity and energy contracts as cash flow hedges.
The aluminium commodity and energy contracts hedge anticipated future purchases of aluminium and energy respectively and mature between 2008 and 2009 2006: between 2007 and 2008.
Forward foreign exchange contracts hedge foreign currency transaction risk and mature between 2008 and 2009 2006: between 2007 and 2009.

The resulting returns for equities, bonds and cash were then reduced to allow for administration expenses.
The mortality assumptions used in valuing the liabilities of the UK pension plan in 2007 and 2006 are based on the standard tables PA92 as published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
These tables are adjusted to reflect the circumstances of the plan membership.
The life expectancy assumed for male pensioners aged 65 is 19.6 years 2006: 19.6 years and for female pensioners aged 65 is 22.4 years 2006: 22.4 years.
The mortality assumptions used in valuing the liabilities of the US pension plans in 2007 are based on the RP2000 combined active and retiree mortality table projected to 2007 2006: RP2000 combined active and mortality table projected to 2006 weighted 70% blue collar and 30% white collar.
The life expectancy assumed for male pensioners aged 65 is 17.8 years 2006: 17.8 years and for female pensioners aged 65 is 20.2 years 2006: 20.2 years.

Most of the utilisation of these provisions is likely within the next year.
Incentives relate to the cash settled phantom share option scheme.
This provision is short term, with the timing of its utilisation being dependent on various performance criteria being met.
For further details of the phantom share option scheme see note 28.
Environmental compliance mainly relates to the USA and is long term in nature with the timing of utilisation unknown due to the need to complete remedial investigations, to negotiate remedial plans with local authorities and to implement agreed plans.
Other provisions comprise the following amounts: A provision of 14m 2006: nil relating to indirect tax exposures in Brazil, as explained in note 6.
A provision of 8m 2006: 8m in respect of a legacy litigation claim relating to an acquired business where the amount of the final liability and timing of payment, if any, is dependent upon the outcome of the litigation.
A provision of 2m 2006: 3m in respect of onerous property contracts in the UK, the timing of the utilisation of which is in accordance with those contracts.
A provision of nil 2006: 3m in respect of emission rights of the discontinued Glass segment utilised in the year and a provision of nil 2006: 1m in respect of business disposals.

This raised 280m net of 6m expenses, resulting in 38m being credited to share capital and 242m being credited to share premium account.
The proceeds were used to partly finance the acquisition of OI Plastics.
At the AGM 2007, shareholders approved the consolidation of the 72,462 billion 2 authorised unclassified shares of 0.0001p into 112,718,793 authorised ordinary shares of 64 7p each ranking equally as one class of shares with the existing authorised ordinary shares.
In 2006, shareholders approved the compulsory conversion of all the issued convertible preference shares into new ordinary shares.
As part of the conversion process the difference in value between the aggregate nominal value of the convertible preference shares prior to conversion and the aggregate nominal value of the new ordinary shares was redesignated into deferred shares of 0.0001p each.
The deferred shares were redeemed on 31 December 2006 and the related authorised share capital was redesignated as unclassified share capital.
112 Rexam Annual Report 2007 27 Equity continued The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares and the provisions relating to the transfer of ordinary shares are as governed by law and in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive all shareholder documents, to attend, speak and exercise voting rights, either in person or by proxy, on resolutions proposed at general meetings and participate in any distribution of income or capital.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of ordinary shares where such transfer documents are not lodged by acceptable means or proof of title is required.
Ordinary shares are held by the Rexam Employee Share Trust Trust for the satisfaction of options granted through the Long Term Incentive Schemes LTIP, Deferred Bonus Incentive Scheme DBIS and the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
The independent trustee of the Trust has the same rights as any other shareholder.
The options granted under the Companys other share incentive schemes are satisfied from the issue of new ordinary shares: therefore employees do not hold any voting rights until the date of exercise.
There are no restrictions on the voting rights of holders of ordinary shares nor any known agreements between holders of ordinary shares under which financial rights are held by any person other than the registered holder, or voting rights or the transfer of ordinary shares are restricted.
28 Share based payment Rexams equity settled share based payment schemes comprise the LTIP, DBIS, ESOS and the Savings Related Share Option Schemes SAYE.
Rexams cash settled share based payment scheme is the Phantom Stock Plan Phantoms.
LTIP Annual grants of options over ordinary shares are made to executive directors and certain senior executives.
The Total Shareholder Return TSR of Rexam is measured and compared to a comparator group of listed companies.
The percentage of share options that actually vest is dependent upon Rexams comparative TSR over a three year measurement period, commencing on 1 January of the year in which the option is granted.
If performance targets are met, share options vest on 1 January, three years after the start of the measurement period and can be exercised at a nominal cost to the employee.
The expiry date is six years and eleven months after the grant date.
DBIS A grant of options was made during 2007 to an executive director.
The number of shares that vest was measured over 2007 against a non market based condition relating to an OI Plastics operating profit target.
If the target is achieved or exceeded by up to 10%, the option will vest on a straight line basis.
Subject to vesting, the option may be exercised at nominal cost to the participant for a period of three months from 1 January 2010 and will expire on 31 March 2010.
ESOS Annual grants of options over ordinary shares are made to certain senior management.
For grants up to and including 2006, shares vest if a performance target annual growth rate of pre determined economic profit is met over the three year measurement period.
No performance target was set for the 2007 grant and the option will vest three years after the grant date provided the participant is still employed by Rexam.
Share options are exercisable three years after grant date and expire ten years after grant date.
The exercise price is set at market value using the market price of a Rexam ordinary share at the grant date.
SAYE All employee SAYE schemes are open to eligible employees resident in the UK and Ireland.
Annual grants of options over ordinary shares are currently made at an exercise price of 80% of the market value of Rexam shares at grant date.
Share options vest three, five or seven years after the commencement of the savings contract, depending on the term selected by the employee at grant and expire six months after vesting.
Phantoms This scheme operates in the same way as the ESOS with the same terms and conditions, but grants are made to senior management located outside the UK and Europe and are settled in cash.

Historical volatilities are arrived at using a period comparable with the expected life of the option.
The correlation coefficient for the LTIP is calculated using the correlation matrix for the TSR simulation using three year daily historical stock price series for each company in the comparator group, including Rexam, from the beginning of the measurement date.
A ten year life is initially assumed to calculate the fair value of phantoms.
As the fair value is updated at each subsequent valuation the expected life is reduced for each year until exercise.

The claims include litigation against Group companies, investigations by regulatory and fiscal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation.
Provision has been made in these consolidated financial statements against those claims which the Board considers are likely to result in significant liabilities.
34 Post balance sheet events The completion of the acquisition of Rostar, the Russian beverage can maker, for 149m was completed on 31 January 2008.
As at 20 February 2008 the process for finalising the completion accounts is ongoing and it is therefore impractical at this stage to set out the acquired assets and liabilities and their fair values.
