Report on Directors remuneration This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the audited information within the Directors remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
As a result, the report has been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
This report sets out the Companys policy on Directors remuneration for the forthcoming year, and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years, as well as information on remuneration paid to Directors in the financial year.
Unaudited information Membership and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee Membership and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are disclosed in the Corporate Governance report.
The Remuneration Committee continues to use New Bridge Street Consultants LLP whom the Committee originally appointed as remuneration advisers.
Apart from advice regarding the design, establishment and operation of remuneration arrangements, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP provides no other services to the Company.
Policy The objective of the Remuneration Committees remuneration policy is to reward the Companys executives competitively having regard to the comparative market place in order to ensure that they are properly motivated to perform in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The Committee also oversees any significant changes to pay and conditions elsewhere in easyJet and sets Directors remuneration in the context of these pay and conditions.
The Company aims to provide competitive total pay for on target performance, with superior awards for exceptional performance.
The remuneration packages of the Executive Directors comprise a combination of basic salary, annual bonus, participation in share-based long term incentive plans, and lean benefits provision.
easyJet has a no frills approach and does not include, for example, company cars or final salary pensions as part of the package.
Therefore, performance related elements form a significant proportion of the packages of the Executive Directors.

When determining the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors, account is taken of practice adopted in other similar organisations and the time commitment of each Non-Executive Director.
easyJet plc 48 Annual report and accounts 2007 Basic salary The basic salaries of Executive Directors are reviewed annually and are set taking account of a number of factors including i practice adopted in companies of a broadly similar size, ii a formal appraisal of their contribution to the business and iii the competitive environment, as senior easyJet executives are potential targets for other low cost start-ups and other companies in the airline sector.
During the year Andrew Harrisons salary remained at 540,000, in line with his hiring agreement.
Jeff Carrs salary increased from 250,000 to 300,000 reflecting a catch up against market salaries, following his first full year in position.
Pension contributions Pension contributions for Executive Directors are set at 7% of their basic salaries.
While this is a non contributory arrangement, easyJet operates a pension salary sacrifice arrangement where individuals can exchange their salary for company paid pension contributions.
Where individuals exchange salary this reduces easyJets National Insurance contributions.
easyJet credits half of this saving to the individuals pension currently 6.4% of the amount exchanged.
Annual bonus scheme All Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity of the Chief Executive during the year was 200% of salary, with a 100% of salary maximum for other senior executives.
This policy will remain unchanged for the forthcoming year.
Bonus targets are aligned to easyJets visions and values.
For the financial year ending 30 September 2008, 70% of Executive Directors bonus opportunity is subject to achieving demanding profit before tax targets related to the expected rate of return on equity.
The remaining 30% is subject to the achievement of demanding quantifiable business targets related to customers, people and operational excellence.
If the profit before tax measure is not achieved, payment on all other measures will be halved.

Jeff Carr will be paid a bonus of 276,900 92.3% of salary in the year ending 30 September 2008 to reflect performance in the year ended 30 September 2007.
These bonuses reflect the years financial performance and the Directors contribution to this.
This was calculated according to the bonus targets for the year ended 30 September 2007, the table below give details.
The financial targets are related to a targeted rate of return on equity.

The LTIP replaced the existing Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme the ESOS as the primary long term incentive arrangement for the Executive Directors and other senior employees although the ESOS was retained for flexibility, e. g. options were granted to the Chief Executive under the ESOS on his appointment in 2005.
However, there were no grants during the year and there is no current intention to make regular grants of options under the ESOS.
In summary, the LTIP is structured to tie in directly with the Companys current circumstances and strategy.
It provides for regular annual awards of i Performance Shares worth up to 100% of salary each year and ii Matching Shares linked to the investment of up to 50% of annual bonus in easyJet shares, which are then matched on a 1:1 gross basis.
Performance Shares and Matching Shares awards normally vest three years after grant, subject to continued employment.
It is currently intended that the vesting of all such regular annual LTIP awards will be subject to the satisfaction of return on equity ROE targets.
These are defined as post tax profit divided by average shareholders funds.
The ROE targets will be measured by reference to a three year performance period.
Awards granted in the forthcoming year will vest according to the achievement of the following ROE targets relating to the Groups ROE in the year ending 30 September 2010.
Threshold Target Maximum 25% vests 50% vests 100% vests Return on equity 12.5% 14.5% 16.5% ROE has been chosen as the performance measure for a number of reasons, such as: It is a fundamental measure of easyJets underlying performance and is directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders: and It is directly connected to the self-sustaining growth rate of the business and incentivises management to achieve the appropriate balance between growth and returns, to deliver the best shareholder value.
The Remuneration Committee will review the ROE targets prior to each grant date in order to ensure that they remain sufficiently challenging.
When determining the extent to which the ROE targets and indeed, the earnings per share EPS targets that apply to awards made under other long term incentive schemes operated by the Company are met the Committee will seek actual advice as and when it considers it necessary to do so.
In addition to the proposed regular annual LTIP grants, a one-off FTSE 100 award was granted shortly following the establishment of the LTIP to provide senior executives with a simple, transparent incentive to increase materially easyJets market capitalisation.
This FTSE 100 award was structured so that, if easyJet becomes a member of the FTSE 100 index for a period of at least six months before the end of the financial year ending 30 September 2008, participants will become entitled to receive an award over easyJet shares worth 100% of salary subject to the Remuneration Committee being satisfied that the Companys issued share capital has remained reasonably constant over the relevant period or any major acquisition has created shareholder value.
These shares will vest three and a half years after entry into the FTSE 100 index subject to continued employment.
Although these FTSE 100 awards that the Remuneration Committee views as a one-off grant form a smaller part of the overall incentive arrangements compared to the annual bonus opportunity and the regular annual LTIP awards, they are an important element of the incentive arrangements at easyJet for a number of reasons: They support the corporate goal of easyJet: They provide an important growth underpin to the ROE targets: and They are indicative of easyJets growth potential.
The Committee will regularly review the Companys long term incentive provision to ensure that it fully supports the corporate strategy and continues to take account of best practice.
easyJet plc 50 Annual report and accounts 2007 Andrew Harrison matching award To facilitate Andrew Harrisons recruitment as Chief Executive Officer and to ensure that his interests were directly and immediately aligned with those of easyJet shareholders, a matching award was introduced.
This was covered in detail in previous reports.
However in summary, Andrew acquired and will retain 1,000,000 worth of easyJet shares using his own funds.
In recognition of this, he was granted a further share-based incentive award.
The shares he acquires will be matched by the conditional award of an equal number of shares.
This matching share award will vest three years after grant subject to the satisfaction of challenging EPS and ROE performance conditions described more fully in the notes to Directors share options below.
Andrew also received the one-off FTSE 100 award, together with the grant of options under the ESOS described above, but he did not receive a normal LTIP award in the relevant year.
Shareholding guideline Linked to the establishment of the new LTIP, the Remuneration Committee has introduced a share ownership guideline which will apply to all members of the Executive Management Team being those senior executives who report to the Chief Executive Officer which requires them to retain all the shares they receive on the vesting of LTIP awards on an after-tax basis until they have built up a shareholding equal to 100% of salary with pre-existing shareholdings taken into account.
For senior executives who report to the Executive Management Team and receive LTIP awards, a 50% share ownership guideline will apply.
All employee share participation easyJet encourages share ownership throughout the Company by the use of a Share Incentive Plan and a Sharesave Plan.
There was a Sharesave scheme grant in June 2007.
In October 2006, the Company granted a free share award under its Share Incentive Plan to all employees.
