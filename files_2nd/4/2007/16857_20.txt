58 VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007 REMUNERATION REPORT For the year ended 31 March 2007 Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme Under the DABS, approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM, executive directors and other members of the Group Executive Committee are required to defer 40% of any bonus payment up to 75% of salary into VT Group shares for a period of three years.
Individual executive directors may also elect to defer a further 35% of bonus up to 75% of salary under the same arrangement.
At the end of the three year period, matching shares will be awarded dependent upon the extent to which Earnings per Share EPS targets have been achieved over the three year period.
In the current year, the remuneration committee reviewed the EPS targets applying to the DABS in line with the companys current strategy for growth over the next three years.
Accordingly, the range of EPS growth hurdles applying to the release of the matching shares to be awarded in 2007 linked to the out-turn of the 2006 7 annual bonus has been increased since last year.
The schedule for release of 2007 matching shares will be as follows: EPS growth over 3 years Number of matching shares awarded Less than RPI 5% p. a. previously 3% Nil RPI 5% p. a. previously 3% 1:1 RPI 7% p. a. previously 5% 2:1 RPI 12% p. a. previously 10% 3:1 Between the above points Straight line Given these more challenging EPS targets, the remuneration committee also determined that the requirement for the companys EPS growth in each of the three years of the performance period to be at least 3% higher than in the previous year should be removed for the awards to be made in 2007 and thereafter.
Other Long-Term Incentive Plans Until 2006 7, the companys policy was to make awards to executive directors under the Long-Term Incentive Plan and two share option plans approved and unapproved.
These plans are summarised in greater detail below.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, approved by shareholders in 2003, provides for annual conditional awards to be made over VT Group shares worth up to 50% of basic salary.
The shares are held in trust and are released after three years subject to the extent to which a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance target is met over the vesting period, with TSR chosen to encourage the delivery of above market returns to shareholders.
For awards made to date, the comparator group for measuring performance has been the FTSE 250 but excluding Investment Trusts.
If the company is ranked at the median at the end of the performance period, 50% of shares will be released, with full vesting for upper quartile performance or above.
No shares will vest if the company is ranked below the median.
Share Option Plans Until 2006 7, the company has operated two share option plans a UK Inland Revenue approved plan and an unapproved plan approved by shareholders in 1999 and 1996 respectively and under which directors and other executives are eligible to participate at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
Options are granted at market value determined immediately before the grant.
Annual awards do not normally exceed one times base salary.
Options under the companys schemes can normally be exercised only on the achievement of an EPS performance condition.
For the most recent awards, the performance condition applying is real growth in adjusted EPS of at least RPI plus 3% per annum over three consecutive years.
If this target is not met at the end of the three year period, the options lapse there is no re-testing facility.
In 2006, Mr P J Lester was granted an award of options worth 200% of salary.
Whilst this was higher than the usual maximum annual grant of 100% of salary, Mr Lester had not received any option awards since 2003, so on an annualised basis, this grant was below the normal 100% maximum.
In making this award, the remuneration committee was mindful of the need to ensure that Mr Lester continues to be strongly aligned with the business over the long term.
59 REMUNERATION REPORT For the year ended 31 March 2007 New VT Group 2007 Performance Share Plan Following a wholesale review of long-term incentive provision conducted by the remuneration committee, from 2007 onwards, it is proposed that these two plans are replaced by a single new plan, the VT Group 2007 Performance Share Plan PSP, for which shareholder approval will be sought at the forthcoming AGM.
The main features of this plan are set out in detail in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
In summary, it is intended that annual awards of conditional shares will be made to executive directors and other eligible executives worth up to a maximum of 100% of salary.
These awards will vest after three years subject to the satisfaction of performance targets based on EPS growth 50% of awards and relative TSR performance 50% of awards, thereby providing a balanced incentive to senior executives to deliver both outstanding returns to shareholders and strong earnings growth.
More precisely the vesting schedule that will apply to initial awards in 2007 is as follows: TSR Element EPS Element TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 excluding Number of PSP shares vesting investment trusts EPS growth over 3 years under each element Below median Less than RPI 5% p. a Nil Median RPI 5% p. a.
Between the above points Straight line Following the adoption of the PSP, it is intended that no further awards will be made under either the LTIP or the option schemes.
Assessing performance under Long Term Incentive Plans Performance under the TSR targets in the LTIP is independently calculated by NBSC on behalf of the remuneration committee and this will continue to be the case under the TSR element of the PSP.
Under the DABS and share option plans, the remuneration committee will obtain external guidance as regards the extent to which the EPS targets are satisfied.
Where outstanding awards straddle the transition from UK GAAP to International Accounting Standards, the committee will continue to ensure that EPS is calculated on a consistent basis.
Share ownership guidelines Executive directors are encouraged to build a shareholding in VT Group worth 100% of salary.
Directors service agreements All executive directors service contracts are of no fixed term and are subject to 12 months notice of termination from the company.
Non-executive directors are normally appointed for a three year term which is extendible at the boards discretion.
All appointees are subject to regular re-appointment by shareholders.
