Diageo Annual Report 2007 55 Directors remuneration report Dear shareholder I am pleased to present the remuneration report for the 2007 financial year.
Diageos solid performance over the past three years has been reflected in the returns to shareholders and rewards earned by our executives.
Such long term sustained performance is at the heart of Diageos corporate strategy and is evident from our consistent above median positioning in the total shareholder return plan TSR plan where performance is measured relative to a selected peer group.
For the plans that have vested in February of 2005, 2006 and 2007, a position of 5, 8 and 7 respectively was achieved against a peer group of 17 other companies over each three year performance cycle.
The TSR plan is a core component of our reward approach for senior executives and forms part of our long term incentive arrangements as set out in our remuneration policy.
The current policy was introduced in 2004 and continues to be based upon our wish to attract and retain the best global talent to deliver Diageos strategy within a framework of good corporate governance.
The key principles of the policy, which are interdependent, are: Our senior executive remuneration arrangements are intended to attract and retain the best global talent.
We believe that pay should vary significantly with performance over both the short and long term.
Our base salaries are generally set around the median of the relevant market for each role.
In exceptional circumstances, base salaries may be positioned above the median if justified by the requirement to recruit or retain key executives.
Such positioning of base salaries ensures market competitiveness.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash after the end of each financial year and are determined by performance in the year against pre-set stretching business targets.
Our long term incentives comprise a combination of share option grants and share awards in each year and vary with three year EPS and TSR performance respectively.
Our senior executives are required to hold shares in Diageo to participate fully in our share option and share award plans.
On an annual basis the committee reviews executive share incentive schemes to ensure that existing arrangements remain appropriate for both shareholders and the company.
During this years review, the effect of a movement in exchange rates on the EPS performance of the group and the subsequent impact on incentive plans was considered by the committee.
It was determined to exclude this effect from the comparison of the groups EPS performance against the RPI under the Senior Executive Share Option Plan SESOP for all current and future grants.
The committee recognised that performance measures should be clearly linked to the achievement of challenging and stretching financial performance and were mindful that foreign exchange could influence the outcome, both positively and negatively, for reasons beyond the control of management.
In order to ensure our incentive arrangements continue to have stretching performance targets that will drive the business and its leaders over the medium to long term, the committee intends to review the current remuneration arrangements during the next financial year.
In 2008 this will coincide with the renewal of the TSR plan.
As part of this process, the committee intends to engage with our major investors on any significant changes that may result from the review.

The fees of the chairman are normally reviewed every two years and any changes would normally take effect from 1 January.
Fees are reviewed in the light of market practice in large UK companies and anticipated workload, tasks and liabilities.
In accordance with the companys stated policy, a review of the chairmans fees was undertaken in the year.
In light of market practice, it was determined that the chairmans annual fee should be increased by 25,000 to 525,000.

Remuneration philosophy Diageos remuneration philosophy for senior executives is based on a belief in: performance-related compensation: it influences and supports performance and the creation of a high performing organisation: rewarding sustainable performance: it is at the heart of Diageos corporate strategy and is vital to meeting investors goals: measuring performance over three years: it aligns with the time cycle over which management decisions are reflected in the creation of value in this business: providing a balanced mix of remuneration: base salary, benefits, short term cash incentives, longer term equity incentives and pension: providing a competitive total remuneration opportunity: it helps Diageo compete for the best talent among companies with global operations and global consumers: and simplicity and transparency.
The board of directors continues to set stretching performance targets for the business and its leaders in the context of the prevailing economic climate.
To achieve these stretching targets requires exceptional business management and strategic execution to deliver performance.
This approach to target setting reflects the aspirational performance environment that Diageo wishes to create.
In Diageo, annual incentive plans aim to reward the delivery of short term performance goals with commensurate levels of remuneration.
Long term incentive plans aim to reward long term sustained performance.
Under both sets of plans, if the stretching targets are achieved, high levels of reward may be earned.
All incentives are capped to ensure that inappropriate business risk taking is neither encouraged nor rewarded.

The committee believe it is appropriate to position total remuneration between the median and upper quartile of this group, given the size and complexity of Diageos business globally.
Diageo Annual Report 2007 59 Anticipated mix between fixed and variable remuneration The balance between fixed and variable elements of remuneration changes with performance.
The anticipated normal mix between fixed and variable remuneration is that for 100 of remuneration earned, 33 will be fixed remuneration and 67 will be performance-related remuneration, excluding pensions and other benefits.
This mix is illustrated in the pie chart below.
In some years, the performance-related remuneration may be higher or lower depending on the performance of the business.
Executive directors remuneration mix 33% 33% 34% Fixed base salary Variable short term Variable long term Share ownership Senior executives are required to hold shares in Diageo to participate fully in the share option and share award plans.
This policy extends to the top 80 senior executives and reflects Diageos belief that its most senior leaders should also be shareholders.
Individuals have three years to build up their shareholding from their own resources.
On 1 January 2007 the executive directors met the requirement by each holding company shares equivalent to at least 225% of their base salary.
The senior executives are eligible to participate in the broad-based share and option plans Diageo operates for its employees.
These are the tax approved share incentive plan and savings-related share option scheme in the United Kingdom.

60 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Directors remuneration report continued Annual performance bonus The annual bonus plan is designed to incentivise year on year delivery of short term performance goals, these goals are determined by pre-set stretching targets and measures agreed by the remuneration committee with reference to the annual operating plan.
The committee determines the level of performance achieved based on Diageo's overall financial performance at the financial year end.
The business results for the year ended 30 June 2007 are described in the Business review.
The targets for the last financial year were a combination of measures including profit before exceptional items and tax, net sales and free cash flow.
For all measures, the level of performance achieved was above target resulting in an actual performance bonus paid equating to 146% of base salary.
The actual bonus payments received by the executive directors are shown in the table 'Directors' remuneration for the year ended 30 June 2007'.
Long term incentive plans payments and gains for the year ended 30 June 2007 In addition to the above emoluments, in the year the executive directors received payments and made gains under long term incentive plans as follows: 2007 2006 Executive 2004 share option TSR award exercises Total Total 000 000 000 000 Executive directors NC Rose 795 481 1,276 970 PS Walsh 1,389 2,304 3,693 1,751 Total 2,184 2,785 4,969 2,721 Long term incentive plans LTIPs Our long term incentives comprise a combination of share awards in the TSR plan and share options in the SESOP.
Awards under the LTIPs are made on an annual basis with the level of award considered each year in light of individual and business performance.
The performance criteria under both sets of plans remain unchanged as they continue to provide a challenging level of performance expectation in the current economic environment.
The regular review of the performance measures and the vesting schedule used in each plan ensures that the LTIPs continue to support the business objectives and are in line with current best practice.
Total shareholder return plan TSR plan Under this plan, at the discretion of the remuneration committee, participants are granted a conditional right to receive shares.
All conditional rights awarded vest after a three year period the performance cycle subject to achievement of two performance tests.
The primary performance test is a comparison of Diageos three year total shareholder return the percentage growth in Diageos share price assuming all dividends and capital distributions are reinvested with the TSR of a peer group of 17 other companies.
TSR calculations are converted to a common currency US dollars.
The second performance test requires that the remuneration committee does not recommend the release of awards unless it considers that there has been an underlying improvement in Diageos three year financial performance, typically measured by an adjusted earnings per share measure EPS.
For awards made before July 2005 the performance cycles began on 1 January each year.
For awards made after July 2005 the performance cycle begins on 1 July each year.
For the performance cycle 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2006, the peer group consisted of Altria, Anheuser-Busch, Campbell Soup, Carlsberg, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Heineken, Heinz, Inbev, Kelloggs, McDonalds, Nestl, PepsiCo, Pernod Ricard, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Yum!
There were no reserve companies remaining for the 2004 plan.
For performance cycles from 1 January 2005, the peer group consists of Anheuser-Busch, Brown Forman, Cadbury Schweppes, Carlsberg, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Groupe Danone, Heineken, Heinz, Inbev, Nestl, PepsiCo, Pernod Ricard, Procter & Gamble, SABMiller, Scottish & Newcastle and Unilever.
The reserve company is LOreal.
The peer group against which we measure TSR performance reflects the product and geographic mix of Diageos business.
The following table shows the percentage of the award that will normally be released at the end of the performance cycle: 2005 2007 and subsequent performance cycles Ranking in peer group 1-2 3456789 10-18 % of award released 150 142 114 94 83 72 61 35 nil For the January 2004 December 2006 performance cycle the level of vesting is 50% of the initial award.

Details of executive share options are shown separately below.
With the exception of the 2004 plan cycle, 35% of this number of shares would be released for achieving position nine in the peer group.
No shares would be released for achievement of position 10 or below.
b This number reflects that 150% of the number of shares initially awarded would be released for achieving position one or two in the peer group.
c The three year performance cycle for the 2004 TSR award ended on 31 December 2006.
The number of shares released was 72% of the initial award.
This was based on a relative TSR ranking of position seven in the peer group at the end of the performance cycle.
Kepler Associates independently verified the TSR increase and ranking.
The remuneration committee reviewed and confirmed Diageos EPS growth over the performance cycle exceeded the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index RPI over the same period and determined this represented an underlying improvement in financial performance that permitted the release of the awards.
d The price on 16 February 2007, the release date.
The market price was 728 pence when the award was made on 20 February 2004. e The directors interests at 13 August 2007 were the same as at 30 June 2007. f For the performance cycle ending on 31 December 2007 the remuneration committee will normally approve the release of awards in the February following the end of the performance cycle.
For all other awards, the remuneration committee will normally approve their release in the August following the end of the relevant performance cycle.
g The timing of awards under the TSR plan was aligned with the financial year in 2004.
To effect this transition, awards granted on 18 February 2005 were a one-off half size award with a performance cycle that began on 1 January 2005. h The market price on 19 September 2006, the award date, was 937 pence.
Position 62 Diageo Annual Report 2007 Directors remuneration report continued Senior executive share option plan SESOP Options granted under SESOP cannot normally be exercised unless a performance condition is satisfied.
The current performance condition is based on the increase in Diageos adjusted earnings per share EPS measure over a three year period.
If the increase in this EPS measure is at least 15 percentage points greater than the increase in the RPI over the same period, then all the options can be exercised.
If the increase in this EPS measure is at least 12 percentage points greater than that of the RPI but less than 15 percentage points, half of the options can be exercised.
For options granted prior to October 2004, if the options fail either initial performance condition, the three year assessment period will be rolled forward by a year and a re-test carried out at that time.
However, the performance condition can only be rolled forward a maximum of three times.
For options granted from October 2004, no re-testing is permitted.
The following table shows, for the directors who held office during the year, the number of options held under all executive share option schemes and savings-related schemes.
The mid-market price for ordinary shares at 30 June 2007 was 1037 pence 2006 917 pence: 13 August 2007 1025 pence.
The highest mid-market price during the year was 1094 pence and the lowest mid-market price was 895 pence.
Exercisable options are those that have vested and can be exercised in the option period:not exercisable are those options where the minimum holding period has not been completed or the performance conditions have not yet been met.
The option period starts from the earliest month in which the options may be exercised and ends with the month in which the options lapse.
The growth in Diageos adjusted EPS measure over the three years ended 30 June 2006 did not exceed the performance condition and therefore the options were not exercisable.
The grant was eligible for re-testing under the Rules of the Plan and was measured again after 30 June 2007.
Growth in Diageos adjusted EPS over the three years ended 30 June 2007 exceeded the performance condition RPI plus 15 percentage points and these options will become exercisable in full in October 2007.
The effect of movements in exchange rates is excluded from the comparison of the groups EPS performance against the RPI under the SESOP for all current and future grants.
b The performance condition in respect of this SESOP grant was measured after 30 June 2007.
The growth in Diageos adjusted EPS measure over the three years ended 30 June 2007 exceeded the performance condition RPI plus 15 percentage points and these options will become exercisable in full in October 2007. c Options granted under the UK savings-related share option scheme.
Long term incentive plans and change of control In the event of a change of control and at the remuneration committees discretion, outstanding TSR plan awards would be released and outstanding share options would become exercisable, based on the extent to which the relevant performance conditions had been met since the initial award or grant respectively, and time apportioned to reflect the shortened performance period that had elapsed.
Pension provision Scheme details NC Rose and PS Walsh are members of the Diageo Pension Scheme.
They currently accrue pension rights at the rate of one-thirtieth of base salary each year.
Bonus payments and other benefits are not included in pensionable pay.
The pension at normal retirement age NRA will not be less than two-thirds of base pay in the 12 months prior to retirement less any pension benefits accrued elsewhere.
Subject to the consent of the company, no actuarial reduction is currently applied upon early retirement on or after age 57.
Pensions in payment are increased each year in line with increases in the RPI subject to a maximum of 5% per year, and a minimum of 3% per year.
Diageo Annual Report 2007 63 On death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable salary would become payable, together with a spouses pension of two-thirds of the executive directors prospective pension.
Upon death after retirement, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the executive directors pension before commutation is payable.
Employee contributions equal to 2% of base pay were introduced on 1 April 2006, increasing at 2% a year up to 6% of base pay by 1 April 2008.
As a result of changes introduced by the Finance Act 2004 affecting the taxation of pensions from 6 April 2006, executive directors were offered the option of having benefits in excess of their personal lifetime allowance LTA provided by an unfunded non-registered arrangement.
Both directors have opted to have part of their benefits provided from this unfunded arrangement.
Total pension benefits remain subject to the Inland Revenue limits that were in force on 5 April 2006.
Executive directors pension benefits Details of the accrued pension to which each director is entitled had they left service on 30 June 2007 and the transfer value of those accrued pensions are shown in the following table.
The accrued pensions shown represent the annual pension to which each executive director would be entitled at NRA.
The transfer value is broadly the cost to Diageo if it had to provide the equivalent pension benefit.
The transfer values shown in the following table have been calculated in accordance with the Guidance Note published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries GN11.

The decrease in pension for PS Walsh was due to the implementation of a pension sharing order, which reduced his accrued pension as 30 June 2007 from 803,000 pa to 490,000 pa. b Part of the pension for both NC Rose and PS Walsh is provided from the unfunded non-registered arrangement.
As at 30 June 2007, the percentage of pension provided from this arrangement for NC Rose was 72% 2006 70% and for PS Walsh was 9% 2006 1%.
c The changes in the transfer values during the year attributable to an additional years service was an increase of 256,000 for NC Rose and 503,000 for PS Walsh and for salary increases received during the year, an increase of 197,000 for NC Rose and 649,000 for PS Walsh PS Walshs transfer value at 30 June 2007 was reduced from 11,314,000 to 6,901,000 due to the implementation of the pension sharing order referred to above.
The remainder of the change in the transfer values is mainly attributable to changes in market conditions, in particular, interest earned on the transfer value and changes in index-linked gilt markets over the year.
d From 1 April 2006 executive directors were required to pay pension contributions.
During the year, NC Rose made pension contributions of 14,950 2006 2,850 and PS Walsh made pension contributions of 25,950 2006 4,950.
Share and other interests The beneficial interests of the directors in office at 30 June 2007 in the ordinary shares of the company are shown in the table below.
NC Rose and PS Walsh are among the potential beneficiaries of these trusts and are deemed to have an interest in all these shares and shares subject to call options.

The FTSE 100 Index reflects the 100 largest UK quoted companies by market capitalisation and has been chosen because it is a widely recognised performance benchmark for large UK companies.
The graph shows that Diageo outperformed the FTSE 100 Index over this period using 12 month average share prices but underperformed on a spot price basis.
The former measure is comparable with that used in the TSR plan, which measures TSR against a defined peer group of 17 other companies, over a three year performance period.
