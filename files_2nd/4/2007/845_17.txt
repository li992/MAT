Remuneration policy The objective of the remuneration policy, in respect of the executive directors and other senior executives, is to offer remuneration packages that are competitive in the markets in which the executives are based and which: n allow AMEC to attract and retain senior executives of high calibre: and n incentivise senior executives to achieve superior short-term performance, increase the medium and long-term value of AMEC for its shareholders and encourage executives to build and retain a significant shareholding in AMEC.
More specifically the policy is to set: n base salaries which broadly equate to the mid-market salary practices of a relevant group of oil equipment and services and other engineering and business support services companies and other companies regarded as comparable by virtue of, amongst other factors, revenue, employee numbers, market capitalisation and or geographic coverage n annual bonuses which incentivise the achievement of stretching business and individual performance targets and offer the opportunity to achieve upper quartile annual cash earnings if these targets are achieved n longer term incentives which align the interests of shareholders and senior executives by offering the latter the opportunity to accumulate significant capital over a period but only if stretching financial and shareholder value targets are met n whilst accepting that within this policy there will be occasions when higher and or lower levels of remuneration will be appropriate in particular circumstances.
Relationship between remuneration practice and strategic objectives In applying the above policy, particularly in relation to setting targets under the annual and longer term incentive arrangements, the committee has regard to the need to ensure alignment with the companys strategic objectives.
In 2007, the key objectives which informed this were: n Delivering improved profitability from ongoing operations n Reducing the cost base through the STEP Change programme n Completion of the portfolio restructuring in particular the disposals of the Built Environment businesses 72 AMEC plc annual report 2007 AMEC plc annual report 2007 73 1013 AMEC back 07 CS2.

Executive directors are able to opt-out of further pension accrual, particularly if this would provide benefits in excess of the Life Time Allowance, in which case they will receive a non-bonusable salary supplement of 20 per cent of basic salary in lieu of further pension accrual.
This applied to Mr Early during the part of 2007 for which he was employed.
If individuals do accrue benefits in excess of the Life Time Allowance, the payment of the associated tax liability will be the responsibility of the individual and not AMEC.

This incentive, which requires shareholder years remuneration less tax as liquidated damages in full and final approval, would relate directly to the achievement by 2010 of even greater settlement.

The non-executive directors receive fees for their services and do not participate in any of the incentive or benefit schemes of the group.
Fees were reviewed with effect from 1 January 2008.
The current fee is 50,000 per annum plus a further 5,000 per annum in respect of chairing committees of the board other than the audit committee, where the additional fee is 12,500 per annum, and the remuneration committee, where the additional fee is 7,500 per annum.
There is an additional fee of 7,500 per annum paid to the senior independent director.
The policy with regard to fee structure is to reflect time commitment and responsibility of the various roles.
Non-executive directors may also be paid additional fees for other duties undertaken on behalf of the company.
The boards policy is that non-executive director appointments are normally for three consecutive three-year terms, subject to review after the end of each term.
The non-executive directors as at 31 December 2007 have fixed-term contracts which run until the dates set out below: Date of contract Service review date E P Airey 26 May 1999 13 May 2009 M O Hesse 1 June 2000 31 May 2009 P J Byrom 10 February 2005 9 February 2011 T W Faithfull 10 February 2005 9 February 2011 The contracts of non-executive directors may be terminated by the individual at any time and there are no specific provisions for compensation in the event of early termination by the company.
In accordance with the articles of association of AMEC, all directors are required to seek re-election by shareholders every three years.

Mr Early received a supplement of 20 per cent of total salary in lieu of further pension accrual.
ii The bonuses detailed above represented the following percentages of their base salaries for the year: Mr Brikho 125 per cent, and Mr Siddall 80 per cent.
The level of these awards at maximum reflects the outstanding business performance during the year where all targets on profit, cash and STEP Change implementation were exceeded.
Although not separately targeted for annual bonus purposes for these directors, good progress was also made in settling legacy issues.
The bonus figure for Mr Early relates to a special incentive geared to both the proceeds of the sale of the Built Environment businesses, which were at the upper end of the range of original expectations, and the maintaining of budgeted financial performance up to the point of sale.
This replaced his normal annual bonus for the year.
iii The value of benefits in kind received during the year relates principally to the provision of a company car or car allowance, travelling expenses and private medical expenses insurance.
iv Mr Early received a payment equal to base salary, pension supplement and car allowance for the remaining five months of 2007 following his retirement, in line with his contractual terms.
indd 76 2 4 08 11:09:54 Directors remuneration report continued Notes i For the performance share awards made in April 2004, AMEC failed to meet the minimum performance conditions and, therefore, the awards lapsed in April 2007. ii A proportion of Mr Earlys performance share awards lapsed on his retirement to take account of the unexpired portions of the relevant performance periods.
iii The awards made to Mr Brikho in October 2006 under the Recruitment Plan are not subject to performance conditions.
These replaced share awards in his former employer which were forfeit on joining AMEC.
iv The market price on 8 December 2007, the date of vesting of the second portion of Mr Brikhos award under the Recruitment Plan, was 753.00 pence.
v The terms and conditions of the Performance Share Plan 2002 have not been varied during the year.
vi The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2007 was 838.50 pence 2006: 421.50 pence.
vii The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 419.50 pence to 840.50 pence.
viii The register of directors interests, which is open to inspection at the companys registered office, contains full details of directors shareholdings, share options and awards under the performance share plans.
ix Had the restricted shares as at 31 December 2007 detailed above vested in full on that date the approximate latent value before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Mr Brikho, 7,167,000: and Mr Siddall, 4,549,000.
These hypothetical figures assume that all relevant performance conditions would have been fully met, which in practice may not transpire.

ii All awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 are subject to performance conditions which require a minimum level of earnings per share growth for any vesting and a higher level of growth for full vesting.
The minimum performance conditions which applied to the awards made in 2002 and 2004 were not met and these awards therefore lapsed on their respective fifth and third anniversaries from grant.
The minimum performance condition in relation to the awards made in 2003 has also not been met and these awards will lapse on 4 September 2008. iii The terms and conditions of the Option Schemes have not been varied during the year and all subsisting awards were made at nil cost.

iii The value of net increase represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption service terminated at the year-end.
It is based on the accrued pension increase after deducting the directors contribution.
iv The change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company and directors, such as stock market movements.
It is calculated after deducting the directors contribution.
