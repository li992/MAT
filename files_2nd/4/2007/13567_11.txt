7 Sir John Rose started to receive his pension from February 1, 2008.
John Cheffins received a cash allowance in lieu of pension accrual until he started to receive his pension on October 1, 2007.
Sir John Rose and John Cheffins are not accruing any further benefit or allowance in lieu of pension benefit from their ongoing employment with the Group.
Colin Smith and Mike Terrett receive a cash allowance in lieu of future pension accrual.
Had they elected to continue to accrue pension the estimated cost of that accrual would be higher than the cash allowance to be paid in lieu.
8 The Group operates the Rolls-Royce Supplementary Retirement Scheme.
The purpose of the Scheme is to fund pension provision above the pensionable earnings cap which was imposed on approved pension schemes under the 1989 Finance Act.
Membership of the Scheme is restricted to executive directors and to a limited number of senior executives.
Andrew Shilston is a member of this Scheme.
He joined the Group after the introduction of the earnings cap and his terms and conditions on joining the Group included a commitment to provide pension and life cover based on total salary, in line with other directors and senior executives.
Employer contributions to the Scheme during 2007 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2007 for the registered defined benefit plans, and are therefore included in the figures shown in the right hand column of the first table.

He accrues a retirement lump sum benefit in both of these plans.
The aggregate value of the retirement lump sums accrued in these two plans, and the transfer values of these benefits, are shown in the second table.
In addition, James Guyette is a member of two 401 K Savings Plans in the US, one qualified and one non-qualified, to which both he and his employer, Rolls-Royce North America Inc. contribute.
James Guyette is also a member of an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan in the US, to which his employer makes notional contributions.
Employer contributions to these three plans during 2007 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2007 for the defined benefit plans, and are therefore included in the figures shown in the right hand column of the second table.
