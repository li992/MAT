Remuneration report The Board presents the Remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The aim of the remuneration policy is to provide a competitive remuneration package, having regard to comparable companies in the financial sector, which is sufficient to attract and retain the quality of director needed to manage and develop the Company successfully.
The stated policy shall apply in 2008 and, subject to review, in subsequent financial years.
Remuneration packages Remuneration packages are designed to include xed and variable elements, and to provide rewards for both the long and short term as follows: Short term Long term Fixed Basic salary and benets Pension Variable profit share Long Term Incentive Plan The Remuneration Committee the Committee considers that the key objectives of a remuneration package are to motivate directors to generate long-term shareholder value and to increase short-term profitability.
The first objective is met by long-term incentive plan LTIP awards providing directors with the opportunity to build a meaningful shareholding in the Company, performance permitting.
Executive directors are actively encouraged to build up and maintain a shareholding to the equivalent value of at least one years salary within five years of their appointment to the Board.
The second objective is met by profit share payments.
Basic salary and benets An executive directors basic salary is determined by the Committee and any change implemented on 1 January of each year or when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers salaries throughout the Group as a whole and the information obtained on comparable companies in the financial sector.
Board salary and fee costs were 2.07 million in 2007 compared with 1.93 million in 2006 adjusted to reect the retirement of James Lifford on 31 December 2006, an overall increase of 7.3%.
When setting salary levels, use is made of survey data and information provided by the advisers to the Committee.
The views of the chairman and chief executive are also taken into consideration.
All directors are entitled to take part in the Share Incentive Plan SIP on the same terms as all other employees.
This allows all employees to purchase shares in the Company and currently these are matched on a one-for-one basis by the Company.
Performance shares are also offered to employees based on earnings per share growth.
In addition Rathbones provides a range of benets, the most significant of which is a company car or cash alternative.
With effect from 1 January 2008, the provision of cars will be phased out as lease arrangements end.
profit share Certain executive directors on the Executive Committee are eligible for a discretionary profit share payment from a pool based on approximately 1% of Group pre-tax profits.
Directors with direct responsibility for investment management, unit trust or trust and tax departments receive a profit share payment based on the profits of the department concerned.
This may be supplemented by a payment from the pool.
profit share payments are not capped and are not pensionable.
Details of payments for 2007 are shown in Table 1.

3 Benets include the provision of a company car and medical insurance.
4 During the year, retirement benets accrued under money purchase schemes in relation to two directors 2006: four.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP At an Extraordinary General Meeting in November 2000, a long-term incentive plan LTIP was approved by shareholders to start in 2001.
No awards from the current plan will be made after November 2010.
Executive directors are provisionally awarded rights to acquire ordinary shares at the start of a three-year plan cycle the provisional award.
The maximum value of a provisional award is 75% of a participants basic salary.
At the end of each plan cycle, the Companys performance is assessed against the performance targets for that cycle.
The extent to which the targets have been achieved determines the actual number of shares if any attributable to each participant the actual award.
The performance targets used to date have been a mixture of growth in earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR.
TSR is a measure of the overall return to shareholders.
It reects both the change in the share price and dividends, and any other cash payments made, assuming that they are reinvested.
If a participant ceases to be employed as an executive director by reason of retirement at normal retirement age or earlier with the Companys consent, ill-health, redundancy or death, or any other circumstances which the Committee deems to be appropriate, the Committee may, at its discretion, recommend to the trustee that any distribution be based on the performance during the plan cycle as a whole but that the actual award be reduced pro rata to reect the fact that the participant was not an executive director for the whole plan cycle.
45 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2007 Remuneration report continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP continued 2001 03 and 2002 04 plan cycles The performance target for the 2001 03 and 2002 04 plan cycles was average annual compound EPS growth over the plan cycle.
No actual awards were made from these plans.
2003 05 plan cycle The performance targets for the 2003 05 plan cycle are set out in Table 3.
Actual awards of 100% of the provisional award before any pro rata service related adjustment totalling 136,991 ordinary shares were made in March 2006 as both EPS and TSR performance conditions were fully satisfied.
Awards were made in the form of 65,312 ordinary shares and the cash equivalent value of 71,679 shares at 11.45 the closing mid-market value on 8 March 2006.
2004 06 plan cycle The performance targets for the 2004 06 plan cycle were unchanged and are set out in Table 3.
Actual awards of 100% of the provisional award before any pro rata service related adjustment totalling 150,752 ordinary shares were made in March 2007 as both EPS and TSR performance conditions were fully satisfied.
Awards were made in the form of 75,206 ordinary shares and the cash equivalent value of 75,546 shares at 11.75 the closing mid-market value on 6 March 2007.
EPS increased from 38.11p in 2003 to 76.62p in 2006, an increase of 101% whilst the TSR for the three year period was 79%.
A 100% award is made for each element of the Plan if the relevant percentage exceeds 37.5%.
2005 07 plan cycle The performance targets for 2005 07 onwards were changed taking into consideration feedback from shareholders and changes to expectations of best market practice.
The Committee particularly took note of the preference for the use of a relative rather than an absolute TSR measure and considered that the revised targets are as demanding then as those put in place for earlier cycles were considered to be at the time.
With effect from 2005 07, TSR performance relative to the FTSE All Share Index rather than absolute TSR has been used as set out in Table 4.
The use of a peer group rather than a broad index was ruled out due to the small number of similar businesses in the speciality and other finance sector, and the risk that numbers would fall still further due to consolidation.
EPS increased from 48.99p in 2004 to 87.88p in 2007, an increase of 79% which triggered a 100% award for this element of the Plan.
A 100% award is made for this element of the Plan if the relevant percentage exceeds 37.5%.
The TSR for the three-year period was 34.9% which ranked the Company at the 59th percentile relative to the constituents of the FTSE All Share Index.
As this was below median, no award from this element of the Plan was triggered.
2006 08, 2007 09 and 2008 10 plan cycles Details of the provisional awards for the 2006 08, 2007 09 and 2008 10 plan cycles are set out in Table 5.
On 31 December 2006, the trustee held 100,000 Rathbone Brothers Plc ordinary shares.
On 7 March 2007, 75,206 were awarded to 2004 06 Plan participants.
On 20 March 2007, the trustee acquired a further 50,000 ordinary shares at 12.44 to be held for future actual awards.
74,794 shares were held as at 31 December 2007. Dividend entitlements in respect of this holding have been waived and voting rights will not be exercised.
Were the maximum possible provisional awards to be made to current and former directors, 331,245 ordinary shares 2006: 400,727 would be awarded, representing 0.8% 2006: 0.9% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2007.

The FTSE All Share Index has been selected as a comparator as it is a suitably broad market index and has been used as a performance comparator for LTIP plan cycles since 2005 07.
Long-term incentive arrangements for Peter Pearson Lund Following his appointment to the Board, Peter Pearson Lund has continued to participate in the Rathbone Unit Trust Management Limited RUTM deferred profit sharing plan rather than the LTIP.
A deferred profit sharing pool, which in a normal year equates to 20% of RUTMs pre-tax profits, is allocated to participants on the recommendation of a RUTM Plan Committee.
Allocations are held in trust and invested on behalf of participants.
The release of an award is conditional on continued employment unless the participant is a good leaver.
Funds are released in two equal tranches two and three years after the period end.

The value of these awards when made was 75% of a participants basic salary.
The market value of shares at the date of the provisional award is the average mid-market price over the 20 dealing days prior to the start of the plan.
Share options Historically, share options were granted to senior employees who it was considered would have a significant impact on the earnings and profitability of the Group during the following five years.
The Board is of the view that, following the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards, share options are increasingly expensive to administer and that there is a mis-match between their cost to the business and their perceived value to employees.
In future, option grants will only be made in exceptional circumstances.
Options are no longer granted to directors after their appointment to the Board.
Options granted prior to 21 June 2004 can be exercised if the earnings per share of the Group during the period from grant to the date of notication of exercise has increased in percentage terms by more than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 2% per annum or pro rata for any part thereof.
Options granted after 21 June 2004 can be exercised if the earnings per share of the Group between the accounting period immediately prior to the option grant and the accounting period immediately prior to the third anniversary of grant has increased in percentage terms by more than the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum or pro rata for any part thereof.
Option grants to a participant in a ten year rolling period are capped at four times remuneration.
There is no automatic waiving of performance conditions in the event of a change of control or the early termination of a participants employment.
Options may not normally be exercised before the third anniversary of the date of grant and expire on the tenth anniversary of grant.
Details of outstanding options at the start and end of the year together with details of options exercised during the year are set out in Table 6.
The terms and conditions of all options have remained unchanged during the year.
49 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2007 Remuneration report continued Share options continued Table 6.
Dilution Not more than 15% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company adjusted for bonus and rights issues should be issued for all share incentive schemes operated by the Company in any ten-year period.
Of that 15%, not more than 10% applies to shares allotted under share option schemes and not more than 5% to shares allotted under both the LTIP and SIP.
In the ten years to 31 December 2007, options over 2,775,787 ordinary shares 2006: 3,126,037 have been granted which represents 6.5% of the issued share capital at that date 2006: 7.4%.
905,367 ordinary shares 2006: 849,674 have been allotted in respect of the SIP, representing 2.1% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2007 2006: 2.0%.
No shares have been allotted for the LTIP to date.
Pension arrangements UK employees who joined Rathbones prior to 1 April 2002 were offered membership of the Rathbone 1987 Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme provides for members to retire at the age of 60 with a pension based on final pensionable salary.
Prior to 1 April 2006, the accrual rate was 1 60th for each year of membership.
With effect from 1 April 2006, employees were given the choice of either remaining on a 1 60th accrual rate but increasing their contribution rate from 5% to 6.5% at 1 April 2006 and to 8% from 1 January 2008 or switching to a 1 70th accrual rate for future pensionable service but continuing to contribute at 5%.
Details of the Companys contributions are set out in note 27 to the accounts.
Since1 April 2002, new employees have been offered membership of a Group dened contribution plan, established with Scottish Widows.
In the case of certain directors and senior staff, the Group contributes to their personal pension arrangements.
Paul Chavasse, Richard Lanyon, Andrew Morris, Peter Pearson Lund and Richard Smeeton are members of the Scheme.
Ian Buckley and Andy Pomfret participate in the Scheme for death in service benets only.
Ian Buckley, and Andy Pomfret have arrangements under self-invested personal pension schemes.
Rathbones pays annual contributions of 11.5% of salary to those schemes, subject to HM Revenue and Customs maximum limits, where applicable.
In the case of Mark Powell and Peter Pearson Lund, employer pension contributions and death in service benets ceased on 31 March 2006 and 31 October 2007 respectively.
Additional payments are now made in lieu with no overall increase in cost to the Company.
50 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2007 The changes in pension entitlements arising in the financial year, required to be disclosed by the UK Listing Authority, are shown in Table 7.
There have been no changes in the terms of directors pension entitlements during the year.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for directors.
Following the introduction of the Governments simplication of the pension taxation regime on 6 April 2006 the Company has taken action, where required, to ensure that the pension arrangements for staff conform to the new regime.
Where possible, for all UK employees, death in service cover has been extended to age 65 for those that stay in service beyond age 60.
