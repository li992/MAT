A proportion of this fee is applied to the purchase of Reckitt Benckiser plc ordinary shares.
The items included within benefits are given on page 52.
Share incentive plans The interests of the executive directors in shares of the company provided in the form of options and awards since listing on 8 March 1999 are shown in the tables below, which have been audited.
During the year to 31 March 2007 the highest and lowest market prices for the companys shares were 12.26 and 9.21 respectively and the market price on 31 March 2007 was 11.15.
The tables below contain the aggregate expected values of each option grant or performance share award.
The expected values of grants and awards made prior to November 2002 are the values previously disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Reports up to 2003 and were calculated by Mercer.
The expected values for the grants and awards made in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been calculated by Mercer using: A binomial valuation model for the options that uses daily share price data and takes account of the option grant date, exercise price and risk-free rate of return, with assumptions as to dividend yield, future volatility and forfeiture: and A Monte Carlo simulation model for the performance share awards using the same inputs and assumptions as for the binomial model, but which projects, many thousands of times, the share price of the company along with the share prices of the comparator group stocks to determine correlations between the companies.
This produces a distribution of share prices and TSR rankings thus allowing complex market-based hurdles to be modelled.
The methods of calculation of expected values have not been audited by  LLP.

50,000 shares were registered in the name of Mr Mackay and the balance of 100,000 shares remain in his family trust.
The executive directors are not eligible to receive further awards under this scheme.
The characteristics for this scheme are such that gains on exercise of options were recognised in prior years in respect of all the share rights reflected in the table.
From 3 June 2000, the SAB Executive Share Purchase Scheme was closed for purposes of new awards, and replaced by the Mirror Scheme for the purposes of new awards to employees of South African employers in the group and certain categories of other employees of South African origin elsewhere in the group other than SABMiller plc directors, principally in Africa.
These are issued annually to employees on the basis of assessment of performance and potential.
The unconditional vesting period has been reduced from a five-year period to a three-year period for the May 2006 and future grants, in line with local market practice.
Approval This report was approved by the board on 16 May 2007 as recommended by the remuneration committee on 15 May 2007.
