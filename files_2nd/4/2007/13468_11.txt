Termination by company general Rio Tinto has retained the right to pay executives in lieu of notice.
Given the wide variety of circumstances leading to early including redundancy termination, the executives service contracts do not provide explicitly for compensation but, in the event of early termination, including redundancy, it is the Groups policy to act fairly in all circumstances.
Pre-existing entitlements may apply under redundancy policies generally applicable to employees in particular regions.

Shareholding policy In 2002, the committee decided that it would be appropriate to encourage executives to build up a shareholding, aiming to reach a holding equal in value to two times base salary over five years.
Details of executives share interests in the Group are set out in Table 3 on page 115.
Share dealing policy Executives participate in long term incentive plans which involve the awarding of Rio Tinto securities at a future date.
The board has a policy prohibiting an executive from limiting his or her exposure to risk in relation to the securities.
This is contained in the Rules for dealing in Rio Tinto securities which is available on the companies website.
All employees subject to the Rules receive regular training and information about this prohibition.
The grants of shares and options under the plans are conditional upon compliance with the Rules.
