Remuneration Report This report contains the information required by the Companies Act 1985 and the relevant parts of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board of Directors report that the Company has complied with these regulations throughout the year under review.
IIn nf fo or rm ma at tiio on n n no ot t s su ub bjje ec ct t t to o a au ud diit t T Th he e R Re em mu un ne er ra at tiio on n C Co om mm miit tt te ee e The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration of the Groups Chairman and executive directors, and reviews that of senior executives.
The members of the Committee who served during the year are listed in this Annual Report, and from June 2006 include the Chairman as permitted by the revised Combined Code.
The Committee members have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, and no director is permitted to be involved in any decisions as to his or her own remuneration.
R Re em mu un ne er ra at tiio on n p po olliic cy y The remuneration packages of directors are reviewed by the Committee at least annually on the same basis as any other employee of the Group.
The review takes into account market practice and performance of the individual and of the business.
Other factors taken into account include the experience and responsibility of the individuals concerned.
The Committee receives information from various independent sources on directors remuneration.
The components of the Groups remuneration packages are detailed below.
Policy is structured to provide a mix of remuneration to ensure that no one component or measure dominates and that interests are aligned over different time periods with other employees and shareholders.
Packages include basic salary, annual bonus based on earnings per share and a long term incentive plan based on total shareholder return.
It may also include optional participation in a risk reward investment plan.
S Sa alla ar ry y Directors salaries are set by reference to those prevailing in the market, particularly within other major retail companies, and according to individual performance, experience and responsibility.
A An nn nu ua all p pe er rf fo or rm ma an nc ce e r re ella at te ed d b bo on nu us s The executive directors participate in an annual performance related bonus scheme which is based on a formula determined by the Committee measuring the performance of the business.
The performance measure is earnings per share before tax, which must increase by 5% prior to any bonus becoming payable.
The formula includes an upper limit of 100% of salary and earnings per share growth must reach a demanding level of at least 20% for the maximum bonus to be earned.
L Lo on ng g t te er rm m iin nc ce en nt tiiv five e p plla an n A new ten year plan was approved by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually to executive directors and senior executives.
Under the plan, performance is measured over periods of three years, which commence annually, by comparing total shareholder return against approximately 20 other UK listed retail companies.
The comparator group of companies for the three year performance period to January 2007 was as follows: Body Shop G. U. S. Marks & Spencer New Look Boots JJB Sports Matalan Signet Burberry J Sainsbury MFI Furniture Tesco DFS Furniture Kingfisher Mothercare W H Smith Dixons Laura Ashley N Brown Woolworths Findel The Committee determines which companies are to be added to or removed from the comparator group.
Laura Ashley, DFS Furniture and New Look have been removed for periods ending January 2008 onwards and have been replaced with Carpetright, Kesa and Wm Morrison Supermarkets.
For periods ending January 2010 onwards Body Shop, MFI Furniture and Matalan have been removed from the comparator group and replaced by Debenhams, Carphone Warehouse and French Connection.
2 24 4 Remuneration Report Following the merger of Boots Group with Alliance Unichem on 31 July 2006, data for Boots Group is used prior to the merger date and data for the merged entity thereafter.
Similarly, following the demergers in the year of G. U. S. and W H Smith data for the appropriate demerged entity Home Retail Group and W H Smith is used after the date of the demerger.
The Committee considers that the comparator group consists of companies which are most comparable to NEXT in size or nature of their business.
The Committee believes that comparison against a group of retail companies is more likely to reflect the Companys relative performance against its peers, thereby resulting in appropriate awards being made.
The graph below shows relative total shareholder return of the Company over five years when compared with the FTSE All Share index and FTSE General Retailers index.
This illustrates the Companys performance against a wide all-share UK index and against other companies in the same sector.
NEXT plc Performance Chart 2002-2007 Total Shareholder Return 250 200 150 100 50 Re-based to 31 January 2002 100 NEXT plc FTSE General Retailers FTSE All Share For performance periods commencing before January 2006 the maximum share award possible under the rules of the plan for each performance period is the equivalent of 100% of basic salary at the start of the performance period.
However, the Committee has generally restricted the maximum share award possible to the equivalent of 70% of basic salary.
For performance periods commencing January 2006 onwards the rules permit a maximum of 200% of basic salary or 300% in exceptional circumstances, but it is proposed that awards will be restricted to a maximum of 100% of basic salary for directors and 80% for other eligible employees.
Incremental awards have been made to Mr Angelides, bringing his maximum share award to an equivalent of 100% of salary for the performance periods commencing January 2004 and 2005 and 130% of salary for the performance period commencing January 2006.
The additional 30% awards are contingent on his remaining with the Group for a five year period to January 2009.
If total shareholder return is below the median ranking company there will be no entitlement to any of the award.
For median performance the entitlement will be 30% of the maximum award.
For performance above the median the entitlement will rise, with the maximum award being earned for performance which places the Company in the upper quartile of the comparator group.
Irrespective of where Company performance ranks, no award will be made unless the earnings per share of the Company has increased by at least the increase in the Retail Price Index over the period.
Awards are granted provisionally at the start of a performance period and remain subject to performance conditions over the life of the plan before any entitlement is earned.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of a three year performance period then the award for that period will lapse and there is no retesting.
2 25 5 Remuneration Report The Company has discretion as to whether entitlements earned are payable in NEXT shares or cash and to date it has allowed participants the choice.
Entitlements earned are not pensionable and are based on salary and share price at the start of the performance period.
Individuals included in the plan have not received grants under the management share option scheme in the same year.
R Riis sk k R Re ew wa ar rd d iin nv five es st tm me en nt t p plla an n In May 2006 shareholders approved a risk reward investment plan similar to the plans implemented in 2004 and 2005.
However, the Remuneration Committee did not consider it appropriate to introduce a new plan during the last year and is unlikely to do so every year.
Full details of the 2005 Plan were included in the 2006 Remuneration Report, the main elements of which are repeated below.
In July 2005, a risk reward investment plan was approved by shareholders.
Following approval by the Remuneration Committee, the Group made a special contribution to the NEXT 2003 Employee Share Ownership Trust the ESOT to acquire listed warrants issued by Goldman Sachs Jersey Limited.
These warrants are held on revocable trusts for those executives who made a personal investment from their own resources in a financial contract, the success of which is based on the market price of NEXT shares in July 2009.
The returns on the warrants and the financial contracts are materially the same and will vary between a minimum of zero if the final share price is then 20.50 or less and a maximum of approximately five times the initial investment.
The maximum value will only be achieved if the final share price is at or above 25.00.
On maturity of the warrants, any returns accruing to the trust will only be distributed either in NEXT shares and or cash to those participants who have remained with NEXT.
The Companys share price must increase at the equivalent of an annual compound growth rate of 8.3% adjusted for the difference between assumed dividends payable and actual dividends paid in order for there to be any return on the initial investment.
In order to achieve maximum value the annual compound growth rate would be 13.8%.
In addition, the Group also acquired 172,368 warrants direct from Goldman Sachs Jersey Limited in order to hedge its potential employers national insurance contributions liability in respect of the plan.
Details of the amounts invested in the financial contracts by the executive directors and of the Groups related special contributions to the ESOT are given below.

The plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees excluding main board directors and senior executives who participate in the long term incentive plan at the discretion of the Board.
Options can either be approved where the beneficiary may qualify for tax relief or unapproved.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to shareholder approved limits and there are no cash settlement alternatives.
2 26 6 Remuneration Report Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.
The maximum total market value of shares i. e. the acquisition price of shares over which options may be granted to any person during any financial year of the Company is three times salary, excluding bonuses and benefits in kind.
This limit may be increased to five times salary in circumstances considered by the Remuneration Committee to be exceptional, for example on the grant of options following recruitment.
Grants are generally made annually.
The exercise of options is subject to a performance condition where the percentage growth in earnings per share of the Group over a three year period must exceed RPI and a further 3% per annum.
If this performance condition is not met within three years from the date of grant, the options lapse.
No options were granted to directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.
No employee has received option grants under the scheme and been included in the long term incentive plan in the same year.
S Sh ha ar re es sa av five e o op pt tiio on ns s The sharesave option scheme was approved by shareholders in 2000 and will be due for renewal in 2010.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually to all employees.
The scheme operates on a save-as-you-earn principle and is subject to a maximum contribution limit of 250 per month per employee.
Options are exercisable three, five or seven years from the date of grant.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20%.
A similar scheme is operated by the Company for Group employees in the Republic of Ireland.
Sharesave options granted to directors in the year under review are detailed on page 31.
G Gr ro ou up p p pe en ns siio on n p plla an n Executive directors are eligible for membership of the NEXT Group Pension Plan the Plan which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs and consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The trustee of the Plan is a limited company, NEXT Pension Trustees Limited the Trustee.
All the directors of the Trustee are appointed and can be removed by NEXT.
The Board of the Trustee includes members of the Plan, a pensioner member and an independent director who is also the Chairman of the Trustee.
All directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of NEXT.
Following recent changes in pension legislation, a process will take place during 2007 to elect pensioner and member representatives as member nominated directors.
The Plans investments are kept entirely separate from the business affairs of the NEXT Group and the Trustee holds them in trust.
Responsibility for investment of the Plans funds has been delegated by the Trustee to professional investment managers.
D fide ef fiin ne ed d c co on nt tr riib bu ut tiio on n s se ec ct tiio on n Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the Plan.
Members elect to pay either 3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.
For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of three times the members basic salary at the previous April is payable along with the current value of the members fund.
D fide ef fiin ne ed d b be en ne ef fiit t s se ec ct tiio on n The defined benefit section of the Plan was closed to new members in 2000 but is being continued for the benefit of existing members.
This section provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth depending on chosen member contribution rate of final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service.
This section also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependants pensions on death in service or following retirement.
For death prior to retirement a spouses pension of 60% of the members prospective pension is payable.
A lump sum of up to three times the members final pensionable earnings plus a return of the members contributions with interest is also payable.
For death after retirement a spouses pension of 60% of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
A lump sum equivalent to the balance of five years pension is payable if death occurs within five years of retirement.
If death occurs after leaving service but before the pension becomes payable i. e. as a deferred pensioner, a spouses pension of 60% of the accrued deferred pension is payable along with a lump sum equal to the members own contributions with interest.
Childrens pensions are only payable on death in service.
In the case of ill-health retirement only the accrued pension is payable.
All benefits are subject to Plan limits.
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post-1997 is subject to limited price indexation.
2 27 7 Remuneration Report For all current Plan members, pensionable earnings are comprised of basic pay, overtime and, prior to 1 October 2006, annual performance bonuses.
No other items of remuneration are taken into account.
From 1 October 2006, sales and profit related bonuses are no longer taken into account.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company made contributions at the rate of 15.5% up to August 2005 and 17.5% thereafter.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit sections financial position was undertaken as at 30 September 2005 and concluded that the Plan had a 19% deficit of assets compared with actuarial liabilities.
Members who joined the Plan after May 1989 and before October 2000 were, prior to 6 April 2006, subject to a statutory salary cap for approved pension schemes.
From 6 April 2006, the statutory salary cap was removed and replaced with a lifetime allowance, subject to transitional rules.
Certain members subject to the salary cap were provided with appropriate benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement in relation to that part of their earnings which exceeded the cap, where they so elected.
The unapproved arrangement continues to be provided in respect of certain members whose accrued or projected pension fund value exceeds their personal lifetime allowance.
The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by paying 5% of pensionable earnings into the Plan.
From 1 October 2006, the normal retirement age under the Plan was increased from 60 to 65.
Specific information in respect of executive directors pension entitlements is detailed below.
N No ot tiic ce e p pe er riio od ds s Each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract which is terminable by the Company on giving one years notice.
The Committee will ensure that in the event of any termination payment being made to a director full account will be taken of that directors duty to mitigate any loss and where appropriate the Committee may seek independent professional advice prior to authorising such payment.
Apart from service contracts no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries.
O Ot th he er r b be en ne ef fiit ts s Executive directors receive benefits which may include the provision of a fully expensed company car or cash alternative, private medical insurance, annual subscriptions to appropriate professional bodies and staff discount when purchasing the Groups merchandise.
Other employees are also eligible for certain of these benefits.
N No on n- -e ex xe ec cu ut tiiv five e d diir re ec ct to or rs s Remuneration of the non-executive directors of the Company is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.
Remuneration consists of a basic fee for services in connection with Board and Board Committee meetings.
Additional fees are paid for the roles of Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, Chairman of the Audit Committee and Senior Independent Non-executive Director.
Letters of appointment do not contain notice periods, however non-executive directors are appointed in the expectation that they will serve for a minimum of six years, subject to satisfactory performance and successful re-election at Annual General Meeting.
Non-executive directors receive a discount when purchasing the Groups merchandise but do not participate in any of the Groups bonus, pension, share option or other incentive schemes.

Mr Wolfson was the highest paid director in the current and previous year.
The Company also paid a pension under the unfunded, unapproved arrangement to a former director of the Company of 32,771 2006: 31,495.
2 29 9 Remuneration Report L Lo on ng g t te er rm m iin nc ce en nt tiiv five e p plla an n Estimated monetary values were included in the January 2006 Remuneration Report for the three year performance plan which matured at that date based on a share price of 1743p on 21 March 2006.
Performance conditions of the plan are detailed above.
Awards were made subsequent to the Report on 29 March 2006 when the share price was 1660p.
Adjustments to the estimated monetary value together with the final award have therefore been included in the table below.
A further three year performance period of the plan matured in January 2007.
The total shareholder return of the Company over this period ranked eighth in the group of 21 other listed retail companies.
Accordingly an award of 57% of the maximum equivalent to 40% of basic salary is expected to be made to the participants in the plan, which is payable in NEXT shares or cash at the Companys discretion.
The awards will be made during 2007 and, based on the share price of 2092p on 20 March 2007, awards to directors would be as follows: J Ja an nu ua ar ry y 2 20 00 07 7 January 2006 A Ac ct tu ua all n no o..

D Diir re ec ct to or rs s p pe en ns siio on n e en nt tiit tlle em me en nt ts s All executive directors are members of the defined benefit section of the NEXT Group Pension Plan.
Directors and some senior managers receive an enhancement from the Plan, increasing the accrual of their retirement benefit up to two thirds of their final pensionable earnings on completion of 20 years pensionable service at age 65 for members who joined before October 2000.
The lump sum payable on death in service for directors and some senior managers is enhanced to four times pensionable salary.
In the case of earnings over 100,000 per annum, final pensionable earnings are based on an average of the best consecutive 36 or more months earnings in the ten years prior to retirement.

Due to movements in bond yields, which underlie the basis of calculation of transfer values, the increase in transfer values over the year can be significantly higher for members nearer to retirement than for younger members.
Mr Wolfson and Mr Angelides are subject to the lifetime allowance and have elected to join the unfunded, unapproved pension arrangement.
The accrued annual pension set out above includes their membership of that arrangement.

The market price of shares at 27 January 2007 was 1946p and the range during the year then ended was 1600p to 1961p.
The executive directors are also together with other employees discretionary beneficiaries under the ESOT and, as such, were each considered to be interested in the 6,441,692 shares owned by the Trust at 27 January 2007.
Mr Keens has a beneficial holding of 41,000 nominal value of the Companys 10 year 5.25% corporate bonds.
