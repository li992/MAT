Report of the remuneration committee This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles of good governance relating to Directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
Remuneration Committee The Committee consists solely of five non-executive Directors, Messrs Camus, Dowley, Licoys, Nelson and Stone, under the chairmanship of Mr Nelson.
Mr Nelson is a non-executive partner in Graphite Capital, one of whose funds has an investment in the ICG Mezzanine Fund 2000.
Other than this, none of the Committee members have any personal financial interests other than as shareholders, conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
Two non-executive Directors, Mr Bartlam and Mr Manser, who are not members of the Committee, attend the meeting by invitation.
Two Executive Directors attend the meetings by invitation and the Committee consults the Executive Directors about its proposals and has access to professional advice from outside the Company.
The Head of Human Resources also attends the meetings by invitation.
The Committee meets at least twice a year and more frequently if necessary.
Remuneration policy on Executive Directors remuneration Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibre needed to maintain the Companys position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
In arriving at the Executive Directors remuneration packages, the Committee relies on objective research from McLagan Partners, which contains up to date information from a comparative group of companies.
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package is undertaken by the Committee.
This policy has been formulated having given full consideration to Schedule A annexed to the Code.
Whilst it is intended that the policy statement set out in this report should continue for future years, it is not certain that this policy will continue without amendment in subsequent financial years.
This is because the Committee considers that an effective remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take into account changes in the Groups business environment and remuneration practices.
The main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are as follows: basic annual salary: bonus payments: share option incentives, including a Key Employee Retention Share Plan KERSP scheme: and carried interest arrangements.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance related.
As described below, the majority of the expected value of their pay comes from bonus payments and carried interest arrangements, as well as from the benefits of participation in share option schemes.
Basic salary An Executive Directors basic salary is determined by the Committee at the beginning of each year.
In deciding appropriate levels the Committee can rely on objective research, which gives up to date information on a comparator group of companies which comprises companies engaged in private equity investment and related functions within investment banking.
Executive Directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
The Company also provides all Executive Directors, along with all other employees, with healthcare and prolonged disability and life assurance cover.
Annual Report and Accounts Intermediate Capital Group PLC 41 Report of the remuneration committee continued Bonus payments In setting appropriate bonus parameters the Committee refers to the objective research on comparator Groups of companies as noted above.
The Committee believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the interests of the Companys shareholders and that the principal measure of those interests is shareholder value.
The key element is the Medium Term Incentive Scheme, reapproved by the shareholders in 2003, the payout of which is related to the cumulative growth in earnings per share and calculated by reference to the amount of realised gains on investments and rolled-up interest.
No payment currently is made if the cumulative growth in EPS is less than 5% per annum.
The amounts payable rise on a straight line basis from 4% of realised gains to a maximum of 20% of realised gains when cumulative growth in earnings per share reaches 10% per annum.
The extension and appropriateness of the scheme is considered by the Committee on an annual basis.
In the current year the amounts payable under the Medium Term Incentive Scheme were based on the maximum percentage of 20% of gains on investment and rolled-up interest.
General remuneration policy The Company also operates a short-term bonus scheme under which bonuses are paid to individuals who do not participate or whose share in the Medium Term Incentive Scheme is not, in managements opinion, sufficient to retain, reward or incentivise such individuals.
These bonuses are also paid to executives who are not yet participating fully in the Medium Term Incentive Scheme and may be paid to newly appointed Directors at the discretion of the Committee.
Share options There are a number of share option schemes currently operated by the Company: all schemes are, in so far as Executive Directors are concerned, administered by the Committee.
The schemes are: The ICG 2001 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme, which was adopted on 21 May 2001 and approved by the Inland Revenue on 22 May 2001.
The granting of options, the exercise price of which is based on the previous five days closing share price, are phased and may be exercised between three and ten years after the date of grant only if performance targets are met.
It is intended that options will not be exercisable unless, during a period of three consecutive years from the date of grant, the Companys earnings per share since 1 February 2005, core income increases.
i in the case of executives: by an average of at least 4% per annum above the Retail Price Index ii in the case of Directors: by an average of at least 3% per annum above the Retail Price Index in which case one third of options may be exercised by an average of at least 4% per annum above the Retail Price Index in which case two thirds of the options may be exercised by an average of at least 5% per annum above the Retail Price Index in which case all options may be exercised.
The value of individual grants of options are restricted to an upper limit equivalent of 200% of salary 400% for the first grant to an individual based upon the exercise price.
The ICG 2001 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme which was adopted on 21 May 2001 and whose provisions are substantially similar to those of the ICG 2001 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme.
The Key Employee Retention Share Plan which was adopted on 23 May 2005, under which an amount, up to 15% of the value of the MTIS pool, may be distributed to key executives in the form of share options with an exercise price equal to nil.
In order to exercise these options, the Company must achieve a growth in EPS of 5% per annum from the date of grant to the vesting date and the limit to any individual is 20% of the value of their monetary remuneration in the year.
42 Intermediate Capital Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts Carried interest arrangements The Company has established for its executives, including the Executive Directors, carried interest arrangements whereby between 60% and 80% of the carried interest negotiated by the Company in respect of managed funds raised since 21 January 1998 is available for allocation to its executives.
Although these arrangements are not a long term incentive scheme as the costs of these arrangements are borne by the investors in such funds, the Company sought, and obtained, approval from its shareholders for such arrangements at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 21 January 1998.
Reconfirmation of the carried interest arrangements was obtained from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 May 2003.
It is not possible to put a monetary value on these interests, as they are dependent upon the performance of such funds over the next few years, and amounts will not be payable until the investors in the funds have had their capital returned, plus a minimum return.
However, the allocation of carried interest entitlements as at 31 March 2007 was as follows: Mezzanine Fund Mezzanine Fund Mezzanine Fund Asia Pacific European Fund 1998 2000 2003 Mezzanine Fund 2006 Executive Directors 22.6% 17.2% 22.7% 30.0% 30.8% Former Executive Directors 18.3% 11.7% 2.3% Other executives 19.1% 31.1% 50.0% 32.6% 49.2% ICG 40.0% 40.0% 25.0% 37.4% 20.0% Total 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Executive Directors pension arrangements Under their service agreements, each Executive Director is paid an additional gross annual amount to be paid into any one or more pension plans of his choice up to a maximum annual amount equal to 15% of basic annual salary.
There have been no changes in the terms of Executive Directors pension entitlement during the year and there are no other arrangements in place concerning their pensions.
In respect of all other employees either a an additional gross annual amount is paid to them which they use to contribute to any one or more pension plans of their choice or b the Company makes contributions into a designated Group pension plan.
Executive Directors contracts Executive Directors have one year rolling contracts which are deemed appropriate for the nature of the Companys business.
The Company is obliged to pay damages for wrongful termination.
No other payments are made for compensation for loss of office.
Non-executive Directors The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board within the limits set out in the Articles of Association, which currently limits the total amount paid to non-executive Directors to 400,000.
The annual fee paid to the current non-executive Chairman in the year was 127,500, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee was 52,500, the non-independent non-executive Director was 40,000 and the annual fees paid to each other independent non-executive Director was 45,000.
In arriving at these levels of fees, the Committee relies upon objective research from KPMG and Deloitte & Touche LLP which contains up to date relevant information.
Included in these amounts are fees for additional work performed for the Company in respect of time spent working on the Remuneration and Audit Committees, which amounted to 2,500 for each non-executive Director for each Committee, with the exception of the Chairman.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share option schemes.
Non-executive Directors do not have a contract of service and are not eligible to join the designated Group pension plan.
