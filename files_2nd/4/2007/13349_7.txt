In determining the other executive Directors remuneration for the year the Committee consulted Alan Jackson Chairman about its proposals.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP appointed independent adviserswho provided no other services to the Group during the year provided advice to the Committee, encompassing all elementsofthe remuneration packages.
Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages aredesigned to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibreneeded to progress and developthe Group and to rewardthem for enhancingvalue to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package areundertaken by the Committee.
In addition, the Committeedetermines the remuneration for the Chairman.
The remuneration of the other non-executive Directors is determined by the Board.
Thereare four main elements of the remuneration package for executiveDirectors: Basic annual salary including Directors fees and benefits: Annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 100% of basic salary for executiveDirectors: Long-Term Incentive Plan awards: and Pension arrangements.
The Companyspolicy is  of the remuneration of the executive Directors should be performance related.
As describedbelow, executive Directors may earnannual % of their basic salary together with the benefits of the participation in the Long-Term IncentivePlan.
Executive Directors areentitled to accept appointments outsidethe Company or Group.
Thereisnorequirement for Directors to remit fees earned from appointments outsideofthe Company or Group to The RestaurantGroup plc.
Basic salary An executive Directorsbasic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginningofeach year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
, the Committee considers the Group asawhole and by reference to remuneration levels at other companiesinthe leisureand hospitality sectors.
Basic salaries werereviewed in December 2006 with increases taking effect from1January 2007.
They wereagain reviewed in December 2007 with increases from1January2008.
In additiontobasic salary, the executive Directors receive pensioncontributions and certain benefits-in-kind, principallyacar or car allowance, and health and life insurance.
Changes to the basic salary in 2007 represented increasesofbetween 25% and 40%.
These significant adjustments wereconsidered necessary to ensurethat the managementteam wereretained in circumstances whereseveral members of the team had been approached by other organisations offering very attractive packages potentially significantly higher than the current packages.
In part, this increase also recognised the increased complexity of the businessand performance of the Company and individual executives.
23 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2007 Directors remuneration report continued Annual bonus payments The annual bonus is basedonthe achievement of stretching profit beforetax targets and personal objectives.
Performance targets areset annually as part of the budgeting process and performance is reviewed against those targets at the end of the financial year.
The maximum performance related bonus that can be paid in respect of performancein2008 is 100% of basic annual salary and for significant bonuses to be paid, performance must be outstanding.
For any bonus payment made in excess of 75% of salary thereisa reinvestment commitment for the Director into shares in The Restaurant Group plc, and these shares form part of the matching element described in the Long-Term Incentive Plan detailed below.
Long-term incentives The Company operates the 2005 Long-TermIncentive Plan LTIP or Plan, and the 2003 Save As YouEarn SAYE Scheme under which awards may be granted to executive Directors.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The 2005 LTIP is the primarylong-term incentive scheme of the Company.
Under the terms of the LTIP, individualsmay receive an awardofconditional free shares Conditional Awards withaface value at grant of up to 100% of salary per annum, vesting at least three years after grant subject to performance conditions and continued employment.
In addition, the Plan has the flexibility to grant conditional awards onamatching basis, prorata to the number of shares purchased via the annual bonus Matching Awards.
Matching Awards may be grantedover shares worth up to 37.5% of base salary per annum.
The aggregate value of annual awards Conditional and Matching iscapped at 137.5% of base salary.
Under the Plan, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to increase this cap to 200% of salary if the Committeedecides thereare exceptional circumstances in relation to retention and recruitment of employees.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that exceptional circumstances do currently exist in relation to the retention of certain key employees and Directors and may exercise its discretion to make awards of up to 200% of salary in 2008.
The Committee considers that Earnings Per Share EPS and Total Shareholder Return TSR are the most appropriate measures of performance, with EPS targets rewarding significant and sustained earnings growth and TSR providingabalance to the financial performance and retainingashareprice discipline in the remuneration package.
For the Conditional Awards to executive Directorstobemade in 2008, two separate performance conditions apply to proportions of the award.
These have been reviewed to ensuretheir continued appropriateness: The performance conditionattached to 50% of the Conditional Awards requires average annual EPS growth from1January 2008 to 31 December 2010 of between RPI plus 4% to RPI plus 10% p. a. for between 30% and 100% of this part of the awardtovest i. e. between 15% and 50% of the total award.
The performance conditionattached to the other 50% of the Conditional Awards is based on TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE Travel&LeisureIndex overasingle three-year period from1March 2008 to1March 2011.
This awardwill vest between 30% for median performance increasing onastraightline basis to 100% for upper quartile performance of this award to vest i. e. between 15% for median and 50% for upper quartile performance of the total award.
Awards will vest onastraight line basis between minimum and maximum thresholds.
For Matching Awards, therewill bea0.3:1 match for average EPS growth of RPI plus 4% p. a. rising onastraightline basis to the full 1:1 match for average EPS growth of RPI plus 10% p. a.
Performance against the TSR and EPS targets will be  and reviewed by the Committee.
Following the approval of the LTIP, shareholding guidelines for executive Directors have been introduced, linked to the out-turnofthe Plan.
At the time Conditional and Matching Awards vest under the Plan or any other executive plan established in the future, thereisa requirement to retain no fewer than 50% of the shares net of taxes vestingunder an LTIP  withamarket value equal to 100% of base salary is achieved.
