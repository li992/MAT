Remuneration Committee The Group has established a Remuneration Committee the Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The current members of the Committee, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors, are given on page 16.
The Chairman of the Committee is Mr R J Harrison.
The Group Company Secretary acts as its secretary.
The role of the Committee is to decide on all aspects of the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and the Chairman.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is a matter to be agreed between the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive.
The Committee reviews and retains a right of veto on all aspects of remuneration for all direct reports of Executive Directors and all members of the senior management team.
1 Remuneration Policy The Group aims to provide competitive salary and benefit packages for all employees.
As far as is practicable it pursues a consistent policy of terms and conditions across the Divisions.
In that context benets such as Share Options and Pension Scheme membership are open to all qualifying employees.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benets, comparison is made with the packages offered by companies of similar size and business diversity and after considering general pay and employment conditions in the Group.
The Committee has access to New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who as independent consultants, provide external research on market data and trends.
1 Executive Directors The Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate the Executive Directors to maintain the profitable growth of the business.
As far as possible, it is the Committees intention to align Executive Directors interests with those of the shareholders.
The main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are as follows: Basic salary Benets in kind Annual bonus scheme Pension arrangements Share Option schemes.
The Groups policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance related.
Excluding Share Options and the Long Term Incentive Plan, the targeted composition of each Executive Directors annual remuneration is non performance related 61% and performance related 39%.
Executive Directors, subject to Board approval, may hold external Non-Executive Directorships of businesses that do not compete with The BSS Group PLC.
Directors may retain payments received in respect of these positions.
Basic Salary Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Committee annually after a review of individual performance and having regard to competitive practice.
Pay rises take effect from 1 April each year unless an individual changes role, when pay changes take effect from the date of change.
Benets in Kind The Executive Directors receive certain benets in kind, which in the main relate to the provision of a Company car.
Annual Bonus Scheme All of the Executive Directors are eligible to participate in a short term incentive scheme for which targets are set annually by the Remuneration Committee.
The targets are designed to encourage individual performance, operating efficiencies and profitable growth.
Currently these relate to improvements in profit before taxation 50% of basic salary, the achievement of working capital targets over 10 months of the year 10% of basic salary and personal objectives 5% of basic salary.
Therefore the maximum payable under the scheme during 2006 2007 was 65% of basic salary.
For the financial year 2007 2008, the maximum payable under the scheme will be 65%.
Bonuses are paid out in June following the announcement of the results for the financial year.
Mr G Slark received 64% of his basic salary and Mr K M Higginson received 64% of his basic salary for the financial year ended 31 March 2006.
Pension Arrangements In line with the Groups policy, all new Executive Directors are eligible to join The BSS Group PLC Group Stakeholder Pension Plan.
THE BSS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007 24 Share Option Schemes All of the Executive Directors participate in long term incentive schemes, details of which are set out below.
There were three long term incentive schemes in operation during the year: The BSS Group PLC Performance Share Plan A new performance share scheme, The BSS Group PLC Performance Share Plan the Plan, was approved at the Annual General Meeting on 21 July 2005.
This plan will be used as a means of incentivising employees, including senior management and Executive Directors, to maintain the profitable growth of the Group such that their interests continue to be aligned with those of the shareholders.
The maximum number of shares granted to any Director in any one year is equivalent to one year of basic salary.
The Plan is structured to reward performance where the Group achieves strong growth in earnings per share EPS in excess of growth in the Retail Prices Index RPI.
The second award under the Plan was made on 21 June 2006: performance for this award will be measured over three financial years ended 31 March 2007, 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2009.
The principal features of the Plan are as follows: Participants will receive a promise of free shares subject to meeting specic performance conditions Vesting of awards will only take place once the performance conditions have been satisfied With a view to linking rewards to performance, average EPS growth per annum for the awards made shall result in vesting as follows: Growth in EPS average per annum over RPI Vesting Less than 5% EPS No part of the award will vest Between 5% and 10% inclusive Straight line proportionate vesting between 30% and 100% inclusive More than 10% EPS 100% of the award will vest In order to provide shares for part of this plan, the Group purchased 90,000 of its own shares on 30 November 2005.
The BSS Group PLC Approved and Unapproved Share Option Scheme Under the Approved and Unapproved Share Option Schemes, options were granted at 175.83 pence rebased for the 4:1 share split, on 1 June 2004.
The options are exercisable from 1 June 2007 to 1 June 2014 and can only be exercised if the following cumulative earnings per share EPS target is met: 100% 50% Year Ending Exercise EPS Exercise EPS March 2005 65.5p 63.2p March 2006 72.4p 70.0p March 2007 81.9p 76.1p Cumulative EPS 219.8p 209.3p Below the 50% target none of the options will vest.
For EPS performance between 100% exercise and 50% exercise there will be interpolation to achieve an intermediate position.
EPS will be calculated based on a pre goodwill amortisation and pre exceptionals basis and under the rules of UK GAAP prevailing at the time of grant.
The cumulative actual EPS over the three years ending 31 March 2007 will be compared with the cumulative EPS targets as set out above to determine whether any of the options will vest and if so how many.
Both of the previous grants under this Scheme have vested at 100% and the Directors with interests in these have exercised their options.
Save As You Earn SAYE Executive Directors may participate in an Inland Revenue approved SAYE scheme which is open to all employees.
Details of Directors interests including share options are shown on pages 27 to 28.
