It believes that senior executives should be highly rewarded on a market competitive basis for the delivery of stretching goals but also should receive reduced rewards when the business performs poorly.
To achieve this alignment Avivas remuneration package is leveraged, with a high percentage of pay at risk against the achievement of stretching goals.
Furthermore two-thirds of any bonus and any LTIP grant are delivered in the form of Aviva shares.
The requirement to defer bonus and participation in the LTIP closely ties the long term value of executive remuneration to Avivas share price performance.
Executives thus have high exposure to the same benets and drawbacks of share price movement as other shareholders.
The belief that our Executives should be shareholders is reinforced through formal guidelines requiring executive directors to build up and retain a significant holding of Aviva shares.
The Groups strategic priorities and targets are set out elsewhere in this report.
Those priorities are reected closely in our remuneration package: Basic Salary: Delivering our business plans requires talented senior executives focused on business performance.
Overall remuneration is heavily inuenced by basic salary.
Internal and external equity in basic salary positioning is an important contributor to a motivational remuneration package and hence to delivering our business plan.
A range of market data is used to inform decision making taking into account our policy with regard to the FTSE 30 and FTSE 50 data.
We wish to win, keep and focus talented individuals on delivering sustained group performance.
Bonuses: Bonus structures are effective only if they drive, through the targets chosen, sustained profitable growth for shareholders.
In choosing targets careful thought also needs to be given to the unhelpful behaviours they might inadvertently promote.
These considerations are regularly debated by the Committee.
Management is asked to explain 95 and justify the targets recommended for adoption.
The Committee must assure itself that the final targets are, firstly, Governance the correct ones to provide incentives and, secondly, are set at an appropriately challenging level.
This debate has resulted in significant developments in Avivas target setting in recent years.
In brief, the moves have been towards a smaller number of financial targets, with emphasis given through gearing to operating profit and new business contribution two measures of particular relevance to a large life insurance business.
The emphasis in 2007 has been to reduce and focus the number of financial measures further for 2008.
These financial targets sit alongside targets on customer advocacy and employee engagement introduced in 2005 that the Committee believes are critical to long-term organisational health.
The personal objectives of executive directors and executive committee members are also reviewed by the Committee to ensure they adequately reect the strategic aims of the Group, good governance and best practice.
The LTIP encourages a longer-term management focus on Return on Capital Employed ROCE and relative TSR.
These metrics measure how the Company is performing in both relative and absolute terms.
It also ensures direct line of sight for executives between, on the one hand, the actual experience of shareholders investing in the insurance sector and Aviva in particular and, on the other, their own financial interests and wealth creation opportunities.
The Committee considers all these elements, plus pension and other benets, as a whole.
They look to ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained between them so that the need for both short-term success and long-term sustainable growth is recognised.
The Committee also ensures that the non-financial business measures and individual objectives reect adequately Avivas environmental, social and governance responsibilities and send the right messages to management about the positive behaviours required to meet those responsibilities.
Constituent elements of reward as a percentage of total remuneration The bar charts below show how the Groups remuneration policy translates in practice into the Chief Executives remuneration package.

Other benefits 13,300 cash car allowance Private medical insurance 99 Annual Bonus Plan ABP target setting Governance The financial targets which underpin the ABP accounting for 50% of annual bonus are derived from Avivas return, growth and capital efficiency capital generation goals.
Two of the financial targets operating profit and new business contribution are stretched due to their importance in achieving these aspirations.
Employee and customer targets each accounting for up to 10% of annual bonus are set taking into account performance to date and aspirations for the future.
The employee targets on leadership and engagement are derived from the Groups global climate survey in which all business units participate and which over 42,000 staff completed in 2007.
This survey is delivered through an independent third party able to provide extensive external benchmark data.
Our current aim is to reach the relevant global and national norms on leadership and engagement.
Our aspiration is to be at the upper quartile positions over time.
The ABP replaced the Aviva Deferred Bonus Plan DBP, which was approved by shareholders in 2001 and provided for a one-for-one match on deferred awards.
Vesting of awards is not subject to any further performance conditions and takes place on the third anniversary from grant.
Final awards were made under the DBP in respect of the 2004 financial year in March 2005 and will vest in 2008.
Our customer metrics do not yet have the same degree of consistency and external comparability in all business units as our employee climate survey.
Different methodologies and measures are used in different parts of the business.
We already derive suitable performance targets from available data and are working to establish greater consistency and external comparability.
Internal assurance that the outcomes on employee and customer targets were accurately calculated and reported was provided to the Committee by Group Audit.
Personal objectives based on delivery of key strategic priorities, personal leadership and operating performance of the relevant portion of the business account for up to 30% of annual bonus.
The Groups performance against its financial, employee and customer KPIs in 2007, as they affected the bonus of the Chief Executive, is shown in the table below.

ROCE targets are set annually within the context of Avivas three year business plan.
Vesting depends upon performance over the three year period against a target return.
Avivas external auditor provides a formal opinion on the ROCE vesting calculation.
The 2007 LTIP award has the following three year ROCE targets: ROCE over the three year performance period Percentage of shares in overall LTIP award that vests based on achievement of ROCE targets Less than 31.5% 0% 31.5% 15% Between 31.5% and 37.5% Prorata between 15% and 50% on a straight-line basis 37.5% and above 50% Relative TSR determines the vesting of the other 50% of any Aviva LTIP award.
The comparator group for the assessment of relative TSR performance under the 2007 grant comprises Aegon, Allianz, Axa, Fortis, Friends Provident, Generali, HBOS, ING, Legal and General, Lloyds TSB, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal and Sun Alliance, Standard Life and Zurich.
The 2005 and 2006 LTIP grants are based on the same comparator group but without Standard Life.
TSR vesting operates as follows: TSR position over the three year performance period Percentage of shares in overall LTIP award that vests based on achievement of TSR targets Below median 0% Median 15% Between median and upper quintile Prorata between 15% and 50% on a straight-line basis Upper quintile and above 50% 100 Details of unvested LTIP awards are provided on page 175.
Governance As at 31 December 2007, vesting projections non-audited of subsisting LTIP awards were as follows: LTIP award 31 December 2007 vesting projection % of award Aviva LTIP 2007 43% Aviva LTIP 2006 46.5% Aviva LTIP 2005 50% Details of the assumptions used in valuing the LTIP for accounting purposes can be found on page 176 of this report.
The vesting assumption made in respect of the 2007 grant for accounting purposes is 50%.
The following table has been drawn up to assist in understanding the potential value of the LTIP grants made to executive directors in 2007: LTIP Andrew Moss Philip Scott Face value of grant 1,050,000 825,000 Minimum vesting 315,000 247,500 Expected value 607,750 477,500 Maximum vesting 1,397,500 1,098,000 Assumptions are as follows: Minimum vesting assumes TSR and ROCE elements vest at the minimum level, producing a 30% vesting of the total award.
No share price growth is assumed: Expected value, based on the vesting assumption made for accounting purposes, assumes TSR and ROCE elements vest at a combined rate of 50% of the total award.
Share price growth of 5% per annum is assumed over the three year performance period: Maximum vesting assumes both TSR and ROCE elements vest in full, producing a 100% vesting: Share price growth of 10% per annum is assumed over the three year performance period.
The current LTIP succeeds a previous long term incentive plan, the last awards under which were made in 2004 and vested in 2007.
For the 2007 LTIP release, at the end of the performance period, on TSR the Company was ranked eighth out of the 20 companies in the comparator group 34.9% vesting and ROCE was 32.4% 30% vesting.
The total vesting was therefore 64.9%.
The 35.1% of the award which did not vest lapsed.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 The vesting history under the previous long term incentive plan is as follows: Percentage of award vesting Year of grant Performance period ROCE TSR Total 2002 January 2002 to December 2004 23.3 23.0 46.3 2003 January 2003 to December 2005 30.0 34.9 64.9 2004 January 2004 to December 2006 30.0 34.9 64.9 Aviva does not award additional shares for the dividends that were paid during the three year performance period on those shares that vest.
For the director appointed in 2007, the amounts disclosed relate to their awards at the date of appointment.
For former directors, the amounts disclosed relate to their awards held during their period of service as director.
Where awards have lapsed or are due to lapse no vesting date is given.
Richard Harvey resigned from the Board with effect from 11 July 2007.
Patrick Snowball resigned from the Board with effect from 8 May 2007.
Tidjane Thiam was appointed to the Board on 1 May 2007 and resigned from the Board with effect from 21 September 2007.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Planned Future Changes The Committee reviewed in 2007 the remuneration package of Avivas senior executives.
This was against a background of the Chief Executive, Andrew Moss clear strategic imperative for the Group to deliver one Aviva, twice the value.
Twice the value will be measured in terms of growth in the Companys Earnings Per Share EPS with a target of doubling EPS in five years.
Management also has an incentive to achieve the goal more quickly.
No current element of executive remuneration is focused on EPS growth.
The use of this measure will achieve direct alignment between a portion of executive remuneration and the additional financial goals of the new strategy.
The remuneration review also showed that the potential rewards represented by Avivas long-term incentives fall short of benchmark figures in the comparator groups for our executive directors.
As a result of the review, and subject to the outcome of consultation with institutional investors, we therefore to intend to put to shareholders at the 2008 Annual General Meeting a proposal to introduce a matching element to a proportion of the shares deferred under the ABP, with the following key features: The proportion of the deferred shares eligible for the matching award will be 100% for the CEO and 75% for the Finance Director and Executive Committee.
The matching element will be extended to the top 400 executives within the Company with a reducing proportion of the deferred element matched depending on seniority.
The maximum match will be two shares for each share eligible for matching.
Vesting of the matching shares will depend upon the Companys EPS performance over a three year period as follows:- Performance Level Annualised EPS Growth Matching Ratio Below threshold Less than 10% pa Nil Threshold 10% pa 0.1 for 1 Stretch 26% pa 2 for 1 103 Matching will be on a straight-line basis for performance between threshold and stretch.
Governance Subject to shareholder approval, the first award of matching shares will be made in 2008, matching a proportion of deferrals made under ABP in respect of 2007 performance.
The Committee has satisfied itself that following the introduction of the matching share element the total remuneration of the CEO and Finance Director would be positioned consistent with our policy on FTSE 30 and FTSE 50 benchmarking.
Further details on the proposals are included in the notice of meeting for the 2008 Annual General Meeting.
Other than this proposal, we do not anticipate any further significant changes in remuneration in 2008.
Performance graph The following graph compares the TSR performance of the Company over the past five years with the TSR of the FTSE 100 Return Index.

External Board appointments Aviva recognises its senior executives can benefit from serving in a personal capacity as a non-executive director of non-Aviva Group companies.
Aviva therefore has a policy of allowing senior executives to serve as a non-executive director of one external company, subject to approval by the Board, and to retain any board fees.
Exceptionally, a second non-executive directorship might be approved.
The only Executive Director who held such an appointment during 2007 was Philip Scott who was appointed to the Board of Diageo plc on 17 October 2007.
All-employee share plans Executive directors are eligible to participate in a number of HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved all-employee share plans on the same basis as other eligible employees.
These plans include a share element of the Aviva All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP.
Under this plan, eligible employees can receive up to a maximum of 3,000 per annum in shares based upon the profits of the Companys UK business.
The shares are free of tax subject to a retention period.
In addition, the partnership element of the AESOP, which the Company also operates, allows participants to invest up to 125 per month out of their gross salary in the Companys shares.
There is no matching to this investment by the Company.
The Aviva Savings Related Share Option Scheme allows eligible employees to acquire options over the Companys shares at a discount of up to 20% of their market value at the date of grant.
In order to exercise these options, participants must have saved through a three, five or seven-year HMRC approved savings contract, subject to a maximum savings limit of 250 per month.
Details of holdings under these plans can be found on page 110.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Dilution Awards granted under the Aviva ABP and the Aviva LTIP are met by the issue of new shares when awards vest.

NEDs receive a basic annual fee in respect of their Board duties.
A further fee is paid to NEDs other than the Chairman in respect of membership and, where appropriate, chairmanship of Board Committees.
From 2007 fees will be reviewed annually and are set by the Board to attract individuals with the required range of skills and experience.
In determining the level of fees paid to the NEDs the Board receives recommendations from the executive directors, who consider the NEDs duties and responsibilities, together with the time commitment required in preparing for and attending meetings, and the amounts paid by competitors and similar-sized companies.
The Chairman and NEDs receive no benefits in addition to their fees nor do they participate in any incentive or performance plans or pension arrangements.
The Companys Articles of Association provide that the total aggregate remuneration paid to the Chairman and NEDs will be determined by the Board within the limits set by shareholders.
The current aggregate limit of 1.5 million was approved by shareholders at the Companys 2005 Annual General Meeting.
The amount paid in 2007 was 1.04 million.
Executive directors are remunerated under their service contracts and receive no additional fee for serving as directors.

Mr. Harvey ceased to accrue pension benets in the Pension Scheme with effect from April 2006.
Instead, contributions have been paid into his ACAP.
Mr. Harveys Pension Scheme benefit at March 2006 was 75,000 pa.
This increased in line with deferred pension increases the lower of the increase in the RPI or 5%.
Mr. Harvey subsequently took early retirement with effect from 31 July 2007.
As part of Mr. Harveys agreed early retirement terms, the Company agreed to base the calculation of his pension on it being paid two years earlier than a retirement of age 60 rather than three.
Consequently, his early retirement pension payable from 1 August 2007 amounted to 69,153 pa rather than 65,237 pa. To provide this additional 3,916 pa pension, a cost was incurred to the Company of 101,857.
Mr. Harvey then surrendered 19,014 pa of his pension for a cash sum, reducing his pension payable from 1 August 2007 to 50,139 pa.
This will increase annually in payment in line with RPI, subject to a maximum of 10%.
Mr. Moss ceased accrual in the Pension Scheme with effect from 31 March 2006, and as a result, his post-March 2006 pension benefit was 19,556 pa.
This will increase in line with deferred pensions the lower of the increase in RPI or 5% subject to the LTA.
At 31 December 2007 it increased to 20,260 pa.
The amounts shown above are rounded to the nearest thousand, thus showing no increase in pension for Mr. Moss.
Mr Scott has been accruing benets in the Pension Scheme since before June 1989, so was not therefore subject to the HMRC Earnings Cap.
Following pensions simplication Mr Scott registered with HMRC for enhanced protection.
He remains a member of the scheme and continues to accrue benets as a result of salary increases and ination.
However, he is not accruing benets as a result of additional service.
Mr. Scotts pension will be based upon his final pensionable salary and years of service at retirement, subject to an overriding limit of two-thirds of final pensionable salary.
Mr. Snowball had been accruing benets in the pension scheme since before June 1989, so was not therefore subject to HMRCs Earnings Cap.
He continued to accrue benets in the Pension Scheme until he left the Company on 30 June 2007.
His deferred pension at that date is that shown above at 31 December 2007, which will increase until his retirement in line with RPI subject to a maximum of 5%.
Mr. Thiam was appointed as Group Executive Director with effect from 1 May 2007.
The above shows his benets, including pensionable service prior to him being appointed an executive director.
He ceased to be Group Executive Director with effect from 21 September 2007.
The above only allows for benets up to that date.
The accrued pension is the amount of annual pension to which the directors would have been entitled at age 60, had they left service at 31 December 2007.
The amount shown in respect of Mr. Harvey is his annual pension in payment at 31 December 2007.
Members of the Dened benefit section of the Pension Scheme made a contribution of 5% of their pensionable salary.
The change in transfer values over the year includes the effect of changes made by the Trustee of the Pension Scheme to the assumptions used in respect of changes to market values and expected future investment returns.
Transfer values represent the estimated liability on the Scheme to pay the stated level of benets.
They are not sums paid or due to a director, and do not represent the true cost of providing the pension benefit.
No former directors received any increase in retirement benets in excess of the amount to which they were entitled, on the later of the date when the benets first became payable or 31 March 1997.

Accounting changes Major changes to accounting policies and practices in 2005, including adopting International Financial Reporting Standards and European Embedded Value principles for supplementary reporting, affected a number of the key performance indicators and performance measures used in connection with the Companys long term incentive plans.
