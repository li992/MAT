41 NORTHUMBRIAN WATER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 06 07 Directors remuneration report Information not requiring audit The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee of the Board the Committee determines the remuneration and terms of employment of the Chairman of the Company, executive directors and senior management of the Group in accordance with a remuneration policy approved by the Board.
The Committee members are Martin Ngre Chairman, Sir Patrick Brown, Alex Scott-Barrett, who are all considered by the Company to be independent, and Sir Derek Wanless.
Before Sir Dereks appointment as Chairman of NWG on 27 July 2006 he was an independent non-executive director and a member of the Remuneration Committee.
Although the Combined Code in place on that date required all members of the Committee to be independent non-executive directors, the amendment permitting company chairmen to sit on the Remuneration Committee, with effect from 1 April 2007, had already been published.
The Board wanted the Committee to continue to have the benefit of Sir Dereks experience and asked him to retain his seat on the Committee.
Therefore, between 27 July 2006 and 31 March 2007, the membership of the Committee was not compliant with the Combined Code.
The Committee met five times during the year with 100% attendance by all members.
As the Committee works closely with NWLs Remuneration Committee, Committee papers and minutes are circulated to all NWL and NWG non-executive directors, who can give their views direct to the Committee Chairman and can attend meetings if they wish.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Companys website.
The Committee received advice during the year from its appointed remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC, and also from the Managing Director.
NBSC continues to assist the Committee in maintaining best practice in relation to remuneration.
NBSC does not provide any other service to the Company.
The Committee is always available to engage with major shareholders and their representatives to discuss remuneration matters, although no such approaches have been received.
During the year the Committee: agreed bonuses for 2005 06: agreed salaries for 2006 07 and 2007 08: decided the vesting percentage to be applied to the LTIP awards made on 27 January 2004, which vested on 27 January 2007: agreed performance conditions for future LTIP awards, after consultation with major shareholders.
Further information is set out below under LTIP: agreed to increase the upper limits of future LTIP awards from 75% to 100% of annual salary, subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM on 2 August 2007: and set performance targets for executive directors and senior managers.
Statement of remuneration policy The Committee has considered the principles and provisions of the Combined Code when setting its policy and believes it is fully compliant.
The policy of the Company, which applied throughout 2006 07 and applies for 2007 08 and subsequent financial years, is to provide remuneration that is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to run the Company successfully.
That being said, the Committees paramount principle is to pay fairly.
The Committee is aware of the risk of remuneration being ratcheted up as a result of benchmarking exercises and confirms that this has not happened.
Consistent with its fair pay policy, when considering the remuneration packages of senior executives and directors, the Committee takes into account pay awards to other employees in the Group.
The remuneration policy of the Committee is: the setting of base salaries to be largely influenced by individual contributions and internal relativities rather than external comparators: the annual bonus plan should recognise the interests of all of the Companys stakeholders shareholders, customers and employees rather than be focused solely on profits: and management should share in the longer term value created for the Companys investors, but equity incentive schemes should only reward if there is clear outperformance of the market and other quoted companies.
The implementation of this remuneration policy is described over the page.
CLICK TO RETURN TO CONTENTS 42 NORTHUMBRIAN WATER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 06 07 Directors remuneration report continued Elements of remuneration The remuneration of the executive directors consists of basic salary and benefits, including pension and participation in the Companys SIP, all of which are not performance related.
The performance related elements are annual bonus and LTIP awards.
The relative importance of the performance and non performance related elements is monitored and the Committee recognises the importance of the performance related elements.
Even with the proposed increases, the LTIP awards will remain below general market levels.
Executive directors: basic salary and benefits The basic salaries paid to each director during the year are set out in Table 1 on page 45.
Basic salary is the only pensionable element of the executive directors remuneration packages.
Data received from NBSC has indicated that the Managing Directors basic salary is less than the median paid to his counterparts at other quoted water companies.
For the second year in succession, however, John Cuthbert has declined salary increases recommended by the Committee.
He has, therefore, had no increase in his basic salary in 2006 or 2007.
Benefits provided to the executive directors include membership of a defined benefit pension scheme, car allowance and healthcare.
Non-executive directors: fees and benefits As Chairman, Sir Derek Wanless receives an annual fee of 125,000.
All other non-executive directors are paid a fee of 30,000 per annum.
Additional fees of 5,000 and 7,500 per annum are paid to the Chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committees respectively.
Sir Derek and the other non-executive directors do not receive benefits in kind.
When Sir Fred Holliday was Chairman he received an annual fee of 125,000 and benefits in kind, which included the use of a company car and driver and work-related accommodation.
The car, driver and accommodation were available to the Company when not being used by Sir Fred.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not participate in bonus, pension or share schemes operated by the Company.
Details of non-executive directors remuneration are set out in Table 1 on page 45.
Non-executive directors fees have not been reviewed for some time, but will in future be reviewed annually by the Chairman and the executive directors.
From 1 April 2007, the Chairmans annual fee will be 150,000 and the non-executive directors fees will be 35,000 per annum, with the Chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committees receiving additional fees of 5,000 and 10,000 per annum, respectively.
Annual bonus Since 2005 06 the annual bonus plan reflects the interests of all of the Companys stakeholders.
Maximum annual bonuses for the executive directors in 2006 07 are 70% of salary, which are apportioned as follows: Maximum bonus available as a Stakeholder Bonus metric % of salary Shareholders Profit before tax PBT 40 Customers Overall Performance Assessment OPA rating 5 Employees Percentage lost time through sickness 5 Bespoke personal targets 20 Total 70 John Cuthberts personal targets related principally to improving the sustainability of the pension scheme, business strategy, investor relations and succession planning, as well as a range of financial matters.
Chris Greens personal targets were focused mainly on funding and credit rating, the maintenance of key financial ratios and measures, and the relationships with major debt and equity investors and analysts.
Taking account of performance against personal targets and the OPA, PBT and lost time performance, bonuses equal to 62% and 64.5% of basic salary were approved for payment to John Cuthbert and Chris Green, respectively.
Bonus payments are included in Table 1 on page 45.
CLICK TO RETURN TO CONTENTS 43 NORTHUMBRIAN WATER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 06 07 LTIP Under the LTIP, executive directors and senior managers may receive, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, annual conditional awards of shares in the Company.
Details of the levels of award and performance conditions are shown in Table 2 on page 46.
A conclusion of the review that took place during 2005 06 was that the LTIP remained the most appropriate equity incentive plan, particularly in the light of the Companys dividend policy.
The Committee agreed that total shareholder return TSR performance conditions remained the best performance measure to ensure that executives are rewarded fairly for value created for the Companys investors.
However, changes were made to the structure of the TSR conditions, which are more consistent with best practice.
Following the fide-listing of several water companies, and after taking advice from NBSC, it was decided during 2006 07 that the water company comparator group was of insufficient size to be a fair comparator.
After consultation with major shareholders, it was decided to replace this comparator group with a larger group containing all the water and sewerage companies of England and Wales and using relative return on capital employed as the performance target.
This target was chosen because: it directly compares NWLs financial performance against that of its peers: it is objectively measured and verified by a third party Ofwat : NWL is the largest company in the Group: there is no subjectivity in determining what level of return would be a good and excellent result it being a relative measure to which quartile analysis is applied : and the comparative approach should be able to deal with the five year pricing reviews without the Remuneration Committee having to reset targets.
For the awards granted on 21 December 2006 the three years to be reviewed are 2006 07, 2007 08 and 2008 09.
Over the three year performance period the return on capital employed will be calculated on a compounded annualised return basis rather than a straight average of the three years.
As part of this review the Committee back-tested this performance condition and it was observed that this was a tougher condition than TSR over previous performance periods.
In addition, awards will only vest if the Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR performance is consistent with the underlying business performance of the Company.
In the event of a change of control, the Committee would determine the extent to which the performance conditions had been met and the proportion of the performance period that had elapsed in deciding whether or not any vesting of awards would take place.
The performance conditions described above were chosen to align the interests of participants in the LTIP with those of shareholders.
Rewards should only be earned over a number of years in circumstances where shareholders have benefited.
An independent firm is engaged by the Committee to calculate the TSRs and to assess the extent to which the performance conditions have been met, so that the process is rigorous and transparent.
The first LTIP award, granted on 27 January 2004, became available to vest on 27 January 2007.
The Committee instructed  PWC to assess the level of vesting of this award.
PWC reported that 73% of the award was available to vest being 100% of the award relating to the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index and 61% of the award relating to the Companys TSR performance against the other listed water companies.
Details of the number of awards which lapsed and those which were exercised by the directors of the Company are shown in Table 3 on page 47.

Directors pensions and pension benefits The main features of the Northumbrian Water Pension Scheme are set out in note 26 to the financial statements.
The Committee has reviewed its pensions policy in the light of the introduction of the new pension rules in April 2006 and details are given in the notes below Table 6 on page 48.

Performance conditions Comparison of TSR with two comparator groups over three years: 1 70% of award depends on the Companys TSR performance against other listed water companies: AWG plc, Bristol Water Group plc, East Surrey Holdings plc, Kelda Group plc, Pennon Group plc, Severn Trent plc and United Utilities plc: and 2 30% of award depends on the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts.
East Surrey Holdings plc fide-listed on 28 October 2005 and Bristol Water Group plc fide-listed on 18 May 2006.

The service contracts of the executive directors do not contain provisions relating to compensation for termination.
In the event of termination by the Company, the Remuneration Committee would make recommendations to the Board on what payments, if any, should be made to the director, depending on the circumstances of the termination, and taking into account the provisions of the Combined Code regarding non-payment for failure.
The Company would also expect directors to seek to mitigate their loss.
Contracts do not provide for compensation for loss of office in excess of fees accrued.

Voluntary contributions paid by the directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
The change in transfer value allows for fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors, such as changes in stock market conditions.
The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The directors participate in a salary sacrifice arrangement and, therefore, paid no contributions to the scheme during the year.
From 6 April 2006, following pension changes introduced in the Finance Act 2006, the Scheme removed the earnings cap restriction.
Benefit calculations for John Cuthbert and Chris Green had been subject to the earnings cap.
As a result of the removal of the earnings cap, an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement, designed to provide John Cuthbert with pension benefits based on salary in excess of the earnings cap, was terminated.
The additional liability on the pension scheme as a consequence of the removal of the earnings cap was met by the Company.
