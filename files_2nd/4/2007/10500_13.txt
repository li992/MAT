Remuneration policy The remuneration policy with respect to the Executive Directors and the Executive Management Team has been designed to provide market competitive remuneration relative to UK listed companies of similar size and scope.
The principal objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration in a form and amount to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and an Executive Management Team of appropriate calibre and experience which is essential to the future success of the Company.
The importance of aligning the interests of the Executive Directors and Executive Management Team with the creation of shareholder value over both the short and long term is key to this objective.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this requires: the provision of mid-market base salaries and the opportunity to receive incentives, with appropriate leverage to reward sustained exceptional performance and support the future growth aspirations of the Company: and a reward structure that places an equal emphasis on short term and long term performance to support operating performance and to reward sustained longer term performance.
The Company believes that in order to meet its remuneration objective, the remuneration of Executive Directors and the Executive Management Team should provide a balance between xed and variable performance related pay elements with a significant proportion of potential total remuneration comprising performance related elements.
The Remuneration Committee will, during 2008 and thereafter, constantly review the remuneration policy to ensure that it is sufciently exible to take account of future changes in the Groups business operations and environment, and recognises key developments in remuneration practice and alignment to shareholders interests.
