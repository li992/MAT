AUDITED SECTIONS OF THE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The following sections of the Report have been audited: the Directors remuneration table, the sections on the long-term incentive plan and pension contributions, and the executive Directors pension table.
REMUNERATION AND CONFLICTS COMMITTEE The remuneration packages of individual executive Directors are determined by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee which comprises Charles Bailey as Chairman, Andrew Knight and James Leigh-Pemberton all of whom are considered by the Board to be independent, non-executive Directors.
Lord Rothschild, Duncan Budge and David Haysey liaise closely with the Committee, although they do not take part in any discussions relating to decisions on their own terms and conditions of employment.
Determination of the remuneration of the non-executive Directors, within the limits imposed by the Articles of Association, is the responsibility of the Board as a whole.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee is also responsible for the operation of the long-term incentive plan for executive Directors.
Remuneration Policy The Company complied in the year under review with the provisions relating to Remuneration Committees incorporated in the Combined Code issued in June 2006 the Code.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee aims to set executive remuneration at an appropriate level to attract, retain and motivate Directors of requisite calibre.
Any arrangements made to provide longer term incentives will aim to encourage and reward performance and to benefit shareholders.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee aims to compare remuneration packages of similar financial institutions to the Company and models its decisions on the median position of those institutions.
In setting policy and making decisions, the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee gives full consideration to the provisions on the design of performance-related remuneration set out in Schedule A of the Code.

Basic Salary, Salary Supplements and Bonus Basic salaries for the executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee and the last review was at 31 March 2007.
For the current year, to 31 March 2008, Lord Rothschilds salary is 386,122 per annum 2006 7: 369,495 per annum, Duncan Budges salary is 283,914 per annum 2006 7: 271,688 per annum and David Hayseys salary is 216,315 2006 7: 207,000 per annum.
Lord Rothschild received a salary supplement of 20% of his basic salary, amounting to 73,899 in the year ended 31 March 2007 period from 1 January 2006 to 31 March 2006: 17,850.
This is included in the other benefits figure disclosed above.
The supplement is equivalent to the value of his pension contributions foregone since his election to opt out from the Companys pension scheme following advice received ahead of the pension tax reforms that came into force on 6 April 2006.
The salary supplement shall continue to be paid at the same proportion to salary in future.
For similar reasons, Mr Budge elected for the Group to cease making contributions on his behalf into the defined benefit section of the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, with effect from 6 April 2006.
From that date Mr Budge has received a salary supplement equivalent to 42% of his basic salary, or 114,109 for the year ended 31 March 2007.
The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, has adopted an Executive Bonus Plan.
The Plan provides that each executive Director, and such other participants as may be determined by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, shall be entitled to an annual bonus.
The amount payable under the Executive Bonus Plan is calculated by reference to the Companys three-year moving average outperformance over the three most relevant total return indices.
The indices are currently the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index, the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return Index expressed in Sterling.
The percentage of salary payable as a bonus rises on a straight line basis from 0% to 100%, if the average annual outperformance is between 0% and 7%.
Thereafter, the percentage of salary payable as a bonus rises from 100% in a straight line to the maximum bonus payable under the Plan of 125%, if the average annual outperformance is RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 208720 RIT R&A pp15-49 1 6 07 17:13 Page 30 30 Directors Remuneration Report between 7% and 10%.
The bonuses payable under the Plan to Lord Rothschild and Mr Budge in respect of the year ended 31 March 2007 amounted to 174,734 year ended 31 March 2006: 422,050 and 128,481 year ended 31 March 2006: 310,350 respectively.
The bonus payable under the Plan to Mr Haysey in respect of the year ended 31 March 2007 amounted to 97,890 31 March 2006: 137,950.
In addition to the bonus entitlements under the Executive Bonus Plan, Lord Rothschild and Mr Budge both received a 1,000 bonus which was paid to the Groups employees in December 2006 year ended 31 March 2006: 1,000.
Mr Haysey also received a bonus of 1,000 in December 2006 year ended 31 March 2006: 500.
Mr Haysey was not entitled to a bonus in respect of the performance in the year to 31 March 2007 of a portfolio of global equities managed by him for the Company period to 31 March 2006: 141,100.
This entitlement is calculated on the same basis as the Executive Bonus Plan outlined above, with the exception that it is calculated by reference to the performance of the portfolio against the three indices since the date on which he began managing the portfolio, rather than the three-year moving average.
Long-term Incentive Plan The adoption of a Share Appreciation Rights plan the SAR Plan was approved by shareholders on 10 July 1996, as it constituted a related party transaction under Stock Exchange rules, given the participations of Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge.
Under the SAR Plan, participants are entitled to elect to receive a cash bonus.
The amount of the bonus will represent the increase, since the date of grant, in the Companys share price multiplied by the notional number of shares.
This is, however, conditional on any increase in the share price, plus dividends paid, exceeding the increase in the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum for any three year period between the date of grant and the tenth anniversary thereof.
The Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, resolved in March 2005 that the performance condition relating to any further grants after that date under the SAR Plan shall apply only to the fixed three year period from the date of grant.
As at 31 March 2007 the amount accrued in respect of the SAR Plan participations of the Companys executive Directors was 2,832,690 31 March 2006: 2,137,531.
The lowest closing price of the Companys shares during the year was 862p and the highest was 1,060.5p.
Should a participant leave his employment involuntarily at any time, the bonus accrued to the relevant date will be payable, subject to there being no grounds for non-payment arising out of negligence or other misconduct.
The following grants of Share Appreciation Rights were made to the Companys executive Directors during the year.
All grants were made on 15 March 2007: Notional no.

Performance Graph In accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, it is necessary to include a performance graph which measures the Companys total shareholder return calculated by reference to the Companys share price, including dividend reinvestment against that of a broad equity market index.
For this purpose the Committee considers that the Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return Index in Sterling, the FTSE AllShare Total Return Index and the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index are the most suitable indices for comparative purposes.
The graph below therefore compares the Companys total shareholder return to that of these three indices over the last 5 years.
