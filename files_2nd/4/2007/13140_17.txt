As in previous years, our approach has been to meet the highest standards of disclosure, whilst aiming to produce a clear and understandable report.
Throughout 2007, the Committee consisted wholly of independent non-executive directors and the Chairman of Reed Elsevier.
In July 2007 some changes were made to the composition of the Committee.
I succeeded Rolf Stomberg as Chairman of the Committee and Robert Polet was appointed to become a member of the Committee.
Cees van Lede left the Committee upon his retirement from the boards after the 2007 Annual General Meetings.
Rolf Stomberg, Jan Hommen and I were members of the Committee throughout the year.
The Committee remains satisfied that our current remuneration arrangements continue to achieve the aim of delivering superior shareholder value by driving strong performance against our sector.
The Committee is mindful of the need to balance the fostering of a performance culture with the need to provide competitive total remuneration packages.
During the year we undertook a review of our approach to pay benchmarking.
We re-confirmed our approach of making our decisions on remuneration levels on the basis of data on the total remuneration package.
The focus on total remuneration means that any gaps to market will not automatically be addressed by salary increases.
To reflect the diversity of the markets in which we compete for talent, total remuneration will be assessed against a range of relevant comparator groups.
These comparator groups include global peers in the media sector, and listed peers of similar size and international scope in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.
We will assess the relevance of each comparator group on a role by role basis.
The positioning of an individuals total remuneration vs. the relevant comparator groups will be based on the Committees judgement of individual performance and potential.
The Committee remains committed to aligning the performance targets under our incentive plans to reflect our business goals and changing market circumstances, and will increase or, where necessary, decrease our targets accordingly.
In this context, the Committee has decided to increase by 2% the compound annual EPS growth rates required to meet the performance conditions under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Bonus Investment Plan BIP and the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
The minimum EPS growth rates that must be met and, where appropriate, the stretch performance levels that must be achieved for maximum vesting will all increase by 2% for all awards made in 2008 under these plans.
Details are provided under the description of each plan in the body of the report.
In addition, to reflect the level of stretch in our budget targets, the target annual bonus opportunity for executive directors will be increased to 100% of salary from 90% in 2007.
Furthermore, with a view to lessening the focus on base salary within the total remuneration package, we will be reviewing during 2008 the basis on which share-based awards are determined.
We will fully communicate with shareholders about any proposed changes in policy in this area.

and benchmarking During the year, the Committee undertook a review of the benchmarking methodology applied in assessing the competitiveness of the executive directors total remuneration.
The market competitiveness of total remuneration i. e. salary, short and long term incentives and benefits will be assessed against a range of relevant comparator groups as follows: Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2007 55 The total remuneration package Overview of individual remuneration elements The main elements of the reward package for executive directors are summarised below: Summary of remuneration elements for executive directors Element Purpose Performance period Performance measure Salary Positions the role and individual Not applicable Reflects the sustained value of within the relevant market for the individual in terms of skills, see page 56 executive talent experience and contribution compared with the market Annual Incentive Provides focus on the delivery One year Award subject to the achievement Plan AIP of the financial targets set out of annual targets for: in the annual budget Revenue 30% see page 56 Profit 30% Motivates the achievement of strategic Cash Flow Conversion Rate 10% annual goals and milestones KPOs Key Performance Objectives 30% that create a platform for future performance Bonus Investment Encourages personal investment in Three years Matching shares vest after three years Plan BIP and ongoing holding of Reed Elsevier subject to continued employment and shares to develop greater alignment the achievement of an Adjusted EPS see page 57 with shareholders growth hurdle Supports the retention of executives There is no retesting of the performance condition Executive Share Provides focus on longer term Three years On grant Adjusted EPS growth Option Scheme share price growth and individual performance over ESOS three-year period prior to grant Rewards sustained delivery see page 58 and quality of earnings growth On vesting Adjusted EPS growth over the three-year performance period post grant There is no retesting of the performance condition Long Term Drives value creation Three years Adjusted EPS growth over the Incentive Plan via longer term earnings, three-year performance period LTIP share price and dividend growth Relative Total Shareholder Return TSR see page 60 Motivates and rewards the delivery against a selected group of comparator of a total return to shareholders companies over the three-year performance period There is no retesting of the performance conditions Retirement Positioned to ensure Not applicable Specific to individual benefits broad competitiveness with local country practice see page 62 Directors remuneration report 56 Directors remuneration report continued Each of these remuneration elements are described in greater detail below.
Salary Salary reflects the role and the sustained value of the individual in terms of skills, experience and contribution compared with the relevant market.
Salaries are reviewed annually in the context of the competitiveness of total remuneration.
Any increases typically take effect on 1 January.
The table below shows the salaries that took effect on 1 January 2008.
Salary from Salary from 1 January 2008 1 January 2007 Gerard van fide Aast 585,996 552,825 Mark Armour 613,440 589,838 Sir Crispin Davis 1,181,100 1,135,680 Erik Engstrom 627,612 $1,146,600 Andrew Prozes $1,215,180 $1,168,440 Patrick Tierney $1,071,200 $1,071,200 During 2007 Erik Engstroms total remuneration package was altered to parallel UK remuneration arrangements.
His base salary was translated from US dollars to Sterling using a conversion rate of 1.00: $1.90 which reflected the average :$ exchange rate during his period of employment.
Following the successful sale of Harcourt Education, Patrick Tierney retired on 30 January 2008.
His salary was not increased from 1 January 2008.
The annual salary increases made to executive directors with effect from 1 January 2008 were in a range of 4-6% with an average of 4.4% for those executive directors who received an increase.
This was slightly below UK and US norms.
It is important to emphasise that Reed Elsevier uses the same factors: relevant pay market, skills, experience and contribution, to determine the levels of increase across all employee populations globally.
However, Reed Elsevier operates across many diverse countries in terms of their remuneration structures and practices.
The levels of pay increase awarded to different employee groups in different geographies reflect this diversity and range of practices.
Annual Incentive Plan AIP The Annual Incentive Plan provides focus on the delivery of the financial targets set out in the annual budget.
It further motivates the achievement of strategic annual goals and milestones that create a platform for future performance.
How the AIP works For 2008, directors have a target bonus opportunity of 100% of salary for 2007 this was 90%.
The target bonus opportunity for the financial measures is payable for the achievement of highly stretching financial targets, set in line with the annual budget for the relevant business.
The 100% target bonus opportunity is weighted as follows across the performance measures set out below: Revenue 30% Profit 30% Cash Flow Conversion Rate 10% Key Performance Objectives KPOs 30% The Profit measure for the CEO and CFO is Adjusted Profit After Tax for the Reed Elsevier combined businesses.
The profit measure for Divisional CEOs is the Adjusted Operating Profit for their respective division.
The four elements are measured separately, such that there could be a payout on one element and not on others.
The KPOs are individual to each executive director.
Each director is typically set around six KPOs to reflect critical business priorities for which they are accountable.
Against each objective, a number of measurable milestone targets are set for the year.
All financial targets and KPOs are approved by the Committee at the beginning of the year.
Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2007 57 For 2008, payment against each financial performance measure will only commence if a threshold of 97.5% of the target is achieved unchanged from 2007.
A maximum bonus of 150% of salary can be earned unchanged from 2007 for substantial out-performance against the demanding annual budget targets and for the achievement of agreed KPOs to an exceptional standard.
AIP Payments for 2007 In assessing the level of bonus payments for 2007, the Committee noted the following underlying performances.
Underlying percentage change over 2006 at constant exchange rates Measure Elsevier LexisNexis Reed Business Reed Elsevier Revenue 6% 7% 6% 6% Adjusted operating profit 10% 12% 8% 10% Payments made for 2007 to be paid in March 2008 % of salary Gerard van fide Aast 594,563 107.5 Mark Armour 666,222 112.9 Sir Crispin Davis 1,267,419 111.6 Erik Engstrom 592,004 98.1 Andrew Prozes $1,051,596 90.0 Patrick Tierney $854,657 79.8 The annual bonuses paid to directors were based on performance against targets set for revenue growth, profit growth, the achievement of the targeted cash flow conversion rate, and performance against key strategic objectives.
The Harcourt Education sale was treated as a non-recurring item and its positive impact was excluded from the financial results for the purposes of the AIP.
The 2007 financial results were very strong, with 6% revenue growth at constant currencies, underlying margins improved by 100 basis points, and adjusted operating profits were up 10% at constant currencies.
The quality of earnings was underpinned by excellent cash flow with 97% of adjusted operating profits converting into cash and higher returns on invested capital.
Overall, earnings at constant currencies grew 12%, Reed Elseviers strongest growth for ten years.
There was strong above market revenue growth in Elsevier, LexisNexis and Reed Business and encouraging margin progress in all three businesses.
In addition the directors were generally assessed as having delivered well against their KPOs with some exceptional performances noted.
Individual KPOs were largely focused against execution and delivery of Reed Elseviers key strategic priorities: development of workflow solutions, improving cost efficiency, and strengthening and refocusing of the Reed Elsevier portfolio.
Overall, this resulted, as shown above, in bonus payments generally above target.
Bonus Investment Plan BIP The Bonus Investment Plan encourages personal investment and ongoing shareholding in Reed Elsevier shares to develop greater alignment with shareholders.
How the BIP works Executive directors and other designated key senior executives may invest up to half of their cash bonus received under the AIP in shares of Reed Elsevier PLC or Reed Elsevier NV.
Subject to continued employment and their retaining these investment shares during a three-year performance period, participants will be awarded an equivalent number of matching shares.
The vesting of the matching shares is subject to the achievement of a performance condition.
For the 2008 awards this has been increased to at least 8% from 6% in 2007 per annum compound growth in the average of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV Adjusted EPS over the three-year performance period.
In the event of a change of control, the vesting of the matching shares is subject to the discretion of the Committee.
Directors remuneration report 58 Directors remuneration report continued BIP new awards made in 2007 In 2007, executive directors invested up to half of their cash bonus received under the AIP for 2006 in shares of Reed Elsevier PLC and or Reed Elsevier NV.
Subject to meeting the performance condition, continued employment and their retaining these investment shares during a three-year performance period, the following numbers of matching shares will vest in 2010.

Therefore the following numbers of shares were transferred in 2007 under the terms of the BIP to the following executive directors.
The performance condition which applied to the vesting of the above awards was 6% per annum compound growth in Adjusted EPS over a three-year performance period.
The same performance condition applies to the unvested 2005, 2006 and 2007 BIP awards.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The Executive Share Option Scheme is designed to provide focus on longer term share price growth and reward the sustained delivery and quality of earnings growth.
How the ESOS works Annual grants of options are made over shares in Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV at the market price on the date of grant.
The maximum size of the total grant to all participants is determined by the compound annual growth in Adjusted EPS over the three years prior to grant.
The Target Grant Pool for all participants is defined with reference to share usage during the base year as follows: Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2007 59 Adjusted EPS growth per annum Target Grant Pool Less than 8% 50% 8% or more 75% 10% or more 100% 12% or more 125% 14% or more 150% ESOS options granted in 2005, 2006 and 2007 were subject to a pre-grant performance condition relating to the Target Grant Pool of 6% to 12% Adjusted EPS growth per annum respectively.
ESOS grants made to executive directors are subject to an annual individual maximum of three times salary.
The awards to individual directors are subject to the following three performance criteria: Test 1 On grant The size of the Target Grant Pool determined as above.
Test 2 On grant Individual performance over the three-year period prior to grant.
Test 3 On vesting Compound Adjusted EPS growth during the three years following grant of at least 8% per annum increased from 6% p. a..
There is no retesting of the performance condition.
ESOS options granted in 2005, 2006 and 2007 are subject to a post-grant performance hurdle of 6% per annum compound Adjusted EPS growth over three years.
Options are exercisable except for defined categories of approved leavers between three and ten years from the date of grant.
In the event of a change of control, the performance test applied under the ESOS for executive directors will be based on an assessment by the Committee of progress against the targets at the time the change of control occurs.
ESOS options new grants made in 2007 Share type Option price No.

The vesting of the award is subject to performance against two measures: Adjusted EPS growth and relative TSR performance over the same three-year performance period.
How the LTIP performance measures work The combined effect of the two performance measures is shown in the following table, which sets out the potential payment as a percentage of the initial target award: LTIP Performance Schedule TSR ranking Upper quartile th Adjusted EPS Growth constant currencies p. a.
The Committee considers the above performance conditions to be tougher than normal UK practice because the TSR element can enhance the reward to participants if, but only if, the Adjusted EPS test has first been achieved, as explained below.

quartile of the comparator group.
For awards made in 2007, the comparator group comprised: The Thomson Corporation, United Business Media, McGraw Hill, Fair Isaac, Reuters Group, John Wiley & Sons, Pearson, DMGT, Wolters Kluwer, Lagardere, ChoicePoint, Dun & Bradstreet, EMAP, WPP, Informa, Taylor Nelson, Dow Jones.
The Committee has full discretion to reduce or cancel awards granted to participants based on its assessment as to whether the EPS and TSR performance fairly reflects the progress of the business having regard to underlying revenue growth, cash generation, return on capital and any significant changes in currency and inflation, as well as individual performance.
Notional dividends accrue on the award during the vesting period i. e. to the extent that the underlying shares vest, notional dividends are paid out as a cash bonus at the end of the three-year performance period.
For the purposes of determining Reed Elseviers TSR performance over the performance period, the averaging period applied is six months prior to the start of the financial year in which the award is made and the final six months of the third financial year of the performance period.
The TSR of Reed Elsevier and each of the comparator companies will be calculated in the currency of its primary listing, which the Committee considers to be the fairest test of managements relative performance.
Reed Elseviers TSR will be taken as a simple average of the TSR of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV.
For awards made in 2006, VNU was also a member of the peer group.
It has been removed for awards made in 2007 as it has become a private company.
In addition to achieving appropriate levels of performance against the two measures, the ultimate vesting of the LTIP award is subject to the executive meeting a shareholding requirement see page 63.
In the event of a change of control, the performance test applied under the LTIP will be based on an assessment by the Committee of progress against the EPS and TSR targets at the time the change of control occurs subject to any rollover that may apply.
LTIP target awards made in 2007 The target awards made to directors in 2007, and which vest in 2010 depending upon the extent to which the performance criteria are met, subject to continued employment and to meeting the shareholding requirement, are as follows: Target award Share type No.

For reference, no LTIP awards were made in 2005 and as a result the next LTIP awards that are scheduled to vest will be for the 2006-08 cycle which will be performance tested following the audited results in February 2009.
Andrew Prozes has waived his right to participate in the 2009 and 2010 LTIP cycles.
Treatment of the special distribution for share-based incentives In January 2008 a special distribution was paid on ordinary shares in Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV.
The special distribution was not attributed to any unvested share-based awards nor to any vested share options that had been granted under the incentive plans.
None of these awards was therefore adjusted as a result of the consolidation of share capital in January 2008.
Other employee share plans UK-based executive directors are eligible to participate in the HMRC approved all-employee UK Savings-Related Share Option Scheme.
US-based directors are eligible to participate in the all-employee US-based Employee Stock Investment Plan EMSIP.
Under the EMSIP, employees are able to purchase Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV securities at the prevailing market price, with commissions and charges being met by Reed Elsevier.
The estimated dilution over a ten-year period from outstanding awards over Reed Elsevier PLC shares under all share-based plans was 6.8% of the Reed Elsevier PLC share capital at 31 December 2007.
This estimate was made before the share consolidation which took place in January 2008.
Retirement benefits policy The Committee reviews policy retirement benefit provisions in the context of the total remuneration for each executive director, bearing in mind his age and service and against the background of evolving legislation and practice in Reed Elseviers major countries of operation.
Base salary is the only pensionable element of remuneration.
Retirement benefits for UK-based executive directors The UK-based executive directors are provided with conventional UK defined benefit pension arrangements targeting two thirds Sir Crispin Davis 45% of salary at a normal retirement age of 60.
The targeted pension is provided through a combination of: the main UK Reed Elsevier Pension Scheme for salary restricted to a cap, determined annually on the same basis as the pre-April 2006 Inland Revenue earnings cap, and Reed Elseviers unfunded unapproved pension arrangement for salary above the cap.
Retirement benefits for non UK-based executive directors The two US-based directors, Andrew Prozes and Patrick Tierney, are covered by a mix of defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements.
In accordance with US legislation, they have no defined retirement age.
Patrick Tierney retired on 30 January 2008 and became fully vested in his pension.
During 2007, the Committee reviewed Andrew Prozes pension provision in the context of relevant market data and determined that he will receive an enhancement to his annual pension of $44,651 for each completed year of service between 1 July 2007 and 1 February 2011, applied on a pro-rata basis.
Prior to 2007 Reed Elsevier paid an annual contribution of 19.5% of salary to Erik Engstroms personal pension plan.
This arrangement ended on 31 October 2007 and with effect from 1 November 2007 he was provided with similar defined benefit pension arrangements as those set out above for UK-based executive directors, targeting two thirds of salary at a normal retirement age of 60.
These arrangements are set out in further detail on page 69.
Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2007 63 Shareholding requirements Participants in the LTIP are required to build up a significant personal shareholding in Reed Elsevier PLC and or Reed Elsevier NV.
The shareholding requirements were increased in 2006, when the new LTIP cycle for 2006-08 was launched.
The new higher requirements must be met prior to any payout under that cycle in March 2009.
The shareholding requirement for the Reed Elsevier Chief Executive Officer was increased to three times salary previously two times and for other executive directors to two times salary previously one and a half times.
These shareholding requirements are a condition of vesting under the LTIP.
The executive directors that participated in the 2004 LTIP grant met and exceeded their shareholding requirements in respect of the 2007 vesting of this award.
Details of directors shareholdings, as at 31 December 2007, are set out on page 75.
Service contracts policy Executive directors are employed under service contracts that provide for a maximum of one years notice.
The contracts neither specify a pre-determined level of severance payment nor contain specific provisions in respect of change in control.
The Committee believes that as a general rule, notice periods should be twelve months and that the directors should, subject to practice within their base country, be required to mitigate their damages in the event of termination.
The Committee will, however, note local market conditions so as to ensure that the terms offered are appropriate to attract and retain top executives operating in global businesses.
The service contracts for executive directors and for approximately 100 other senior executives contain the following provisions: non-compete provisions which prevent them from working with specified competitors, from recruiting Reed Elsevier employees and from soliciting Reed Elsevier customers for a period of 12 months after leaving employment: in the event of their resigning, they will immediately lose all rights to any awards under the LTIP, ESOS and BIP granted from 2004 onwards including any vested but unexercised options: and in the event that they were to join a specified competitor within 12 months of termination, any gains made in the six months prior to termination on the exercise of an LTIP, ESOS and BIP award made from 2004 onwards shall be repayable.
External appointments policy The Committee believes that the experience gained by allowing executive directors to serve as non-executive directors on the boards of other organisations is of benefit to Reed Elsevier.
Accordingly, executive directors may, subject to the approval of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, serve as non-executive directors on the boards of up to two non-associated companies of which only one may be to the board of a major company and they may retain remuneration arising from such appointments.
Gerard van fide Aast became a non-executive director of OCE NV on 1 May 2006 and received a fee of a37,216 25,490 during 2007 a23,342 15,879 during 2006.
Sir Crispin Davis is a non-executive director of GlaxoSmithKline plc and received a fee of 70,000 during 2007 70,000 during 2006.
Andrew Prozes is a non-executive director of the Cott Corporation and received a fee of $62,270 31,135 during 2007 $56,000 30,435 during 2006.
Directors remuneration report 64 Directors remuneration report continued Non-executive directors Policy on non-executive directors fees Reed Elsevier seeks to recruit non-executive directors with the experience to contribute to the board of a dual-listed global business and with a balance of personal skills that will make a major contribution to the boards and their committee structures.
With the exception of Dien fide Boer-Kruyt, who serves only on the supervisory board of Reed Elsevier NV, non-executive directors, including the Chairman, are appointed to the boards of Reed Elsevier Group plc, Reed Elsevier PLC and the supervisory board of Reed Elsevier NV.
Non-executive directors fees reflect the directors membership of the three Reed Elsevier boards.
The primary source for comparative market data is the practice of FTSE50 companies, although reference is also made to AEX and US listed companies.
Non-executive directors, including the Chairman, serve under letters of appointment, do not have contracts of service and are not entitled to notice of, or payments following, retirement from the boards.
Fee levels Non-executive directors receive one annual fee in respect of their memberships of the boards of Reed Elsevier PLC, Reed Elsevier NV and Reed Elsevier Group plc.
The fee paid to Dien fide Boer-Kruyt, who serves only on the supervisory board of Reed Elsevier NV, reflects her time commitment to that company and to other companies within the Reed Elsevier combined businesses.
Non-executive directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending meetings.
They do not receive any performance related bonuses, pension provision, share options or other forms of benefit.
Fees may be reviewed annually, although in practice they have changed on a less frequent basis.
During 2007, a review was conducted of the non-executive director fees in the context of relevant market data.
This was the first time that non-executive directors fees had been reviewed since 2003.
The fee for the Chairman, which was last reviewed in 2005, was also included in this review.
The review indicated that fees paid by Reed Elsevier were no longer competitive with those paid by companies of a comparable size and international scope.
The new fee levels for the non-executive directors, which are effective from 1 January 2008, were reviewed and recommended by the Reed Elsevier Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, and were approved by the Reed Elsevier Group plc board, excluding those board members affected by the recommendations.
The Chairman indicated that his fee should remain unchanged and will therefore remain ata350,000 per annum.
Annual fee rates applicable to non-executive directors and the Chairman are set out in the following table: Annual fee 2008 Annual fee 2007 a Chairman 350,000 a350,000 Non-executive directors 55,000 a75,000 45,000 a65,000 Chairman of: Audit Committee 15,000 a20,000 7,000 a12,000 a Remuneration Committee 15,000 20,000 7,000 a12,000 As a result of the review, the total annual fee payable to Dien fide Boer-Kruyt was increased to a48,000 from a33,800 in 2007.
The Reed Elsevier Chairman chairs the nominations committee and does not receive a separate fee for his role as chairman of that committee.
Non-executive directors donation matching programme In 2007 the Reed Elsevier Group plc board had a charity donation matching programme for non-executive directors.
Under the policy, where a non-executive director donates all or part of their fees to a registered charity, Reed Elsevier may, at its sole discretion, make a matching donation to that charity, provided the charitys objectives are judged to be appropriate and are not political or religious in nature.
David Reid, Strauss Zelnick, Cees van Lede, Mark Elliott and Jan Hommen each donated a proportion of their fees in respect of 2007 to charity and, in accordance with the programme, matching charitable donations were made of 45,000, 44,325, 13,699, 22,500 and 6,849 respectively.
This programme will not be operating in 2008.

Total Shareholder Return TSR graph As required by Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985, the following graphs show the Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV total shareholder return performance, assuming dividends were reinvested.
They compare the Reed Elsevier PLC performance with that achieved by the FTSE 100, and the Reed Elsevier NV performance with the performance achieved by the Euronext Amsterdam AEX Index, over the five-year period from 31 December 2002 to 31 December 2007.
For the five-year period from 31 December 2002, the TSR for Reed Elsevier PLC was 28%, against a FTSE 100 return of 88%.
For Reed Elsevier NV during the same period, TSR was 23% against an AEX Index return of 78%.
As Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV are members of the FTSE 100 and AEX Index respectively, the Committee considers these indices to be appropriate for comparison purposes.

Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2007 67 Service contracts Each of the executive directors has a service contract, as summarised below: Expiry date Contract Date subject to notice period Notice period Subject to: i Gerard van fide Aast 15 November 2000 17 July 2017 12 months English law i Mark Armour 7 October 1996 29 July 2014 12 months English law i Sir Crispin Davis 19 July 1999 19 March 2009 12 months English law i Erik Engstrom 25 June 2004 14 June 2025 12 months English law ii Andrew Prozes 5 July 2000 Indefinite 12 months salary New York law payable for termination without cause ii Patrick Tierney 19 November 2002 Retired on New York law 30 January 2008 i Employed by Reed Elsevier Group plc ii Employed by Reed Elsevier Inc.
The Committee reviewed Erik Engstroms contract and remuneration arrangements during 2007 and altered his terms of employment to parallel UK remuneration arrangements.
This change was made to reflect the current circumstances of his role.
At the request of the Board, Patrick Tierney agreed to defer his planned retirement in early 2007 in order to manage and oversee the sale of Harcourt Education for maximum value.
In order to secure that deferred retirement, the Committee put special retention and incentive arrangements in place which: i rewarded his continuing commitment to Reed Elsevier and ii incentivised him to optimise the Harcourt Education sale proceeds.
Such payments are established practice in the US, and increasingly in Europe.
The successful completion of the Harcourt Education sale on 30 January 2008 resulted in aggregate sale proceeds of $4.95 billion and a special distribution of $4 billion was paid to shareholders.
The Committee consequently awarded Patrick Tierney a sale bonus of $2,917,150 calculated by reference to the excess of the above sale proceeds over a pre-determined target figure.
Furthermore, the Committee recognised his outstanding management contribution to the Harcourt Education performance in meeting financial targets during the extended sale period, and awarded Patrick Tierney a payment of $1,500,000 under the terms of his retention bonus.
As required by Schedule 7A, these payments will be disclosed in full in the audited section of the 2008 remuneration report.
Patrick Tierneys service contract terminated on 30 January 2008 following his retirement from Reed Elsevier.
Any outstanding awards under the ESOS, BIP and LTIP have been treated in accordance with the standard retirement rules under those plans.
Patrick Tierneys shareholding requirements in respect of his share-based awards terminated upon his retirement.
For the avoidance of doubt, no severance payment has applied and he did not receive an increase in base salary from 1 January 2008.
With effect from the date of retirement, he became fully vested in the pension arrangements that have been set out in the current and prior remuneration reports.

Since 1 November 2007 Erik Engstrom has accrued pension benefits at an accrual rate of 1 30th of salary for each year of pensionable service after 1 November 2007, payable at normal retirement age of 60.
On 17 July 2007, Andrew Prozes, a US-based director, vested in an annual pension of US$300,000.
His basic pension continues to accrue at a rate of $42,857 per annum for each completed year of service between 17 July 2007 and 1 February 2011.
In addition, a lifetime benefit is payable to his surviving spouse equal to 50% of his vested and accrued pension at the time of death.
The pension will be reduced by the value of any other retirement benefits payable by Reed Elsevier or any former employer other than those attributable to employee contributions.
In addition, Andrew Prozes will be entitled to receive an enhancement to his annual pension unless he resigns or his employment is terminated by Reed Elsevier for cause prior to 1 February 2011.
Any such enhancement will be equal to $3,720.93 times the number of completed calendar months between 1 July 2007 and the date of termination or, if earlier, 1 February 2011.
For these purposes, his termination date shall be deemed to be 12 months after he ceases employment.
Patrick Tierney completed five years of service in November 2007.
Following his retirement on 30 January 2008, he became entitled to draw his pension of $440,000 p. a.
The pension arrangements for all directors include life assurance cover whilst in employment, an entitlement to a pension in the event of ill health or disability and a spouses and or dependents pension on death.

No contractual entitlement to the pension existed prior to the vesting date.
In addition, the transfer value also reflects the pro-rata increase in his pension entitlement since July 2007 up to 31 December 2007 as set out above.
The latter is subject to reduction in certain circumstances of termination.
Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the guidance note GN11 published by the UK Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
The transfer value in respect of individual directors represents a liability in respect of directors pensions entitlement, and is not an amount paid or payable to the director.
Directors remuneration report 70 Directors remuneration report continued Share-based awards in Reed Elsevier Details of options and restricted shares held by directors in Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV during the period are shown below.
Other than in relation to the application of the retirement rules to Patrick Tierneys share-based awards, there have been no changes in the options or restricted shares held by directors at the date of this report.
The numbers of LTIP shares included in the above table are calculated by reference to an assumed achievement of 10% per annum averaged compound growth in Adjusted EPS and median TSR, which would result in 100% of the award vesting.
Depending on actual Adjusted EPS growth and TSR, the proportion of the award that may vest could be lower or higher.
Options under the SAYE scheme, in which all eligible UK employees are invited to participate, are granted at a maximum discount of 20% to the market price at time of grant.
They are normally exercisable after the expiry of three or five years from the date of grant.
No performance targets are attached to these option grants as it is an all-employee scheme.
