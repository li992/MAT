Long-term incentive plans Thomas Cook Group plc 2007 Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan PSP was approved by the Board prior to the Companys listing and provides for the award of shares to Executive Directors and other senior employees who are selected to participate.

Awards are made annually over shares having a face value at the date of grant of up to 200 per cent of the individuals base salary.
Awards will vest after three years providing the participant is still employed by a company in the Group and to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Good leaver provisions apply in the event of cessation of employment due to death, injury, disability, ill-health, redundancy or retirement.
In the event of a change of control, a proportion of the awards re ecting the proportion of the performance period that has elapsed will vest immediately subject to the achievement of performance conditions as at that time.
The performance conditions and vesting schedule attaching to the outstanding PSP awards are set out in the table below.

This comparator group excludes investment companies.
The comparator group is determined at the date on which PSP awards are made.
Future performance conditions and vesting levels will be attached to awards that are believed to be stretching and provide value to the Executive Directors commensurate with performance achieved and align their interests with those of shareholders.
Co-Investment Plan COIP It is proposed that shareholder approval will be sought for the introduction of a COIP at the Companys AGM in April 2008.
Executive Directors and other senior employees will be eligible to participate in the COIP.
It is currently proposed that a proportion of post tax annual bonus must be deferred under the COIP with the opportunity to voluntarily defer a further amount such deferred amounts to be applied in the purchase of Company shares.
The requirement for compulsory investment under the COIP will cease once a participants shareholding reaches a value equal to 200 per cent of salary this level of shareholding must be maintained.
A matching award of up to 2.5 shares for every 1 share purchased will be made subject to the achievement of EPS linked performance targets, agreed by the Committee, measured over a three year period.
A ratchet mechanism based on Return on Invested Capital achievement ROIC may increase the matching award by up to 40 per cent for superior performance but will reduce the matching award by up to 100 per cent for below target range ROIC performance.
Further details of the COIP will be contained in the Companys AGM notice.
