Remuneration report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors remuneration in the Combined Code.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The Committee operates under the delegated authority of the Board and its Terms of Reference is available from the Company Secretary.
The Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing the pay, benefits and contractual arrangements for the Executive Directors of the Company including the Executive Chairman and other members of the senior management team.
The members of the committee during 2007 were P E Godec Chair, K P Forrest and R J Shepherd who are all independent NonExecutive directors.
Attendance at Committee meetings held during the year and the number of meetings held is set out in the Corporate Governance Statement.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as shareholders, conflicts of interests arising from crossdirectorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the board.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee has appointed Hewitt New Bridge Street formerly known as New Bridge Street Consultants LLP to provide it with independent remuneration advice.
Hewitt New Bridge Street does not provide any other services to the Group.
The Committee also received assistance from T G K Smith, J A Hamilton the former and current Group Finance Directors and P M Levine Executive Chairman, who attended meetings of the Committee as required.
No Director took part in matters relating directly to their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy The Companys policy is to maintain levels of remuneration sufficient to attract, motivate and retain senior executives of the highest calibre who can deliver growth in shareholder value.
Executive remuneration currently consists of basic salary, benefits, annual bonus potential and a long term incentive share plan.
The total remuneration package is structured so that a significant proportion is subject to performance-related elements, thereby creating a strong alignment of interest between executives and shareholders.
The committee has made changes to the remuneration policy for 2008 in recognition that the Company has developed rapidly since its flotation in May 2004 and make it more relevant to its status as a FTSE 250 company from November 2007.
In this regard, a number of changes have been made to ensure that the policy is more compliant with best practice and institutional shareholder guidelines.
Basic salary The Remuneration Committee reviews basic salary annually.
Salaries are set to reflect the particular skills, responsibilities and experience of the individual and to provide a market competitive base salary.
In determining a market competitive amount the Committee takes into account pay levels for similar sized companies in the oil and gas producers sector and in the FTSE 250 and seeks to pay broadly market rates, taking account of experience and expertise of individual executives.
The salaries effective from 1 January 2008 are P M Levine 429,300, S C Hopkinson Roubles 22,406,232, J A Hamilton 200,000, D V Kurochkin Roubles 9,028,483 and E Kirsanova Roubles 8,404,212.
With the exception of J A Hamilton, the Executive Directors are based outside of the UK and this is partly reflected in the salaries paid.
Benefits-in-kind The Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, namely health insurance and life assurance.
For full details of the benefits provided in the 2007 financial year, please refer to the table below.
Pension The policy of the Company is not to make any contributions and to permit individuals to be responsible for their own pensions.
Bonus The Company operates an executive bonus scheme.
The annual bonus is designed to drive and reward excellent short term operating performance.
In line with best practice, the Company has introduced a maximum bonus opportunity for the current and future financial years.
The maximum bonus potential for the 2008 financial year is 150% of salary with any bonus in excess of 100% of salary being paid in shares, the receipt of which is deferred for 2 years and subject to continued employment.
Payment of the annual bonus is based on stretched production 50% and operating costs 50% targets.
There is overriding Committee discretion in exceptional circumstances for bonuses to be scaled back if the Companys HSE Performance is considered unacceptable.
In 2007, the annual bonus plan operated on a discretionary basis.
Actual bonuses awarded for 2007 are shown in the table below.
As part of the terms of his joining package, the Company has agreed to compensate J A Hamilton for the bonus opportunity relating to 2007 which he lost on leaving his previous employer up to an amount of 300,000.
Long term incentive plan In 2006, the Board approved the introduction of a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Awards under the LTIP are subject to continued employment and the satisfaction of performance conditions defined at the time of the award.
No consideration is payable for grant of the awards, with aggregate par value of the shares under award due on exercise.
It is the intention of the Committee that awards granted in 2008 will be subject to a combination of Total Shareholder Return 50% and production 50% performance targets, both measured over a three year performance period.
TSR has been chosen because it aligns the interests of Directors with shareholders by requiring superior total shareholder return performance compared to competitor companies.
Production targets have been chosen because they require a substantial improvement in the Companys operational performance before awards are capable of vesting.
Total shareholder return will be measured relative to a peer group of oil and gas companies.
Awards will vest as to 15% of the total award in the event that median performance is achieved with proportionate vesting up to 50% of the total award if upper quartile performance is achieved.
The production targets will be based upon a sliding scale of barrels of oil per day bopd performance.
Awards will vest as to 15% of the total award in the event that 40,000 bopd is achieved, with proportionate vesting up to 50% if 60,000 bopd is achieved at the end of the performance period.
The Committee will re-assess the performance condition immediately prior to granting the awards to ensure that it remains appropriately challenging.
Going forward, awards will be made within a maximum individual grant limit of up to 150% of salary per annum, save in exceptional circumstances such as a senior executive recruitment when higher awards may be granted.
Share price performance graph The performance graph below sets out Imperials annual total shareholder return since its flotation in April 2004 to 31 December 2007.
This is compared to the FTSE 350 Oil & Gas Index, which was selected as an appropriate comparator because it represents a broad equity market index of which the Company is a member.

In determining bonus payments the Remuneration Committee took into consideration the relative importance of the achievements in the year and the actual contribution of those towards furthering the Companys strategy.
In awarding the 2007 bonuses, the following specific factors were taken into account: i the significant increase in reported reserves, ii achievement of the Groups production target for 2007, iii achievement of strategic targets, including successful admission to the main market and iv the need to motivate key staff following the exceptional external scrutiny during the year.
Benefits in kind represent private health insurance, life insurance, Mr P M Levine receives a housing allowance and as part of his recruitment terms, Mr S C Hopkinson received a location allowance and as part of his recruitment terms, a one-off assistance towards personal legal costs.
Options will vest as to 30% in the event that median performance is achieved with proportionate vesting up to 100% if upper quartile performance is achieved.
The share price on the date of grant was 690 pence per share.
2 The grant to on 1 January 2007 was subject to two performance conditions, 50% of the awards granted are subject to a condition based on the Company's net present value reaching a range of targets by certain future dates, and the remaining 50% of the awards have been subject to a performance condition based on the companys total shareholder return relative to 15 Oil and Gas companies measured between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2009.
The share price on the date of grant was 637 pence per share.
3 These one-off grants in May 2007 were made in recognition of the work done by P M Levine and S C Hopkinson to manage the exceptional external scrutiny on the Company in 2007.
The award is split into three parts: Part A will vest in full on the Normal Vesting Date subject to the Companys barrels of oil production per day reaching at least 10,000 on any day within the financial year of the Company ending 31 December 2007: Part B will vest in full on the Normal Vesting Date subject to the Companys barrels of oil production per day reaching at least 25,000 on any day within the financial year of the Company ending 31 December 2008: Part C will vest in full on the Normal Vesting Date subject to the Companys barrels of oil production per day reaching at least 35,000 on any day within the financial year of the Company ending 31 December 2009: Subject to the achievement of the relevant bopd target, the extent to which such portion of the Award may vest if at all shall further be determined by the extent to which the TSR Condition is met.
The TSR Condition provides that no part of an Award that would otherwise vest may vest unless the Companys total shareholder return performance over the period 17 April 2007 to 16 April 2010 is at least equal to the median within a specified comparator group of 15 oil and gas companies.
For such median performance, 30% of the relevant part may vest, rising on a straight line basis to full vesting for upper quintile total shareholder return performance.
The share price on the date of grant was 1295 pence per share.
4 The grant to J A Hamilton was made as part of his recruitment terms for the value loss he suffered on leaving his previous employer.
This option was granted subject to a performance condition based on the Companys total shareholder return relative to 15 oil and gas companies measured between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2010.
Options will vest as to 30 per cent in the event that median performance is achieved with proportionate vesting up to 100% if upper quartile performance is achieved.
The share price on the date of grant was 1324 pence per share.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 December 2007 was 1550 pence per share and the range during the year was 610.5 pence per share to 1550 pence per share.
Any ordinary shares required to fulfil entitlements under the LTIP are issued as new ordinary shares.
