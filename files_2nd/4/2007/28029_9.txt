An Ordinary Resolution for the approval of this Report will be put to shareholders at the AGM.
The Companys Auditors are required to audit certain of the disclosures provided in this Report.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated in this Report.
The Auditors opinion is included in their report on pages 31 and 32.
Remuneration Responsibilities The Board have resolved that a remuneration committee is not appropriate for a company of this size and nature.
Remuneration responsibilities are part of the Boards responsibilities, to be addressed regularly by the Board as a whole.
All Directors are non-executive and all participate in meetings of the Board at which Directors remuneration is considered.
The Board seeks advice, inter alia, from the Company Secretary, INVESCO Asset Management Limited, when considering the level of Directors fees.
Policy on Directors Remuneration The Boards policy is that the remuneration of non-executive Directors should be fair and reasonable in relation to the time commitment and responsibilities of the Director.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ended 31 March 2007 and subsequent years.
During the year, the Board has reviewed Directors remuneration.
In light of increasing demands and accountability of the current corporate governance and regulatory environment, the Board has recognised the additional workload that each Director has and will continue to experience.
The Board also recognised the need for Directors remuneration to be at a level at which additional Directors of the highest quality can be appointed should it be appropriate to do so.
For these reasons the Board concluded that the Chairmans remuneration be increased from 20,000 to 25,000, the Audit Committee Chairmans from 15,000 to 21,000 and the other Directors from 15,000 to 17,500, with effect from 1 July 2006.
Fees for the Directors are determined by the Board within the limits stated in the Companys Articles of Association.
The maximum currently dictated by the Companys Articles of Association is 150,000.
The Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other incentives or benefits.
Directors Service Contracts It is the Boards policy that none of the Directors has a service contract.
The terms of the Directors appointment provide that a Director shall retire and be subject to election at the first AGM after appointment and subject to re-election at least every three years thereafter.
The terms also provide that a Director may be removed from office without notice and that no compensation will be due on leaving office.
