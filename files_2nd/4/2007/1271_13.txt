Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and has been approved by both the Remuneration Committee and the Board.
The committee is responsible for all matters relating to the remuneration arrangements for executive directors, and senior management below Board level.
Membership of the committee is limited to the non-executive directors.
The membership in 2007 was as follows: N P Buckles chairman from 5 September 2007 Sir Richard Broadbent from 5 September 2007 S G Batey A V M Palmer chairman until 5 September 2007 when she retired from the committee During the year, the committee met on three occasions: details of the attendance at meetings appear in the Corporate Governance report on page 58.
Remuneration policy The objective of the Boards remuneration policy is to recruit and retain high quality directors and managers by providing competitive rewards based on the achievement of targets which are aligned to the companys strategic goals and with returns to shareholders.
The committee has established and continues to maintain with independent advice a peer pay comparator group comprising a selection of FTSE 250 companies from the transport and other sectors of a similar size and complexity to that of the company.
The committee benchmarks remuneration with the peer group, subject to the achievement of performance targets.
Performance targets selected by the committee are subject to periodic review to ensure continued congruence with the groups strategic goals.
Remuneration structure a Base salary Each of the executive directors is paid a basic annual salary which is reviewed in January each year.
Basic Salary Basic Salary 1 January 2008 1 January 2007 000 pa 000 pa D R Martin 480 465 S P Lonsdale 312 302 S J Clayton 280 271 b Performance related bonus Each of the executive directors has the opportunity to earn an annual bonus of up to 100 per cent of basic annual salary of which 70 per cent of the potential award is determined by group financial performance, with the balance being determined by the performance of each director against qualitative objectives agreed at the beginning of the year.
With regard to the group financial performance element, the target is group earnings per share before goodwill impairment and intangible asset amortisation calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and adjusted for exceptional items EPS.
The committee reviews annually the EPS target to ensure that it remains appropriate in the context of the groups strategy and the delivery of sustained shareholder value.
For 2007 the EPS element of the bonus arrangement was structured as follows: EPS Target Bonus as a pence per cent of Basic Salary 42.0 Nil 44.5 40 47.0 70 The qualitative element of directors bonus arrangements focuses on delivery of specific elements of strategy, environmental issues, organisational and management goals and the development of a high calibre management team.
49 Directors Remuneration Report continued As a consequence of the EPS performance of the group for the year ended 31 December 2007 46.5 pence, and the performance of each director against the qualitative targets agreed at the beginning of the year, bonus payments were made to each executive director in February 2008 as follows: Bonus for Year Ended 31 Dec 2007 2006 D R Martin 425,000 246,800 S P Lonsdale 265,700 160,950 S J Clayton 243,900 136,500 934,600 544,250 The non-executive directors do not participate in the performance related bonus scheme and no change to this policy is envisaged.
c Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a share-based plan and comprises a conditional award of shares of a value equivalent to 200 per cent of the executive directors basic salary as at the date of an award: awards are normally made each March following the announcement of the groups preliminary results for the preceding financial year.
The vesting of the shares conditionally awarded in 2005 had as the performance measurement period the three years ended 31 December 2007.
The Total Shareholder Return target was met, however the EPS performance target required in order to trigger vesting was 52.6 pence.
The actual EPS performance was 46.5 pence and, as a consequence, none of the shares conditionally awarded in 2005 will vest and the awards have therefore lapsed.
Since 2006, awards have comprised a blend of two elements with each element providing the opportunity for each executive director to earn up to one half of the conditional share award.
Each element operates as follows: i Total Shareholder Return element TSR This element provides the opportunity to earn up to one half of the initial conditional award and is based on the groups TSR performance when ranked against the TSR performance of those companies comprising a peer comparator group.
For this purpose the peer comparator group consists of companies excluding the company and investment companies whose shares comprise the FTSE 250 at the beginning of each three-year measurement period.
Performance is measured over three consecutive financial years 1 January 31 December, the first year of the measurement period being the year in which the conditional share award is made.
In order for shares to vest under this element, the TSR performance of the group must achieve, as a minimum, the median TSR performance of the peer comparator group: achievement of the median position will generate the vesting of 25 per cent of this element of the award, and this will increase on a linear basis to 100 per cent of this element on the achievement of upper quartile performance.
The TSR performance is independently calculated and verified by Alithos Limited.
ii The EPS element This element also provides the opportunity to earn up to one half of the initial conditional award: vesting of the shares is on a linear scale with 10 per cent vesting if EPS increases to a level which is four per cent per annum in excess of the increase in the Retail Prices Index over the three-year measurement period: vesting will increase on a linear scale to a maximum of 100 per cent of this element on EPS performance achieving or exceeding 13 per cent per annum in excess of the growth in the Retail Price Index.
The company operates share retention guidelines which require each executive director to retain 50 per cent of any vested shares until such time as a holding equivalent in value to basic annual salary has been achieved.
Awards made prior to 2006 limited the market value of any conditional share award to 100 per cent of the directors basic salary as at the date of the award.
Vesting was dependent on both the TSR performance when compared with that of the peer comparator group and also the groups EPS performance when compared with the movement in the Retail Price Index.
Irrespective of TSR performance, an award was not capable of vesting if the EPS performance target was not met.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the LTIP, and no change to this policy is envisaged.

A review conducted at the end of 2007 indicated that the fee levels in comparator companies had increased markedly and it was decided therefore to implement increases in January 2008, in the fees paid to the non-executive directors, as follows: Basic Additional Annual Fee Annual Fee Total Sir Richard Broadbent 150,000 - 150,000 S G Batey 40,000 10,000 50,000 N P Buckles 40,000 5,000 45,000 A V M Palmer 40,000 5,000 45,000 S G Williams 40,000 5,000 45,000 310,000 25,000 335,000 The non-executive directors take no part in the process for establishing their individual fee level.
Under the terms of the Articles of Association the fees payable to the non-executive directors are limited to 400,000 per annum in the aggregate: this level was established following approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 23 April 2004, and the Articles permit the directors to increase this cap annually in line with the increase in the index of UK wage inflation.
As at 31 December 2007, in accordance with the indexation provisions, the cap on the aggregate level of non-executive directors fees was 456,800.
Each non-executive director has been appointed for a fixed-term not exceeding three years and those appointments are normally renewable, with the agreement of both parties, for terms not exceeding three years.

No future executive director external appointees to the Board will be eligible for a final salary based pension arrangement, but instead will receive a cash contribution equal to 25 per cent of basic salary.
i Service contracts Each of the three executive directors has a service contract dated 19 April 2006: the contracts are subject to twelve months notice from the company and six months notice from the director.
Each contract contains covenants restricting the ability of the director, within a period of six months from termination, from competing with the company.
The contracts make specific provision with regard to termination payments which are quantified as the sum of: i The directors basic pay at the date of termination: ii The amount of bonus estimated to be payable in respect of the year in which notice is served, but in any event capped at maximum of 40 per cent of basic pay: and iii The value of the benefits in kind.
Additionally, in the case of termination by the company, the company will seek to procure that the director is credited with an additional 12 months service in his respective pension scheme.
Should the director terminate the contract within six months of a change of control of the company he will receive a termination payment equal to 50 per cent of the termination payment described above.
j External Board appointments The Board will permit executive directors to accept one appointment outside the company.
Before accepting such appointments the director s involved must receive the prior approval of the Board.
In considering such cases the Board will always satisfy itself, as far as is possible, that such appointments will not detract from the executive directors expected contribution to the company, nor that such appointment will create any conflict of interest: any fees earned by an executive director in such a capacity will be assigned to the company.
