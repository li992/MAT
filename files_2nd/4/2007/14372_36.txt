The terms of reference, which are available on the Companys website at www.
com, enable the Committee to obtain its own external advice on any matter, at the Companys expense.
During the year, the Committee received information from a number of independent consultants appointed by the Company: Deloitte & Touche LLP on a broad range of remuneration issues:  LLP on long-term incentiveplan comparative performance and Towers Perrin and Hay Group on salary data when consideringbase salaries of executive directors and executive officers.
Deloitte & Touche LLP has provided taxation advice and  LLP has provided consultancy services to the Group whilst Towers Perrin and Hay Grouphave notprovided anyadditionaladvice.
Remuneration Policy The remuneration policy, as approved by the Remuneration Committee, is designed to ensure that remuneration is sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and executive officers of a calibre that meets the Groups needs to achieve its business objectives.
Remuneration includes base pay and benefits which are targeted at median competitive levels for acceptable performance, and incentive schemes which are designed to motivate and reward for outperformance.
Remuneration packages are benchmarked by reference to appropriate UK and US companies and where relevant other local markets.
Individual remuneration levels are based on measurable performance against fair and open objectives and there are no automatic pay adjustments unless required by law or local protocol.
Major changes to the remuneration policy are discussed with the .
Reviewof Remuneration Policy During 2007, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration policy and identified a number of changes which will better support the achievement of the Groups key business drivers: and will help the retention of high performing senior executives, particularly in the context of the US talent market.
The changes and the revised policy for 2008 are set out below.
In accordance with Smith and Nephews normal practice, all of the major changeshave been discussed withthe Groups .
For2008, the followingchangeshave been made to executive : TheCo-Investment Plan willnolongerbe operated except as it relates to the 2007bonus.
A new Deferred Bonus Plan will be introduced for 2008.
Annual bonus opportunities at target level and above have been adjusted to reflect both the cessation of the Groups Co-Investment Plan and the 61 Remuneration Report requirement that a portion of executives bonuses will be compulsorily deferred.
The cash bonus opportunity remainsunchanged.
Bonusdeferral willonlyapply to bonusawards earned at target level andabove.
The Performance Share Plan PSP has been changed to enable more effective use of performance measures.
New targets will apply from 2008 onwards, which re-balance the focus on strong financial  incentivisethe achievementof .
Shareholder approval is being sought at the AGM on 1 May 2008 to increase the limit of the initial market value of awards for executive directors made under the PSP to 150% of a participants basic salary.
Were upper decile total shareholder return TSR achieved, the maximum market value of an award at grant would increase to 225% of salary.
This amendment is necessary to implement the change of policy which was announcedinthe 2006 RemunerationReport.
The level of shareholding that executive directors are required to build up and maintain has been doubled to 200% ofsalary, inorderto strengthen furtherthe linkbetween executives andshareholders interests.
The Principal Components of Remuneration  forthe  for2008 comprisesthe followingelements: Basicsalary: Annualbonuswitha deferred element underthe Deferred BonusPlan: Long-termincentives,  Plan awards and share options:and Pensionentitlement and otherbenefits a Basic Salary and Benefits Basic salary reflects the responsibility of the position and individual performance.
Salaries are reviewed annually witheffect from1 April eachyear.
Thebasic salaries of the executive directorsas at 1January2008are: DavidJ.
The Remuneration Committee considers any pension consequences and costs to the  salary increases forexecutive  officers.
b Performance Related Bonus and DeferredBonus Plan For executive directors, the Group operates an annual bonus scheme.
The scheme is designed to encourage outstanding performance.
In 2008, 75% of the annual bonus will be based on annual growth in EPSA and 25% willbe based onpersonal objectives underpinnedby asset velocitymeasurements.
To encourage executives to build-up and maintain a significant shareholding, a new Deferred Bonus Plan will operate from 2008.
Under the plan, one third of any bonus earned at target level or above by an executive director will be compulsorily deferred into shares which vest, subject to continued employment, in equal annual tranches over three years i. e. one third each year.
No further performance conditions will apply to the deferred shares.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for executive directors in 2008 will be increased from 100% to 150% of annual salary, of which one third will be compulsorily deferred.
The maximum cash bonus opportunity therefore remains unchanged at 100% of salary.
The target bonus award for 2008 will be increased from 65% to 100% of salary.
For executive officers with corporate responsibilities, the 2008 annual bonus plan will be linked to EPSA growth, and personal objectives.
For those executive officers with specific business unit responsibilities, targets will be linked to EPSA growth, sales growth, trading profit and margin of their respective business unit and personal objectives.
One quarter of the annual bonus earned, if at target level or above, will be compulsorily deferred into shares, which vests in equal annual tranches over three years, subject to continued employment.
No further awards willbe made underthe voluntary2004 Co-Investment Plan.
For 2007, for executive directors, the annual bonus targets related 75% to annual growth in EPSA and 25% was based on personal objectives underpinned by asset velocity measurements.
On this basis, the actual bonus earned in 2007 by executive directors is shown in the table on page 68 and ranged from 88% to 91% of annual basicsalary.
62 c Long-TermIncentives i Performance Share Plan Following the review of remuneration policy, in 2008 the Remuneration Committee has amended the operation of the Performance Share Plan to make more effective use of the performance measures that apply to the awards.
The new performance measures are aligned with Smith & Nephews growth strategy, and balance an enhanced focus on strong financial performance, with the alignment of executives and shareholder interests through  opportunitylinkedto the creationof shareholdervalue.
From 2008 onwards, annual awards over shares made under the 2004 Performance Share Plan will only vest if pre-defined levels of EPSA growth are achieved.
The number of shares that are delivered may be increased if superiortotal  achieved.
The Remuneration Committee considers the proposed targets to be suitably stretching to incentivise achievement of excellent financial performance.
For future awards, the Remuneration Committee will continue to select performance measures in respect of each annual award at the level it considers appropriately stretching given the conditionsinwhichthe Companyis operating.
The 2008 awards will vest subject to EPSA growth measured over the three-year performance period, based on the : 25% of the award will vest if growth in EPSA over the three-year period ending 31 December 2010 is 43% i. e. 13% per .
50% of the award will vest if growth in EPSA over the three-year period ending 31 December 2010 is 64% i. e. 18% per .
100% of the award will vest if growth in EPSA over the three-year period ending 31 December 2010 is 82% i. e. 22% per .
In order to drive enhanced shareholder value and maintain close alignment of executives and shareholders interests, the number of shares delivered to executives may be increased, subject to the achievement of superior TSR measured against the majorcompaniesinthe medicaldevices industry.
The TSR of the Groups shares as listed on the London Stock Exchange will be measured over the performance period and compared with the TSR of the medical devices comparator companies using a common currency.
If the Companys TSR is positioned above median, the number of vested shares made available to the individual followingthe achievementof the EPSA targets willbe increasedby a multiplieras follows: TSR ranking within comparator group Multiplier Medianorbelow.......................................................... Nomultiplier i. e. 1.0 Upper quartile............................................................ 1.3x Upper decileorabove...................................................... 1.5x  ona straight linebasis between the above points.
TSR will be measured relative to a tailored sector peer group of medical devices companies.
The comparator companies in the benchmark comparator group for the 2008 awards which the Committee considers appropriate tothe Companyare: Arthrocare KCI Bard Medtronic Baxter NobelBiocare BectonDickenson Nuvasive BostonScientific Orthofix Coloplast Group Stryker Conmed St Jude Medical Covidien Synthes-Stratec Edwards LifeSciencesCorp WrightMedical Johnson& Johnson Zimmer 63 Remuneration Report In 2007, the Remuneration Committee decided to make awards to executive directors under the Performance Share Plan with a market value of 150% of basic salary.
As this was in excess of the normal individual limit of 100% of salary, these awards were made under Rule 9.4.
This was considered necessary to deliver market competitive remuneration and retain executives, particularly in the context of pressures faced from the US medicaldevices industrytalent market.
In order to maintain the competitive positioning of the remuneration policy, shareholder approval is being sought at the AGM to be held on 1 May 2008 to increase the individual limit of the initial market value of awards under the plan for executive directors to 150% of basic salary.
Subject to shareholder approval, for 2008, the initial market value of awards made to executive directors will be equivalent to 150% of their basic annual salary.
The initialmarket value of the awards made to executive officers will be equivalent to75% .
Thesevalues are before the applicationof the TSR multiplier.
The Groups TSR performance and its performance relative to the comparator group is independently monitored and reported to the Remuneration Committee by Deloitte & Touche LLP.
Awards made in 2007 were divided equally into two tranches, so as to measure TSR relative to the FTSE 100 and major companies in the medical devices industry respectively.
In relation to either tranche, if the Group ranks at median, 25% of the award of that th tranche will vest and if the Group is at the 75 centile then all of the shares of that tranche will vest.
Between the th th median and 75 centile, the shares will vest on a straight-line basis.
If the Group is above the 75 centile, then the number of shares increases above the award on a straight-line basis up to a maximum of 150% of the award th ifthe Groupisrankedat orabove the 90 centile.
th For awards made in 2005, 17% vested as the Company was ranked 77 in the FTSE 100 comparator group and th 9 inthe medicaldevices group.
ii ExecutiveShare Options Share options will continue to be granted under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan and 2001 UK Approved Plan for executive directors.
Under the 2004 Plan, the maximum market value of options which may be granted each year is equivalent to the basic annual salary of the participant.
Share options are exercisable uptoten years from the date of grant and are only exercisable if graduated target levels of growth in EPSA over the three-year performance period are achieved, beginning with that in which the share option is granted.
Options granted under the 2001 UK Approved Plan up to a value of 30,000 will form part of the overall grant.
Performance conditionsforthese awards willbe the same as forthe 2004 Plan.
The target levels of performance are set by the Remuneration Committee for each grant.
For 2008, the performance targets for executive directors will be: 25% of the options will vest if growth in EPSA over the threeyear period ending 31 December 2010 is 43% i. e. 13% compounded annually with 50% vesting if such growth is 64% i. e. 18% compounded annually.
Only if growth in EPSA over that period exceeds 82% i. e. 22% compounded annually will all of the options vest.
Share options will vest pro rata on a straight-line basis if growth inEPSA isbetween these levels.
For awards made in 2007, 25% of the options will vest if growth in EPSA over the three-year period ending 31 December 2009 is 26% i. e. 8% compounded annually with 50% vesting if such growth is 40% i. e. 12% compounded annually.
Only if growth in EPSA over that period exceeds 64% i. e. 18% compoundedannually will all of the options vest.
Share options will vest pro rata on a straight-line basis if growth in EPSA is between these levels.
To be aligned with practice in the US market, from 2008 US-based executives below executive director level will participate in the 2001 US Share Plan, which vests in equal annual tranches over three years, and will not be subject to performance conditions.
Awards granted to UK senior executives below executive director level will be granted under the 2001 plan, which vests after three years subject to the achievement of appropriate EPSA targets.
For options granted in 2005 under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan, 40% of the awards vested as EPSA growthwas 39% overthe three year performanceperiod.
iii Co-investmentPlan The 2004 Co-Investment Plan enabled executive directors and senior executives to take part of their annual bonus in the form of shares.
Under the Plan, the participant elected the level of bonus to be used for this purpose up to a maximum of one half of annual gross bonus capped at 20% of basic annual salary.
The net amount of the gross amountelected was thenused to purchaseshares.
64 For the March 2008 award based on executives 2007 elections, and provided such shares are held for three years and the participant remains employed within Smith & Nephew, the participant will be entitled to matching shares if the Company achieves a target level of growth in EPSA over that three year period of 60% i. e. 17% compounded annually.
At this level, the participant is entitled to one matchingshare for every share acquired out of the gross equivalent amount of the net bonus used to acquire shares.
If growth in EPSA is 70% i. e. 19% compounded annually or more, the participant is entitled to two matching shares for each share acquired out of the gross equivalent amount of the net bonus used to acquire shares.
There is no sliding scale or pro rata vesting ofmatchingawards between these performancelevels, noris there anyretesting.
For the 2007 award, provided such shares are held for three years and the participant remains employed within the Group, the participant will be entitled to matching shares if the Group achieves a target level of growth in EPSA over that three-year period of 40% ie.
At this level the participant is entitled to one matchingshare for every share acquiredoutof the gross equivalent amountofthe net bonusused toacquire shares.
If growth in EPSA is 50% or more the participant is entitled to two matching shares for each share acquired out of the gross equivalent amount of the net bonus applied to shares.
There is no sliding scale or pro rata vesting of matching awards between these performance levels, nor is there any retesting.
For awards made in 2005, no matching shares were awarded as EPSA growth over the three year performance period of 39% was belowthe target of 48%.
iv Restricted stock awards The issue of restricted stock to senior executives is considered in exceptional circumstances subject to the approval of the Remuneration Committee.
During the year a restricted stock award was made to David J. Illingworth on his appointment as Chief Executive.
This award was made under Rule 9.4.
2 of the Listing Rules and will vest on 1 January 2010 subject to Earnings Improvement Programme performance targets.
Any vested shares fromthis award willnotbe pensionable.
d  Senior executives are expected to buildand maintaina personal equitystake inthe Company.
Executive directors are required to accumulate a personal holding equivalent to 200% of basic salary within five years and executive officersare requiredto accumulatea personal holdingequivalent to 150% of basicsalary withinfive years.
e Pensions Pensions UK UK based executive directors and executive officers have a normal retirement age of 62.
Those commencing employment after 2002 either participate in the defined contributionplan to whicha  30% of base salary is made or have a non-pensionable, non-bonusable salary supplement of 30% of base salary.
Death in service cover of seven times salary of which four times is provided as a lump sum is provided on death.
Pensions US US based executive directors and executive officers participate in either the defined benefit Smith & Nephew US Pension Plan or the defined contribution US Savings Plan 401 k Plus.
New executives would enter the US Savings Plan 401 k Plus.
Under the US Pension Plan, pensions accrue at an annual rate of approximately one-sixty second of final pensionable salary up to a limit based on service of 60% of final pensionable salary.
The plan also provides for a spouses pension at the rate of one half of the members pension on death.
Normal retirement age under the plan is 65.
For executives in the defined benefit US pension plan a supplementary plan is used to enable benefits to be payable from age 62 without reduction for early retirement.
A supplementary defined contribution plan is used to compensate for the earnings cap imposed by the US Internal Revenue Code  benefits.
Other Long-TermIncentive Plans The Performance Share Plan adopted in 2004 replaced the long-term incentive plan LTIP established in 1997 for executive directors and executive officers.
The last award was 2003 and vested in 2006.
No further awards will be made under this LTIP.
However, as every encouragement is given to executive directors and senior managers to build up a significant shareholding in the Group, participants in the LTIP who have not left the Group will, at the fifth and seventh anniversaries of the date of the original award, be awarded one additional share for every five soretained.
65 Remuneration Report Under the 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan and the 2001 US Share Plan the Remuneration Committee determines the maximum value of options to be granted to executives byreference tomultiples of salary forthose executives noteligibleforthe 2004share plan.
With the exception of the 2001 US Share Plan, the exercise of these options is subject to EPSA growth of not less than RPI plus 3% per annum, on average, in a period of three consecutive years.
From 2005, there is no retesting of the performance conditions.
Performance conditions were selected to be in line with market practice at the time.
The awards made in 2005 will vest in 2008 as EPSA growth over the three year performance period exceeded the RPI 3% target.
Options granted under the 2001 US Share Plan, inlinewithUS marketpractice, are not subject to performance targets but are exercisable cumulatively up to a maximum of 10% after one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years.
For awards made in 2008 and thereafter, options granted under the 2001 US Share Plan will vest in equal tranches over three years to keep in line with senior executives.
Awards of restricted stock under the 2001 US Share Plan are not subject to performance targets but are subject to the executive remaining with the Group for a specified period, normally twoyears.
Executive share options under all schemes are not offered at a discount to the market value at the time of grant andwouldvest ona changeincontrol.
UK executive directors and executive officers are eligible to participate in the Smith & Nephew Employee Share Option Scheme Sharesave and US executive directors and executive officers are eligible to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Total Reward Composition The general statement on Remuneration Policy on page 61 sets out the approach taken when setting different elements of pay.
In 2007, excluding pension entitlements, the composition of remuneration for both David J. Illingworth and Adrian Hennah was: base pay fixed 20%, annual bonus variable 20%, and long-term incentives variable 60%.
The following table provides a comparison of variable remuneration of executive directors and executive officers and business unit management shown as a percentage of salary for 2007.
Except for the annual bonus, the componentsare measured overa three year period.

Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee approved that, for the appointment of David J. Illingworth as Chief Executive, the notice period on appointment would effectively be 24 months, reducing to 12 monthsonthe expiry of the initialterm.
David J. Illingworth, appointed to the Board of Directors in February 2006, has a service agreement dated June nd 2007, the date of his appointment as Chief Executive which expires on his 62 birthday in 2015.
Adrian Hennah, appointed to the Board of Directors in June 2006, has a service agreement dated June 2006whichexpires onhis nd 62 birthday in 2019.
The service agreement for David J. Illingworth is terminable by the Company on not more than 24 months notice reducing to 12 months after the initial term.
Adrian Hennahs service agreement is 66 terminable by the Company on 12 months notice.
The agreements are terminable by the executive director on six months notice.
There is no enhancement of termination rights on a change of control of the Group.
During 2007 termination of the contract by the Group, except for cause, would have effectively entitled David J. Illingworth to 24 months basic salary reducing to 12 months after the initial 24 months and Adrian Hennah to 12 months basic salary plus a bonus at target of 50%, a contribution to reflect the loss of pension benefits, an amount to cover other benefits and a time apportionment of the 2004 senior executive share plans entitlement.
The Group has a policy of not rewarding failure and the Committee will review all circumstances in determining whether to invoke mitigation.
Sir Christopher ODonnell, whose service agreement was due to expire in October 2008, retired in July 2007.
External  Currently, neither of the executive directors is a non-executive director of another company.
Such appointments would be subject to the approval of the Nominations Committee and are restricted to one appointment for each executive director.
 Non-executive directors do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment.
Non-executive directors are normally appointed for three terms of three years terminable at will, without notice by either the Group or the director and without compensation.
The Chairman has a six month notice period.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Nominations Committee which aims to set fees that are competitive with other companies of equivalent size and complexity.
Non-executive directors are expected to accumulatea personal holdinginthe Companyequivalent to theirannualbasicfee, withinthree years.
The Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and the Senior Independent Director receive an extra 8,500 for their additional responsibilities.
In 2007, Dr. Rolf Stomberg waived his extra fee entitlement due to him as Senior Independent Director.
Fee arrangements were amended in 2007 whereby an additional fee of 3,000 is paid to non-executive directors each time inter-continental travel is necessary to attend company business meetings.
