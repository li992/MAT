70409 pre 2 30 5 07 20:53 Page 33 Annual report and accounts 200733 Remuneration Report This Directors Remuneration Report the Report has been prepared in compliance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
Further, subject to certain exceptions which are explained in the Directors Report on pages 23 to 25, the Company complies with the Combined Code.
A resolution to approve the Report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting AGM.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to members on parts of the Report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations.
The Report is therefore divided into separate sections of unaudited and audited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Remuneration Committee Overall tasks The main duties of the Remuneration Committee the Committee are to: determine, on behalf of the Board, the policy for engagement and remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer and the executive directors and to report to shareholders on the policy: implement the remuneration policy for executive directors: monitor the remuneration policy for senior executives below Board level: and ensure that remuneration is aligned with business strategy and shareholder interests and that a constructive dialogue on remuneration matters is maintained with major institutional investors.
During the year, the Committee reviewed its operation and concluded that it has continued to provide rigorous independent review of the development of executive incentive schemes within the Group.
The conclusion of the review was that the depth of knowledge of the members of the Committee and of the Committees advisors, together with their understanding of the Groups business, was sufficiently robust to ensure that the Groups executive incentive arrangements are designed and operated so as to increase shareholder value.
The Committee continues to keep all aspects of the Groups share based incentive schemes under review.
It confirms that their operation throughout the year remained satisfactory and that the remuneration policy expressed in the Report remains appropriate to the Groups current requirements.
Constitution and operation The Committee is comprised solely of independent non-executive directors who have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the Committees decisions.
Throughout the year, the Committee was led by Mr T J C Eggar as Chairman and Mr R F Boyes and Mr T M Lazenby served as members.
During the year, the Committee noted the result of the vote on the Directors Remuneration Report at the AGM in 2006.
If a major shareholder were to vote against the adoption of the Directors Remuneration Report at a future AGM, the views of that shareholder would be sought by the Committee, to assist it in determining future remuneration policy.
During the year, the Committee met five times and all members were present at each meeting.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Groups website www.
com and are available upon request from the company secretary.
During the year, the Committee and the Board each reviewed the terms of reference and concluded that they continued to be suitable for the Committees purposes.
Advice The Committee has access to the advice and services of external professional advisors.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC continued to act as advisors to the Committee throughout the year and, during the year, NBSC advised the Committee on remuneration issues.
During the year, NBSC provided no other services to the Company and had no other connection with the Company.
70409 pre 2 30 5 07 20:53 Page 34 34 Annual report and accounts 2007 Remuneration Report continued During the year, the Chief Executive Officer Mr G F Coutts and the company secretary until 28 November 2006, Mr A M Dand: thereafter, Mr L J W McAlister provided advice to the Committee that materially assisted in its consideration of remuneration matters.
No advisor gave advice in relation to his own remuneration.
The Committee refers to external comparisons provided by NBSC and to other publicly available information when reaching its decisions.
During the year, Jardine Lloyd Thompson, the Groups pension advisors, were available to provide advice on directors retirement benefits.
Policy The aim of the remuneration policy is to attract capable executives and create a flexible, performance orientated reward structure to ensure their continued motivation and retention.
In addition to the executive directors, the policy also applies to certain senior executives below Board level.
The Committee ensures that remuneration of executive directors and senior executives is aligned with shareholders interests as well as the Groups performance, taking into account the markets in which the Group operates and pay and conditions elsewhere within the Group.
The remuneration of executive directors comprises salary, annual bonus, car allowance, short-term incentive, long-term equity incentives, pension benefits and limited benefits in kind.
During the year, the Committee continued to review the balance of the elements of the executive directors reward packages, to ensure that a substantial proportion of their remuneration would be performance related and that performance targets for short-term incentives remained appropriate and stretching.
The Committee confirms that during the year there were no exceptional circumstances which required remuneration to be set outside the terms of the policy.
Elements of remuneration Base salaries Base salaries payable to executive directors are reviewed annually by the Committee, and when there is a change to an individuals role or responsibilities, and are the only element of remuneration that is pensionable.
Where appropriate, guidance on setting base salaries is provided by independent consultants using external market data.
The Committee sets pay scales by reference to UK based listed companies and not to its US based international competitors.
As the Company has no direct UK peer group, the Committee has considered the pay practices of companies with a similar market capitalisation across all sectors.
Short-term incentive Payment of all incentives is subject to the approval of the Committee and no executive director has a contractual right to an incentive.
Each executive director is eligible to participate in an annual performance based bonus scheme, which also applies to other senior executives in the Group.
Annual bonuses are capped at 100% of basic salary and are subject to achievement of a specific financial objective and of specific personal objectives set by the Committee.
In addition, the Committee may award further discretionary bonuses in exceptional circumstances.
The financial objective requires the Group to achieve a business budget earnings per share EPS target, the amount of bonus being determined on a sliding scale.
Common personal objectives for all directors include the active implementation of the Groups published strategy, together with specific items relevant to the individual directors role.
As all members of the Board are behind the drive to maintain safe working practices, the achievement of a safe performance, when assessed against the Groups safety plan, is included in each executive directors personal goals.
In order that the interests of directors are as closely aligned as possible with those of shareholders, the Committee maintains a policy that each executive director should invest a minimum of 25% of his bonus in the shares of the Company each year, with the aim of achieving a minimum investment equal in value to 100% of his annual salary over the longer-term.
70409 pre 2 31 5 07 18:32 Page 35 Annual report and accounts 200735 Long-term incentive Policy The Committee reviews its policy with regard to share incentive schemes for the executive directors and the senior management team on an annual basis.
In line with Association of British Insurers ABI guidelines, it aims to grant share incentive awards on an annual basis.
Performance Share Plan PSP The executive directors currently participate in the PSP, under the rules of which selected individuals may receive a conditional award of shares, released after three years subject to the achievement of market based performance conditions considered over the same period and subject to continued employment.
Annual awards are limited to 100% of an executives annual salary, although this may, if required, be exceeded within the first 12 months of an executive joining the Company, subject to an overriding limit of 200% of base salary.
Awards during the year In the year to 31 March 2007, awards equal to 80% of basic salary were made to executive directors under the PSP.
Performance condition The performance condition attached to the awards made under the PSP on 6 July 2006 was an EPS growth target.
Specifically, no part of an award may vest unless the Companys EPS growth over the three year performance period equates to growth of at least Retail Price Index RPI 6% per annum.
For such performance, 25% of the award may vest, rising on a straight line basis to full vesting for RPI 15% per annum performance.
Other terms Awards made under the PSP are expected to remain within the ABIs dilution limits for share plans of 5% in 10 years for all executive schemes and 10% in 10 years for all share plans.
In the event of the participant ceasing to be employed in the Group for any of the reasons specified in the PSP rules, or on a change of control, awards will vest on a time apportioned basis but only to the extent that the performance condition has been met.
In accordance with ABI guidelines, participants who retire during the performance period will be required to wait until the normal vesting period of three years has been completed, when performance will be assessed.
Vesting during the year On 8 August 2006, the PSP 2003 award vested at 52.90%.
The performance condition attached to the award was a measurement of the Companys total shareholder return TSR against a defined comparator group of companies comprising the constituents of the FTSE Mid 250 Index, excluding investment trusts.
Employee Share Trust At 1 April 2006, the Employee Share Trust held 155,720 ordinary shares of the Company, to satisfy the future vesting of awards under the Groups share incentive schemes.
During the period 1 April 2006 to 1 August 2006, the Trust transferred 155,720 shares in order to satisfy vesting of awards between those dates.
Between 1 August 2006 and 31 March 2007, a total of 131,330 shares were subscribed for by the Trustee and allotted by the Company in order to satisfy vesting of awards.
As at 31 March 2007, the number of shares held by the Trust was nil.
Vesting of awards will continue via the Trust and the Company does not intend that the Trust hold any further shares.
The Committee confirms that shares held in the Trust have not in the past, and, if relevant, will not in the future, be voted at any shareholder meeting.
Employee Sharesave scheme The Company operates a Sharesave scheme, a savings related share option scheme, which is open to all eligible employees, including executive directors.
Options were granted to employees under the Sharesave scheme in the UK, The Netherlands and Australia on 4 July 2006.
US Stock Purchase Plan The Company also operates a US Stock Purchase Plan, which is open to all US based eligible employees, including executive directors.
Options were granted to employees under the Stock Purchase Plan in the US during the year.
It is anticipated that further grants under the Sharesave scheme and US Stock Purchase Plan will be made on an annual basis.

The following table shows the graph of the Companys TSR performance using hypothetical 100 shareholdings in both the Company and the FTSE Mid 250 Index.

However, the Committee is of the opinion that it is in the best interests of the Company that it retain flexibility to offer an initial notice period in excess of one year, provided that at the conclusion of the first such period, the notice period reduces to one year.
Service contracts expire at the normal retirement age of the director concerned, but are subject to earlier termination for cause or if notice is given under the contract.
The policy does not provide for express compensation payments upon termination.
No contract contains a liquidated damages clause and, in all cases, the parties are legally required to mitigate their losses.
The Committee has previously reviewed service contracts and concluded that they are fully compliant with current best practice.
In order to mitigate the Groups losses, the Committee will consider the imposition of phased payments in any common law settlement.

The Company may summarily terminate the service contract of an executive director and pay him an amount equivalent to his salary, less any deductions required by law, for the period between the termination date and the date on which his notice period would otherwise have expired, together with payment in lieu of any accrued holiday.
Bonus entitlement and long-term incentive awards are non-contractual and are dealt with in accordance with the rules of the relevant schemes.
External appointments of executive directors Executive directors are not permitted to accept significant external directorships or appointments without the Boards prior consent and no executive director has any such external appointment at the date of this Report.
Non-executive directors Policy on non-executive directors remuneration The Board sets remuneration at a level to attract and retain experienced non-executive directors.
Their remuneration will be proportional to the time they spend in the Company and the contribution they make, as well as being consistent with the remuneration of non-executive directors in comparable companies.
Non-executive directors may not participate in any of the Companys incentive schemes and are not eligible to join the pension schemes.
Remuneration is reviewed regularly by the full Board.
The most recent review resulted in fee increases which took effect from 1 April 2007 for the Chairman and other non-executive directors.
No non-executive director is in receipt of any incentive award.
Non-executive directors have contracts of appointment which recognise that, subject to the Companys Articles of Association, their service is at the discretion of shareholders.
They submit themselves for election at the AGM following their appointment by the Board and subsequently at intervals of no more than three years.
