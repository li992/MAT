Chairman, Remuneration Committee 30 November 2007 The funds of the Marstons Scheme are administered by Trustees and are separate from the Group.
An actuarial valuation of the Marstons Scheme was carried out as at 30 September 2005.
This resulted in a long-term Group contribution rate of 17.5% of members pensionable earnings plus an annual contribution of 7.2 million.
The first of these annual contributions was received into the Marstons Scheme on 29 September 2006, and a further 6 million was paid in September 2007.
The additional 1.2 million was paid shortly after the year end.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the funding position of the Marstons Scheme are those relating to the differences between the long-term rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in earnings and pension increases.
The 30 September 2005 funding valuation for the Marstons Scheme assumed that: the long-term investment return before retirement would exceed salary increases by 2.3% per annum and price inflation by 3.0% per annum, and the long-term investment return after retirement would exceed pension increases by 2.0% per annum and price inflation by 2.0% per annum.
The market value of the Marstons Scheme assets was 199.8 million, which was sufficient to cover 77% of members accrued benefits at 30 September 2005, after allowing for future increases in earnings at the long-term rate.
During the year the Eldridge Pope Pension Scheme merged into the Marstons Scheme.
The amounts quoted above do not include the assets and liabilities of this scheme, or the Burtonwood and Jennings Schemes which merged in the 2005 06 financial year, but they are recognised in the valuation adopted in the accounts under IFRS as at 29 September 2007.
They will be recognised in the next full actuarial valuation of the Marstons Scheme which has an effective date of 30 September 2008.
Eldridge Pope During the year the Group acquired Eldridge Pope, which also operated a final salary pension scheme.
The Group has paid contributions in accordance with the Schedules of Contributions, which include lump sum payments in respect of the merger payable before and after the year end.
