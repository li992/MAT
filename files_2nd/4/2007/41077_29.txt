Section 5 Shareholder Annual Report and 78 Workspace Group PLC reporting Accounts 2007 b Co-investment plan audited This plan, approved in March 2004, is directed at increasing the directors direct share ownership in the Company, incentivising them on a medium-term basis in relation to total shareholder return TSR and aligning shareholder and director interests.
Under the plan up to 100% of the net annual bonus awarded to directors may be invested in the Companys shares.
The Company then buys, in the market, shares which, after settlement of the tax liability, would yield a one for one matching award when compared with the invested holding.
These shares are held over a subsequent three-year qualification period.
To qualify for full distribution of matching shares the TSR of Workspace Group over the reference period must exceed that of the company at the bottom of the top quartile of the FTSE Real Estate Index of which the Company is a constituent member.
To qualify for any matching shares, the TSR performance must be above that of the company at the bottom of the fourth decile.
In between these two measures there is a scaled award.
The Company believes that linking awards to above average TSR aligns the interests of shareholders and employees.
The Company believes also that such longer term incentives encourage the retention of senior staff.
In June 2006 under the plan executives invested 75% of their annual bonus.
Shares acquired under the plan, which are subject to matching shares should the performance conditions be met, are shown in the following table: Shares acquired under co-investment plan 2006 2005 2004 H Platt 32,606 33,013 32,200 M Carragher 21,846 23,019 22,540 J P Marples 22,332 23,019 22,540 R M Taylor 22,089 23,019 22,540 Share price at time of grant 3.45 2.445 1.810 c Executive share options audited The Group believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior managers aligns their interests with those of ordinary shareholders.
The executive share option scheme encourages this whilst providing a longer term incentive to participants.
Prior to 2005 the Board awarded options subject to criteria linked to the growth of earnings per share.
Given the changing balance in the Groups business model as noted earlier which focuses on both increased earnings and the added capital value of the Groups assets to generate sustained growth in shareholder value, the Committee decided that options awarded in 2005 and in future years should be tested on the basis of a relative assessment of the Groups NAV growth against other companies in the real estate sector with a market capitalisation greater than 300m.
Full vesting of options will arise for top quartile performance, whilst no options will vest for below median performance.
Within the second quartile options will vest on a pro rata basis.
Options lapse on termination of employment unless termination arises due to exceptional circumstances, such as redundancy or death.
All grants of executive share options awarded since 2004 have been on the basis of a single performance test and where this test is not fulfilled or is only partly achieved, no retesting in future periods is allowed.
Further, for all grants of options from this time, in the event of a change in ownership of the Company, options only vest to the extent that exercise conditions have been fulfilled.

The above options were granted pursuant to the Companys 2000 Share Option Scheme which was approved at the July 2000 EGM and amended at the EGM held in July 2003.
The options granted to directors this year equated to shares of a value equivalent at the time of the grant to one times the base salary of the directors.
Options over a further 77,102 shares were granted during the year under the Groups SAYE scheme, which all employees are entitled to join following any probationary period relating to their employment.
Following the grant of these options the Group had at 31 March 2007 options over 4,926,053 shares outstanding, of which 2,738,250 were designated to be satisfied by shares held by the Groups ESOT and 2,187,803 through the issue of new shares.
The shares held by the ESOT represent 1.57% of the issued share capital at 31 March 2007 with options to be satisfied by the grant of new shares representing 1.26% of the issued capital.
17,390 of the options granted during the year other than the SAYE options were granted pursuant to an annex to the 2000 Share Option Scheme which is approved for income tax purposes with the balance of 462,160 being unapproved.
All have a ten year life expiring on 19 June 2016.
Options obtained under the Rules of the Groups SAYE scheme.
All other options have been granted under the rules of the Companys executive share option schemes.
Section 5 Shareholder Annual Report and 82 Workspace Group PLC reporting Accounts 2007 There have been no changes in directors interests over options in the period between the balance sheet date and 11 June 2007.
The middle market price of Workspace Group PLC ordinary shares at 31 March 2007 was 5.0325 and the range during the year was 2.9125 to 5.1725.

1 times salary NAV growth over 3 years in top quartile of listed real estate companies with market cap exceeding 300m All options awarded in 2004 and earlier have been subject to a single test which is related to published EPS growth.
With the introduction of IFRS in 2006, valuation surpluses are now included in the calculation of EPS.
As a consequence, the Remuneration Committee concluded that the most appropriate and challenging basis of measuring additional shareholder value creation is to test cumulative earnings growth through the period and it is on this basis that options awarded in 2003 and 2004 are tested.
This also had the benefit of moving towards the criteria relative NAV growth established for options awarded in 2005 and future years.
The prescribed targets have been met in respect of all options granted in 2004 and earlier years.
Total package and fixed variable balance Assuming that the performance criteria for the exercise of options and receipt of Co-Investment Plan matching shares granted during the year are satisfied and that the share price at maturity of these schemes is 60% above the option price and co-investment matching shares option price 3.45, share price 3.45, share price 31 March 2007 5.0325, then the composition of the total package and the fixed variable balance is shown in the table below: Variable components Fixed Co-investment remuneration Bonus Options plan %%%% H Platt 44.3 12.8 21.4 21.5 M Carragher 44.3 13.0 21.1 21.6 J P Marples 45.0 12.4 20.7 21.9 R M Taylor 44.1 13.2 20.9 21.8 5.
ESOT In implementing its remuneration strategy, the Board established in 1999 an Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT.
The trust is used to purchase shares in the Company to meet its obligations under share options.
Use of the ESOT reduces the dilutive effect of the grant of options over new shares.
The ESOT purchased 2,000,000 shares at an average price of 50.7 pence per share in March 1999 and a further 5,067,700 shares at a price of 1.03 in September 2002.
Of these shares 4,329,340 have been transferred on exercise of options and a further 2,738,250 have been allocated to meet future exercises.
The market value of the ESOT holding at 31 March 2007 was 13,780,797 compared with a book cost of 2,819,014 and value due on exercise of options of 3,155,889.
The ESOT also holds 301,033 shares as bare trustee on behalf of the four executive directors following purchases by them under the terms of the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan, together with a further 504,565 shares held to meet matching awards under this scheme.
Performance graph The following graph compares the total shareholder return performance TSR of the Group with benchmark indices.
Given the differing benchmarks used for such performance measurement, your Board has decided to undertake this comparison against all of the FTSE All Share, FTSE Real Estate and FTSE 250 indices, of all of which the Company is a constituent member.

Section 5 Shareholder Annual Report and 84 Workspace Group PLC reporting Accounts 2007 Directors appointments The Groups policy is to engage all executive directors on rolling service contracts requiring 12-month notice of termination on either side.
Non-executive directors are ordinarily appointed on three-year contracts.
The details of the service contracts of those who served as directors during the year are: Contract Date of last reappointment date at Annual General Meeting Unexpired term Notice period A J Hales 19.11.2005 2006 20 months 12 months H Platt 01.12.1993 2005 n a 12 months M Carragher 01.01.1996 2004 n a 12 months B Cragg 01.06.2006 2006 24 months 6 months J P Marples 27.09.1996 2004 n a 12 months C J Pieroni 10.06.2003 2005 Retired: July 2006 R M Taylor 22.09.1995 2004 n a 12 months J Bywater 09.06.2004 2004 3 months 6 months R Dickinson 02.08.2006 n a 28 months 6 months Service contracts do not provide for compensation on termination of contract other than in the form of written notice provisions.
There are no express mitigation provisions in the directors service contracts, however ordinary principles of contract law are implicit in these contracts obliging contract parties to mitigate losses.
Non-executive directors remuneration policy Fees for non-executive directors are reviewed annually and determined by the Board in the light of market practice and surveys eg by Monks and IRS, and with reference to the time commitment and responsibilities associated with the roles.
Generally, the time commitment of the Chairman is expected to be 50 days a year and for other non-executives some 12-15 days a year.
Non-executive directors do not participate in decisions about their own remuneration.
Following review, and with effect from 1 April 2007, basic non-executive directors fees have been increased to 33,000 per annum from 28,000 previously with additional fees for Committee Chairs maintained at 5,000 per annum.
Non-executive directors receive no other pay or benefits other than the reimbursement of expenses incurred in respect of their duties as directors of the company.
Executive directors remuneration and wider group remuneration policy The Groups wider people policies are reported separately page 16.
The ratio of the average base pay of executive directors to the average of all other full-time staff directly employed by the Group is 6.52 2006: 6.22.
The one scheme which only executive directors and no other staff currently benefit from is the long term incentive scheme established three years ago.
Following probationary periods, all staff in the Company are eligible to participate in the Companys bonus scheme, SAYE, pension scheme, life assurance arrangements, and medical insurance benefits: and some senior staff have share option awards.
The Remuneration Committee discusses the remuneration of senior staff outside the Executive Board, and following recommendations from the Executive Board, made share option awards to certain senior managers.
