It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation B after deducting the directors contribution during the year D. 4.

Directors share options There are two schemes under which both HMRC approved and unapproved options may be granted: The Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme the 1994 Scheme requires options granted to be held for five years before they become exercisable, at which point they are not subject to any performance criteria: and The Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2000 Scheme, under which options granted become exercisable by participants after an initial three year performance period, to the extent that performance criteria have been satisfied.
Performance criteria are based on robust levels of business performance over the period.
Although share options may continue to be granted on a selective basis, it has been agreed that share option awards will not form part of the normal ongoing remuneration package for executives.
The number of share options held by the directors under the 1994 Scheme and the 2000 Scheme were as follows: Earliest Options Exercised Options normal as at Lapsed during as at Exercise exercise Expiry Exercise Price on 16.09.06 in year year 15.09.07 price date date date exercise George Weston 15,000 15,000 561.5p 28.04.2003 27.04.2008 22,500 22,500 484.0p 17.01.2004 16.01.2011 John Bason 50,000 50,000 484.0p 17.01.2004 16.01.2011 50,000 50,000 497.0p 07.12.2006 06.12.2011 50,000 50,000 564.0p 09.12.2007 08.12.2012 Granted under the 1994 Scheme Granted under the 2000 Scheme At 15 September 2007 the market value of the Companys ordinary shares was 793p.
During the previous 12 months the price ranged from 780p to 956p.
Performance review The performance graph illustrates the performance of the Company over the past five years in terms of total shareholder return compared with that of the companies comprising the FTSE 100 index.
This index has been selected because it represents a cross-section of leading UK companies.
Directors service contracts It is the Companys policy that all executive directors have rolling contracts with 12 month notice periods.
The Companys Articles of Association require that all directors retire from office at every third annual general meeting.
Details of the contracts of service of directors who served during the year ended 15 September 2007 are set out below: Effective Notice Notice date of period period Date of relevant from from appointment contract Company director Martin Adamson 11.10.99 11.12.02 6 months 6 months George Weston 19.04.99 01.06.05 12 months 12 months John Bason 04.05.99 16.03.99 12 months 12 months Mike Alexander 16.01.02 16.01.02 6 months 6 months Lord MacGregor 09.12.94 16.11.99 6 months 6 months Tim Clarke 03.11.04 03.11.04 6 months 6 months Jeff Harris 21.05.03 21.05.03 6 months 6 months Lord Jay 01.11.06 01.11.06 6 months 6 months Javier Ferrn 01.11.06 01.11.06 6 months 6 months Peter Smith 28.02.07 28.02.07 6 months 6 months Jeff Harris resigned as a non-executive director on 18 April 2007.
The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter of appointment with Galen Weston in view of his relationship with the ultimate holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington Investments Limited.
He receives no fees for performing his role as a non-executive director and Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse him for any expenses incurred by him in that role.
The committee takes the view that the entitlement of the executive directors to the security of 12 months notice of termination of employment is in line with the practice of many comparable companies.
The Remuneration committees aim is always to deal fairly with cases of termination whilst taking a robust line in minimising any compensation.
The Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained in the Combined Code regarding inclusion of explicit provisions in directors service contracts for compensation commitments in the event of early termination.
The committee will continue to keep under review its current practice, which is not to include such provisions in order to enable it to respond appropriately to particular circumstances.
Directors beneficial interests The directors of the Company as at 15 September 2007 had the following beneficial interests in the shares and debentures of the Company, its holding company and fellow subsidiary undertakings.

Non-executive directors The board reviews non-executive directors fees periodically in the light of fees payable in comparable companies and the importance attached to the retention and attraction of high calibre individuals as non-executive directors.
Fees are paid on a per annum basis and are not varied for the number of days worked.
The chairman of the Audit committee and the senior independent director are paid an additional fee.
Nonexecutive directors do not participate in the Companys annual or long-term incentive plans and take no part in any discussion or decision concerning their own fees.
It has been agreed that adjustments will be made to the fees in December 2007 following a period of two years in which the fees have remained unchanged.
Executive directors serving as nonexecutive directors The Remuneration committee has determined that executive directors serving as nonexecutive directors of other companies may retain any fees earned.
During the year, George Weston served as a non-executive director of Wittington Investments Limited, for which he received no compensation.
