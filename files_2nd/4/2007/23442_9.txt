The total remuneration of the Directors is determined by the provisions in the Articles of Association and by shareholders resolutions.
Policy on Directors Remuneration The policy of the Remuneration Committee is that remuneration of non-executive Directors should be fair and sufficient to attract Directors to properly oversee the affairs of the Company and should reflect the specific circumstances of the Company, the duties and responsibilities of the Directors and the value and amount of time committed to the Companys affairs.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ended 30 September 2008 and subsequent years.
Nonexecutive Directors are not eligible to receive bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other benefits.
