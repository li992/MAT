Governance Remuneration Report This report, approved by the Board, has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 the Act, as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Apart from the information relating to individual remuneration, share options, share interests and pensions information on pages 53 and 55 to 59, this report is not subject to audit.
The purposes of this report are to inform shareholders of the Companys policies on directors remuneration applicable to the two financial periods up to 28 April 2007 and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years as well as to provide details of the remuneration of individual directors as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the report at the annual general meeting on 5 September 2007.
Remuneration Committee The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility for determining policy in relation to and approval of the remuneration packages and terms and conditions of employment of each of the executive directors of the Company and for other senior executives of the Group, and policy in relation to the operation of the Groups share-based employee incentive schemes.
In setting its policies, the Committee has regard to the compensation and benefits arrangements which apply below senior management level.
The Committees terms of reference are shown on the corporate responsibility section of the corporate website.
The current membership of the Committee is set out below and all Committee members served throughout the current and prior periods.
The Committee met five times during the period.
Members Meetings attended during period John Whybrow Chairman 5 Rita Clifton 5 Andrew Lynch 4 The Chairman, Group Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director attend meetings of the Committee by invitation in an advisory capacity.
Meetings are attended by the Company Secretary who acts as secretary to the Committee and occasionally by the Director of Employee Reward and representatives of remuneration consultants.
Nobody attends any part of a meeting at which their own remuneration is discussed.
The remuneration policy which was in place for the current and the previous two financial periods was approved by shareholders at the annual general meetings held in 2004, 2005 and 2006.
No significant changes to the principal elements of the policy have been made for the financial period commencing on 29 April 2007.
A change to the targets for the annual cash bonus has been made for the 2007 08 financial year and details are described in section b i below.
KPMG LLP who assisted the Remuneration Committee in devising the current policy, provided occasional advice to the Committee during the year for which they received fees of 32,500.
During the year the Committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP in their place for which they received fees of 21,200.
Total fees received by KPMG LLP from the Group were 703,000 and included internal audit, tax advice, corporate finance work and other accounting advice provided throughout the year.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP provided no other services to the Company.
Remuneration policy Executive directors The objectives of the remuneration policy are to: ensure that remuneration fairly recognises and rewards the contribution of individual directors and senior executives to the attainment of the Groups short and longer term results and, where appropriate, the performance of individual trading divisions and business units: maintain, particularly through reward schemes based on performance, a competitive package of pay and benefits which provides the motivation for future achievement: facilitate, in an increasingly competitive international environment, the building and retention of a high calibre and focused team which will work effectively to achieve the Groups longer term strategic objectives: align the directors interests with those of shareholders by offering participation in schemes which provide opportunities to build shareholdings in the Company: and facilitate effective succession planning.
DSG international plc 51 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Governance Remuneration Report continued In implementing this policy, the Remuneration Committee takes account of information and surveys from internal and independent sources and the remuneration paid for comparable positions in other companies, especially those operating internationally.
It reviews data and surveys provided by remuneration consultants and market research companies with particular reference to the scale and composition of the total remuneration packages payable to people with like responsibilities, qualifications, skills and experience in businesses of similar size and structure.
The main components of the remuneration of the executive directors are as follows: a Basic salaries These reflect the Remuneration Committees assessment of the mid-market rate for relevant positions and levels of responsibility and the individual directors experience, performance and value to the business.
The basic salaries of the two executive directors were reviewed at the start of both the 2006 07 and the 2007 08 financial periods, to coincide with the Group-wide pay reviews and are currently 700,000 and 480,000 for John Clare and Kevin OByrne, respectively.
b Performance related remuneration The performance based elements of remuneration are designed to drive performance and to strengthen the alignment between the interests of the Companys shareholders and its senior management, whilst encouraging management retention.
Remuneration packages are constructed to deliver a ratio between fixed salary and performance related pay of 2:3 for on target performance.
The components of performance related remuneration are as follows: i Annual cash bonus For the years 2006 07 and 2005 06 performance based remuneration for the executive directors comprised an annual cash bonus plan based on the achievement of the Groups targets.
In the case of other participating executives below Board level, divisional and business unit targets were applied.
For 2006 07 and 2005 06, the bonus performance measures were underlying diluted earnings per share EPS growth and Free Cash Flow.
EPS and Free Cash Flow are defined in the consolidated financial statements in note 8 and the consolidated cash flow statement, respectively.
The maximum bonus payable to the Group Chief Executive was 100 per cent of basic salary.
The maximum which may be earned by the Group Finance Director was increased from 85 per cent in 2005 06 to 100 per cent in 2006 07 by the addition of an element based on the attainment of the controllable earnings targets of the Computing Division for which he assumed responsibility during the year in addition to his duties as Group Finance Director.
In the case of both of the executive directors the bonus performance measures were based on the same year on year EPS growth rates as for 2005 06 and the achievement of Free Cash Flow targets whereby EPS growth represented 80 per cent of the maximum for achieving target and Free Cash Flow comprised 20 per cent of the maximum for achieving target.
The potential maximum bonus for members of the Group Executive Committee was 85 per cent of basic salary and for other participating senior executives was 80 per cent of basic salary.
In the case of both the executive directors and other participating senior executives, 50 per cent of the maximum bonus would have been earned for achievement of targets with additional bonuses payable for substantially exceeding targets calculated on a sliding scale.
For 2007 08 maximum potential bonus for executive directors remains unchanged at 100 per cent of basic salary but the bonus performance measures have been changed to a mixture of Group Controllable Earnings up to 80 per cent of the maximum bonus and Free Cash Flow targets up to 20 per cent of maximum where targets exceeded.
Targets are set using benchmarks that reflect both internal and external expectations, along with earnings estimates for other retailers in the forthcoming year.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the targets are challenging.
Before approving bonus payments, the Remuneration Committee will confirm that awards reflect genuine improvement in the Groups underlying financial performance.
Further information on employee costs, including those relating to senior management is given in notes 6 and 34, respectively to the financial statements.
ii Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP, performance is measured in terms of the Total Shareholder Return TSR achieved by the Company over a three year period relative to the companies comprising the FTSE 100 Index at the start of the performance period.
The Remuneration Committee chose the TSR performance condition as it aligned 52 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Governance managements interests with those of the shareholders.
TSR data is collated by external consultants to help the Company calculate the extent to which the performance condition has been met.
The number of shares awarded is calculated by reference to basic salary at the date of the provisional award.
The maximum award of shares requires performance in the upper quartile and is equivalent to 50 per cent of basic salary in the case of the executive directors, 45 per cent for the members of the Group Executive Committee and 40 per cent for other participating executives.
Prior to vesting, the Remuneration Committee will satisfy itself that the TSR performance achieved reasonably reflects the financial performance of the Group and reserves the right to vary awards accordingly.
No awards are payable for performance below the median TSR achieved by the comparator group.
At the median performance, awards will be 40 per cent of the maximum number of shares, representing 20 per cent of basic salary for the executive directors, 18 per cent for the members of the GEC and 16 per cent for other participating executives.
The number of shares released is calculated using a sliding scale for performance between the median and upper quartile.
iii Share options and performance share plans The Remuneration Committee approves the bases on which options are granted to executive directors and other employees under the Companys discretionary share option schemes and other performance share plans.
Options are normally granted annually to executive directors and other senior executives over shares having a market value on the date of grant equal to twice their basic salary.
Executive directors and senior executives are also entitled to participate in the Sharesave Scheme SAYE on the same conditions as other employees.
Over 6,000 employees currently participate in SAYE.
The following table summarises the terms applicable to the executive directors and senior executive options outstanding as at 28 April 2007.
Share option terms audited information Performance conditions Retesting Grants made before The market price on the date of exercise is at least During the life of the option.
20 per cent higher than the option price, assuming exercise takes place between three and four years after the date of grant.
For later exercises, the rate of share growth is adjusted in line with the Retail Prices Index RPI.
Exercise is also conditional upon underlying diluted earnings per share EPS having increased by not less than 3 per cent above the annual RPI over any consecutive period of three years during the life of the option.
Grant made on On the third anniversary of the date of grant EPS The EPS test will be used 28 July 2003. growth over the period since the date of grant must on the fourth and fifth exceed the annual RPI by at least 3 per cent per anniversaries.
Grant made on On the third anniversary of the date of grant EPS No re-testing.
4 August 2004. growth over the period since the date of grant must exceed the annual RPI by at least 3 per cent per annum compound.
Grants made after Over the three year performance period EPS growth No re-testing.
11 October 2004. is equal to or greater than annual RPI plus 5 per cent.
Where EPS growth is between annual RPI plus 3 per cent and annual RPI plus 5 per cent, options will vest on a straight line basis between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the award.
DSG international plc 53 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Governance Remuneration Report continued All options are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant if the Remuneration Committee determines that the performance conditions have been met.
Such determination is made following presentation of the calculation which is performed once EPS figures are known for the relevant financial year.
The Remuneration Committee chose the EPS performance condition because it represented challenging market conditions in the retail sector.
All share options lapse on the earlier of ten years from the date of grant or the date on which the Remuneration Committee determines that the performance conditions have not been met.
Prior to 2005 06, options were granted to other employees in the UK and overseas on the basis of management grade and to employees with more than three years service.
Employees below executive level now participate in a cash settled performance share plan linked in most cases to the attainment of three year EPS targets.
The eligibility criteria and overall fair value of awards under this plan are similar to those under the previous share option plan.
For 2007 08, it is proposed to grant options to an additional layer of senior management and the cash settled performance share plan will continue to apply below this level.
Of the 91,155,973 shares currently under option, 10,523,278 relate to the executive directors and members of senior management.
Options granted since April 1997 may be satisfied either by the issue of new shares or using shares bought in the market.
Options satisfied by the issue of new shares upon exercise represented 6.36 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company.
Further information on share-based payments is set out in note 26 to the financial statements.
c Taxable benefits Each of the executive directors is entitled to the use of a company car with related benefits or cash payments in lieu and is a member of the non-contributory DSGi medical expenses plan which provides benefits similar to those applicable in similar companies.
d Pensions and related benefit The executive directors accrued benefits under the senior executive defined benefit section of DSG Retirement & Employee Security Scheme DRESS.
This is a funded, HM Revenue & Customs registered contributory pension scheme which provides a pension at normal retirement age 60 of two-thirds of pensionable salary subject to a minimum period of 20 years membership.
Part of this pension may be exchanged for cash at the date of retirement.
Membership of the scheme also confers dependants pensions, insured lump sums on death in service and benefits in the event of prolonged disability.
In 2003 the Remuneration Committee decided that bonuses should no longer be pensionable and addressed this by removing bonuses from the definition of pensionable pay in respect of pensionable service accruing after the end of 2004 05.
As John Clare had already accrued the minimum period of 20 years membership required to secure the maximum pension of two-thirds of pensionable salary as at the date of this change, his pensionable pay includes cash bonuses, and pension contributions have been made on this basis.
Details of pension benefits earned by directors during the financial period are shown on page 57.
Following the implementation of the Finance Act 2004, John Clare whose accrued pension at 6 April 2006 was valued in excess of the Lifetime Allowance has elected to continue to accrue pensionable service on existing terms, but subject to the new tax regime.
He has the option to withdraw from DRESS, in which case he would receive a taxable salary supplement of 30 per cent of his base pay, representing the contributions that the Company would otherwise pay to DRESS.
Notwithstanding the abolition of the statutory earnings cap for pension purposes on 6 April 2006, an equivalent cap, adjusted annually for inflation, has been introduced for the purposes of DRESS.
Kevin OByrne will continue to receive a salary supplement equivalent to the contributions which would otherwise have been paid by the Company to DRESS on that part of his pensionable salary which exceeds the earnings cap.
A similar salary supplement arrangement for pension purposes applies to seven other senior executives.
New externally recruited executive directors will be offered membership of the money purchase section of DRESS and the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion regarding the level of award of any salary supplement or enhanced contributions.
54 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Governance e Service agreements Each of the executive directors has a service agreement with DSG Retail Limited which may be terminated at any time by 12 months notice.
Service agreements contain neither a liquidated damages nor a change of control clause.
It is the Companys policy to ensure that any payments made to a director in the event of the early termination of a service agreement reflect the circumstances giving rise to termination and, where considered appropriate, the obligation of the outgoing director to mitigate his loss.
Accordingly, consideration is given to making compensation payments in instalments and are conditional on the leavers employment and earnings status.
The service agreements of the executive directors who served during the financial period were entered into on the following dates: Date John Clare 3 Feb 1989 Kevin O'Byrne 16 Jul 2004 The service agreements of the continuing directors are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours on each business day.
f External directorships Executive directors are permitted to accept non-executive directorships in external companies and to retain the fees which they receive in such roles.
Normally only one such appointment will be authorised for each director.
During the period, John Clare was a non-executive director of Hammerson plc and was paid a fee at the rate of 44,000 per annum.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors are normally appointed for three year terms.
Their current terms expire as follows: Date Sir John Collins 11 Sep 2008 Count Emmanuel d'Andr 1 Sep 2008 Rita Clifton 1 Sep 2009 Andrew Lynch 20 May 2009 John Whybrow 24 Jun 2009 The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the Board upon the recommendations of the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director.
Sir John Collins fee is currently 300,000 per annum and following the annual review will increase to 320,000 in September 2007.
He is also provided with the use of a car and related benefits and is a member of the Groups medical expenses plan.
The other non-executive directors receive a fee currently 45,000 per annum or euro equivalent.
The fee is normally reviewed annually in September.
The last increase occurred in September 2006.
Andrew Lynch and John Whybrow receive additional fees payable at the rate of 7,500 per annum for services as chairmen of the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee, respectively.
Andrew Lynch has been designated Senior Independent Director for which he receives a further fee of 5,000 per annum.
Non-executive directors derive no other benefits from their office and are not eligible to participate in the Groups pension scheme.
It is Company policy not to grant share options to non-executive directors or to require part of their fees to be paid in the form of shares.
Letters of appointment of the non-executive directors are available on application to the Company Secretary.

2 Kevin OByrnes salary included 75,535 52 weeks ended 29 April 2006 61,981 representing contributions which would have been payable to DRESS had his pensionable salary not been subject to the earnings cap.
3 Amounts shown relate to his period in office as a director 1 May 2005 to 5 April 2006.
The following table shows performance related remuneration paid in the form of shares: 2006 07 2005 06 2006 07 2005 06 Gains from Gains from Gross value of Gross value of exercise of exercise of shares released shares released share options share options 000 000 000 000 Current directors John Clare 268 Kevin O'Byrne 39 Former director David Longbottom 100 407 The gross value of shares released in 2005 06 comprised share releases under the Deferred Equity Participation Plan DEPP which operated for years prior to and including 2003 04 and which provided a bonus based on the level of growth in EPS payable partly in cash and partly in shares.
The share element was matched by the Company on a basis determined by the Remuneration Committee with shares awarded being allocated to a share bank, a proportion of which was released to participants annually after a retention period and for which the last release was made in April 2006.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to encourage executive directors to build shareholdings in the Company over a three year period to a minimum value equivalent to their basic salary with the expectation that such shareholdings will be achieved principally through shares vesting under the share option and other performance share plans in which they participate.

No shares vest if TSR performance is below the median for the comparator group.
For performance in the upper quartile, 100 per cent would vest, for median performance 40 per cent would vest and for performance between the median and upper quartile the number of shares is calculated using a sliding scale.
Any shares which vest cannot be released within close periods.
2 Following the period end, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the TSR performance condition associated with the awards made to John Clare and Kevin OByrne in the 2004 05 financial period and determined that the target had not been met.
Accordingly, these awards have now lapsed.
3 The market price was 183.75 pence at the date the scheme interest was awarded.
