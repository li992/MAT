DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The directors remuneration report describes Candovers remuneration policy, the role of its remuneration committee and its activities for the year ended 31st December, 2007.
It has been prepared on behalf of the Board in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and the Combined Code.
It is more succinct than in previous years because the Company did not have any executive directors during 2007.
It will be put to shareholders for approval by ordinary resolution at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 14th May, 2008.
The audited section of the directors remuneration report is the table of non-executive directors remuneration.
Remuneration committee Composition and operation The remuneration committee supports the Board by determining the level of remuneration of the chairman of the Company, as well as reviewing the remuneration policy applicable to the senior management of Candover Partners Limited.
The Board of the Company is now comprised solely of non-executive directors.
At 31st December, 2007 the members of the remuneration committee were Richard Stone chairman, Gerry Grimstone, Antony Hichens, Jimmy West and Chris Russell.
Lord Jay joined the committee on 1st March, 2008.
The remuneration committee, which meets as often as necessary to discharge its duties, met on four occasions in 2007.
Attendances have been noted already in the directors report.
Written terms of reference are available on the Companys website at www.
No member of the remuneration committee has any personal financial interests or conflicts of interest other than as shareholders.
In this regard, the remuneration committee gives full consideration to the provisions of the Combined Code.
Professional advice During the year the remuneration committee received, at the Companys expense, professional advice from Grant Thornton UK LLP, the Companys auditors and tax advisors, Ashurst, the Companys lawyers, and New Bridge Street Consultants, independent remuneration advisors.
New Bridge Street Consultants were appointed by the committee to advise on directors fees and to provide advice in relation to the implementation and operation of the Companys employee share schemes.
Candover participates in the MM&K remuneration survey of the private equity industry, the results of which are reviewed by the remuneration committee, to ensure that the Companys remuneration policy remains in line with market trends and practice.
Activities during the year Following approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Company on 16th May, 2007, the remuneration committee launched a share matching plan SMP to executives and a company share option plan CSOP to support staff.
The purpose of the SMP is to encourage executives to own shares in the Company, promoting a better alignment of interests and a focus on Group performance.
94% of Candovers executives participated in the SMP purchasing 36,293 shares in the Company.
Demanding performance criteria requiring the Companys net asset per share growth to outperform the FTSE All-Share Index by a fixed margin over a fixed three year period attach to the receipt of any matching shares as follows: Out-performance of the FTSE All-Share Index over three financial years Level of match Less than 5% per annum 0 5% per annum 0.5:1 12.5% per annum 1:1 25% per annum 3:1 Between 5% and 12.5% and between 12.5% and 25%, straight line pro-rating shall apply.
29,675 options were granted to support staff who play an important role that adds to shareholder value, but who do not participate in incentive schemes linked to funds managed by Candover Partners Limited.
Further details can be found in note 2 to the accounts on page 49.
As permitted by the SMP and CSOP scheme rules, the remuneration committee intend to invite executives to participate in the SMP and to grant further options to support staff on an annual basis.
The Companys non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in either of these schemes, and no individual employee will be eligible for both schemes in any given year.
At the beginning of the year the remuneration committee considered the fee paid to the Chairman of the Company.
Based on market information, time commitment required and the level of responsibility undertaken, an increase in fee payable to the Chairman was approved by the Remuneration Committee, effective 1st January, 2007.
The remuneration committee reviewed salaries and performance related bonuses payable to Candover Group employees.
Salary levels were reviewed after considering relative salary levels within the industry, the estimated movement in net assets and the profits for the year.
Performance bonuses were reviewed after consideration of the profit and net asset performance, operational achievements of the Company, including progress on investments and realisations, and the external market.
36 Candover Report and accounts 2007 Remuneration policy The Groups remuneration policy is designed to ensure that the Company maintains competitive remuneration packages in order to recruit, retain and motivate executives of exceptional quality in the overall interests of shareholders.
As is customary in the private equity industry, the remuneration package for executives comprises both fixed and variable elements, including salary, performance related bonuses, pension contributions and other incentive arrangements.
For non-executive directors the Chairman of the Company recommends the level of fees to be paid based on market information, time commitment required and the level of responsibility undertaken.
These recommendations are then put to a meeting of the executive committee of the Company for approval.
Having sought advice from New Bridge Street Consultants on current market information, and given that base fees for non-executive directors had not increased since 2002, increases in annual fees payable to non-executive directors were approved by the executive committee of the Company as set out below.
Non-executive directors are not paid performance fees, granted share options or invited to participate in long-term incentive plans.
